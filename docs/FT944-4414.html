			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Countryside Properties rises 74% and plans expansion Countryside Properties, one of the largest housebuilders in the south of England, reported a 74 per cent rise in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 8.2m, against Pounds 4.74m, and further expansion of its housing activities. The company completed 1,506 new homes in the year to September 30, up from 1,295. Mr Alan Cherry, chairman, said he expected the company to build 2,400 homes this year. The government's decision to cut grants available to housing associations will reduce the amount of social housing work available. Last year, two-thirds of Countryside's homes were built under contract for housing associations and others. However, Mr Cherry said that the company would make up any shortfall from projects which attracted urban regeneration funding. Orders for contract housebuilding were more than Pounds 100m, against Pounds 85m. Countryside has opened offices in Surrey and Bristol during the year and plans to increase its speculative housebuilding programme from 550 to 800 homes this year. Turnover rose from Pounds 91.7m to Pounds 149.1m, including Pounds 4.37m from the commercial property investment portfolio, which was sold for Pounds 60m in June. Sales of residential property increased from Pounds 76.9m to Pounds 130.1m. About 40 per cent of house sales did not contribute to profit because they were built on land acquired in the late 1980s at prices higher than today's values. This year, the proportion will fall to about 12 per cent as old land is used up, leading to higher margins. Turnover from commercial property development rose from Pounds 9.1m to Pounds 14.6m. Last week, Countryside announced that the Post Office had agreed to pre-let a 190,000 sq ft processing centre at Chelmsford, Essex. The development has been sold forward to PosTel, the post and telecommunications pension fund. Earnings per share were 8.4p (5.9p) and the proposed final dividend is raised by 0.1p to 2.8p, making a total for the year of 4.21p (4.11p).</p>

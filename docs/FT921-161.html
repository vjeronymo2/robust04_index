			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Inchcape Inchcape is fashionable these days, so it is worth remembering how recently the market saw it as a rather uninspired overseas trading company. Its results for 1991 were a reminder of the group's transformation since the mid-1980s, not least because they included proceeds from the sale last June of its Assam tea business. The figures also contradicted the notion that Inchcape is too reliant on the motor industry and Toyota in particular. Cash flow after tax and dividends last year of Pounds 115m was strong enough to bring gearing down to about 20 per cent, well below the level predicted at last year's rights issue. Growth in the non-motor businesses was vigorous, with profits up by more than half in services and by nearly a tenth in marketing. As for Toyota, Inchcape was sensible enough to negotiate a long-term deal with the manufacturer, so it has plenty of time to reduce its dependence and has already made significant progress. Once the Tozer Kemsley &amp; Millbourn acquisition is fully absorbed, only 40 per cent of vehicle sales will be Toyota cars. The recent volatility of its shares suggests that some investors have been tempted to take profits. Inchcape is coming out of recession in far better shape than it went in, which suggests considerable long-term scope. The prospective multiple of 12.5 is far from daunting.</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILL ON HONG KONG REFUGEES  </P> <P> While he was at it, Will should have explained to the American people who  rejoiced with the victors of the Falkland's war, the primary reason why the  whole Armada was mobilized by the British to preserve the status quo on the  tiny Malvinas (Falklands to the British) Islands. The issue at hand was the  conservation of second-class citizenship for the inhabitants of the islands.  </P> <P> Had Argentina claimed the islands unopposed, British would have been  hard-pressed not to grant full citizenship to the 2,000 or so Brits living  there who may have opted to live in England rather than Argentina.  </P> <P> Full citizenship, in this case, meant that the Malvinas/Falklanders would have  the sovereign right to emigrate to England. No problem, right? Wrong! Full  citizenship to the South Americans would have to set a precedent for the  citizenry of Hong Kong in 1997.  </P> <P> To save the integrity of their peaches-and-cream complexions hundreds of young  men were killed and injured, to say nothing of the innocent whales who,  mistaken for submarines, were torpedoed.  </P> <P> It's amazing how cheap life becomes when in the service of warped ideals.  </P> <P> SAVINA J. TEUBAL  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

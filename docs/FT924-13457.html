			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report NICKEL continued to decline on the LME while other base metals were largely steadier on technical buying and some short covering. Three-month nickel hit a fresh 34-month low of Dollars 6,280 a tonne in morning trading before recovering to Dollars 6,372.50 at the close, down another Dollars 75 on the day. The steadier trends in the rest of the metals were largely due to technical factors. 'Nothing goes down in a straight line forever ..and there are also pockets of consumer buying around,' one dealer said. London COCOA closed near the day's lows on mainly technical dealing with little sign of any aggressive origin selling. The next downside objective for March is a test of support at Pounds 650 a tonne, dealers said. Robusta COFFEE futures ran into an expected bout of profit taking after January earlier rose to a six-month high of Dollars 868 a tonne, but the overall mood remained constructive. But dealers said there might be scope for a more extensive correction as the market has risen around Dollars 90 since the end of last month. Compiled from Reuters</p>

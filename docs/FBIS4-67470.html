			<p>BFN     [Text] Debt-for-nature swap schemes may become the in  thing for member-countries of the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) as APEC environment ministers okayed a  proposal which open APEC countries to innovative approaches in  mobilizing financial resources for the environment.    An official from the Department of Environment and Natural  Resources (DENR) said the proposal is aimed at awakening the  interest of APEC member-countries to debt-for-nature swap  arrangement.    At present, only Mexico and the Philippines are taking part  in the program among APEC member-countries.    Robert Jara, project coordinator of DENR foreign assisted  special project director, told BUSINESS WORLD the  debt-for-nature swap scheme remains one of the more creative  financing mechanism a Third World country can avail of in  preserving its environment.    He disclosed that during the recently concluded meeting of  APEC's environment ministers in Vancouver, Canada, the proposal  was adopted as one of the "framework of principles" approved by  the APEC body.    The principle specifically states that APEC member-economies  should cooperate in exploring "innovative approaches to  fund-raising scheme and mechanisms" in protecting the  environment.    The debt-for-nature swap program, however recently came  under  attack from various sectors claiming the arrangement had become  virtually impractical because of the rising cost of the  Philippine debt papers.    The debt-for-nature swap arrangement is based on the  principle that part of the foreign debt of severely indebted  country is "canceled" by rechanneling it to a national currency  fund directed to finance environment programs.    Specifically, the program involves the purchase and  subsequent cancellation of part of a country's foreign debt in  exchange for the funding of local conservation efforts and a  government commitment to protect the environment.    Mr. Jara claimed the arrangement even has finance Secretary  Roberto F. de Ocampo's endorsement.    In a brief presented during the meeting of APEC's finance  ministers last March, Mr. de Ocampo proposed debt-for-nature  swap deals as one of the concerns which countries should adopt.    Based on the copy of the brief obtained by BUSINESS WORLD,  Mr. de Ocampo praised debt-for-nature swap arrangement as a  "win-win" scheme which can allow the Philippines to address both  its debt and environment protection problems, specifically in  relation to fund lack.    Mr. Jara admitted, however, that the program will not solve  the country's debt problem as the amount of money involved is  just too small to make a dent in the country's total foreign  debt. On the other hand, he said it can help a long way in the  country's conservation efforts.    The country's debt-for-nature swap program is currently  supporting biodiversity projects in the El Nido Marine  Reservation and St. Paul River Subterranean National Park, both  in Palawan, and in Mt. Pulog in Northern Luzon.    The Foundation for Philippine Environment is overseeing the  program in coordination with the Philippine Business for Social  Progress.    Earlier, Environment Secretary Angel C. Alcala, who  represented the country during the APEC environment ministerial  meeting, explained the discussions mainly focused on integrating  environment issues with the economy or industrialization.    It is an initial discussion on potential cooperation among  APEC member economies in the area of environment and sustainable  growth, he added.    The meeting was held last 23-25 March and was attended by  150  delegates, representing APEC's 18 member-countries.    APEC was formed in 1989 in response to increasing calls for  closer economic cooperation among countries in the Asia-Pacific  through increased intra-regional trade and investment flows.</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> POST SPORTSWRITER DEFENDS HER PEER IN HARASSMENT INCIDENT  </P> <P> Washington Post sportswriter Christine Brennan defended Boston Herald colleague  Lisa Olson today, saying Olson's sexual harassment by several New England  Patriots football players is "the worst I've ever heard in my 10 years of  sports writing."  </P> <P> "I've been in 500 locker rooms.  </P> <P> I have rolled my eyes. I have laughed. I've had towels thrown at me. I've had  whoops and hollers," said Brennan, who was the Post's beat reporter covering  the Washington Redskins in the mid-1980s.  </P> <P> "I've been taking it for 10 years, Lisa's been taking it for that long,"  Brennan said during an interview on Cable News Network. "We've had hundreds of  women taking it, taking and taking it and we continue to do so because we love  these jobs."  </P> <P> Olson said Thursday that during the Sept. 17 incident in the Patriots' locker  room, she was sitting down when Zeke Mowatt came up, exposed himself and made  lewd remarks.  </P> <P> NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue had summoned Mowatt to a meeting today in New  York, but the meeting was postponed Thursday when Tagliabue said he would  appoint a special counsel to investigate the incident.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) For any equipment for which the U.S./Canadian content is less than 70 percent, the country of origin for the equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency proposed (&sect;583.11) to require allied suppliers to provide the following information for any equipment they supply to a vehicle manufacturer: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The price of the equipment to the manufacturer; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The percentage U.S./Canadian content of the equipment; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The country of origin of the equipment, i.e., the country in which the greatest percentage, by value (using purchase price), of value was added to the equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposal, both outside and allied suppliers that directly supply vehicle manufacturers would be required to provide the specified information directly to the vehicle manufacturer, accompanied by a certification of the information's accuracy. Outside suppliers that directly supply allied suppliers would be required to provide the specified information and certification directly to the allied supplier. Suppliers would also be required to maintain records of the information used to determine the information provided to the manufacturers or allied suppliers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency noted in the NPRM that since the information required for items one and two of the label must be calculated before the beginning of the model year, it is important that manufacturers and outside suppliers receive the required information in a timely manner. NHTSA proposed to require suppliers to provide the information by specified dates, based on typical model year production periods. The agency also proposed to require suppliers to base the information they provide on what they expect to supply during specified production periods. However, recognizing that manufacturers may establish different model year production periods for particular carlines, the agency proposed to permit manufacturers and suppliers to conclude agreements specifying alternative production periods and alternative times for providing the information to the manufacturer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, the information for items four and five of the label, i.e., countries of origin for the engine and transmission, is calculated for individual vehicles rather than on a carline basis. Under the agency's proposal (&sect;583.12), suppliers of engines and transmissions would be required to provide the vehicle manufacturer with the country of origin for each engine or transmission it supplies to the manufacturer, i.e., the country in which the greatest percentage, by value (using the total cost of equipment to the engine or transmission supplier), was added to the engine or transmission. The agency proposed to require this information to be provided no later than the time the engine or transmission is delivered to the manufacturer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA received numerous comments concerning the proposed requirements for suppliers. AAMA noted that the proposed regulation would require outside suppliers to provide a manufacturer or allied supplier content information for each unique type of equipment. It stated that the requirement should be limited to providing content data on those items of equipment requested by a manufacturer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AAMA also noted that the proposed regulation would require suppliers' best estimates of price, content and origin for unique type of equipment expected to be supplied during a 12-month period. That organization stated that it believes it is highly unlikely that suppliers would be willing or able to release estimates ``for future model year costs,'' as this information is confidential business information and suppliers may not be able anticipate changes that may be required to contract price during the year due to unforeseen design changes. AAMA suggested that to ease this potential point of friction between suppliers and manufacturers, it recommends that suppliers' best estimates of price, content and origin be based on the price which exists in the financial records of the manufacturer at the time when the content is calculated. That organization stated that if this information does not yet exist because the part is new, suppliers should be required to provide their best estimates of what the price, content or country of origin will be at start of production. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AAMA also stated that the proposed requirements would not provide manufacturers the data necessary to determine engine and transmission country of origin because they do not specify separate (as well as combined) U.S. and Canadian content for transmission and engine items of equipment. Information on a combined basis is needed for items one and two of the label; information on a separate basis is needed for items four and five of the label. Ford stated that since it is not always known if an item of equipment is going to be installed on an engine or transmission, and to reduce complexity, the separate and combined U.S. and Canadian content data should be obtained for all items of equipment. That manufacturer stated that this would also permit the basic information collected from suppliers to support Labeling Act requirements to be used for other reporting and analysis purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of manufacturers argued that because carlines are not introduced on a rigid schedule, it would be difficult or impossible for suppliers to adhere to the proposed timing schedule. AAMA stated that suppliers and manufacturers should be allowed flexibility to establish their own internal guidelines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nissan stated that since vehicle model changeovers may occur at varying times throughout the year, it urges NHTSA to specify that supplier content reporting requirement dates be negotiated by contract among suppliers and manufacturers rather than a date prescribed by regulations. BMW stated that it believes exact dates for suppliers should be left to agreements between the manufacturers and suppliers and, therefore, not included in the regulation. That company noted that the manufacturer has ultimate responsibility to provide a label on the vehicle. BMW stated that the manufacturer will require from its suppliers that information is received in a timely manner because without the information the vehicle cannot be sold. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other vehicle manufacturers, including Toyota and Honda, also emphasized the need for manufacturer flexibility but stated that the agency's proposal to permit manufacturers and suppliers to conclude agreements specifying alternative production periods and alternative times for providing the information to the manufacturer would provide the needed flexibility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> APMA stated that if NHTSA adopts the AIAG format, requisite reporting would be jointly submitted by the outside supplier to the allied supplier or manufacturer. That organization stated that if the AIAG format is not adopted, it recommends (1) that a common reporting date be used for reporting to both allied suppliers and manufacturers, and (2) that an outside supplier's obligation to report be conditioned on the receipt of at least 90 days advance written notice from an allied supplier or manufacturer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the issue of supplier certifications, AAMA stated that since allied suppliers are wholly owned by the manufacturer, the manufacturer has control over the information as well as the timing required from suppliers. It stated that the information required of allied suppliers should be the same as for outside suppliers, but the certificate should be optional. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

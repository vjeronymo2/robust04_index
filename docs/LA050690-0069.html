			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PIGMENT ENVY  </P> <P> Obviously, the Welsing theory does not take into account the careful historical  research of scholars like Frank Snowden and the fact that relations were not  inherently strained between Ethiopians, Greeks and Romans over 2,000 years ago.  Nor does this theory help in explaining Japanese corporate racism toward  African-Americans.  </P> <P> But there is a more interesting angle. With the onset of the Cold War there has  been a systematic effort to silence voices of the left in the black community,  like Paul Robeson, W.E.B. DuBois and their progeny, who offered explanations of  racism that focused on the slave trade and profit.  </P> <P> Is it surprising that when one seeks systematically to discredit and to still  such voices that inexorably stubborn and narrow nationalisms arise? The left  seeks to unite across racial lines and as Eastern Europe is now demonstrating,  when it declines, narrow nationalism flourishes. You can't have it both ways,  i.e., you can't squash the left, then wring one's hand about Public Enemy.  </P> <P> GERALD HORNE Ph.D  </P> <P> Chairman, Black Studies  </P> <P> UC Santa Barbara  </P></p>

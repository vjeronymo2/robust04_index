In statements to LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA, Delgado admitted  that  a group of former officers of the defunct Panama Defense Forces  (FDP) met with retired General Ruben Dario Paredes to analyze  "the country's problems, among them the public security  problem." Delgado insisted that "none of the meetings (with Gen.  Paredes) has been in favor of Carles or against Ernesto Perez  Balladares."    However, several sources have informed LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA  that Paredes tried to promote an association of former military  men who would support Carles, the presidential candidate for the  Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement (Molirena), the Civic  Renewal Party (PRC), and the National Renewal Movement (Morena).    Approximately 25 former officers attended the meetings with  Gen. Paredes, among them Daniel Delgado Diamante, Carlos  Arosemena King, Virgilio Mirones, Major Severino Mejia, and Maj.  Juan Antonio Guizado.    Yesterday on Radio Ancon, Gen. Paredes denied reports  published in the 17 February edition of LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA.  However, he did admit that he met with Carles for 45 minutes.  According to Paredes, it was "a regrettable lie published by LA  ESTRELLA DE PANAMA."    Delgado said the former officers are worried about the  increase in crimes, kidnappings, drug trafficking, vandalism,  and the failure of the current Public Force, but warned that  they, the officers, are conceptually "Torrijists." "We continue  to be Torrijists because we believe the ideas promoted by  Torrijos are the appropriate answer to the country's problems,"  Delgado stressed.</p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAMIR OFFERS ASSURANCES ON PEACE PLAN;  </P> <P> HE SAYS HIS INITIATIVE IS INTACT, BUT CABINET RIVALS DEMAND VOTE  </P> <P> Saying that his initiative for peace in the occupied territories remains  intact, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir uttered key words Sunday meant to keep  his shaky coalition together, but his rivals demanded a new, formal vote on the  original plan.  </P> <P> According to an official account of the weekly Cabinet meeting, Shamir took  rehearsed questions from ministers and gave the answer: "The peace initiative  is unchanged and the government will continue to act in accordance with it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coalition Threatened  </P> <P> The assurance was aimed at placating the Labor Party, led by Finance Minister  Shimon Peres, whose members have threatened to leave the ruling partnership if  Shamir subjects the plan to limitations demanded by a resolution adopted by his  Likud Party. The objective of the plan is to allow Palestinians in the West  Bank and Gaza Strip to choose a peace delegation.  </P> <P> "We have agreed on a governmental initiative which we felt should be defined in  a way to attract an Arab side. Our argument is that there is a contradiction  which exists between the government of Israel plan and the Likud resolution. We  are trying to see where we stand on this contradiction," Peres said.  </P> <P> Shamir offered to let the Cabinet vote on his verbal pronouncement, but Peres  and his allies held out for a new, written text and a vote to guarantee that  the proposal as originally advanced by Shamir is still valid. The plan was  adopted by the government May 14.  </P> <P> The conflict began after Likud placed limits on the plan earlier this month.  Under no circumstances must Israel give up land on the occupied West Bank and  Gaza Strip, the party's resolution said. It also specified that the Arab  uprising must end before any election to choose peace negotiators takes place,  and Arabs who live in East Jerusalem would not be permitted to vote.  </P> <P> Likud Party hawks were silent Sunday, evidently put on the defensive by  Shamir's insistence that the May 14 plan takes precedence over his own party's  policy -- one that he had endorsed when it was resolved.  </P> <P> To avoid a confrontation with Likud, Shamir is resisting a new Cabinet vote on  the plan. The Cabinet originally adopted the measure 20 to 6. "It is not  necessary to have another vote," said Yosef Ben-Aharon, a top Shamir aide. "The  decision has been made to proceed -- and that is that."  </P> <P> Ben-Aharon went on to argue that the greatest obstacle to getting the peace  plan on track is not Israel's political maneuverings but continued talks  between the United States and the Palestine Liberation Organization.  </P> <P> Ben-Aharon said Shamir's plan and Washington's dialogue with the PLO are  "mutually exclusive." The United States cannot profess to support Shamir's plan  and yet keep talking with the PLO, he insisted. Israel's plan precludes  participation by the PLO in elections or subsequent talks.  </P> <P> "We are getting to the moment of truth. We are not going to accept talks with  the PLO, we are not going to accept indirect negotiations with the PLO through  Washington," Ben-Aharon said.  </P> <P> "We want to work with Palestinians here to have elections. The talks with the  PLO undermine that effort."  </P> <P> The Shamir government has steadily campaigned to end the talks between the Bush  Administration and the PLO, which it considers an unrepentant terrorist  organization. Once the PLO is let in on talks, Israeli officials assert, the  formation of a Palestinian state next to Israel is inevitable.  </P> <P> Ben-Aharon's comments came in the wake of hints from Secretary of State James  A. Baker III, who said that if Shamir's elections proposal falls through, the  United States might lean toward the option of holding an international  conference on the Middle East.  </P> <P> Such a conference has been a goal of the PLO.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. Trip Canceled  </P> <P> The Bush Administration canceled plans to send a top State Department delegate  to Israel this week to determine whether Shamir was still standing firm on his  original plan, in the face of attacks on it from Likud. U.S. officials said  that because Shamir was giving assurances that his initiative remained  unchanged, it was unnecessary to send such a delegate.  </P> <P> Sources in the prime minister's office and in the Labor Party said that Labor  Party officials had feared that such a trip would be seen as pressure on its  behalf.  </P></p>

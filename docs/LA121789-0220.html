			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CURTAIN RISES: EASTERN EUROPE, 1989;  </P> <P> VOICES;  </P> <P> 'I PRAY GORBACHEV WILL STAY ALIVE'  </P> <P> Andras Szilagyi heads the psychiatric department at Tetenyi Hospital in  Budapest. He is also a member of the opposition group Hungarian Democratic  Forum.  </P> <P> "Every night I get down on my knees and I pray that Gorbachev will stay alive  six more months, one more year, so that we can push these reforms through so  there is no turning back."  </P> <P> He also has misgivings about the commitment of his compatriots:  </P> <P> "Hungarians have had a life without any political ideas, and now they're not  interested in politics, they don't want to speak, they're just interested in  consumer ideas and their standard of living.  </P> <P> "It's a collective depression. Hungary has lost two world wars, two-thirds of  its population. We live in a political system we don't like, with economic  standards that go down step by step.  </P> <P> "The real changes will come when the average man learns to think in political  terms and not Frigidaires."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Edvin Sugarev commentary: "Preach of State Traitor"] </F>   [Text] In his Sunday [9 January] speach, delivered on the  radio, President Zhelev said that anyone who hindered  negotiations on the foreign debt and concluding an agreement  with the IMF is encroaching upon national interests and is  committing an act of state treason. Unquestionably, this is a  worthy position on the part of the head of our state.  Simultaneously, this is unprecedented hypocrisy in our modern  history.    This is so because the government of the Union of Democratic  Forces [SDS] was on the verge of signing an agreement with the  former creditors on much better terms than the government of the  Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], led by his former adviser.  This government achieved a vague preliminary agreement, which  could hardly be implemented. Weeks before the SDS government  was about the sign the agreement, the Bulgarian president gave  the signal to launch a total attack on the government, and  personally joined in the attack with unworthy lies and mean  scripts concocted by the secret services under his control. At  that stage [former Finance] Minister Kostov warned him that the  national interests are on the line rather than political  interests or power ambitions. However, the president, the  Bulgarian president, preferred to act as if he were deaf.    The SDS government also reached an agreement with the IMF on  a three year stand-by. Berov's cabinet has no chance of  reaching such an agreement. The tacit coup, again directed by  this president, foiled that opportunity. The result -- not a  single dollar for Bulgaria as a credit for more than one year,  and not a single serious investment. Thus for a year we are  marking time, something that has completely ruined our economy,  filled up the pockets of the new mafia, caused record  unemployment, blocked privatization and land restitution,  prompted the first steps of hyperinflation, and foiled the  budget and the new draft budget, whose deficit could bury any  government.    To speak after all this about national interests is only  political impudence. It is high time that the one who preaches  to Bulgaria measured his own words and deeds, because following  their logic it appears that the president himself is a state  traitor.</p>

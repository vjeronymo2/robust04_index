			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Kruglov, prosecutor of the Russian </F> Federation General Prosecutor's Office Administration for the  Enforcement of National Security and Interethnic Relations Laws,  by Sergey Kaverin under the "Only for KURANTY" rubric:  "Zhirinovskiy Under Probe"; place and date not given]    [Text] Let us remind our readers that in mid-December  KURANTY published excerpts from Mr. Zhirinovskiy's election  speech to naval officers at a party devoted to the 300th  anniversary of the Russian Navy at the Estrada Theater. On that  occasion Vladimir Volfovich openly called for "a war to be  provoked between mountain tribes..." The author of these lines  witnessed the blood-curdling "revelations." It turned out that  the "Bersenevskaya [after Bersenevskaya Embankment, location of  the Estrada Theater] calls" of Russia's chief liberal were not  the least in bringing a lawsuit against Zhirinovskiy.    So, your correspondent met with Viktor Kruglov, prosecutor  of  the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office  Administration for the Enforcement of National Security and  Interethnic Relations Laws.    [Kaverin] Viktor Alekseyevich, how did the "Zhirinovskiy  case" came about?    [Kruglov] Our administration and I personally have been  dealing with aspects of Zhirinovskiy's political activity that  are of interest to us. We have focused on four main incidents:  the well-known ruling by the Third Party Information Court of  10 December 1993; second, an article in your newspaper; third,  the incident involving Zhirinovskiy and Gdlyan, which took place  on the night of 12 and 13 December at the Kremlin Palace of  Congresses. The last incident is the book "The Last Dash to the  South," published by Zhirinovskiy. We have considered all the  facts together. The lawsuit was brought under Article 71 of the  Russian Federation Criminal Code -- "propaganda of war." The  decision on bringing a lawsuit was made at the level of the  Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office leadership.    [Kaverin] But was is done at your initiative?    [Kruglov] Let us clarify: On the basis of our investigatory  materials.    [Kaverin] What steps will be taken against Zhirinovskiy upon  his return from abroad?    [Kruglov] First, the Russian general prosecutor should  determine who will investigate the criminal case. Once he makes  up his mind on that, the division that will be tasked with the  investigation will resolve all the matters -- of course,  according to the law. The mechanism of such an investigation is  well known: Subpoenas, interrogations. The investigation will  be carried out in full as any investigation of an ordinary  criminal case.    [Kaverin] How will the investigation square with the  immunity Zhirinovskiy enjoys as a deputy?    [Kruglov] According to the new Russian Federation  Constitution, the status of a Russian Federation State Duma  deputy is not an obstacle to bringing a lawsuit and  investigating the case. The Constitution stipulates completely  clearly and unequivocally that State Duma approval is required  for arresting a deputy, searching his or her place, or detaining  him or her. Let me repeat: Arrest, search, and detention. That  is to say, a criminal lawsuit against a deputy may be brought  and the case may be investigated according to general rules, and  only later, depending on the results of the investigation -- if  reasons for a search, detention, or arrest emerge -- will the  general prosecutor make a petition to the State Duma requesting  that this or that deputy be stripped of his immunity on the  basis of the presented investigation results. Let me recall  that in accordance with the constitution in force at the time,  the Supreme Soviet had to be petitioned so as to bring a  criminal lawsuit itself against the deputy.    [Kaverin] Still, Viktor Alekseyevich, let us try to simulate  the situation: What if, say, Zhirinovskiy does not show up  under the subpoena. What will he be threatened with in this  event?    [Kruglov] Let us begin by stating that he is obliged to show  up in the first place. Because until charges are brought  against him he is technically considered a witness. And he will  be subpoenaed for questioning precisely in that capacity. If he  still does not come, the investigator will have to react.    [Kaverin] How? What measures are provided for in the law  for this situation?    [Kruglov] An ordinary citizen risks being forcibly brought  before the court if he does not have good reasons for his  failure to appear. This is enforced by the militia. But this  action has an element of enforcement to it, so it can  effectively be interpreted as a detention -- one of the three  (!) instances where deputies enjoy immunity.    [Kaverin] Then what we have is a closed circle: in order to  arrest or detain a guilty deputy one needs weighty reasons and  the State Duma's "OK." But in order to give this "OK" the Duma  needs facts that the investigation is unable to obtain from the  deputy...    [Kruglov] This is correct, to a certain extent. But you  should take into account that any criminal case is based not  only on testimony of the person under investigation. There  should be some other ideas, materials, documents, witnesses'  testimonies, evidence produced by expert appraisals. In short,  we need an objective record. This is why even though a deputy  may evade giving testimony as a witness, this does not mean that  a sufficient amount of evidence would not be collected to press  charges against him. I would like to repeat that all said above  is only theoretical in nature, but specifically these questions  concerning the suspect will be decided upon by an investigator.  The investigator who, under the law, inquires into the case and  makes all decisions independently.    [Kaverin] What is your opinion -- how long will the  investigation last?    [Kruglov] I do not know, this is a complex matter. It  depends on a huge number of circumstances.</p>

The French delegation was composed of Bruno Delaye,  diplomatic adviser of President Mitterrand; Jean-Marc Rochereau  de la Sabliere, director of African and Malagasy Affairs at the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The delegation was accompanied by  the French ambassador in Yaounde, Mr. Gilles Vidal, and another  French military officer, Colonel Rentegeat, the radio added  without specifying the function of this officer.    Well-informed Cameroonian official sources were pointing out  this morning that the delegation hoped to go to Abuja, the  Nigerian federal capital, immediately after the audience with  President Biya to meet the Nigerian head of state, General Sani  Abacha. A French military detachment of about 30 soldiers also  arrived in Yaounde yesterday from their base at Bouar in Central  African Republic. The detachment is charged with an  "exploratory mission on the conflict situation at the borders,"  in accordance with the defense accord signed between France and  Cameroon.    The French Foreign Ministry today pointed out that while  sending a delegation to the two countries, France is also  "undertaking an intensive diplomatic activity" at the OAU and  the UN Security Council.</p>

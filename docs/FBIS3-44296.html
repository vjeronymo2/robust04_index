			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 3 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng, interviewed by XINHUA over the weekend, expressed  confidence for China's future, saying that the country's  modernization is ensured with "organizational guarantee as well  as a theoretical basis."    Explaining the reason why the world began to have a new  understanding of China in 1993, Premier Li said the fundamental  reason lies in the fact that guided by Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, China has  scored great progress in reform, opening up and economic  development.    Only a few years ago, amidst the drastic changes in eastern  Europe and the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, some  people abroad spread the idea that China would collapse.    "Facts have shown that China, instead of collapsing, has  developed and grown in strength," Li noted.    "Some economists, critics and statesmen in the world have  made more optimistic estimation and prediction than we do with  regard to China's economic strength and prospect of  development," Li said. "though not tallying with the realities,  this reflects the world's acknowledgement of China's  achievements from one perspective."    A full set of Deng's theories on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics has not only taken shape, but also  displayed great power in practice, Li said. "The third  generation of Chinese leadership, with Jiang Zemin as the core,  has not only been established, but has been maturing as well."    "Thus, our modernization drive is blessed with  organizational  guarantee as well as a theoretical basis," Li said. "Today, we  are more confident than ever about the future of China."    However, he pointed out that some people are spreading a  theory that a powerful China would constitute a threat, with the  purpose of sowing dissension between China and its neighbors,  and thus to spoil China's good surrounding environment.    "From the theory of collapse to the theory of threat, this  is  indeed a 180-degree turn and is really hard to understand," Li  said. "These two ideas, which both go to extremes, show total  ignorance of China's realities."    A developing and more powerful China will not threaten any  country, Li said. "Instead, it will only make greater  contribution to world peace and development."    As for how to view possible differences between the central  government and localities and the imbalanced development between  different parts of the country, Li said: "The socialist market  economy we are going to build up is a unified market."    Though the gap between China's eastern and western parts has  expanded, the western part has been developing and the people's  life there has been improved, Li said, adding that imbalance of  development is a universal phenomenon in the world.    "The party and government are fully aware of this problem  and  taking measures to solve it.    "It is understandable if some people, out of goodwill, worry  that contradictions might arise from the imbalanced development  between different regions and some reform measures that affect  some local interests," Li said.    "If some hostile people expected or even predicted that the  gap between China's eastern and western parts would lead to a  split in the country, hoping to see problems occur inside China,  they are doomed to be disappointed," he said.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Australian 'right to strike' row Australia's federal government was yesterday at loggerheads with the powerful Australian Council of Trade Unions (Actu) over the country's new 'right to strike' law, as a 24-hour stoppage by aircraft refuellers and oil tanker drivers in support of a 12 per cent industry-wide pay claim brought chaos to airports. On Friday, the Industrial Relations Commission ruled that by pursuing an industry-wide pay claim the union involved - the Transport Workers Union - was seeking to avoid 'enterprise-bargaining', and that its right to strike free from the threat of legal action should be withdrawn. The Labor government yesterday said it supported this stance. But the Actu weighed in behind the TWU, whose appeal against the IRC ruling will be heard today. 'If pattern (industry-wide) bargaining is good enough for politicians, judges, members of the IRC and the business sector, then it's good enough for transport workers,' said Mr Martin Ferguson, Actu president.</p>

			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Letter: Borrowing requirement and money supply Sir, Mr Anthony Harris ('A new twist to ease the slump', July 20) suggests that under-funding the public sector borrowing requirement would cause a large rise in the M4 monetary aggregate and goes on to describe this as an 'arithmetic certainty'. We have surely learned that there is no such thing as a mathematical certainty, at least when it comes to the economy. But economic theory, for what it is worth, states that the impact upon M4 would be precisely zero: in an open economy such as the UK within a credible fixed exchange rate system such as the ERM the money stock is determined by public demand and cannot be influenced by funding or other financial devices. Actually, M4 might rise if exchange or interest rates fell, stimulating economic growth and the demand for money. But there is little if any scope for such reductions at the moment. Changes in gilt issuance would in this situation be offset largely in external capital flows, most obviously overseas purchases of gilts.

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Council tax bill forecasts seen as too optimistic THE first council tax bills in 1993 are likely to be up to nearly Pounds 70 higher than the government has forecast, according to a report published today by the Local Government Information Unit. The report by the research unit - which is backed by Labour-controlled councils and nine public-sector trade unions - claims that the government's council tax projections assume full collection of the poll tax in its final year. In reality, the report says, councils will have to set higher council taxes to make up for the shortfall caused by the rise in non-collection of the poll tax. The announcement of the abolition of the tax will encourage more people not to pay it, the unit argues. Assuming a poll tax non-collection rate of 5 per cent - 'a conservative estimate', according to the report - the council tax on properties in the middle tax band in Langbaurgh, Cleveland, would be Pounds 41 higher than forecast. Those in the lowest band would pay Pounds 27 more, and those in the highest Pounds 68. In Solihull, West Midlands, properties in the middle band would pay Pounds 22 more than predicted, those in the lowest band Pounds 15, and in the top band Pounds 40 more. Even in Lewisham, south London, which shows the lowest rises of nine sample councils examined in the report, properties in the middle band would pay Pounds 12 more, compared with Pounds 8 in the lowest band and Pounds 20 in the highest. Mr Michael Carr, leader of Middlesbrough District Council and chair of the LGIU, commented: 'As with the poll tax, the government has got in a muddle with its sums. Its poll tax predictions were consistently wrong because it failed to base them on realistic assumptions. The same thing is happening with the council tax because ministers have rushed out incomplete and poorly thought-out proposals.'</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Survey of Ukraine (4): March to market begins - The Economy Converting what was until recently a part of the vast Soviet empire into an economically viable economy was the most important, and most daunting, task facing the architects of the new state of Ukraine. But only recently has the march to the market economy finally begun. The appointment of Mr Leonid Kuchma as prime minister last November, with enhanced executive authority to govern by decree, and the selection of known economic reformers to the cabinet, has been followed by a flurry of market-orientated reforms. But the reformers have inherited a bleak and chaotic economy from Mr Kuchma's conservative predecessor, Mr Vitold Fokin. The collapse of the Soviet Union left an over-industrialised Ukrainian economy, dependent on military production, Russian trade and cheap oil. Months of drift and indecision have meant a reversion to a primitive combination of barter and corruption. Not surprisingly, the arrival of the reformers has coincided with a battery of bleak economic statistics. Rising state spending, now equivalent to more than 60 per cent of total gross output, and dwindling tax revenues mean that the government budget deficit has grown to 36 per cent of gross domestic product, which is financed by credit creation. It was the persistent release of these credits that provoked the Russian government to stop recognising Ukrainian-issued rouble credits last summer. This in turn led to Ukraine's departure from the rouble zone in November and effectively made Ukraine's government-issued coupons an independent currency. But the breakdown in monetary relations with Russia has left Ukrainian enterprises with Rbs426bn in unpaid bills from Russian enterprises, and no convertible currency in which to conduct essential trade. The result is hyperinflation. The monthly inflation rate has risen to 50 per cent (13,000 per cent a year), fuelled for the moment by the liberalisation of state food prices in December. In the illegal currency black markets that cluster around the entrance to Kiev's main department store, Ukraine's fledgling currency has collapsed in value against both the dollar and the rouble, although the Ukrainian population remains surprisingly willing to use the coupon. Yet while Kiev's citizens wearily go about their business, bemused by fuel shortages and rising prices, there is no mistaking the new mood of optimism among Ukraine's western advisers. World Bank officials have been closely involved in drawing up the government's reform programme while the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private finance arm, which only recently was considering pulling out of Ukraine, is now pressing ahead with plans for small-scale auctions of state property in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. Even the resident representative of the International Monetary Fund walks the streets of Kiev with a spring in his step, as IMF teams from Washington tour government offices in search of meaningful statistics before negotiations over a stand-by agreement can begin. The Cabinet of Ministers' draft reform programme sets ambitious targets. By the end of 1993, Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, minister of the economy, hopes to reduce inflation to between 3 and 4 per cent a month and cut the budget deficit to 6 per cent of GDP. One advantage of delay in starting reform is that Ukrainian officials, and their western advisers, have been able to learn from the failure of the Russian government to stabilise inflation and encourage private employment. All agree that the reformers must take steps to reduce the budget deficit, stabilise the currency and tax excessive wage increases. But the prevailing wisdom in Kiev, accepted by both Ukrainian leaders and western officials, is that budget austerity cannot work without liberalisation and privatisation. The powerful industrial lobby, which undermined Russia's attempt to stabilise its inflation rate by demanding inflationary credits from the central bank, is also responsible for Ukraine's inflation. The Black Sea shipyard at Mykolaiv, for example, received Rbs3bn in low interest credit over the past six months in order to pay its 25,000 largely idle workforce. This practice explains why Ukraine's output has fallen by 20 per cent over the past year but the registered unemployment rate remains only a little over 1 per cent. Simply to cut off the credits at once, however economically desirable, would bankrupt not only industries but whole cities and regions, particularly the politically unstable eastern regions of Ukraine. The solution, argues Mr Daniel Kaufman, the World Bank mission chief in Kiev, is to press ahead with rapid small-scale privatisation, especially of retail stores, trucks and farmland, and to remove all legal barriers to the registration of new businesses in order to generate alternative employment. This is the strategy that Mr Kuchma's government appears to have embraced, at least on paper. The government has liberalised and partially privatised agriculture, simplified the system of corporate taxes and plans to adopt mass small-scale privatisation on the Lviv model. In the meantime, it also wants to commercialise state enterprises as fast as possible but to keep potentially profitable large enterprises afloat. 'We will pay money for the conversion of the military-industrial complex,' says Mr Pynzenyk,'but we will only pay these subsidies when we see a concrete programme for conversion. We want to privatise some military establishments as soon as possible, while others will simply have to close but keep paying their wages for two or three years.' Yet the real test is whether the government can face up to the many hard choices which it must make if it is to bring the budget deficit down to a manageable level. Some have have been taken, for example the introduction of means-tested welfare payments which reduced the number of recipients from 20m to 2m. But the government watered down its decision to cut food subsidies, which caused many food prices to triple overnight, by doubling the minimum wage in the face of popular protest. Mr Kuchma has not managed to rein in this credit emission as he promised when he assumed office last November. Central bank officials say that in the last two months of 1992 there was a net emission of 100bn coupons while Ukraine's coupon currency has continued to slide on the black market. Until the government manages to stabilise the inflation rate, it dare not implement its plan to introduce a new and convertible currency, the Hryvnia. More fundamentally, the government has made little progress in establishing an effective monetary authority or banking system with which to control credit emission and finance trade with other republics, including Russia. After two months of delay, the government has still not appointed a new National Bank governor. 'Whatever the government says it will do now, the reform programme cannot succeed without credible and stable institutions, including an independent central bank,' laments Mr Oleksandr Sharov, the bank's deputy governor. The biggest uncertainty which hangs over the reformers' prospects is whether the Cabinet of Ministers will be able to implement any of its decrees. It will face opposition from recalcitrant local bureaucrats and powerful factory directors who have assumed much power over the past year as the hand of the central state has withered, a problem that Mr Pynzenyk highlights in the interview opposite. Still, compared to Russia, the Ukrainian reformers have some advantages, not least the executive powers that parliament has granted under pressure from the chairman of parliament, Mr Ivan Pliushch. 'All intelligent people in Ukraine today realise that the road backwards is a dead end, although the road forward is steeply uphill,' he says. 'But all we are doing now is consuming what we already have and crawling further into the pockets of future generations.' Moreover, Ukraine's relatively small geographic size compared to Russia, with only a third of its population, means that the government in Kiev can hope to have more power in the regions than the reformers in Moscow, especially as Mr Kravchuk's presidential representatives now also take orders from the prime minister. 'Even the best laws require a mechanism for implementation in the regions,' says Mr Anatoli Kinakh, presidential representative in the Nykolayev region. 'I see my role as the fulfilment of the decrees of the council of ministers.' Whether Ukraine's politicians can manage to achieve the delicate balance between a politically acceptable level of unemployment and an economically manageable budget deficit will depend on whether they can find new markets for their agricultural and industrial production in Europe and the Middle East and whether western aid materialises. Ukrainian leaders are keen to develop trade agreements with western Europe. But to date, Ukraine has received little interest and only miserly assistance and investment from the west, although its nuclear weapons and decaying nuclear power plants could represent a significant bargaining chip and a number of World Bank project loans are said to be in the pipeline. Mr Kuchma, while disappointed at the lack of western aid, says that the western attitude is too short-termist. 'If this government fails then the next government will be one which goes back to the old system,' he says. 'But the road back will be much worse.'</p>

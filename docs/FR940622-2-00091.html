			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Once the clearing member's DVP instruction has been entered and accepted and OCC has completed its processing, the clearing member will be able to print an OCC C/MACS-generated authorization report from its own computer terminal. This new report will replace the DVP authorization form and will contain all of the information currently on the DVP authorization form with the exception of an OCC signature. The clearing member will be required to deliver the C/MACS-generated report to its DVP agent bank and to direct such DVP agent bank to issue a SWIFT or tested telex message to OCC's agent bank guaranteeing delivery or payment, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms of the DVP authorization instruction contained in the report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OCC will send a message to its own agent bank through an electronic communications link to confirm the terms of the accepted DVP instructions. Following receipt of the guarantee message from the clearing member's DVP agent bank, OCC's agent bank or correspondent bank will carry out its payment or delivery obligation to the recipient named in the DVP authorization instruction on the exercise settlement date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, the proposed changes to OCC Rules 1606A and 2107 will require clearing members to submit DVP instructions to OCC through on-line transmissions. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  Other specific changes are also being made. Language is being added to Rule 1606A(b) to clarify that a clearing member's ``agent bank'' is an approved bank acting on its behalf. The additional language will make the language of Rule 1606A(b) consistent with the language of Rule 2107(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rules 1606A and 2107 set forth the DVP settlement procedures for foreign currency options and cross-rate foreign currency options, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rules 1606A(c) and 2107(c) are being amended to reflect an operational change in OCC's DVP processing. Currently, a clearing member may specifically elect to apply a DVP instruction to settle all or part of a gross settlement obligation or a net settlement obligation. Under the proposed on-line system, a clearing member will not be permitted to elect whether its DVP instruction is applied to a gross settlement obligation or a net settlement obligation. Rather, the system will automatically apply the DVP instruction to the clearing member's gross settlement obligation and then adjust the clearing member's remaining net settlement obligation accordingly. This remaining net settlement obligation will then settle through the regular settlement procedures pursuant to Rule 1606. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The situation on the Tajik-Afghan border remains  complex. Some field commanders from the antigovernment  opposition and the Islamic Rebirth Movement plan to attack  border installations and plant field mines in Tajikistan along  the border with Afghanistan.    As the Tajik Foreign Ministry's Spokesman Zafar Saidov  disclosed at a briefing in Dushanbe on Saturday, the foreign  department had received from the Afghan Embassy in Russia a  note, which says that the Afghan Defence Ministry is ready to  take the situation in the Imam-Sakhi (the Kunduz province) under  control. It was from that area that Tajik militants shelled a  border check point at Nizhny Pyanj on 11 April. The Afghan  Defence Ministry pledged to do all it can to prevent such  actions, Saidov said.    He also reported that the Afghan authorities had asked the  Tajik leadership to step up joint actions and stabilize the  situation on the border.</p>

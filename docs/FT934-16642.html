			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: Learning how to work when the sun goes down - Michiyo Nakamota in Tokyo finds out what measures Japanese companies are taking as they try to combat recession JAPANESE companies are generally loath to admit unexpected turns of event. But at the mid-way point of the fiscal year, investors are bracing themselves for a number of nasty surprises. As companies assess business activity in the first half - ended September - they are being forced to downgrade their earnings expectations which, more often than not, have turned out to have been on the optimistic side. Last week Mazda, the car maker, and Matsushita, the consumer electronics group, joined a growing list of companies deeply troubled by the weakness of the Japanese economy and having second thoughts about the outlook for earnings as a result. Mazda said its losses this year would be Y32bn, more than 2 1/2 times its initial forecasts. Matsushita predicted its profits would be Y63bn, 35 per cent lower than last year - it originally thought they would be 3 per cent up at Y100bn. Both companies blamed the further weakening of the Japanese economy and the rapid appreciation of the yen. 'The situation has made it difficult for us to achieve our target for the first half,' a Matsushita representative said. 'We expect the slowdown to be prolonged.' When Japanese companies made their initial earnings forecasts for the year, there were still hopes that government measures to stimulate the economy would trigger a recovery in domestic demand later in the year. In June, the Economic Planning Agency even announced that the economy had bottomed out. The summer months, however, were to prove those early hopes of a revival not only premature, but over-optimistic; things were set to get worse. The pick-up in domestic demand failed to materialise. Both personal consumption and capital spending by companies continued to sag: department store sales in Tokyo dropped 6.6 per cent in the year to August, and private-sector machinery orders fell almost 12 per cent in July. Japanese consumers, feeling the effects of the economic slowdown through smaller summer bonuses and worried about possible redundancy, decided they could not afford to replace cars or stereo sets. The gloom was aggravated by an unusually cold summer, which had a debilitating effect on personal consumption. Meanwhile, the government stimulus failed to have much of an impact. A government survey in August showed Japanese business confidence at its lowest level for almost two decades. 'There is something of a crisis of confidence in the Japanese economy,' said a representative of NEC, the electronics maker, when it reduced its forecast of annual profits from Y50bn to Y30bn. This weakness in domestic demand has been coupled with an unexpected surge in the yen's value against the dollar, which has been little short of disastrous for many Japanese manufacturers. Since the beginning of the fiscal year the yen has risen about 5 per cent, wiping billions of yen off overseas earnings. Mazda said the yen's rise would reduce revenues by Y65bn, while Matsushita noted that the impact of the yen's appreciation against major currencies would amount to a loss in annual revenues of Y132bn. While the strength of the currency was expected to depress profits at the start of the fiscal year, companies recognise that the impact is likely to be even greater in the second half, not only because the yen has continued to strengthen but also because their ability to hedge dollar earnings will be significantly reduced. Japanese executives stress the strenuous efforts they are making to respond to the bleak conditions. Manufacturing costs are being slashed, capital spending is being curtailed and R&amp;D investment is being trimmed to save the last yen. Restructuring has become the latest catchphrase and corporate priorities are being reassessed as never before. Debates are aired in public over the need for higher productivity, particularly among white collar workers. In a reversal of conventional Japanese corporate wisdom, it is becoming increasingly acceptable to talk of the greater importance of profitability over market share. 'It is a perfect time for management to carry out these ideas,' said Mr Yoichi Morishita, president of Matsushita. But in spite of these efforts, as a beleaguered Mazda executive explained last week, it has been difficult to deal quickly enough with the deterioration in the Japanese economy and the speed of the yen's rise. As companies wait for the effects of restructuring measures to come through, the growing consensus is that Japanese corporate earnings will this year fall for the fourth consecutive year, and recovery will be delayed until well into 1994. Before recovery comes, however, it is likely to be preceded by still more nasty surprises. On top of further pain caused by the strong yen, it is increasingly likely that further job cuts will have to be made. So far, Japanese companies have been averse to meeting the decline in business activity through big staff cuts. Life-time employment is a commitment they have been unwilling to sacrifice. On the whole, the most that has been done is to implement voluntary retirement schemes and suppress recruitment. 'Corporations are continuing to act as an unofficial social security system,' said Mr Peter Tasker, strategist at Kleinwort Benson. Mr Tasker noted that personnel costs continued to rise in the second quarter by 4.3 per cent year on year. He said: 'It is hard to see how corporate restructuring can take place without a significant labour market adjustment.' If that happens, however, Japanese companies will once again have to admit to a disturbing and unexpected turn of events.</p>

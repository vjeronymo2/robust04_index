			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: CSI back in black at interim stage CANNON Street Investments, the mini-conglomerate with interests in hotels and leisure, electronics distribution and food and drink distribution, returned to profits at the interim stage, helped by profits on the sale of businesses and lower interest costs. The group, which has been restructured by a new management team, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.83m in the 28 weeks to July 17 compared with restated pre-tax losses of Pounds 30m in the 26 weeks to June 30 last year. Underlying the turnround, CSI posted trading profits from continuing activities of Pounds 2.12m (Pounds 6.73m losses) on turnover of Pounds 96.7m (Pounds 80.2m). Discontinued activities added Pounds 204,000 (Pounds 770,000) to trading profits and Pounds 2.91m (Pounds 46.85m) to turnover. Profits were further boosted in the latest period by Pounds 4.32m profits on the sale and termination of operations mainly related to the sale of the Dutch Tamson business and the Georgian House Hotel - last time the group recorded a Pounds 19.9m loss on the sale and closure of businesses. Interest costs also fell sharply to Pounds 1.82m (Pounds 4.06m), reflecting lower interest rates and a further reduction in net bank borrowings which fell to Pounds 13.4m compared with Pounds 29.6m. Mr Tom Long, chairman, said the turnround in operating profits was the result of 'steps taken to bring greater management focus to the group'. Among the three core businesses Mr Long said the electronics distribution operations performed well, the leisure division had 'mixed fortunes', while the food and drink operations achieved good results. Mr David Smith, chief executive, said only two businesses, both linked to the construction sector, failed to post profits in the first half. Generally, he said, 'things are coming along steadily.' The group reported earnings per share of 3.14p (losses 30.01p). However, there is no interim dividend because earlier losses resulted in a deficit in distributable reserves. Now that the group has returned to profitability Mr Smith said the board is considering a capital reorganisation which would allow the group to resume dividend payments at some stage.</p>

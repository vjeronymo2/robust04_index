			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Renewed impetus for farm trade deal EUROPEAN Community and US farm trade negotiators are to intensify efforts to reach a compromise on farm trade liberalisation, officials said yesterday at the end of a summit in Japan of trade ministers. Failure to reach a deal on the issue has blocked for more than 15 months the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade reform, jeopardising free trade and slowing recovery from recession in many economies. The stimulus for a fresh initiative comes from a meeting in Washington last week of President George Bush of the US and Mr Jacques Delors, president of the EC commission. Expectations of a breakthrough did not materialise but 'new ideas' from the EC - which included an offer to come closer to the 24 per cent cut in the volume of the Community's subsidised farm exports being demanded in the Uruguay Round - appear to have raised hopes. Mr Hugo Paeman, a senior EC trade negotiator, is to contact Mr Jules Katz, his US counterpart, on Wednesday to arrange a schedule of working-level meetings. Officials at the weekend summit of trade ministers from Japan, the US, the EC and Canada, at the Japanese mountain resort of Bandai Kogen, talked of a compromise being reached 'in several weeks, rather than months'. One EC spokesman insisted: 'The problem is not at the working level, but at the political level.' However, he confirmed an early conclusion was the target. 'If we have not got agreement by the time of the Group of Seven summit in Munich in July, we can forget about an agreement for this year and perhaps for ever.' Japan had hoped the Bandai Kogen summit would take place after the Uruguay Round negotiations had been completed. Set in Fukushima prefecture, the childhood home of Mr Kozo Watanabe, Japan's trade minister, it was intended to be '75 per cent pleasure and 25 per cent work'. The pleasure principle was not wholly abandoned but the fact that the meeting followed so swiftly the Washington meeting of Mr Bush and Mr Delors prompted Japanese and Canadian officials to press their EC and US counterparts for comprehensive briefings on the outcome of the summit. 'Encouraged' by reported headway in Washington, Mr Watanabe then pressed for a resumption of bilateral talks in the Geneva headquarters of Gatt on tariff cuts and liberalisation of trade in services.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The House of Representatives has commended the  existing positive and distinguished relations between Jordan and  France based on mutual understanding and respect. In a  statement issued today, the House of Representatives said it was  satisfied with the French Government's decision to stop its  participation in naval inspections at the Port of al-'Aqabah.  Following is the text of the House of Representatives'  statement:    The Jordanian House of Representatives received with some  satisfaction the statements by the French Foreign Ministry's  spokesman on Wednesday, 4 May 1994, which deal with the French  Government's decision to stop its participation in naval  inspections at the Port of al-'Aqabah.    Although the House of Representatives believes that this  step  is somewhat late, it still considers it a positive step since it  shows the French Government's understanding and awareness of  Jordan's sound policies, just demands, and firm and principled  stands.    Moreover, the House of Representatives hopes that the French  Government's decision will be the first step, followed by  similar steps by other countries participating in the naval  inspections, toward lifting the siege imposed on the Port of  al-'Aqabah and compensating Jordan for the serious losses it has  suffered as a result of these inspections.    As the Jordanian House of Representatives is fully aware of  the international changes and developments and of the fact that  only one superpower is imposing its decisions and its own  interpretation on others, and it hopes that the French  Government will take another step by exerting more effort and  playing a more effective role to implement the resolutions of  international legitimacy in a just and unbiased manner.    At the same time, the Jordanian House of Representatives  commended the existing positive and distinguished relations  between Jordan and France based on mutual understanding and  respect and the House called for the continuous development of  these relations.</p>

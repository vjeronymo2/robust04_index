			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POLICIES PUT CONSUMERS IN CREDIT CARD CATCH-22;  </P> <P> IDENTIFICATION: CUSTOMERS FIND THEMSELVES ON MERCHANTS' MARKETING LISTS AFTER  COMPLYING WITH DEMANDS TO PRODUCE MORE THAN A DRIVER'S LICENSE.  </P> <P> Once upon a time, credit cards were simply for buying things on credit. But  that was in those dim, dark days when a driver's license was for driving and a  Social Security number was for old-age benefits.  </P> <P> Today those three items are evolving into a kind of unofficial but very real  universal identification system. And while it is often against the rules -- or  even downright illegal -- to use them this way, those who resist find the full  weight of the nation's commercial establishment brought against them.  </P> <P> Try to charge an item on a credit card without a driver's license, try to pay  by check without a credit card, try to reserve theater tickets or even make  reservations in some restaurants, and you'll find immediately what the  requirements are.  </P> <P> The reasons for the growth of this system are plain enough. Merchants, theater  and restaurant owners and other vendors are increasingly plagued by bad checks,  no-show reservations and other forms of theft and cheating. They want to try to  protect themselves whenever possible.  </P> <P> But one increasingly common practice -- that of using credit cards as a  backstop for bad checks -- is coming under attack.  </P> <P> According to Bankcard Holders of America, a consumer group based in Herndon,  Va., when a merchant writes your name, driver's license number (which in many  states is your Social Security number) and major credit card number all over  your check, he is exposing you to fraud at least as much as he is protecting  himself from it.  </P> <P> Checks travel a lengthy route from the merchant to his bank to yours. Anywhere  along that line, "anyone who has access to the check, or even gets a quick look  at it, has all the information he needs" to buy merchandise over the phone and  charge it to you," said Elgie Holstein, director of Bankcard Holders. "Or a  thief might apply for a credit card in your name."  </P> <P> "Application fraud" is one of the fastest-growing new scams, he said.  </P> <P> Indeed, that and related frauds and dubious practices have become common enough  to persuade the Iowa legislature to prohibit merchants from recording such data  on checks.  </P> <P> Holstein said he has also heard of merchants using this information, or  telephone numbers recorded on credit-card slips, to build marketing lists for  mail or phone solicitations.  </P> <P> Officials of Visa U.S.A. told Bankcard Holders that "we do not believe the  information is used by the merchant for marketing purposes," but MasterCard  International said: "It is indeed our understanding that many merchants who ask  for a cardholder's personal information do so for marketing purposes."  </P> <P> Because 20% to 40% of people Bankcard Holders surveyed have unlisted telephone  numbers, often to avoid just this sort of call, this practice exposes them to  invasion of privacy, Holstein said.  </P> <P> Finally, many merchants use a credit card as a fallback for a check that  bounces. Stores of The Limited chain even stamp the check with an  authorization, which they have the customer sign, so that the amount of the  check plus a $15 fee can be charged to the customer's credit card if the check  is returned.  </P> <P> Visa and MasterCard say this is not permitted.  </P> <P> "If the personal check is returned, the merchant is not permitted under Visa  regulations to submit a sales draft to cover the returned check," Robert H.  Miller of Visa wrote to Bankcard Holders.  </P> <P> "Even if the customer has provided his permission to do so, this is considered  a refinancing of an existing obligation and is strictly prohibited under Visa  regulations."  </P> <P> Darold D. Hoops of MasterCard wrote, "A merchant may not submit a credit-card  slip for the amount of a returned check."  </P> <P> But because merchants do it, "it is possible to conclude that Visa and  MasterCard have to some extent looked the other way," Holstein said.  </P> <P> A Visa spokesman said last week, "It is our position that a merchant cannot  refuse to accept a Visa card if the consumer refuses to provide a phone  number."  </P> <P> He added that Visa is "studying new rules" on the subject. And a MasterCard  spokeswoman said the company may not know about merchants' use of credit cards  to cover bounced checks unless the consumer complains.  </P> <P> Holstein acknowledged that merchants have the right to ask a customer who wants  to pay by check to show a credit card as identification. It is when the  merchant starts recording the credit-card number that it becomes objectionable,  he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TENNIS / ITALIAN OPEN;  </P> <P> 3RD SEED SANCHEZ-VICARIO UPSET  </P> <P> Canada's Helen Kelesi staged two dramatic comebacks to upset weary third-seeded  Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, 6-4, 7-5, in the third round of the Italian Open  today.  </P> <P> Also reaching the quarterfinals was 14-year-old Jennifer Capriati, who won a  tough battle against Italy's Laura Golarsa, 6-3, 6-7, (10-8), 6-2.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Martina Navratilova, Still bothered by a pulled hamstring, the  33-year-old Navratilova managed to defeat Italy's Sandra Cecchini 6-4, 3-6,  6-3.  </P> <P> Sanchez-Vicario took a 4-2 lead in the first set before giving up four  consecutive games and the set to Kelesi.  </P> <P> The scenario repeated itself in the second set, as Sanchez-Vicario, 18,  squandered leads of 4-2 and 5-3.  </P> <P> "After I fell behind 4-2 in the first set, I just told myself to relax, and to  start getting ready for the second," said Kelesi, seeded 11th. "And I started  playing better."  </P> <P> "I really needed this win today. I played Arantxa twice this year and lost both  times. I knew that if I lost today, it would be a long time before I beat her  again."  </P> <P> Sanchez-Vicario said that fatigue had been a factor in the loss. "I think I've  played too many tournaments in a row," she said. "After seven tournaments this  year, I'm tired. I gave it everything I had today. I attacked on the important  points. But my shots kept going long. I guess it just wasn't my day."  </P> <P> Navratilova, who wore a bandage around her left thigh, said the hamstring  injury bothered her on some points.  </P> <P> "I couldn't get down on some volleys and low balls. But it's better than  yesterday so I'm encouraged," she said.  </P> <P> Two other seeded teen-agers, 16-year-old Monica Seles and 19-year-old defending  champion Gabriela Sabatini also reached the quarters. Seles beat Mercedes Paz  6-1, 6-1 and the fourth-seeded Sabatini eliminated Regina Rajchrtova 6-0, 6-1.  </P></p>

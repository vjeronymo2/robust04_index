			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Technology (Eagle Eye): The lines stay 'open' - How AT&amp;T and NCR will fuse their products after this week's merger NCR's marketing slogan 'Open, Co-operative Computing' rings with irony as its executives begin the painful task of combining the proud old company's operations with those of AT&amp;T. Since AT&amp;T launched its hostile bid to acquire NCR last December, the computer company has been anything but co-operative. NCR's support for 'open systems' proved to be the fatal attraction. The AT&amp;T takeover 'is a fact of life', Charles Exley, NCR chief executive, conceded earlier this week. His lack of enthusiasm was hardly surprising after months of battling AT&amp;T to maintain NCR's independence. Exley had been masterminding a transformation of NCR. Last year the company launched a bold move into open systems based upon industry standards including Unix, the AT&amp;T computer operating system, and Intel's microprocessors. It was supposed to breathe new life into what many had come to regard as a tired old-line computer company. NCR launched high-end personal computers and servers. A notebook computer is due next month. The company is also developing mainframe-performance computers in a joint venture with Teradata, a California maker of 'massively parallel' computers. The strategy began to pay off. But just as NCR was beginning to capture the attention of new customers it also caught the eye of AT&amp;T. After years of failing to fulfil its dream of combining telecommunications and computer technology to become a dominant player in the market for networked computers, AT&amp;T was ready to try a new tack. AT&amp;T's strength is that it owns the world's largest long-distance telephone network. The company has long believed that its growth lies in exploiting that network to carry computer data. 'Networked computing is growing more than three times faster than the computer industry as a whole,' Robert Allen, AT&amp;T chairman, said recently. 'Today the world does 50bn electronic transactions a year. By 1995 that's expected to quadruple to 200bn. Leadership in telecommunications alone will no longer be enough.' Allen's logic is faultless. NCR's product strategy has been widely applauded. Drawing the two together will, however, be a challenge. The majority of technology mergers have failed to live up to expectations. The current struggles of Unisys, formed by the merger of Sperry and Burroughs, are testimony to the fact that computer industry visionaries frequently have blind spots. Combining the product lines of AT&amp;T's computer operations and NCR will be made simpler by the fact that both were pursuing 'open sys-tems' strategies. There is plenty of sorting out to be done, however. AT&amp;T, for example, currently sells personal computers built by Intel and high-end multiprocessor systems supplied by Pyramid Technology in addition to its own computers. Pyramid expects to maintain or even expand its business with AT&amp;T in the wake of the NCR acquisition. Industry analysts agree that the Pyramid products will provide the combined companies with a high-performance product that NCR currently lacks. Intel is in a more precarious position. Its personal computer sales to AT&amp;T could be jeopardised by the merger because NCR makes its own PCs. Overall, however, Intel stands to gain since NCR's entire product line is based upon Intel microprocessors. Within the computer industry many question whether AT&amp;T can smoothly execute the merger with NCR. The months of bitterness surrounding the takeover bid will not make the process any easier. Although Exley this week claimed to have a hard time remembering the 'combative stage' of the takeover process, many of NCR's employees who entered into the spirit of the fight have not forgotten. Who you gonna call when your personal computer network goes down? Is it a hardware or a software problem? Whose software? Whose hardware? Open systems standards that enable different manufacturers' computer equipment to work together have many advantages. One drawback is that it has become more difficult for users to get support services from a group of vendors who point fingers at each other when something goes wrong. To address the issue, a group of leading US computer and software companies have formed a combined technical support alliance (TSA) to co-ordinate support for multivendor computing environments. The TSA members include Apple, Borland, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NetFRAME, Novell, Oracle, Ungermann-Bass and 3Com. These companies will co-operate to ensure that their service staffs are trained to understand other member's products so that they can offer users a comprehensive solution to problems. 'Our customers want the flexibility to choose products from many different vendors, along with the assurance that we vendors are co-operating to support them. Although most of us have been working together already, TSA formally offers our customers the assurance that we will all co-operate on support issues,' said Darrell Miller, Novell executive vice president. In theory it should be easy to send data from one personal computer to another via a phone line. Theory and practice collide when we 'road warriors' check into a hotel and try to hook up our laptop or notebook PCs to the phone. Recognising this problem, the Association for Computer Training and Support (Acts), an international mix of corporate computer trainers and computer managers, has challenged hotels in the US to make their phone systems 'computer friendly' by the end of 1992. 'More than 1.3m laptop computers were purchased in 1990,' said Elliott Masie, director of Acts. A large percentage of these are used by business travellers, yet fewer than 40 per cent of hotel rooms in the US are 'modem ready' says the group. In Europe the percentage is much lower. Computer Products Plus, of Huntington Beach, California, offers a 'road warrior's toolkit' - a bag of tricks including crocodile clips, screwdriver, a magnifying glass and a device designed to circumvent hotel switchboards.</p>

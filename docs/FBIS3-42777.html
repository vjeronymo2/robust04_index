Abdulatipov, first deputy minister of </F> nationality affairs and regional policy and deputy chairman of  the Federation Council, by Yelena Dikun, under the rubric  "Reputation"; place and date not given: "Ramazan Abdulatipov: `I  Am Sincere and Direct'"]    [Text] Ramazan Abdulatipov has become famous as a  politician who stays afloat under all regimes. On this score he  is considered to be a worthy successor to the legendary,  "unsinkable" Anastas Ivanovich Mikoyan. This former chairman of  the Soviet of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian  Federation (and prior to this, an executive official of the CPSU  Central Committee) is still in the saddle while most of  Abdulatipov's old comrades-in-arms from the parliament failed to  hang on at the rough turns of history: Some ended up in prison,  others are in disgrace. He is now first deputy minister of  nationality affairs and regional policy of the Russian  Federation and deputy chairman of the Federation Council. In the  words of Ramazan Gadzhimuratovich himself, the secret of his  long political life is quite simple.    [Abdulatipov] I have a principle: The higher I rise in my  life, the more resolutely I give up displays of personal  ambitions. As a politician I just do not have the right to show  my hatred or even dislike toward someone; I must remember at all  times that there are 300,000 voters standing behind me, as was  the case in the old parliament, or as now the entire Dagestan  is, and that any sharp word or action of mine will ricochet and  hit them. I felt this particularly acutely after I signed in  1991 the statement of the "six," in which we warned that Boris  Nikolayevich was inclined toward authoritarianism and incapable  of collective work, and that a handful of courtiers held sway  rather than the Supreme Soviet. To this day I believe that this  statement was timely, and had both sides pondered it calmly, the  one criticizing and the one criticized, the subsequent  confrontation could have been avoided. However, my presentation  at the time infringed on the interests of voters in a way.  Following this, I began to behave in a more restrained manner,  mindful that specific people stand behind me.    There is one more aspect: I have endeavored not to allow  myself a single insulting attack that would be an affront to the  honor and dignity of my political opponents, no matter what my  attitude toward those opponents is. I remember well how hard it  was for my relatives when mud was slung at me right and left  after the statement of the "six." Since then, as I talk to my  opponent I always imagine his circle of loved ones standing  behind him.    Besides, I am a straightforward person. It is not the  tradition of our people to settle accounts behind each other's  backs. I usually express my doubts about someone's behavior and  refine positions to the person's face and, as a rule, due to  this I manage to find a common language with that person.  Therefore, the phenomenon of my "unsinkability" is explained  primarily by the fact that life compelled me to become a  centrist.    [Dikun] In addition to the action of the "six," you took  part  in creating Skokov's Accord for the Motherland committee, which  was likewise of an anti-Yeltsin persuasion. You stayed in the  White House until the end. Moreover, at a conference of the  components of the Federation you expressed the point of view of  the rebellious parliament quite definitively. What did the  president forgive all your sins for?    [Abdulatipov] If we were to use your terminology,  "forgiveness" was, apparently, granted for the same reason--my  criticism is sincere and direct, I do not weave a web of  clandestine intrigues. On a human level, I like Yeltsin; his  direct approach is somehow akin to that of a mountaineer,  although I disagree with his political course on many points.    The hadith [prophetic tradition] of the Prophet Muhammad  says: "Beware of the ignorant." I have always viewed  manifestations of all extremes as a sign of ignorance. If we  sort this out, there were no irreconcilable differences between  the economic and political approaches of the representative and  executive authorities. Much is explained by the struggle for  access to the president. At certain stages, Rutskoy and  Khasbulatov were among Yeltsin's closest entourage, but  subsequently this space was occupied by other people, and the  most elementary human jealousy became a factor. The tragedy of  the situation was in the fact that the people at the very "top"  were unable to "arrange" their ambitions according to rank and  subdue their pride.    As far as I was concerned, all my criticism of the president  notwithstanding, I was prepared to cooperate with him in the  interests of Russia. Thus, on the eve of the Seventh Congress I  brought my entire chamber to him in the Kremlin in search of an  accord. I was later berated for this in the Supreme Soviet: You  went and bowed down to the president, they said; why did you not  summon him to the White House? I answered: "He is older than I  and, according to our customs, I must go to him."    During the days of the October events I did not conduct  negotiations about who would surrender to whom or about our  readiness to confess--not at the conference of Federation  components in St. Petersburg, not in the Constitutional Court,  not at the Monastery of St. Daniel. The discussion was about  eliminating the extremes on both sides, about saving the  parliament and the president in the existing situation. Alas....    [Dikun] After the dispersal of the parliament you went into  state service--you became Shakhray's first deputy in the State  Committee for Federation and Nationality Affairs (now it is the  Ministry for Nationality Affairs and Regional Policy--OBSHCHAYA  GAZETA). Do you intend to pursue the course of the parliament on  the nationality issue within that establishment?    [Abdulatipov] I have always believed that we have created  many hotbeds of ethnic conflicts with our own hands. I have  repeatedly told Yavlinskiy and Gaydar that in this enormous  country there may not be a single model for transition to a  market economy. Dozens of versions adapted to local conditions  are needed--the Dagestani model, the Khakass model, and so on.  Meanwhile, the economic reform was built on purely a party  approach: A Gosplan [State Planning Committee] concept of who is  to develop which way was issued from Moscow. As a result, all  the republics began to climb out on their own. Failing to see a  niche for itself in the reform, Tatarstan stepped aside and  began to pursue its own policy; Chechnya began to distance  itself from Russia because of helplessness.    At this point people are only aware of failures. Meanwhile,  we in the Soviet of Nationalities succeeded in averting a war on  Moscow, which was actually declared by autonomous okrugs and  oblasts, by signing the Federation Treaty with them. We have  stopped the secession of many republics from the Russian  Federation, including Yakutia and Bashkortostan.    Incidentally, when unrest began in North Caucasus,  Shelov-Kovedyayev, Poltoranin, Medvedev, and Khasbulatov went to  Chechnya. I went with my group to Kabardino-Balkaria, where the  situation was no better. As a result of negotiations and  consultations with national movements, we succeeded in bringing  back the government, scheduling new elections, and averting a  split of the autonomous entity into two republics. In Chechnya,  they took a revolutionary path, and the result of this is known.  Right then I wrote to Yeltsin and Khasbulatov that it was not  possible to proceed from the principle of revolutionary  feasibility in relations with the republics. We wanted to take  the "August revolution" from the White House "to the farthest  outlying areas," and this would end badly.    [Dikun] They say that you had an arrangement with Shumeyko  about the distribution of positions on the Federation Council:  You ensure votes for him during the election of the speaker, and  he ensures for you, as a reward, the position of his deputy. For  this reason, you argued before the deputies in favor of voting  for the candidacy of Vladimir Filippovich.    [Abdulatipov] We had a somewhat different arrangement, and  it  was not with Shumeyko. The leaders of most republics and  representatives of some autonomous entities, krays, and oblasts  met in my office shortly before the beginning of the proceedings  of the Federation Council. I was the first one to be nominated  as a candidate for the position of speaker at this conference,  but I warned right away that I would not go for the position of  chairman. First, I was not morally prepared for this; second, I  was afraid that now, when the anti-Caucasus card is being  played, it will be hard for people to see Abdulatipov's human  face behind the "person of Caucasian nationality" right away.  Subsequently, the candidacy of Viktor Stepanov, chairman of the  Supreme Soviet of Karelia, was discussed, but he also declined  because he was running in the presidential elections in his  republic. The candidacy of Spiridonov, chairman of the Komi  Supreme Soviet, emerged at the last moment, but he also did not  agree to it because he had promised his voters he would work at  home.    In general, an interesting situation emerged in which there  was no one to bet on anymore. At that point I proposed to  support Shumeyko. Some of my friends of a more conservative hue  even took offense at me over this and stopped talking to me. As  far as my "arrangement" with Vladimir Filippovich about becoming  his deputy, long before the elections I had said that I intended  to seek this position no matter who becomes chairman, and asked  the leaders of the republic to support me. There later was such  a conversation with Shumeyko, too. Therefore, this was a play in  the open.</p>

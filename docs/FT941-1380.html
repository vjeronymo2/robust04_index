			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Management: Imagine all the people - Mercury's strategic rethink has become a rallying point for its 10,500 employees Telecommunications used to be about plain old telephones - providing enough of them, making sure they worked, and installing the latest network gadgets to upgrade the connections. Only one organisation did the job in the UK: British Telecommunications - the Post Office as was. Little has changed, surprising as it may seem given all the current hype. Most people still use the telephone line to speak to someone, not to indulge in multimedia wizardry. And after 10 years of supposed competition, the overwhelming majority of people in the UK still subscribe to BT for the service. So what has the competition been up to? A decade ago Mercury, BT's main rival, set out to be 'BT Mark II'. It built a national network from scratch; it boasts a powerful brand name, courtesy of Harry Enfield; and it has had considerable success creaming off business from BT in the City of London. Beyond the City, however, its impact has been patchy. Mercury has only 780,000 residential customers to match BT's 20m. And its ability to continue guaranteeing percentage price savings over BT is bound to come into question as BT's costs and prices tumble. Time for a strategy rethink, perhaps? Mercury itself thinks so, but Mike Harris, the company's youthful chief executive, is going about it in a highly unconventional way. His rethink is engaging all 10,500 Mercury employees in a giant reorientation exercise called 'Imagine 1997'. The idea is simple: Mercury needs to banish the BT Mark II spectre, create a new vision of where it wants to be in three years time, and get there. The key to the exercise is that it should be everyone's vision, not just Mike Harris's. As Peter Roche, head of the independent San Francisco-based consultancy masterminding 'Imagine', puts it: 'Everyone needs to be able to create the vision for themselves if it is to succeed.' 'The' vision, note - not 'their vision'. No one pretends that Mercury can afford 10,500 different visions, or that 'the' vision would have sprung like a genie from their collective imaginations. Harris and his executive team had the vision last year; 'Imagine 1997' is to make everyone else think it was their idea too. The French philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau talked, chillingly, of 'forcing people to be free'; 'Imagine' is a more benign version of freedom forcing. Roche has plenty more slick phrases to describe 'Imagine'. Mercury needs a new 'strategic intent' to replace BT Mark II; now that it has got one, it is in a 'moment of discontinuity' requiring 'continuous change'; that means 'working backwards from the future', engaging employees in a 'network of conversations', of which 'Imagine seminars' are the most important. The status quo is not an option: 'If they work more, longer, harder, better at what they are doing now, they won't realise their objectives.' None of which is particularly new: W. Edwards Deming's celebrated '14 points for Management' long ago paraded the proposition 'that everyone in a company must be put to work to accomplish a firm's transformation'. Whatever Mercury's employees think of all that, they find the 'Imagine' seminars rewarding. Senior staff attend a three-day 'Imagine 1997' seminar, the rest a one-day seminar. The purpose of the seminars is partly to 'imagine' the Mercury of the future, partly to present its leaders as more approachable and open to suggestions than employees had previously imagined. This last aspect appeals particularly strongly. The average age of the company's employees is only 33: Harris is 45, looks younger, and has the perfect bedside manner. He has thrown vast amounts of his own time into the process: about a fifth of his diary has been blocked out for 'Imagine' activities over the past year, much of it leading seminars. Every six weeks he calls together his most senior 150 managers to review progress. Harris's attitude is a refreshing change for an industry mostly led by lifelong engineers or telecoms bureaucrats reared in the monopolistic culture. He made his name setting up First Direct, the telephone bank, and views telecoms like any other consumer industry. 'I can't see a single difference between marketing a bank and marketing a telecoms company,' he says. 'This is an extraordinarily lively place anyway,' he is quick to add. 'Unlike banks, which have traditions going back a hundred years, we are still young and flexible.' But what does Harris imagine will set Mercury apart from BT by 1997? Distilled, the new vision amounts to a series of slogans: 'taking a leadership position in the industry as it emerges in 1997'; 'multimedia', 'open networks', 'intelligent services' - 'differentiation on services not just price'. As Mercury put it to the House of Commons trade and industry committee earlier this week: 'Our strategy is to lead the UK development of the multimedia industry.' Since BT mouths identical slogans and objectives, 'Imagine' is hardly an escape from BT Mark II. Harris insists, however, that the process has generated a fierce determination to be free of BT's shackles, one result of which is an ambitious project to build radio local networks for fixed phones. If they work at the required quality - a big 'if' - Mercury will be able to deliver its calls by-passing BT entirely. BT Mark II or not, it does not undercut the value of 'Imagine' as a tool for employee motivation. For remember Roche's definition of power: the velocity with which you realise your intentions.</p>

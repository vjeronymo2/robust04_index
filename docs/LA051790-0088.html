			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN GARDENER'S SLAYING  </P> <P> A transient accused of beating to death a Glendale gardener pleaded not guilty  last week to a murder charge and was ordered to undergo a blood test.  </P> <P> Christopher Pinedo, 28, will return to court June 5 for a preliminary hearing.  </P> <P> If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison.  </P> <P> The body of Jimmy Noda, 67, was discovered April 5 in Noda's Glendale home  after police found his bloodstained car abandoned outside a Denny's restaurant  in North Hollywood. When Pinedo was arrested, he had a deep cut on his hand,  police said.  </P> <P> Authorities said they were uncertain how Noda and Pinedo met. Pinedo admitted  to police that he had beaten Noda, but said he left while the gardener was  still alive and denied killing him, Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Pargament said.  </P> <P> Pinedo was arrested April 28 in Studio City after he jaywalked in front of two  Los Angeles police officers, who matched him to a composite drawing of a murder  suspect that they had seen that morning.  </P></p>

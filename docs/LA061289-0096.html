			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MEA CULPA DEPT.: A reader whose knowledge of art is equalled by her gracious  way of righting wrongs called to say that in Matisse's painting, "Dejeuner sur  l'herbe," the nude is on the left, just as depicted in Mark Turnbull's musical,  "Manet," at Laguna Playhouse. I had remembered it the other way around, and had  the misfortune to check a reference book in which the photo was reversed,  confirming my error. So "Manet" gets an A-plus for accuracy!  </P></p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Legal battle over loans TWO repossession cases, expected to reach court by the end of this month, are to be contested using a previously untried defence. The lender in the cases, believed to be National Home Loans, is seeking to recover properties on which the deferred interest mortgages it granted fell into arrears. Trethowans of Salisbury, the legal firm representing the borrowers, intends to claim that the mortgages cannot be enforced because the deferred interest element in effect constituted a separate loan which should have been subject to the Consumer Credit Act. Paul McDonnell-Staff, an Australian lawyer acting as consultant to Trethowans on these and other similar cases, said lenders generally claimed mortgages were exempt from the act under section 16 and various statutory instruments. But section 16 was notoriously complicated and difficult to interpret. 'In our view, it is limited to money loaned for the purpose of buying land and buildings or for home improvements,' he explained, 'We say you cannot apply that to cover a general purpose loan, which is what deferred interest mortgages often were.' McDonnell-Staff said Trethowans already had filed defences on this basis in about 20 county court cases involving home income plans where the deferred interest loans had been used to buy investment bonds. None has yet come to full trial, but he said many other solicitors and barristers had contacted the firm to support its view, and added: 'If we are successful in using this defence, it will open Pandora's box.' He forecast that people who had been struggling to keep up payments on deferred interest mortgages might stop doing so if they saw a legally viable exit. Because deferred interest mortgages were marketed most heavily late in the 1980s, many borrowers faced a steep rise in interest rates - sometimes, a doubling - after the period of deferment, typically five years. They also saw the market value of their property drop just when rolled-up interest increased their debt. Centralised lenders - of which National Home Loans is one - and smaller building societies were the main sources of deferred interest loans. At NHL, where about 15 per cent of mortgages are deferred interest, spokesman James Fuller said the company was aware of the cases. 'It would not be appropriate to say anything at the moment,' he added. At Mortgage Express, a spokesman said the company was quite comfortable with its position on deferred interest loans but would not reveal what percentage of its total book they represented. At UCB Home Loans, marketing director Roy Battison said that up to half the company's Pounds 3bn mortgage book was in deferred rate lending. 'We are probably one of the biggest in the market for that sort of thing,' he said, 'But we have not been challenged and don't perceive we would have a problem if we were,'</p>

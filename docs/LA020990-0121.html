			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2ND INSPECTION OF CLIFF EXTENDS ROAD CLOSURE  </P> <P> The discovery Thursday of crevices "large enough to fit a man inside" in cliffs  overlooking El Camino Real means that a stretch of the road will now be closed  for weeks rather than days.  </P> <P> The state Coastal Commission on Thursday granted an emergency permit to repair  the cliffs, where serious erosion was recently discovered between Avenida Pico  and Camino Capistrano. City officials, who originally predicted that work could  be finished and the highway reopened by the weekend, found the instability more  serious than was first supposed, City Manager Michael W. Parness said.  </P> <P> "When I went to look at the bluff, it was alarming," Parness said. "Below, the  rocks look flush, but on top you can see daylight between tons of rock and  earth."  </P> <P> City workers noticed the trouble on Sunday. Crews sent to remove rubble on the  highway after weekend rains saw that the bluffs above looked unstable.  </P> <P> An engineer hired by the city visited the site the next day and presented  Parness with evidence that the cliffs were unsound. The city manager closed the  mile-long stretch of highway at 7 p.m. Monday.  </P> <P> Closer inspection of the bluffs also found that they are riddled with rodent  holes, City Engineer William Cameron are.  </P> <P> The city plans to make the cliffs safe by breaking up the unstable chunks of  rock and earth, some as large as 75 feet across, into smaller pieces, Cameron  said.  </P> <P> However, the bluffs were so unstable that engineers were reluctant to bring in  heavy machinery, he added.  </P> <P> "The deterioration of the bluffs came quickly, with the rains coming after all  the dry weather we've been having," Parness said.  </P> <P> The city is negotiating with several contractors to find one with the best  equipment to do the job, Parness said.  </P> <P> The bluffs are part of a 250-acre section of undeveloped land owned by the Lusk  Co. of Irvine, which is working with the city to stabilize the area.  </P> <P> Cameron said he would "expect the city's finances to be impacted minimally."  </P> <P> San Clemente police are stationed on both sides of the roadblock and are  admitting only residents of a mobile home park located on the closed highway.  </P> <P> The closure has snarled traffic at the Avenida Palizada and Avenida Pico exits  of Interstate 5, as drivers seek alternate routes. In addition, drivers exiting  Avenida Pico confront construction work being done on ramps, and a wait of up  to 10 minutes at nearby traffic signals.  </P> <P> "The last couple of days, people have been coming in here steaming," said John  Webright, manager of Aaron Brothers art supply store at 416 Avenida Pico. "It's  pretty much congested all day."  </P> <P> The closure was the latest in a series that have plagued the coastal community  in recent years. The latest occurred in April, when 2,000 cubic yards of mud  and rock tumbled onto the highway after a rain. Three cliff-top homes lost part  of the their yards in the landslide.  </P></p>

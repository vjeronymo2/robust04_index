"Initially, I am thinking of discussing files with the  presidents and vice presidents of the Chamber and Senate  national defense committees, which also include opposition  members," he essentially affirmed during a press interview.    "It is a question of explaining a posteriori the reasons for  deciding to purchase this or that equipment rather than other  equipment," a close associate of the minister explained.    "If this initiative proves positive, Mr. Delcroix envisages  further involving Parliament in discussions," he added.    "This must be a step in the right direction," added Mr.  Delcroix, who denied that he was acting out of opportunism, a  reference to certain military purchases -- including Agusta  helicopters for the army -- which are the subject of a  parliamentary committee of enquiry.    "But we must not go too far," added the minister, apparently  excluding the setting up of a subcommittee charged with military  purchases, similar to that which exists in the United States and  the Netherlands.</p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AUDREY HEPBURN BRINGS RAY OF HOPE TO VIETNAM  </P> <P> Audrey Hepburn traveled to a remote, mountainous area of Vietnam this month to  raise funds for poor children and help forge a kinder image of this isolated  communist country.  </P> <P> Hepburn, who has worked since 1988 as a "goodwill ambassador" for UNICEF, said  she wanted to remind people in the West that Vietnam was a country, not just a  war.  </P> <P> "I would like to give a much more accessible, human picture of Vietnam than  just the Vietnam War. It's a ghost that has to be laid" to rest, she said.  </P> <P> Hepburn flew in a Vietnamese helicopter to the remote northeastern village of  Mo Vang in Hoang Lien Son province near the Chinese border early this month to  visit ethnic minorities who are among Vietnam's poorest people.  </P> <P> She stopped at a simple wooden health clinic tucked in among rugged green  mountains. The clinic was staffed by Vietnamese health workers trained and  equipped by UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund.  </P> <P> They test people for malaria and treat others for goiter, an enlargement of the  thyroid gland caused by iodine deficiency that produces a large swelling in the  throat.  </P> <P> Ten million of Vietnam's 65 million people live in mountainous areas. The  iodine deficiency disorder affects 35% of highland people because iodine is  lacking in the soil, plants and animals.  </P> <P> The disorder causes cretinism or mental retardation among 2% of the 2 million  people in the most remote mountain areas.  </P> <P> Few Westerners get to visit Vietnam's far-flung ethnic minority areas. At one  point, village women in a thatched house on stilts swarmed around Hepburn to  dress her in a colorful skirt and blouse of the Tay minority.  </P> <P> Hundreds of chattering village women then bustled along behind the sprightly  61-year-old actress.  </P> <P> Sixty percent of the people in Mo Vang suffer from goiter, one of the highest  rates in the country, a UNICEF officer said. Several elderly retarded people,  stricken by the disorder, sat staring from their thatched huts.  </P> <P> The UNICEF officer, Jean Dricot, said malaria was the main killer of children  and pregnant women in the area.  </P> <P> Hepburn made a brief reference to a U.S. trade embargo that has denied Vietnam  bilateral American trade and aid, as well as funds from international lending  bodies and technology and investment from many Western countries.  </P> <P> "I'm not in the business of politics. I'm in the business of children," she  said. "This country needs not just to be opened up (from sanctions), but  knowledge-wise."  </P> <P> Otherwise, she said, "this generation of children will go down hill."  </P></p>

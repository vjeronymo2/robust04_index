			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY URGED TO ACCEPT SETTLEMENT ON OLIVE  VIEW  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Claims Board on Monday recommended that the county  accept a $3-million settlement from two firms for alleged defects in their  design of the Olive View Medical Center.  </P> <P> The county filed suit against four firms in 1986 after officials learned that  the almost-completed medical center in Sylmar was plagued with design problems  that delayed its opening for nearly a year.  </P> <P> The total county cost to correct the design flaws in the sophisticated air  exhaust and plumbing systems totaled $4.8 million, said Nancy Singer, who  chairs the claims board, a panel that reviews lawsuit settlements. The county's  settlement with Syska &amp; Hennessey Inc. and Welton Becket Associates Inc.  was reached after a Superior Court judge strongly recommended in October that  the county accept the $3-million offer.  </P> <P> Singer did not know the status of settlement negotiations with the two  remaining defendants, Design Joint Venture and Luckman Partnership Inc.  </P></p>

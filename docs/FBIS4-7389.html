			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tieu Van: "In the First Quarter of 1994, 60 Cases </F> of Corruption and Bribery Causing Losses of 3.677 Billion Dong  Have Been Discovered]    [Text] According to the report of Interior Minister Bui  Thien Ngo, during the first few months of 1994, 60 cases of  corruption and bribery causing losses totalling 3.677 billion  dong have been discovered. In comparison with the last quarter  of 1993, this is a decrease of 27 percent in the number of  cases. Of these cases, five have resulted in the conviction of  11 accused persons, one of them getting a life sentence.    The different forms of corruption and bribery activities  mainly include: intentional violation of budgetary transaction  procedures, keeping funds without bookkeeping documents,  improper expenditure, and violation of income and expenditure  principles. Typical of these offenses are the cases of the Lam  Dong Tea Company, with 1.4 billion dong involved, and the  Company of the Trade Union of the Metallurgy Sector, with 1.8  billion dong. There were also cases of violation of the  regulations on building construction (in the bidding process,  capital allocation, use of capital, and cost of materials),  obtaining property by deception, illegal sales, setting prices  contrary to principles, and spending land fees improperly.    Though the number of discovered cases has been reduced in  comparison with the same period last year, the corruption  situation is still very complicated. The tasks of investigation  and discovery still lack concentration, even though some  progress has been made. The handling process is still sluggish.  The practice of bribing to get construction capital and  licenses for joint ventures is still beyond the scope of the  investigation work. The practices of receiving bribes,  embezzling state property, using public property as presents to  solicit favors, and so forth are still rampant. At many places,  government directives on antiwaste and thrift practice have been  ignored or poorly performed.    The Interior Ministry recently held a meeting to discuss  measures to overcome the tardy progress of the anticorruption  activities, and to further push the campaign to suppress and  prevent corruption.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / South will gain from business rates shift THE BURDEN of business rates is set to shift away from the south-east towards the Midlands and the north following the 1995 rating revaluation, which will be based on rental values at the start of this month. The rates bills of offices in the City of London could more than halve while those in the west Midlands could rise by 58 per cent, according to Gerald Eve, chartered surveyors. Overall, the rates bills of office users may fall by an average of 19 per cent. Retailers are likely to see an overall average increase of 6 per cent, ranging from a decline in central London of about 15 per cent to an increase of 20 per cent in the Midlands and the north. Industrial occupiers may be faced with an increased rates bill of 16 per cent, ranging from a 7 per cent increase in the south-east to a 32 per cent increase in the west Midlands. The revaluation could save the occupier of a 100,000 sq ft City office block about Pounds 1m a year, while the rates payable on a 100,000 sq ft Leeds factory might rise by about Pounds 30,000. These large variations reflect the disparate performances of different regions and different sectors of the property market. While central London office rents were approaching their peak in April 1988, much of the country experienced steep rent increases that year and the next. The shift in the rates burden is much smaller than in the last revaluation of 1990, the first for 17 years, which was based on rental values in 1988. That redistributed the cost of rates from the north to the south and from factories and warehouses towards office and retail property. In England and Wales the uniform business rate raised about Pounds 13.7bn in the 12 months to this April. The Inland Revenue's valuation office bases its rates assessments on information provided by occupiers about their buildings and leases. It will shortly be despatching forms requesting information to occupiers. The average increase in rateable value in 1995 will be 30 per cent, according to Gerald Eve.</p>

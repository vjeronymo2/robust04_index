			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov] </F>   [Text] Almaty, 13 Jun -- A general strike in protest at the  uncontrolled increase in fuel prices, which is causing  production cutbacks, could be unleashed in Kazakhstan.  Enterprises in the Republic's mining and metallurgical sector  are in the worst trouble. The staff of these enterprises are  being sent en masse on vacations for an indefinite period and,  moreover, many have to go without vacation payments being made.  The threat of unemployment is hanging over tens of thousands of  blue- and white-collar staff in the East Kazakhstan Oblast.    Attempts made by the trade unions to persuade the government  to set discount tariffs on the use of energy holders for  fuel-intensive industries have come to nothing. At present  energy holders have reached 70 percent of the cost prices in the  production of titanium, zinc, lead, and other commodities. This  has forced the enterprises to set prices for their goods at  levels that are higher than world prices.    According to the trade union leader, Kazbek Valiyev, the  working people have appealed to the president and the Supreme  Council to dismiss the Republic's government.    The collectives of the oblast's enterprises, who have  already  set up strike committees, have no intention of retracting from  the demands they have put forward. If the expected changes do  not occur in the next few days, they intend to put forward an  initiative for the staging of an all-republican protest strike.    Such an appeal could be upheld in the Republic where, at  present, 1200 enterprises are standing idle.</p>

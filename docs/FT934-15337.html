			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Regional US banks merge in Dollars 125m deal FLEET Financial, New England's biggest banking group, said yesterday it would pay Dollars 125m in stock to acquire Sterling Bancshares of Massachusetts. The announcement comes just two weeks after Fleet's share price rose sharply amid talk that it would be taken over by an even bigger regional bank, NationsBank of North Carolina. The acquisition of Sterling, however, is not regarded as a defensive manoeuvre to discourage NationsBank from launching a bid. The Fleet-Sterling deal is the third regional banking merger unveiled in the last month, which suggests that a new round of consolidation in the US banking industry is under way. Last month, the second and third largest banks in Wisconsin, Marshall &amp; Illsley and Valley Bancorp, announced they would merge in a transaction valued at almost Dollars 1bn. On October 5, Keycorp and Society Corporation, two banks with operations in several states, unveiled a merger that will create the 10th largest bank in the US with assets of Dollars 58bn. Sterling has assets of almost Dollars 1bn and operates 13 banking offices in Massachusetts, which will be added to Fleet's 155 branches in the state. Fleet's chairman and chief executive Mr Terrence Murray said the acquisition would allow it to expand its middle-market corporate lending, consumer services and investment services businesses in the region. Under the terms of the deal, which has yet to be approved by Sterling's shareholders and banking authorities, Fleet will offer 1.1575 of its own shares for every Sterling share, which are valued at Dollars 39.50 each. News of the acquisition lifted Sterling's stock Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 36 1/4 on the over-the-counter Nasdaq market. Fleet's shares eased Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 34 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

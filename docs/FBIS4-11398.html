			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Subparagraph lettering as published] </F>   [Text] The Council of Ministers approved on 20 April the  first three new laws contemplated under the Special Powers Act.    Central Information Office (OCI) Director Guillermo Alvarez  Bajares made the announcement at the conclusion of the Council  meeting, saying that reforms to the law on bids for public  projects and services, the budget law, and the law on taxes on  bank debits had been approved.    Regarding the law on taxes on bank debits, Alvarez Bajares  said the tax will be charged only to those who issue checks or  other documents against their assets held at any of the  country's financial institutions; in other words, the person who  receives the check will not have to pay a tax.    The OCI director added that the tax collection system will  be  quite simple since all financial institutions already have their  own control procedures in place to allow rapid supervision of  the taxes collected.    The tax on bank debits will be implemented on 2 May through  31 December. The government estimates that it will collect  approximately 100 million bolivares during that time. Likewise,  the 0.75 percent tax will be levied on all Caracas Stock  Exchange operations with the understanding that only the first  check of each operation will be taxed.    The other two laws approved by the Council of Ministers  include reforms to the budget law and the law regulating bids  for public projects and services, which will go into effect once  published in the official gazette.    Following is the full text of the decree-law establishing  the  bank debit tax on accounts at the country's financial  institutions.    Rafael Caldera, president of the Republic    In full use of the powers conferred by Paragraph 8, Article  190 of the Constitution, and in accordance with what is  established in No. 4, Article 1 of the Basic Law authorizing  the president of the Republic to adopt extraordinary measures  related to economic and financial issues during the Council of  Ministers;    Mandates with rank and force of law:  <H5>  Decree Establishing a Tax on Debits to Accounts Held With </H5> Financial Institutions    Article 1. A tax is hereby levied on all individuals, legal  entities, communities, societies, or corporations which, as a  result of being account holders, authorize fund withdrawals or  other debits from their respective checking or savings accounts,  deposits in custody as liquid assets, or any other type of  demand deposits, fiduciary funds, or other financial market  assets. The tax will apply to the issuance of cashiers checks or  any other type of operation by any financial institution  regulated by the General Banking and Financial Law, by the  National System of Savings and Loan Law, by the Central Bank  Law, and by the other special laws regulating banks and credit  institutions.    The general rate of this tax shall be zero point  seventy-five  percent (0.75 percent).    Article 2. The tax base is configured and therefore stems  from the obligation to pay the tax when a debit or withdrawal  from any of the accounts, deposits, or funds referred to in the  preceding article is made or when a cashier's check is issued.    Article 3. The payment or liquidation made by financial  institutions on behalf of third parties regarding credit,  rights, or assets represents the tax base, provided such  payments have not been made to the beneficiary in checking or  savings accounts or in cash deposits.    Article 4. The obligation to pay the tax will prevail even  if  the recording of the debit entails the cancellation of the  corresponding account, in which case such cancellation can be  made only after the corresponding tax is paid.    Article 5. Financial investments of any kind can be made  only by way of debits from the accounts or deposits of the  investment holder.    Proceeds from the sale, transfer, or renewal of financial  investments referred to in this article, as well as of assets  involving loans granted by financial institutions, must be paid  exclusively to the beneficiary with a nonendorsable check or  credited to his account.    Article 6. The taxable income will consist of the gross  debit  or taxable transaction prior to the deduction of commissions or  expenses, regardless of their nature.    The taxable income of transactions carried out by the stock  exchange will be made up exclusively of security shares [titulos  valores] offered to the public and issued in accordance with the  Law on Market Capitals, Basic Law on Public Credit, and Basic  Law of the Central Bank of Venezuela, as the case may be.    Article 7. Stock markets and stockbrokers, in keeping with  controls imposed by this decree, must keep special files on all  transactions made by investors.    Article 8. The responsible institutions must register as a  debit the tax produced [impuesto causado] by virtue of this  decree. They will transfer it to a National Treasury account  that will be opened at the Central Bank of Venezuela on the  first banking day following the day when a debit is made to the  taxpayer's account through forms that tax authorities will edit  or authorize for this purpose.    Article 9. Financial institutions are responsible for the  obligations imposed by this decree. Thus, such institutions must  pay the taxes that taxpayers fail to pay in any taxable  transaction for which they serve as intermediary.    Article 10. For the purpose of this decree only, the holders  of accounts, deposits, funds, and other assets specified in  Article 1 must pay the taxes established by it for the  endorsement or transfer of checks or securities that are  representative of taxable operations starting with the second  endorsement or transfer, inclusive. Taxpayers may indicate  "nonendorsable" or "endorsable only once" on the reverse of  securities.    In the case of transactions made through the stock market,  the tax will be applied only to the first purchase for the  corresponding title.    Article 11. The following will be exempt from payment of  this  tax:    a) The Republic, states, municipalities, Central Bank of  Venezuela, Venezuelan Investment Fund, National Savings and  Loans Bank, autonomous institutions, education institutions duly  registered and authorized by the Education Ministry, and public  and private universities.    b) Debits that result from cash reserve accounts held in  the Central Bank of Venezuela.    c) Transactions between the National Savings and Loans  Bank and savings and loans organizations.    d) Transactions between the Central Bank of Venezuela and  Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation and its affiliates.    e) Debits to accounts caused by the payment of the tax  established in this decree.    f) Debits on checking or savings accounts, ready cash  funds, and other cash deposit accounts that are accredited  indistinctly to an account of the same nature, to the same  account holders, and at the same financial institutions.    This exemption does not apply to accounts that are  transferable, either jointly or separately, by individuals and  established by more than two account holders. It is also not  applicable to any account transferable by more than one legal  entity.    i) The issuance of cashiers checks to be applied to an  operation that has generated and paid the tax established in  this decree.    i) Transactions carried out on the interbanking market  that have terms of less than five consecutive days.    Article 12. The tax administration will dictate the required  norms and procedures and impart the administrative instructions  necessary to implement, collect, control, inspect, and prompt  compliance with the tax established in this decree.    This exemption is not applicable to consulates and honorary  consuls.    h) Debits corresponding to entries and corrections  [asientos y reversos] due to material errors or annulment of  operations previously accredited to the account.    g) Debits on checking accounts of diplomatic or consular  missions, international organization representations, and their  foreign officials accredited in Venezuela.    Article 13. This decree will go into effect on 2 May 1994  and will remain in effect until 31 December 1994.    Issued in Caracas on 20 April 1994    184th Year of Independence and 135th Year of the  Federation.    Rafael Caldera    Approved</p>

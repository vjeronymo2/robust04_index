			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Spanish Bonds: Socialist victory keeps dealers bullish for now ONE month ahead of the Pamplona bull-running fiesta that Ernest Hemingway put on the map, the Spanish government bond market bulls are already out in force. Government bonds have leapt forward on the news of Mr Felipe Gonzalez's re-election. As the market sees it, he stands for a strong commitment to the ERM. And although he was short of a majority, the parliamentary shortfall means that Catalan nationalists, with all their alleged fiscal probity, will shore up the new government. The rally finally flattened the yield curve and brought the long bond down by more than 20 points to below 10.80, with just a 65-basis point margin over the three-year bond. Earlier this year the differential had been at least one percentage point. It looked like good news all the way. Pragmatic politicians were in place, the currency risk was fading, and interest rates would fall at a reasonable pace. The pre-election alternative had been the inexperienced right-wing opposition party gaining power, cutting rates and possibly suspending ERM membership. The market felt there was now room for Spanish rates to ease in the wake of German cuts. Bank of Spain governor Mr Luis Angel Rojo fuelled the feel-food factor by saying the peseta was back on the track of being linked into Germany. It is likely investors will be reassured about currency stability over the summer as Spain's tourism industry, powered by three devaluations since September, begins to make a significant impact on the current account deficit. But that is possibly as far as the good news goes. More cautious analysts believe the rally could hit a wall well before September. There are already signs of nervousness over the apparent inability of President Gonzalez to secure quickly his victory of a week ago. The market does not like squabbles in Mr Gonzalez's socialist party over whether the Catalans should be invited into the government or not. Nor does it like similar quarrels among the Catalans about whether any invitations should be accepted. Should the political imponderables resolve themselves, the crunch is likely to come after September, when the markets start looking at inflation, unemployment, and the budget deficit. The May inflation figure published today is expected to show a year-on-year figure unchanged at 4.6 per cent and underlying inflation unchanged at 5.8. In June, when the latest devaluation works through to prices, inflation could start to climb and most bets are on a year-end figure of almost 5 per cent. Unemployment could look increasingly grim as the economy enters the fourth quarter. Last month registered unemployed fell by less than 1 per cent, the lowest May fall for 10 years, to stand at 16.3 per cent of the working population. The budget deficit - 4.4 per cent of GDP according to the government and nearer 6 per cent according to the conservative opposition - could be another headache. If Mr Gonzalez was unable to reduce deficits effectively in the past, when he had a strong majority and the economy was growing, how, economists might ask, will he rein in spending in the middle of a recession and at the head of a coalition government. It could well be that the rate cuts, should they occur, will not look so impressive in three months. Even if there are significant German cuts, Spanish rates are unlikely to fall below 9 per cent, and real interest rates will remain at around 4 per cent. That scenario suggests there could be renewed speculative attacks on the peseta in September. The difference this time will be that the peseta might not be able to avoid following the route of the pound and the lira.</p>

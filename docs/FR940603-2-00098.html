			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Migratory birds listed in treaties with Great Britain (Canada), Mexico, Japan, and the former Soviet Union are protected and activities involving them are regulated in the United States by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The Secretary of the Interior under 16 United States Code (U.S.C.) Sections 703&hyph;712 has responsibility for management of those migratory birds, including the issuance of permits to take those birds. Criteria for issuance of Special Purpose permits is further defined by regulations found in Title 50 CFR part 21. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, 16 U.S.C. 704 provides: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ``Subject to the provisions and in order to carry out the purposes of the conventions, the Secretary *&blank;*&blank;* is authorized and directed from time to time, having due regard to the zones of temperature and to the distribution, abundance, economic value, breeding habits, and times and lines of migratory flight of such birds, to determine, when, to what extent, if at all, and by what means, it is compatible with the terms of the conventions to allow, *&blank;*&blank;* taking *&blank;*&blank;* of any such bird&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*''. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Generally, all species of gulls are listed in the treaties and further identified in 50 CFR 10.13, List of Migratory Birds. Prohibited activities involving these listed migratory birds are more clearly identified in 50 CFR 21.11 which provides: ``No person shall take *&blank;*&blank;* any migratory bird *&blank;*&blank;* except as permitted under the terms of a valid permit *&blank;*&blank;*''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations then provide for issuance of permits for general standardized activities (import/export, banding and marking, scientific collecting, taxidermy, waterfowl sale and disposal, and falconry activities) utilizing standard form permits. They also provide for issuance of Special Purpose permits which authorize otherwise prohibited activities involving migratory birds, not otherwise covered by the standard form permits, when: ``*&blank;*&blank;* an applicant *&blank;*&blank;* submits a written application containing the general information and certification required by part 13 [50 CFR 13] and makes a sufficient showing of *&blank;*&blank;* compelling justification.'' (50 CFR 21.27) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These Special Purpose Permit regulations give the Service broad authorities to address human safety issues at JFKIA. The Preferred Alternative is compatible with all conventions and treaties and the Service Actions identified within this Preferred Alternative are compatible with the intent of these conventions, treaties, and associated regulations. The compelling justification for these Service Actions is the issue of human safety at JFKIA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Service Actions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On May 24, 1994 the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) made a declaration ``*&blank;*&blank;* that in the opinion of the Federal Aviation Authority an `urgent situation' exists at JFK which requires emergency actions which are necessary on a limited and temporary basis for the protection of life, health, and property or natural resources.'' As of this time, there is no effective short-term alternative to address the public safety risk presented by gulls within JFKIA airspace, except to permit limited shooting of gulls at the airport. As is explained below, the Service intends to permit shooting to proceed in May 1994, subject to certain permit conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1994 Actions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service will issue Special Purpose Permits to ADC to permit the 1994 shooting program and to PA to permit the 1994 BCU program. Both permits will be non-renewable and ADC's permit will expire on August 20, 1994, by which time the peak of laughing gull strikes can reasonably be expected to have diminished. The PA's permit will expire on October 1, 1994, as is discussed in greater detail below. Non-renewable means that activity ends when the permit expires, and another permit must be issued before the activity can be continued (Title 50 CFR 13.22). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service will take this action on the ADC permit, in consideration of the FAA's determination of a need for emergency actions at JFKIA and the information presented in the FEIS concerning the hazards presented by gulls at JFKIA. The Service will issue the ADC permit, after the Service has concurred with documentation provided by ADC that the number of birds flying into JFKIA airspace present a hazard to aircraft. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service will condition the PA permit to authorize PA personnel to (1) kill non-endangered and non-threatened species of migratory birds, except eagles and all species of gulls, as provided by 50 CFR 21.41 (c)(2), when they are creating or about to create a hazard to aircraft; (2) all carcasses collected under this permit must be donated to a public/scientific institution or destroyed by burial/incineration; and (3) maintain records as required per 50 CFR 13.46. This gull restriction in the PA permit is based upon a State of New York limitation. The Service will condition the ADC permit to authorize ADC personnel to (1) kill no more than 14,500 laughing gulls, 1,500 herring, 200 great black-backed and 200 ring-billed gulls, when found flying into JFKIA airspace and creating a hazard to aircraft, using shotguns with steel shot; (2) all specimens collected under this permit must be donated to a public/scientific institution or destroyed by burial/incineration; and (3) maintain records as required per 50 CFR 13.46. The validity of both permits is also conditioned upon strict observance of all applicable foreign, state, local or other Federal law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The restrictions placed upon the take of herring, black-backed, and ring-billed gulls under the 1994 ADC permit reflect approximate past performance under the 1991&hyph;93 permits, because these takes have been demonstrated to have no impacts on local, state, or regional populations (FEIS, pp. 3&hyph;92 to 3&hyph;93). The restriction for shooting no more than 14,500 laughing gulls for the 1994 ADC permit is based on the results of population modeling (FEIS pp. 3&hyph;4 to 3&hyph;9 and p. 5&hyph;42) which suggests that the current Massachusetts/New York/New Jersey population could sustain a maximum annual loss of approximately 14,500 birds to shooting every year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service will entertain an application from the PA for a Special Use Permit to support the activities of their BCU for the remainder of 1994 provided that they have agreed to the improvements to the BCU, BHTF and JFKIA management programs and the schedule for these improvements to be completed on or before September 15, 1994. The Service will monitor the compliance of the PA to implementation of these improvements. Future permits will not be issued if improvements are not implemented according to the implementation schedule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: East Asiatic sets up sale of meat unit EAST Asiatic Company (EAC), the troubled Danish international trading group, has made a provisional agreement to sell its Plumrose meat processing operations in the UK and the US to Vestjyske Slagterier, the big Danish abattoir group, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. EAC said that more details about the sale and implications for the group's finances would be published when the agreement was made final. The company's meat processing operations in Germany are not covered by the deal, but the parties have agreed to a co-operation with a view for a later acquisition by Vestjyske. EAC said that its food operations in Australia and New Zealand would shortly be sold. The group made a DKr1.18bn (Dollars 190m) loss on sales of DKr17.3bn last year. The consumer goods division, which includes the food processing operations, had a turnover of DKr7.29bn and made an operating profit of DKr254m.</p>

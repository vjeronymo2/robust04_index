The sources said the revenue decrease will amount to about  170 billion yen in the initial year. They said the tax cut will  be made by raising the minimum taxable level to 50 million yen  from the present 48 million yen and boosting tax exemption for  individual heirs to 10 million yen from 9.5 million yen.    Tax rates on inherited assets ranging from 10 to 70 percent  will remain unchanged but the number of tax gradations will be  rearranged to nine from the present 13, they said. The highest  tax rate of 70 percent will be applied to inherited assets  exceeding 2 billion yen in value, up from the present 1 billion  yen, the officials said.</p>

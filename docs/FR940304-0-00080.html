			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 17, 1992, the Service published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (57 FR 59951) a proposal to list 22 plant taxa from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> island of Hawaii as endangered. This proposal was based primarily on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information supplied by the Hawaii Heritage Program, the Hawaii Plant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conservation Center, and observations of botanists and naturalists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service now determines 20 taxa primarily from the island of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hawaii to be endangered and 1 taxon from the island of Hawaii to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threatened, with the publication of this rule. One additional taxon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been withdrawn from consideration for listing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments and Recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the December 17, 1992, proposed rule and associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factual reports or information that might contribute to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of a final decision on the proposal. The public comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period ended on February 16, 1993. Appropriate State agencies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> county and city governments, Federal agencies, scientific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested to comment. Newspaper notices inviting general public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments were published in the Honolulu Advertiser on January 4, 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and in the Hawaii Tribune Herald on January 6, 1993. Nine letters of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment were received. No requests for public hearings were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received. Additional biological information contained in these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments has been incorporated into the final rule. Three letters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided only biological information and did not provide any comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the proposed listing. Three letters provided both additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information and supported the listing of all 22 species as endangered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species. One letter provided additional biological information and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically recommended that three of the species not be listed as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endangered or threatened. One letter suggested that it would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> better to promote the horticultural use of a particular taxon rather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than list it as endangered. These issues and the Service's response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are discussed below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 1:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Status of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hesperocnide sandwicensis:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One respondent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that this species should not be listed as an endangered or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threatened plant, because there are a large number of individuals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (possibly over 1 million), the taxon is widespread, the species is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adapted to disturbance, there is an abundance of protected habitat,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and there are few serious threats to its survival.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the time the proposed rule was written, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hesperocnide sandwicensis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> was thought to range from several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hundred to approximately 1,300 individuals. Extensive surveys in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992 and early 1993 have documented tens of thousands of plants on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lava flows between Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea (R. Shaw,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has carefully considered the respondent's comments and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concurs with his evaluation. Due to the location and large number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new populations and individuals now known, the Service is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hesperocnide sandwicensis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in the final rule. This species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is placed in category 3C of the Service's plant notice of review and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is removed from the list of candidate species, although the Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will continue to monitor threats to the populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 2:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Status of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pritchardia affinis:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One respondent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that an alternative to listing the species as endangered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be to promote the use of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pritchardia affinis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> for use as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> culturally significant landscape plant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Designating  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pritchardia affinis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endangered species affords this taxon significant legal protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the use of species such as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pritchardia affinis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> for landscaping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes may have important educational or cultural benefits, such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plantings would not ensure the protection of the few remaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals in the wild.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 3:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Status of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Silene hawaiiensis:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One respondent stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this species should not be listed as an endangered or threatened  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species, because the taxon is relatively common throughout its range  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (over 3,000 plants), the taxon is widely distributed, many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> populations are in protected areas, there are few serious threats to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its survival, and there are significant taxonomic uncertainties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding its status as a species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

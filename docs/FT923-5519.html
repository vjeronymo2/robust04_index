			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / UK Company News: SHT cuts interim losses SCOTTISH Heritable Trust, the carpet wholesaling, housebuilding, quarrying and property group, reduced its pre-tax losses from Pounds 3.15m to Pounds 2.86m in the first half of 1992. Turnover fell to Pounds 22.8m (Pounds 38.4m) reflecting the disposal of Standard Fireworks and Hoskins, and accounting for Scottish Heritable Inc as an associate, against a subsidiary last time. Interest charges were halved to Pounds 1.9m. While the group had not been able to comply with the debt reduction targets set out in the standstill agreement with bankers, it had been successful in obtaining their continued support. The three carpet wholesaling companies in the UK, France and the US operated at a loss. In housebuilding, the disposal of Hearthstead Homes in 1991 and strong trading conditions in Tennessee led to a turnround to a profit of Pounds 149,000 (loss Pounds 208,000). Quarrying saw Texas and Arkansas profitable but Virginia turning into a loss. The latter had since been sold for Dollars 19.7m(Pounds 9.8m). Losses per share came to 8p (10.6p).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Russia  will settle the issue of repayment of loans to the former Soviet  Union before President Kim Yong-sam's visit to Moscow in early  June.    A ranking government official said Wednesday that the  government would seek to solve the problem by accepting the  Paris Club payment terms for part of the loans and receiving  payment in kind for the remainder. Of the 1.47 billion U.S.  dollars in loans extended to the former Soviet Union, the funds  that had matured at the end of 1993 and overdue interest now  total 380 million dollars.    At a working-level meeting held in Seoul late last month,  Russia offered to assume responsibility for repaying the loans  if South Korea agreed to reschedule them according to the  agreement reached with the Paris Club of Western creditor  nations.    South Korea countered that Russia pay part of the loans in  kind, such as in aluminum and other industrial materials,  opposing repayment of all of the loans under the Paris Club  terms. The Paris Club terms stipulate installment repayment over  five years after a two-year grace period.</p>

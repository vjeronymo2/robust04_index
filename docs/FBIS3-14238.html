Vivekanand] </F>   [Text] Amman--A German vessel denied entry to al-'Aqabah  was on its way Wednesday [23 March] to another port in the Red  Sea to unload part of its cargo to meet the demands of the  U.S.-led enforcers of the international sanctions against Iraq,  shipping officials said.    The 1300-tonne Skyman, carrying 3,000-tonnes of general  cargo  for Jordan, is the second al-'Aqabah-bound vessel to be turned  away this month and the seventh to be intercepted and delayed  this year, said Sufyan Muhaysin, manager of the Jordan Shipping  Agents Association.    The Red Sea Energy, operated by a consortium of British,  German and French companies, was turned away last week after the  inspectors found two 20-feet containers carrying zinc  phosphorate for Iraq.    The inspectors' decision came despite documents attending  U.N. Sanctions Committee approval for the consignment of the  chemical, used in the detergent industry, shipping sources said.    As a rule, anything classified as "chemicals" comes under  close scrutiny of the inspectors. In many cases, entry to  al-'Aqabah is categorically denied.    The interceptions came against intensified moves by the  government to alleviate the negative impact of the sanctions  enforcement on Jordan's economy and a call by Parliament for the  Kingdom to refuse to return to the American backed Arab-Israeli  peace talks until the "siege of al-'Aqabah" is lifted.    Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani told reporters after  talks with U.S. Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross late  Tuesday that Mr. Ross had promised to consider Jordan's  grievances over the continuing blockade, which is severely  hampering the Kingdom's maritime operations and trade.    The stepped-up interceptions of ships entering the Gulf of  Aqaba come amid follow-up efforts to a proposal to move the  inspection of cargo to the port from the Iran Straits where it  is taking place new.    The proposal was expected to have been discussed by Prime  Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali and Dr. al-'Anani during their  meeting with Mr. Ross.    Under the proposal, an independent international agency,  most  probably Lloyd Register of London, will inspect all incoming and  outgoing cargo at the port for violations of the international  sanctions against Iraq instead of the multinational naval task  force led by American warships now patrolling the Red Sea.    Contacts are continuing among Jordanian, American and U.N.  officials as well as representatives of Lloyd Register on  various aspects of the proposed arrangement, sources said.  However, no one could provide any definite information as to  the progress achieved.    Independent land-based inspections by an international  agency, from the Jordanian viewpoint, will remove all hurdles  that ship owners cite to justify higher freight charges to and  from al-'Aqabah to buffet extra costs incurred as a result of  the delays caused by inspections at sea.    At present, Jordanian importers pay $500 per 20-feet  container and $1,000 per 40-feet container over and above the  regular freight charges to al-'Aqabah. The surcharge for  non-containerised cargo is around $15 per tonne.    In addition are extra costs paid by importers to bring their  cargo to al-'Aqabah if the original ships carrying them are  forced to off load them at other Red Sea ports.    "Cargo inaccessibility," one of the main reasons cited by  the  inspectors for turning ships away from al-'Aqabah, was also the  reason for the Skyman being denied entry to al-'Aqabah despite  efforts by the crew of the ship to rearrange cargo for  inspection.    Ibrahim Nauri, an official of the agents of the vessel, said  inspectors boarded the Skyman four times between Saturday and  Tuesday before refusing it permission to proceed to al-'Aqabah.    Mr. Muhaysin said the Skyman and the Red Sea Energy were the  third and fourth ships to be turned away from al-'Aqabah since  the beginning of the year, the two others came back after  unloading or rearranging cargo for inspection. The crew of  three other vessels managed to rearrange cargo while at sea to  satisfy the inspectors' demands, he said.    According to U.S. Navy figures, the naval task force, which  is now supported by four American warships, has queried 19,800  ships over radio, boarded more than 8000 for closer checks, and  turned away 450 since it took up station following the  imposition of the sanctions against Iraq in August 1990.</p>

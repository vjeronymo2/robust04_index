			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Finland to buy US jet fighters Finland has opted for McDonnell Douglas's F/A-18 Hornet to replace its ageing air force of Russian-built MiG-21s and Swedish Draken fighters, report Robert Taylor and George Graham. It will buy 57 single-seater Hornets and seven two-seater trainers for FM9.5bn (Pounds 1.2bn). McDonnell Douglas was in competition with General Dynamics, Dassault, Saab and the Russians. Total value of the deal, once training and weaponry such as the Sidewinder and Amraam air-to-air missiles are included, is expected to reach FM13bn.</p>

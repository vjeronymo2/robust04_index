			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRANIFF EXPECTS TO DEFAULT ON PAYMENTS TO CREDITORS  </P> <P> Braniff Inc. acknowledged in a quarterly report released Wednesday by the  Securities and Exchange Commission that the company will likely default on  payments to unsecured creditors and not make distributions to stockholders.  </P> <P> Braniff Inc., the Orlando, Fla.-based parent company for Braniff Airlines,  filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last fall, and began liquidating  assets to cover its $300 million in debts.  </P> <P> But with the sale of its last major asset -- the rights to buy 74 Airbus  Industrie A-320 planes -- Braniff is conceding most of its creditors will not  be paid and its shareholders will not receive distributions.  </P> <P> "It is not presently anticipated that the plan or reorganization will provide  for substantial payment of the company's unsecured liabilities or of any  distributions to equity holders," the SEC filing said.  </P> <P> The statement in the filing was confirmed by Joel Shapiro, an attorney with  Blank, Rome, Comisky &amp; McCauley in Philadelphia, a law firm representing  Braniff.  </P> <P> The filing is likely to mean that $100 million of Braniff junk bonds, whose  holders include Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Connecticut National Bank of  Hartford, and Citizens &amp; Southern National Bank in Atlanta, will not be  repaid. Also in jeopardy are debts held by Braniff's unsecured creditors, which  include Dalfort Corp. of Dallas.  </P> <P> David Levine, an attorney with the Miami law firm McDermott, Will &amp; Emery,  which is representing Braniff's bondholders committee, declined comment on the  development.  </P> <P> Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Braniff's remaining funds will first be used to  pay administrative and legal fees, post-petition claims by landlords, leasing  obligations, taxes and back salaries for employees. Any remaining funds will go  to creditors and stockholders.  </P> <P> But the initial payments are expected to fully deplete the $48 million that  Braniff will receive from Orix Corp of Tokyo for its rights to the Airbus  planes, a deal announced June 14. Braniff received a total of $62 million in  the transaction, but $14.2 million will be paid to Airbus for outstanding  debts.  </P> <P> Except for some spare parts, Braniff has no other remaining assets, although  routine investigations could theoretically bring in additional funds for  creditors.  </P></p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Minding Your Own Business: The pull of star vehicles - Tim Minogue meets an entrepreneur who saw a niche for big cars Once, stretch limousines, the unfeasibly long Cadillacs which are the transportation of choice for film stars, supermodels and movie gangsters, were rarely seen outside Manhattan and Los Angeles. Now they are an increasingly common sight in London, in part because of the success of Limco, a limousine-hire business based in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. The idea that Britons might take to being chauffeured in 30ft, three-ton monsters with shag-pile carpeting, white leather upholstery, smoked glass windows, bar, refrigerator, TV, telephone and video came to Les Barnes, managing director of Limco, four years ago during a visit to New York. Barnes, 45, and Chris Thorn, 48, had been partners since 1978 in a much less glamorous enterprise, Cheshunt Contractors Plant, engaged in groundworks on building sites - excavation, drain laying and the like. But by the end of the 1980s, with the construction industry in recession, business was deteriorating. 'We were suffering very badly, with no prospect of improvement,' says Barnes. 'We had to look for something completely different. I had seen the chauffeured limos in New York and thought 'if it can work there, it can work here'.' Having decided to get out of building, Barnes and Thorn could not sell their 17 heavy earth-moving machines, worth Pounds 150,000 on paper, and had to scrap the lot for just Pounds 2,000. The building boom of the 1980s had been kind to them while it lasted, however. They both owned large homes which they were able to remortgage, raising Pounds 80,000 from Barclays Bank towards the cost of two stretched Cadillacs which were shipped from the US in 1991. Barnes believed that the limousines, with their huge seating capacity (the smallest seats eight) would appeal to 'customers who wanted something special, unlike any other limo'. These days celebrities attending London film premieres often hire a stretch from Limco rather than a conventional limousine such as a Daimler - what Barnes calls 'Co-op funeral cars'. Famous names driven by Limco have included Liz Taylor, Sylvester Stallone, David Bowie and Muhammad Ali. The footballer Paul Gascoigne, a Hertfordshire resident, uses Limco much as others would a local minicab service. What surprised Barnes was the enthusiasm with which non-celebrity customers embraced the concept of big nights out in magnificently vulgar style. Twenty per cent of Limco's business is corporate, but the rest is private hire, mostly 'ordinary people out for a good time': birthdays, anniversaries, hen and stag nights, at Pounds 30 an hour (minimum four hours) plus VAT. Barnes says: 'We're selling the image of the glamorous, showbizzy lifestyle, if only for an evening.' Limco's fleet consists of four Cadillacs and four Lincolns. Barnes says demand justifies adding another five cars next year, including a 33ft 'super-stretch'. Expansion, however, has been curbed by the reluctance of finance houses to supply credit for the purchase of such exotic beasts. Barnes says: 'We have had to buy all our cars so far, except for the first three, with money up front, despite having a perfect credit rating. As soon as you mention American vehicles, lenders run a mile.' Valuation data is hard to come by on such cars, and lenders assume - wrongly, says Barnes - that they have little resale value in the UK. Limco is negotiating with Ford Credit, about borrowing up to Pounds 250,000 of the Pounds 400,000 cost of the new vehicles. Barnes concedes that finance companies may fear that the stretch limousine craze is mere flashiness in the pan. 'We have grown very quickly and lenders are wary of firms with rapid growth. They think the bubble will burst.' Profits are nudging Pounds 100,000 per annum on a turnover of around Pounds 320,000, up from a profit of Pounds 2,000 on a Pounds 74,000 turnover in the first year. 'We based our unit costs on the expectation that each car would be on the road for 20 to 25 hours a week,' says Barnes. 'In fact, demand has been much greater than we imagined. The cars average 40 hours each. That level of usage drives the unit costs down and the profits up. At the moment we are turning down about 40 or 50 hours worth of bookings every week, because we haven't got the cars.' Barnes says: 'We're giving people a taste of how the other half lives. When you hire one of these, it's a party from the moment you get in.' He says 'anything goes' in the back of his cars, although women on hen party outings are not encouraged to climb through the sunroof and bare their breasts, as has happened on more than one occasion.

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (8): World's leading producer - Profile of Rockwool A DECISION to spend Dollars 5,000 back in 1935 buying some 'primitive' drawings from a US company is the point from which Denmark's Rockwool group has developed its leading position in the world of insulation. It must have seemed something of a gamble at the time, but the decision's visionary quality is apparent from the fact that the group is now the world's leading producer of rock wool and one of the four biggest producers of mineral wool. Rockwool is based in Hedehusene, outside Copenhagen. It has 5,800 employees and last year turnover amounted to DKr5.20bn. The group is not only one of Denmark's biggest privately-owned companies, it is also one of the country's most international groups. Eleven of the group's 14 factories are located outside Denmark - four in Germany, three in Norway, and one each in Canada, France, Holland and the UK. About 80 per cent of the group's production takes place abroad and 90 per cent of customers are outside Denmark. The conscious strategy to expand abroad early on is one of the key elements in the group's success, according to Mr Tom Kahler, managing director and chief executive officer. Rock wool production only began at the group's Danish plant in 1937 but within three years the company also had factories operating in Norway and Sweden. It set up its first factory in Germany in 1951. Another aspect to the group's success, according to Mr Kahler, is a constant emphasis on research and development. This has helped it to keep technologically on a par with its main rivals who produce glass wool. 'Fifteen other companies in our field started up between the wars, but it was our emphasis on research and development that enabled us to survive,' says Mr Kahler. The group's most important market is Germany which now accounts for about 30 per cent of turnover, compared with just 10 per cent in 1980. The German subsidiary, Deutsche Rockwool, has 1,100 employees. The group was swift to take advantage of the reunification process and had a sales force working on the ground in eastern Germany as early as July 1990. But the big move came in February 1991 when it acquired the largest mineral wool factory in the former GDR, located in Flechtingen near Magdeburg, from the Treuhand. Rockwool claims this made it the first Danish company to enter the East German market and acquire production facilities. Rockwool is certainly not alone among Danish building companies in seeing the attractions of the German market. At a time when the domestic construction market has been so depressed, as many as 500 Danish building groups have been active in both eastern and western Germany. Last year it is reckoned that Danish building exports to Germany were worth DKr10bn, out of total Danish exports to Germany worth DKr51bn. It was thanks largely to Deutsche Rockwool's contribution, where sales rose 30 per cent last year, that Rockwool was able to raise 1991 turnover by 11 per cent. Severe competition and stagnating construction activity in many of its other markets held back the performance, and the pre-tax profit only rose slightly to DKr294m from DKr283m. This year conditions have proved just as difficult. But the group has learned to survive the hard times. In the early 1980s, for example, the combination of falling oil prices and depressed housebuilding activity took a big toll on profits. The group makes great play of the fact that energy consumption and air pollution are greatly reduced by the use of its insulation products. 'One of our companies has estimated that each kilo of CO emitted during production spares the environment a total of 550kg of CO, because our products reduce heating needs when installed in buildings or technical plants,' says a recent annual report. However, Rockwool is anxious not to be seen entirely as an insulating group. Its also supplies netting to the fishing industry, for example, and growing media to horticulturists. This highlights the group's continual drive to develop new products. 'Our expansion will not come from taking market share from other insulating manufacturers but from going in for more sophisticated products,' says Mr Kahler.</p>

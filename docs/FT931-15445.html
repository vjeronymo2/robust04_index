			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India hopes for self-sufficiency in vegetable oils INDIA HOPES to be self-sufficient in vegetable oils in the 1992-93 season, which began in November, thanks to bumper domestic production of oilseeds. Last year the country spent Dollars 68m of precious foreign exchange on importing 160,000 tonnes of oils. This year's optimism stems from an oilseeds production forecast of about 21.56m tonnes, up from 18.32m tonnes in 1991-92. Both the summer and winter crops have turned out to be highly satisfactory. As a result oil availability should rise to 6.11m tonnes from 5.24m tonnes. The federal government's claim that the country has at last achieved self-sufficiency in oils is being contested, however, by experts who point out that Indian per capita consumption of oils and fats works out at about 7 kg, compared with the world average of nearly 15 kg.</p>

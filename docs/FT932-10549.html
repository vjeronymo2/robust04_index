			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Vontobel family transfers shares THE VONTOBEL family of Zurich, which controls the eponymous private banking group, is transferring a large block of its shares to a new foundation as part of a plan to ensure an independent future for the bank. Speculation about the future of the banking group, which was floated on the Zurich bourse in 1986, has been rising because Mr Hans-Dieter Vontobel, the 49-year-old chairman, has no children. Mr Vontobel said yesterday the family was open to any formula that would maintain its independence, including strategic partnerships, wide public shareholding or a merger with another bank of roughly similar size. The only option he excluded was the group being taken over by a large universal bank. Mr Hans Vontobel, the 77-year-old former chairman who holds a 71 per cent stake, will sell a 30 per cent block to Mr Hans-Dieter Vontobel, his son, and will give a 19 per cent stake to a new Vontobel Foundation. A majority of the foundation's directors would come from outside the family and it would be free to vote and dispose of its Vontobel shares as it saw fit. Mr Hans-Dieter Vontobel anticipated he and other family members would gradually pass on their shares to the foundation unless or until some other plan for the bank's control was agreed. He said there was no pressure to find a quick solution; the bank's financial position was strong and he was in no hurry to retire. The Vontobel directors yesterday proposed a 25 per cent rise in the dividend for 1992 to SFr135 per bearer share. They also proposed to split both the registered and bearer shares on the basis of 10 for one.</p>

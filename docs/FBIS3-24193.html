			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report of Tyumen Oblast Statistics Committee: "The Amount </F> of Money Is Substantial but Insufficient"]    [Text] Businessmen and organizations in the oblast earned  1.2 trillion rubles in profit in the first 11 months of 1993.  Around 84 percent of all the profit in the oblast was earned by  industrial enterprises and transport organizations. The higher  profits in these branches were mainly due to higher wholesale  and retail prices.    The majority of industrial enterprises and agricultural,  transport, and construction organizations are experiencing  financial difficulties. This is attested to by data on the  status of mutual settlements between the buyers and producers of  goods.    Overdue payments on incurred debts (or nonpayments)  increased  by 586.2 billion rubles (or 42 percent) in November 1993, and  nonpayments on credit debts increased by 482.1 billion rubles  (36 percent). (Incurred debts are all of the debts owed to  enterprises--Ed.)    Almost one out of every two enterprises was unable to pay  its  debts to creditors on time. Financial conditions are  particularly unsatisfactory at the Otdelochnik-20 and  Sibkomplektavtotrans joint-stock companies of the closed type,  the Tobolsk Meat Combine, the Surgut Municipal Dairy, the  Gydansk Fish Plant, the Vagay Joint Timber Association, the  Feniks joint-stock company, the Mir Sovkhoz, and the Sibir  Kolkhoz.    There were no overdue payments on credit debt in the  Kogalymtruboprovodstroy Trust, the Ishim Reinforced Concrete  Products Plant, the Surgut Meat Processing Combine, the  Tyumenskiy Dom Khleba open joint-stock company, the Akva  joint-stock company, the Pyshminskoye closed joint-stock  company, and the Marma Oil Company.    Enterprises in the petroleum refining industry now owe the  budget 567.2 billion rubles, or 80 percent of all nonpayments to  the budget in the oblast. Overdue payments to the budget amount  to 127.3 billion rubles for the Yuganskneftegaz joint-stock  company, 79.2 billion for Langepasneftegaz, 62.4 billion for  Kondpetroleum, and 43 billion for the Noyabrskneftegaz  Production Association.    Oblast enterprises applied for bank credit and loans to  supplement their financial resources. Their total debt amounted  to 341.6 billion rubles (including 19.3 billion in overdue  payments). This figure is lower than the figure for 1 November  1993.    Deposits in State Bank branches in the oblast from savings  banks in 1993 were 24.4 times as high as the 1992 figure,  receipts from rail, air, and water transport were 20.6 times as  high, the receipts of enterprises of the Ministry of Railways  were 15.9 times as high, local transport receipts were 6.8 times  as high, and the receipts of consumer service enterprises were  9.6 times as high. The rate of increase in receipts in the  oblast was slightly lower in January-December.    The amount of money put into circulation in the oblast was  2.0721 trillion rubles. This was 11 times as high as last year's  figure.</p>

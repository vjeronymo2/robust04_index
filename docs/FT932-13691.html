			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Observer: Bank tank After the heady excesses of the 1980s, it might have been thought that research into financial innovation was a touch passe. Not so, as witness a new London think-tank, the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation, just opened for business. Sir Kit McMahon, erstwhile deputy governor of the Bank of England, Sam Cross, formerly of the New York Fed, and John Heimann of Merrill Lynch, are among the big names supporting the venture which was dreamed up by FT colleague David Lascelles and economist Andrew Hilton, the centre's first director. Most of the research to date has been focused on the risks of such innovation to the financial system, rather than on the opportunities. So Hilton, who will continue to work part-time for his mentor Minos Zombanakis, says he is looking for the 'single big idea' that will change the way people think about the financial system. In a business where there are very few new ideas, the problem may be getting commercial rivals to share their best secrets.</p>

Specifically referring to the commercial opening implemented in  the country, Portillo said: "We always carefully study the  economic conditions prevailing in each country, and I believe  that as a result of the Brazilian economic reform the conditions  are there for offering guarantees for export credits."    Portillo arrived in Brazil at the end of the week at the  head  of a business delegation. Yesterday, during a luncheon  sponsored by the British Chamber of Commerce in Rio de Janeiro,  where he met with Brazilian businessmen, he expressed interest  in the Brazilian privatization program. So much so that during  the morning, after visiting Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum  Corporation] and Shell, he visited the National Bank for  Economic and Social Development (BNDES) where he met with  National Privatization Program Director Elena Landau.    "There is interest in all privatization areas," he added,  and  specifically in the telecommunications and energy fields. He  believes that because of their experience in the privatization  process in Great Britain, British banks may take part in the  Brazilian privatization program through the sale of certificates  in those companies that are being privatized on the  international market. Well versed on the issue, Portillo stated  that the Brazilian privatization program has already yielded a  total of $6 billion, while in Great Britain the program totaled  $75 billion.    British interest in the Brazilian privatization process is  also attested to by the members of the official delegation --  British Gas, Northwest Water International, Powergen (all  companies that were privatized) and the Barings Kleinwort  Benson, Rothschilds, and Schroders and Warburgs banks, all of  which have played an active role in the privatization process.    Today the British delegation will be in Sao Paulo, where it  will hold meetings with Sao Paulo State Governor Luiz Antonio  Fleury Filho and Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf. On 9 March they  are scheduled to visit Brasilia, where they will hold meetings  with Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and with  representatives from the Mines and Energy and Aeronautics  Ministries. The British companies are interested in  participating in the Amazon Region Surveillance System (Sivam);  their bid for the supply of telecommunications equipment  totaling $600 million has already been opened by the Aeronautics  Ministry.</p>

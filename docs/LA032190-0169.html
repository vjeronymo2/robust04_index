			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSS WANTS TO BUILD ARENA IN SAN DIEGO FOR 2 TEAMS  </P> <P> The owner of the Lakers says he is considering building a new San Diego sports  arena in which he hopes to eventually house two new professional sports  franchises.  </P> <P> Jerry Buss said he has been scouting North County sites to build a home for a  National Basketball Assn. team and a National Hockey League expansion  franchise.  </P> <P> "If I can get a grant on some land and the franchises, the rest of it is a slam  dunk," said Buss, the owner of the Forum in Inglewood, where the NBA Lakers and  NHL Kings play.  </P> <P> Buss said he has put together an unidentified group interested in relocating an  NBA team or procuring an expansion team for his new building. He said the  Lakers would not be involved in the San Diego arena project.  </P> <P> Buss also said he has applied to the NHL for an expansion franchise.  </P> <P> Buss' disclosure places him in direct competition with Harry Cooper and Richard  Esquinas, the operators of the existing San Diego Sports Arena, who are in the  process of applying for city permits to build a new arena downtown.  </P></p>

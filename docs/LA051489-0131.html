			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MARKETING: A SUMMER CRUSADE FOR BAT DOLLARS  </P> <P> Holy merchandising dollars, Batman!  </P> <P> When the Caped Crusader swoops into movie theaters this summer, he won't be  empty-handed. He'll be hauling along a cargo of products mighty enough to  satisfy the ego of any superhero.  </P> <P> In fact, despite competition from such notables as Indiana Jones, the  Ghostbusters, and Peter Pan, Batman is already being called the sure -- and  easy -- victor in this summer's movie merchandising sweepstakes by toy industry  analysts, retail store buyers and memorabilia dealers.  </P> <P> The Batman product blowout runs the gamut, from everyday movie tie-ins like  posters, key chains and automobile sunshades to imaginative goodies including a  $150 motorized ride-on Batmobile for kids.  </P> <P> On their way to stores this summer are Batman Nintendo games, Batman walkie  talkies, Batman shirts, robes, pajamas -- even Batman boxer shorts -- and  Batman costumes ranging from $6 vinyl hooded capes to $200-plus Bat wear  fashioned along the lines of Michael Keaton's film wardrobe.  </P> <P> The New York-based Toy Biz company is putting out a Batman line that includes  plastic replicas of the movie's rocket-launching Batwing aircraft ($15.25) and  ultra high-tech Bat Cave ($17.95).  </P> <P> And, of course, there's much more.  </P> <P> In addition to the 24 companies who have deals with Warner Bros. to produce  items in conjunction with the Batman movie, D.C. Comics has licensed 101  companies in the United States and Canada to manufacture products in honor of  the Caped Crusader's 50th birthday this year.  </P> <P> It may well be that comic-book Batman, clad in his classic blue-and-gray gear,  turns out to be the toughest competition for Batman, the all-in-black film  star. Both Batmen, however, face some dynamic challengers, including:  </P> <P> * Indiana Jones. With "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" set for a May 24  opening, Indy is about to become quite a ubiquitous guy around supermarkets and  convenience stores participating in the Pepsi company's summerlong "Indiana  Jones" contest/promotion. Giveaways include a trip for two to Venice or Egypt,  "adventure kits" (complete with khaki-colored Indy watches, soft drink coolers,  visors, sweat bands and radios), adventurous Indy-style jackets and Stetson  hats and movie posters.  </P> <P> For those who would rather buy their Indy gear outright, some similar items  will be available through retail stores.  </P> <P> * Ghostbusters. Although "Ghostbusters II" movie tie-in items including fabric  "Ghostbusters" costumes ($14.99) and vinyl "Slimer" duds ($5.99) are expected  to appear in stores by summer's end, the real powerhouse "Ghostbusters" line is  already on the shelves. Kenner's "The Real Ghostbusters" cartoon show tie-ins  comprised an $80 million toy line in 1988. With some additional products, it's  expected to grow to $100 million in 1989.  </P> <P> * Peter Pan. Sears has an exclusive deal to sell "Peter Pan" products in  conjunction with the re-release of the 1953 Disney classic. The company expects  to have "Peter Pan" items including dolls and plush toys ($10-$20) and  children's apparel ($5.33-$20) in stores by July 1.  </P> <P> * Babar. In terms of movie merchandise, the dark horse of the summer may turn  out to be an elephant. "Babar is a 56-year-old classic character who has never  really been exploited, until now," notes Stanford Blum, executive vice  president of the Toronto-based Nelvana Entertainment. Nelvana ("The Care  Bears") plans to open its animated "Babar: The Movie" in 800 theaters  nationwide July 28. The company also has a commitment for 65 episodes of HBO's  twice-a-week "Babar" series, which debuted April 1.  </P> <P> Nelvana has licensed some 40 U.S. manufacturers and 60 foreign companies to  produce a truly elephantine quantity of Babar toys and other goods. Since it  views Babar as "a yuppie property," says Blum, the firm began its product  launch at department stores on the level of Bloomingdale's and Neiman Marcus,  pushing plush toys (priced at up to a very plush $500), lead crystal, jewelry,  linen and other upscale items.  </P> <P> This summer, Babar will lumber into more common territory with less pricey  </P> <P> merchandise as well as personal appearances at shopping centers and malls  across the country. "We have 20 Babar costumes and they're all booked for the  summer," reports Blum.  </P> <P> And if that's not enough to place Babar in the collective consciousness of Los  Angeles residents, Nelvana has also orchestrated a June 28 event at the L.A.  Zoo in which a newly "adopted" elephant will be named King Babar.  </P></p>

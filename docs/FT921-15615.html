			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report TRADERS WERE predicting a test of upside resistance in the aluminium market after a strong performance at the London Metal Exchange yesterday. They attributed the rise to a heavy bout of trade buying in the morning, and in spite of having to absorb a profit-taking in the afternoon, the three-months position closed Dollars 9.75 higher at Dollars 1,143.25. Zinc prices continued their rally with the cash position adding the Dollars 9 to Tuesday's Dollars 11 rise. Traders explained that fears of a squeeze on supplies for February delivery, which had been easing, flared up again, prompting a wave of short-covering. At the London bullion market the scare about President Bush's health pushed the gold price to Dollars 351.40 a troy ounce at one point. But as concern eased the price fell back to Dollars 350.30 an ounce, up 65 cents on the day. Dealers said gold was as technically oversold with good physical demand underpinning the market. Robusta coffee prices were firmer at the London Futures and Options Exchange, with the March position closing Pounds 16 up at Pounds 548 a tonne. However, dealers said there was disappointment at the failure to break through Pounds 550 and described market activity as 'routine'. Cocoa prices reached four-month lows before finishing little changed. Compiled from Reuters</p>

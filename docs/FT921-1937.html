			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Labour home price fears - Entering the housing market? David Barchard has some advice BRITAIN'S home owners, already battered by the worst housing market in half a century, had better brace themselves for further nasty shocks if Labour wins the general election. People used to say that if there was to be a Labour government the first thing one should do was to buy a house by taking out the largest obtainable mortgage and wait for inflation to whittle the debt away. That was in the 1960s and 1970s, when inflation usually ran well ahead of interest rates. That experience is unlikely to be repeated in the 1990s. A Labour government is going to have to live inside the disciplines of the European monetary system and interest rates and the cost of borrowing will march in line with inflation. Add to this picture, a housing market full of homes that cannot find buyers and there are obvious grounds for apprehension about the effects of a drastic change in economic policy. 'We think that some of the measures the Labour Party are planning could be devastating for the housing market,' says mortgage broker John Charcol. People who earn more than Pounds 40,000 will be hit by the new 50 per rate on income tax, and Charcol fears that a good proportion of people with incomes above Pounds 50,000, who borrowed at the height of the housing boom, may find themselves unable to keep up mortgage payments as a result. Some people, who would have been moving up the housing ladder, may find themselves having to move down, leading to a larger number of higher value properties coming onto the market. Perhaps they should have listened to those economists who have been arguing against investing in property. 'It's a bit late in the day now but most FT readers should have sold their houses two years ago and put the money on deposit and rented. But who wants to live like that?' says Professor Tim Congdon. That said, first time buyers could have cause for moderate encouragement. A Labour government will be good news for people earning less than Pounds 20,000. The tax and National Insurance Plans of the Labour government will leave them slightly better off in a buyer's market. The average first-time buyer has an income of Pounds 18,000, so it is reasonable to assume that a Labour victory could be a mild stimulus to the first-time buyer's end of the housing market. It may also be boosted by tax incentives introduced by a Labour government specifically intended to help first-time buyers. Conversely, first-time buyers may be shy of entering the market because of other likely changes under Labour. One of these is a rise in interest rates. These tend to be at their lowest around election time and to rise afterwards. Economists in the City are forecasting a rise in interest rates of between half a percentage point and two full percentage points in the months after April 9. By the summer, on a pessimistic projection, the market could find itself struggling to contend with base rates of perhaps 12 or 12.5 per cent and mortgage interest rates around 13 per cent. A one per cent base rate rise is perhaps more likely, implying a mortgage interest rate of 12.5 per cent. In such circumstances, would-be home buyers are likely to think twice about entering the market. So, instead of a revival, we are quite likely to see things getting worse. It is more probable that the fall in house prices will accelerate, at least until base rates come down. John Wriglesworth, housing finance analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, reckons that prices could plunge by as much as a further five per cent if base rates rise sharply. Even if base rates do not shoot upwards, building societies and banks are going to find it difficult to hold down their mortgage interest rates. There are two reasons for this. One is that rates are already too low. The lenders cut rates in January, expecting a further half a percentage point cut in base rates in the budget. It did not happen and the margin between their lending and savings rates is now too narrow to be sustained. A second reason is that building societies are under pressure on their savings business and if they have to compete with a government which is also trying to attract savings to finance its budget deficit, they will have even less scope for holding down rates to borrowers. Building society savings accounts look distinctly unattractive compared to other investments such as gilts. But perhaps savings accounts generally will be a better place for your money than housing. 'I don't think you would expect much house price inflation under a Labour Government and if there is a good interest rate available on deposit you should sell and invest the money, but that depends on people's circumstances,' says Professor Congdon.</p>

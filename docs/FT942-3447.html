			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Search starts for Italian left-wing party chief: FT correspondents report on fallout from last weekend's European election Mr Achille Occhetto's successor as head of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) will be chosen by the party's 480-strong national council, it was announced yesterday. Mr Occhetto resigned in the wake of the European elections in which the PDS fared badly. Mr Occhetto had been under pressure to step down since the March general election, but the timing of his move - and the bitterness of his resignation note - caught many of his colleagues by surprise. The tone of yesterday's articles in L'Unita, the PDS newspaper, was respectful but far from eulogistic. The PDS, formed in 1991 and the largest opposition party, has procedures, as yet untested, for electing the leadership in circumstances such as these. The resignation of the communist party leader for personal or political reasons is unprecedented. The former communist party's tradition is embedded in the PDS psychologywhere the secretary-general's departure is only envisaged for 'objective reasons'. The contest to replace Mr Occhetto is expected to be both unpredictable and hard-fought. Most unpredictable element will be the role of the national council, which, for the first time, will have to conduct a democratic leadership contest. Mr Stefano Rodota, one of the father figures in the PDS, was quoted yesterday as saying it was not simply a question of replacing Mr Occhetto, but the entire top tier of the party. The implication was that they were all identified with the past of excessive control at the centre of the communist party. Under Mr Occhetto the PDS was steered towards a social democrat philosophy, similar to the Social Democratic party in Germany. But he failed to broaden its appeal beyond the old communist voters and lost a sizeable rump to hardline marxists who formed Reconstructed Communism. According to Mr Massimo Cacciari, PDS mayor of Venice and a possible contender for the leadership, Mr Occhetto's successor must be able to unite the left as a coherent attractive electoral force. Six groupings, from Greens to Socialists, formed the PDS-led Progressive Alliance in the election; in the new first-past-the-post voting system they stand little chance individually. The weakness of the small left-wing parties was underlined yesterday by the resignation of Mr Ottaviano Del Turco from the leadership of the once powerful, but now insignificant, Socialist party, and by the resignation of Mr Willer Bordon as co-ordinator of the Democratic Alliance. Only a year ago the Democratic Alliance seemed ready to act as an umbrella under which the parties could regroup on the left. Involving former Communists, Republicans and Christian Democrats, it failed to get off the ground because the PDS was not prepared to co-operate. Continuing differences suggest the left will take a long time to reorganise itself to challenge the right-wing coalition of Mr Silvio Berlusconi.</p>

Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters suggested that the Secretary provide greater detail in the regulations concerning when an institution would receive full certification for a period of less than four years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted in the discussion for the proposed regulations, the full four year certification period will generally be used for institutions. There may be a limited number of times when an institution would receive a shorter period of full certification, based upon the specific circumstances presented. One instance where a shorter period of full certification would be used is where an institution has submitted a materially complete application for renewal in a timely manner, but no decision is issued before the institution's certification expires. In that instance, as explained in the discussion concerning provisional certification below, the institution's full certification would be extended on a month to month basis until a decision on its application was issued. Other situations will arise where a certification of less than four years will be appropriate, but it is not feasible to try and identify such infrequent actions by referencing them specifically in the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Provisional certification. Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters were concerned that the proposed implementation of provisional certification in the regulations was very broad, and would impose hardships on a number of institutions. The commenters suggested that the Secretary treat the administrative capability and financial responsibility requirements as indicators of instances where provisional certification could be used, but would not necessarily be required if the institution could demonstrate that it should be permitted to participate under full certification. Numerous commenters suggested that it was inappropriate to use provisional certification for institutions whose cohort default rates exceeded the thresholds set out in the proposed regulations at &sect;668.16. Other commenters recommended that the regulations be amended to clarify that provisional certification could be renewed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters suggested that the regulations be amended to provide for the provisional certification of all institutions in a State where no SPRE has been established. These commenters believed that this use of provisional certification was consistent with the intent of the HEA for the Secretary to monitor institutions more closely in this situation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary believes it is appropriate to use the administrative capability and financial responsibility thresholds as events that will require provisional certification, rather than as indicators that might or might not result in provisional certification being required. Provisional certification will be used to permit these institutions to continue participating in the Title IV, HEA programs while correcting over time the items that were identified that caused the institution to be placed under provisional certification. The categories and thresholds set out in the regulations provide sufficient notice to institutions of the standards to which they will be held accountable. The proposed mechanism for provisional certification also provides administrative efficiency in reviewing applications for certification, and encourages institutional improvements over time to meet and maintain these standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary has responded to concerns about the cohort default rate measures by adjusting the administrative capability thresholds in &sect;668.16 that would trigger a requirement that an institution would receive provisional certification based upon its reported cohort default rates. See the section of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Analysis of Comments and Changes  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> that addresses administrative capability (&sect;668.16). The Secretary intends that institutions that have participated successfully under provisional certification, but who still do not satisfy certain requirements for full certification, will be permitted to renew their provisional certification. No specific changes are needed to reflect this procedure in the regulations, because such decisions will be made in response to the applications for certification that institutions will submit in response to the expirations of their current certifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

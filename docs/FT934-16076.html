			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Mortgage tax relief system on Budget agenda THE government is reviewing the system of mortgage tax relief, but no decisions have been taken and it wants to avoid steps that would deliver a shock to the housing market. The Treasury has put a further reduction of tax relief on mortgage interest payments on its list of possible revenue-raising measures in the November 30 Budget. But it is understood that detailed discussions of the taxation side of the Budget have yet to begin. Asked about his plans for mortgage tax relief yesterday, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said only that he was looking 'at all possible options in taxation' and that his Budget was not yet finalised. Close associates of Mr John Major, the prime minister, said yesterday that he would be very reluctant to accept any move that would be perceived as a break of the Tory general election manifesto promise to 'maintain' mortgage interest relief. They indicated that the government would therefore be unlikely to take such a radical step as abolishing relief for new home buyers from April 1995 as reported in yesterday's Guardian newspaper. However, it is also clear that mortgage tax relief is no longer a sacred cow for the Conservative party. Relief is due to be pared from April as part of staged tax increases announced in the March Budget. From 1994-95 relief will be granted at the lowest 20 per cent rate of income tax on interest paid up to the Pounds 30,000 ceiling for mortgages, compared with 25 per cent at present. Treasury ministers are keen to see a further erosion in mortgage interest relief which represents a substantial cost to the exchequer and is regarded as a factor which distorts the British housing market. Mortgage interest relief cost the government Pounds 5.2bn in 1992-93. But this burden has fallen in line with lower interest rates so the cost in 1993-94 is estimated at Pounds 4.3bn. The Treasury estimates that it will cost Pounds 3.6bn next year. The low interest rates - with mortgage rates about half the level of the early 1990s - should help ease political resistance to any move cutting mortgage interest relief in the Budget. Homeowners are substantially better off than a year ago, while tax relief on a Pounds 30,000 mortgage is now worth only about Pounds 600 a year. However, the housing market is still fragile and lagging the economic recovery. In view of this ministers are approaching the issue cautiously.</p>

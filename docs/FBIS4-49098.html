			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Guangzhou Commodity Fair Punishes 20 Enterprises </F> for Violating Trademarks"]    [Text] The Guangzhou Commodity Fair Office for  Professional Affairs made a decision not long ago to handle the  trademark violation cases of 20 enterprises.    During the 75th Guangzhou Commodity Fair, it was verified by  the Office for Professional Affairs that on the samples  exhibited by 20 enterprises, including Shenzhen's Kaicheng  Company, the registered trademarks of other enterprises were  used without the permission of the owners of those trademarks,  thus violating these trademarks, as well as the Rules for the  Implementation of the Trademark Law and related regulations of  the Guangzhou Commodity Fair. The Office for Professional  Affairs studied the decision based on the Trademark Law and  related regulations of the Commodity Fair, while taking into  consideration of the actual conditions of the Commodity Fair,  and punished those 20 companies that had violated others'  trademarks according to their cases, with penalties ranging from  circulating a notice of criticism, confiscating the exhibits  with unauthorized trademarks, and removing them from exhibition,  effective 26 April.</p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> MASTER CHORALE PERFORMS 'ELIJAH' AT DOROTHY CHANDLER  </P> <P> Mendelssohn's "Elijah" brought out the Los Angeles Master Chorale and Sinfonia  in their largest, grandest manifestations, Saturday evening at the Dorothy  Chandler Pavilion. It also brought out a big effort from music director John  Currie, appropriately swift and dramatic in the first half, meditative or  majestic in ending.  </P> <P> For some of the pre-intermission airs, the pace proved a little too quick, but  the choruses were taut and vivid. From the opening cries of "Help, Lord!" the  choir made its weight felt and demonstrated the ability and will for narration  as well as action.  </P> <P> Despite the choral power, the Sinfonia covered the chorus in its lower range in  the most active portions. Otherwise, its support was vigorous, occasionally  crude in intonation and ensemble, but providing a full, Romantic palette.  </P> <P> In the multifarious title role was baritone Herbert Eckhoff, singing with  ringing, orotund authority. The stentorian glories were largely  undifferentiated in the first half, whether taunting the priests of Baal or  pleading with the Lord. He found only slightly more vocal variety for the  exalted despair of "It is enough," but rode the big climaxes easily.  </P> <P> Soprano Juliana Gondek, mezzo Christine Cairns and tenor Jonathan Mack supplied  fluent, assured sounds in their airs and ensembles, and varying degrees of  characterization. Cathy Larsen sang the bright watch cries of the Youth. JOHN  HENKEN  </P></p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Serious socialising - Giles Kime, at the Nederburg wine auction, on the industry's future For 20 years the Nederburg wine auction has been the highpoint of the South African social calendar. What with the marquees, hats and the cut-glass tones of former Sotheby's auctioneer Patrick Grubb you could be forgiven for thinking that you were at Ascot or Henley rather than Paarl Valley. This year rain added to the illusion. But there is also a serious intent behind the socialising. Wines auctioned at Nederburg include some of South Africa's finest, many made especially to be sold at the event. They are a mixture of old and recent vintages. This year the highest price was paid for a bottle of 1962 Nederburg Cabernet which fetched R1,100 (around Pounds 210). If anything is proof that South Africa can produce world class wine to rival Europe, California and Australia, then these wines are it. This year, of the 1,400 people who attended, there were more buyers from overseas than over before, from the UK, Scandinavia, the Far East, the US and Canada. The overseas attendance figures reflect South Africa's new export market which is little more than three years old, born soon after President de Klerk's landmark speech in February 1991 that promised political reform. Exports to the UK alone looked set to reached 1m cases last year, compared with 190,000 in 1990. Nevertheless the atmosphere at Nederburg this year was of confidence tinged with uncertainty. Like any other industry in South Africa, there is a huge question mark hanging over next year's financial projections. The face of South African wine has changed beyond recognition since Grubb first picked up his gavel in 1973. In those days it comprised little more than a mixed bag of wines of varying degrees of sweetness, sherry, some Chenin Blanc and a bit of Pinotage. Most of what was on British wine merchants' shelves during the dark days of sanctions was produced by the KWV, the competent but huge co-operative. Gradually, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the classic 'noble' varieties began to appear. (Amazingly Sydney Back, of Paarl's Backsberg Estate, planted the first Chardonnay as recently as 10 years ago.) The learning curve has been vertical and some producers now make Chardonnay and Pinot Noir that stand up well to those from Burgundy. But it is facile to see this as being related simply to political changes. Wines do not improve overnight because they are made in a politically correct country. Change was afoot when the idea of 'one man one vote' still seemed like pie in the sky. Improvements have been helped by the end of restrictive regulations imposed by the then powerful KWV, largely thanks to the campaigning of advertising tycoon turned wine producer, Tim-Hamilton Russell. It was evident to this wily newcomer to the industry that South Africa would never fulfil its potential under anachronistic legislation and quota systems and he worked to change this. But at all levels of the industry, the bid to make up for time lost by economic isolation has been speedy - from excellent high volume co-ops, such as Vredendal and Swartland, to large, premium producers like Nederburg and Bergkelder. They have been aided not only by expanding export markets but also by greater contact with the outside world. Young winemakers now travel widely, not only to the classic European regions of Burgundy, Bordeaux and Champagne, but to California, Australia and New Zealand. Prominent figures from the world of wine now visit South Africa regularly, among them Paul Pontallier, director of Bordeaux first-growth Chateaux Margaux, Robert Mondavi from California and Paul Bouchard from Burgundy. The South African wine industry is now firmly on the world wine map and this will be reflected in the increased quality of its wines. But, like any other industry in South Africa, the question is not only the problem of political instability but also whether higher taxation and wage rises will be on the new government's agenda. As a wine-producing region, South Africa along with Chile, Eastern Europe and Australia, shares low-production costs relative to most others. If they increase, competitiveness on the world market will be jeopardised. What the industry has in its favour is the big value of its growing export markets and the livelihoods of almost 100,000 people who rely on it. Giles Kime is editor of Decanter magazine.</p>

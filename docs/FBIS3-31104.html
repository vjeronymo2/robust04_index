			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Defense Is Ready"] </F>   [Text] Major General Zivomir Ninkovic, commander of the  air force and antiaircraft defense of the Srpska republic army,  said that there is no real reason, neither political nor  military, for anyone to directly attack a people. He stressed,  therefore, that "I do not believe that the NATO threat will be  realized."    In an interview with GLAS SRPSKI, Ninkovic said that if,  however, the aggression were to take place, "we must not bow, we  must defend ourselves and succeed at it."    Therefore, if the threat is carried out, it will mean that  we  have been forced into fighting. In that case, we would use all  available means for defense, claims General Ninkovic.</p>

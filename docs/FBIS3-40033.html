The prime minister was speaking at a news conference under way  at Sao Bento. Cavaco Silva is giving a joint news conference  with his Israeli counterpart. Raquel Abecassis reports:    [Abecassis] This was the first question Cavaco Silva had to  answer. He spoke without any problem about the documentary  shown on television on the second massacre in East Timor:    [Begin Cavaco recording] Once again we receive shocking  images of Indonesia's behavior in Timor. We hope that these  images will help the international community to be even more  aware of the need to pressure the Indonesian Government as much  as possible to respect human rights in the territory. I can  also say that we were already working with information very  similar to that revealed yesterday, information we have received  from the resistance [words indistinct]. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Amir Hodzic from Vienna -- recorded] </F>   [Text] [Hodzic] Today, after thorough work over five  days, the Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatian delegations in Vienna  reached an agreement on the number and borders of cantons of the  Federation, the composition and the [word industinct] of the  composition of the government and the [word indistinct] of the  Federation.    There will be eight cantons in the Federation: (Hum)-Sana,  Posavina, Tuzla-[word indistinct], Zenica-Doboj, Gorazde,  (?Upper) Drina, Central Bosnian, and (?Central Herzegovina).    After the agreement was reached, we asked Prime Minister Dr.  Haris Silajdzic to tell the listeners and viewers of Radio and  Television of Bosnia-Herzegovina all that has been agreed and to  assess the importance of the agreement reached.    [Silajdzic] The agreement reached is, so far, the most  serious step toward reaching the final peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and in preserving the integrity and  sovereignty of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The  solutions endorsed are the most important concrete step in  implementing the Washington agreement, the current Washington  agreement and [word indistinct] the Federation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    These solutons, that is, we [words indistinct] the question  of establishing cantonal borders are maximally democratic, they  enable a full national equality, economic appropriateness, a  respect for [word indistinct], logical, and [words indistinct].  In a (?concrete way), these solutions should bring back  confidence between the two peoples and ensure a new quality  [word indistinct] in which [words indistinct] all those people  will be eliminated who want (?dispute) and who do not wish the  joint life of Bosniaks and Croats, as well as those who [words  indistinct] Serbs and others who feel [words indistinct]. These  solutions, in a way, go beyond the Costitution as they offer  parity decision-making in two cantons, which is a higher level  of democratic solution, something that proves there is a  readiness to really build [words indistinct].    The Croatian and Bosniak peoples and all the people who feel  Bosnia-Herzegovina is their own republic will certainly receive  this agreement with relief and delight. It has been left to us  to participate in the implementation of this agreement together.  This is a difficult, very difficult, and very responsible task.  I hope that we shall, all together, once again, prove that we  can overcome this [word indistinct].    [Hodzic] Mr. Silajdzic, what has been agreed about the  government [words indistinct]?    [Silajdzic] It will be proposed to the Constitutional  Assembly that the first (?president) of the Federation (?in the  transient period) should be a candidate from the Croatian people  and in the same period, the (?vice president) of the Federation  is from the Bosniak people. Thus, when the six-month period  expires, the duty of the president will be performed by a member  of the Bosniak people and the duty of (?vice president) by a  member of the Croatian people.    The first president of the Federation after the transitory  period will be elected from the ranks of the Bosniak people.    At the government reshuffle, it will be ensured that the  duty  of the prime minister is taken by a member of the Bosniak people  and the duty of deputy prime minister by a member of the  Croatian people. The deputy prime minister will head the  Ministry of (?Defense).    Amendments to the Law on the Government of the Federation  have been proposed, so that the Government of the Federation is  composed of the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, 17  ministers, and four ministers without portfolio. Ministers from  the Bosniak people will be heading the following (?ministries):  the Ministry for Energy, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of [words indistinct],  the Ministry of (?Zoning), the Ministry for Refugees, the  Ministry of Police, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of  Culture. Ministers from the Croatian people will be heading the  Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Finances, the Ministry of  Justice, the Ministry of [word indistinct], and the Ministry of  [word indistinct]. Of four ministers without portfolio, one  will be a member of the Croatian people.    The territory of the Federation has been established on the  basis of jointly adopted criteria.    After four days of work, this agreement has been (?reached).  [words indistinct] has also been [words indistinct] with special  administration: the Central-Bosnian and (?Neretva) [words  indistinct]. Thus, amendments to the Constitution of the  Federation will be made in conformity with the [word  indistinct], so that in conformity with the (?solution) about  the Federation, these cantons ensure the (?independence) of the  peoples in the Federation.    [Hodzic] Prime minister, please tell us at the end what  (?has been left) to do after this Vienna agreement, so that the  (?Federation) [words indistinct]?    [Silajdzic] We have already ageed to sign this agreement on  Saturday [14 May], to [word indistinct] and [words indistinct].    [Hodzic] There is one more piece of information from Vienna:  The agreed documents will be signed in Geneva on Saturday.    This was Amir Hodzic reporting from Vienna for the  Radio-Television of Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

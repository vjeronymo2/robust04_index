			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 22, IRNA -- A morning daily here Sunday  [22 May] said that recent developments in Yemen are alarming and  would jeopardize stability in the region.    "Remaining passive observers, regional countries did little  to stop the crisis, except to make formal bids for unsuccessful  mediation between former communist South Yemen and former  conservative North Yemen, which merged in 1990," wrote the daily  `TEHRAN TIMES.'    The two Yemen, said the editorial, were different culturally  and economically and it was natural that it would have taken  time for them to be one. Therefore, Yemenis needed moral  support and economic assistance which they could not receive for  pure political reasons and because of drastic global changes,  the article said.    "Most observers believe that Yemenis are punished by the  United States and its allies in the region because of Sanaa's  support of Saddam Husayn during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in  August 1990." Naturally, Iran is concerned with events in Yemen  and recently offered to mediate. "Iran is the only country in  the region which remains neutral so that Tehran's moves might  bear fruit."    The daily concluded by calling on leaders of Yemen to listen  to voice of reason and invest all sources at their disposal for  the reconstruction of their country. "The Yemeni people need  bread and butter and jobs which can be provided through  development projects, not bullets."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Unidentified correspondent] Israel's deputy foreign  minister, Yosi Beilin, is on an official visit to Switzerland.  He met with the state secretary in the Swiss Foreign Ministry,  Jakob Kellenberger, for talks on issues ranging from the Middle  East peace process to closer economic ties between the two  countries. Mr. Kellenberger expressed concern about human  rights in the occupied territories following the Hebron massacre  last week in which a Jewish settler shot over 40 Muslim  worshippers. At a press conference in Berne I asked Mr. Beilin  how much of a threat the massacre poses to the Middle East peace  talks.    [Begin recording] [Beilin] We hope and pray that it won't be  a kind of a setback, and that all parties will understand that  the best answer to the lunatics of this world is not to stop the  process but to accelerate it, so that we will be able to  conclude the negotiations about Gaza and Jericho and to go on to  implement it as soon as possible. And once there is the change  on the ground and once the Palestinians are having their own  police forces and they are in charge of their own business, that  will be the best answer to the extremists who would not like to  see a peaceful solution for the Middle East.    [Correspondent] I wanted to know what measures Israel is  going to take now to reassure the PLO and to get it back to the  negotiating table.    [Beilin] Well, first of all I believe that the most  important  thing is to get back to the negotiating table. We took some  measures but it is mainly for ourselves in order to do whatever  possible to prevent the recurring of such an awful event. We  are speaking about confiscating of the arms of some of the  extremists in the West Bank, about restricting their moves [as  heard], about the first time when there was a closure on a Jewry  [as heard] settlement in the territories. We also released 500  prisoners, Palestinian prisoners, and we are going to continue  this process of releasing prisoners. But I believe that getting  back to the negotiating table should not be a result of those  steps or others, but a real interest of both parties. Because  that is the best and only solution for the situation: Until now  there were about 35 Israelis who have been killed by  Palestinians since the signing of the agreement, there were more  than 50 Palestinians killed in this massacre and later on. We  have to put an end to this bloodshed and the only way to put an  end to it is to sign the agreement between us and to implement  it. The leaderships are ready, we have to educate both our  peoples that there is no better option than that.    [Correspondent] How is Israel planning to ensure the  security  of the Palestinians in the occupied territories?    [Beilin] Well, first of all, I think that the most important  thing is that they will have their own Palestinian police force,  and they may have it if we sign the agreement, and we're  speaking about weeks, not about months. It is a very important  challenge for the Palestinians themselves -- I can understand  the difficulty which is there -- but they have to take this  challenge and to fulfil it. Of course there are Palestinians in  other parts of the West Bank which will not be under the  jurisdiction of the Gaza-Jericho council and we will have to do  whatever possible in order not to expose them to dangers. I  believe that those measures which were taken by the government  and to which I referred to before, will help us in ensuring the  security of the Palestinians.    [Correspondent] Is there any question of moving the settlers  back to Israel?    [Beilin] No, we are not speaking about such a thing. We  agreed with the Palestinians that the whole issue of the future  of the settlements will be considered and debated towards the  permanent solution and we agreed to (?reach) a permanent  solution in five years from now, which means '99, and until then  we will have to negotiate about the future of the borders, of  the settlements. We cannot do such a thing in a very short  while, and I think that we shouldn't. [end recording]    [Correspondent] That was Israel's deputy foreign minister  Yosi Beilin at a press conference in Bern.</p>

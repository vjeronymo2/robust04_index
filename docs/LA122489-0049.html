			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILDLIFE GARDEN  </P> <P> Thank you for the article on Stephanie Lynn's Bel-Air garden "A Garden for the  Birds -- and Other Wildlife" by Robert Smaus (Nov. 19). How lovely to read of  this woman's compassion for the neighboring creatures, and her non-chemical  approach to gardening. One hopes her great success will prompt others to  dispense with spraying, poisoning and other traditional methods in favor of  more harmonious solutions.  </P> <P> STEPHANIE HURTIK  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

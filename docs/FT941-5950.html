			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Greece to go ahead with telecoms sale Greece's socialist government, finally dropping its opposition to privatisation, plans to sell a minority stake in OTE, the state telecommunications company, through a flotation on the Athens stock exchange. The government hopes to raise Dr250bn (Pounds 677m) from the sale of 25 per cent of the company, placing at least half the offering with institutional investors abroad. In a reversal of the socialists' announced policy on privatisation, the Economy Ministry intends to use at least Dr100bn of funds raised by the flotation to help cover an expected shortfall in revenue collection this year. The prime minister, Mr Andreas Papandreou, has maintained until now that income raised from listing state corporations on the bourse would be set aside to modernise them, not transferred to the central budget. However, with revenues in January and February lagging behind the 1994 budget projection, the Economy Ministry is anxious to find fresh sources of revenue without having to impose new taxes. The European Commission, in a recent report on the Greek economy, described this year's budget as unrealistic, calling for immediate measures to avert a revenue shortfall projected at about Dr300bn. Economy Ministry officials said that despite opposition to the listing from OTE's trade union, they were confident the flotation could be launched in October. The Economy Ministry has renewed contacts with international merchant banks that worked with the previous conservative government last year on a plan to dispose of 49 per cent of OTE through a strategic sale to an international telecoms operator, to be followed by a flotation. The plan, fiercely opposed both by trade unions and prominent conservative officials, was abandoned when the socialists came to power last October. However, no decision has so far been taken on re-appointing domestic and international underwriters for the proposed issue. Delays are likely as Mr Giorgos Gennimatas, the economy minister, who takes responsibility for decision-making on privatisation, is seriously ill with cancer.</p>

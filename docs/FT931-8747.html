			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Brussels clears BA takeover of Dan-Air THE European Commission has approved the merger between British Airways and Dan-Air, arguing that it does not significantly affect services between Belgium and Britain. The presence of BA, Sabena, the Belgian flag carrier, and British Midland meant there were three large competitors on the rapidly growing Brussels-London route. The three airlines between them fly 23 times a day from Heathrow to Brussels: BA has seven, Sabena eight and British Midland eight. BA gained four flights as a result of acquiring Dan-Air's low-cost operations at Gatwick last year. But Sabena acquired two extra slots at Heathrow last month. The Belgian government complained in November about the possible anti-competitive impact of the deal. This followed calls from the heads of Air France, the French flag carrier, and Sabena for the Commission to take a more critical view of BA's expansion plans in Europe. Air France, which has a stake in Sabena, also complained about the original Commission decision not to launch a full-scale anti-trust inquiry into BA's acquisition of Dan-Air for a nominal Pounds 1, plus assumption of the ailing airline's liabilities. Belgium resorted to a previously unused clause in the EC's merger rules which allows the Commission's anti-trust authorities to investigate the impact on competition on their national territory. But the Commission said the effects of the BA/Dan-Air merger applied only to the Gatwick-Brussels route. BA's acquisition 'neither creates nor reinforces a dominant position' in Belgium.</p>

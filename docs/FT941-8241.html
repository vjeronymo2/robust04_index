			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Rise in legal claims hits top accountancy firms: Auditors say they are turning away high-risk clients Britain's six largest accountancy firms faced about 600 legal claims last year and paid up to 8 per cent of their audit income on costs related to legal actions. The number of claims has risen sharply in recent years, following growing litigation against auditors in the US, much of it considered by the profession to be unjustified. The figures were compiled for two studies as part of a campaign to reform the law of unlimited liability on auditors and will be submitted to the Department of Trade and Industry. The growing size and number of claims makes commercial insurance cover much more difficult to obtain. Accountancy firms say they have started to turn away high-risk clients, and begun negotiating limits on their legal liability for non-audit work. A working group of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales tackling litigation claims says the average claims in the largest three lawsuits last year were nearly Pounds 500m, compared with Pounds 40m 10 years ago. The figures exclude exceptional claims for more than Dollars 8bn relating to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The largest claims are several times the average limits on commercial insurance cover, currently about Dollars 100m (Pounds 68m). Payments higher than those limits are covered from insurance mutuals and the firms' own resources. The working group's paper is to be discussed by the institute's council on March 2 as part of an effort to win support across the profession for a campaign by the eight largest accountancy firms. Separate information compiled by the firms' insurers showing the proportion of audit income spent on litigation-related costs has been produced at the request of government officials. The accountancy firms want section 310 of the 1985 Companies Act removed. This forbids auditors to negotiate for a cap on their liabilities in the event that they are sued. Some observers have criticised the campaign for its self-interest, and accused the profession of selecting favourable or incomplete data. For example, the fee income figures to which litigation costs are compared do not take into account revenues from non-audit income, such as consultancy work which may have been generated by the audit. The information on which the calculations are based is also not publicly available. The firms refuse to publish any of their own financial information.</p>

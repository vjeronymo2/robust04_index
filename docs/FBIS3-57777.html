After considering  the Downing Street peace declaration, the Ulster Freedom  Fighters [UFF] said they retained the right to "respond  militarily" in 1994.    The outlawed organisation -- the UDA's [Ulster Defence  Association] military wing and the largest of the Protestant  paramilitary groups -- said it was difficult to give a  comprehensive and final response to the deal, but added that  they viewed it sceptically.    A statement late last night said: "It is widely agreed that  the declaration, despite its grand claims regarding consent  freely given, is part of a wider agenda and once again ignores  the reality that the status of Northern Ireland within the  United Kingdom was substantially changed with the imposition of  the Anglo-Irish diktat."    The statement claimed the Government had abdicated its  responsibilities to protect Northern Ireland and its citizens.    In a final warning, the UFF statement added: "So long as  pan-nationalist terror and political coercion continues, we  retain the right to respond militarily in 1994."</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / IDA plans to target poorest THE International Development Association (IDA), provider of low-cost aid to developing countries, said yesterday it would distribute more of its resources to the world's poorest, least creditworthy countries, Reuter reports from Berne. The IDA, an arm of the World Bank, also said its 34 donor countries had agreed to replenish IDA funds with SDR13bn (Pounds 11.8bn) over three years from next July. The IDA 'will reduce the share of its lending to countries able to access international financial markets as well as IDA resources,' said Mr Ernest Stern, World Bank managing director. The countries likely to receive less of IDA's aid than in previous years were China, India, Pakistan, and Nigeria. The 34 donor countries met in Berne to complete the negotiations on the 10th replenishment of IDA resources. In Washington, Mr Lewis Preston, the World Bank's president, said in a speech to the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based research group, that his organisation's efforts to tackle other developmental and environmental problems depended on its success in reducing poverty. Mr Preston called on industrialised nations to help developing countries attack the problems of unclean water, inadequate sanitation, soil degradation and population control.</p>

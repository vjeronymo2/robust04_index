			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Blair condemns 'cuts' in funding of Tecs LABOUR yesterday said that Training and Enterprise Councils are breaking government guarantees on Youth Training by building up waiting lists and cutting spending per trainee, Ralph Atkins writes. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said a Labour survey of 54 out of 82 Tecs showed 'substantial cuts' in funding for training. With unemployment rising, Tecs were being expected to provide more places for less money. He said: 'The government is systematically betraying our young people and the unemployed, forcing severe behind-the-scenes reductions in government support whilst publicly denying that cuts are taking place.' Labour's survey shows 27 Tecs had waiting lists for places on the Youth Training scheme. The average waiting list was 380. The Department of Employment said the waiting lists, which built up in the autumn when many school leavers were looking for places, had been substantially reduced.</p>

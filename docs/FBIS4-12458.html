			<p>BFN     [Text] As part of the Israeli occupation authorities'  piracy off the Lebanese coast, this morning an Israeli gunboat  intercepted a German-flagged ship carrying used cars to Tyre  port. The Israeli pirates searched the ship before allowing it  to enter the port.    Another Israeli gunboat carried out naval patrols all along  the coast from al-Naqurah to Tyre.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by "jj": "Beautiful, Mysterious Formulas"] </F>   [Text] The debate about NATO membership for the East  European states is as honest as all diplomacy that faces an  insoluble dilemma, meaning that it is nothing special. One half  of the dilemma consists of the conviction that the former  satellites of the Soviet Union need and deserve a safe home.  The other half is that the West cannot offer them membership in  the alliance.    There are good and not so good reasons for the denial. The  latter include consideration for Moscow's irritability, which is  ultimately turning into a Russian right of veto over Western  policies. The better reasons include the fear of a watered-down  alliance and of the acceptance of states that would bring too  many internal and external conflicts into the alliance. In  fact, NATO has always drawn its strength from a solid foundation  of identical interests and institutions (with the exception of  Greece and Turkey).    This dilemma explains the vague rhetoric, the "beautiful,  mysterious formulas," as the Estonian president put it. They  include neither dates nor obligations. Still, there is a better  way to avoid the dilemma. Clinton outlined it when he appealed  to the West to speak more about "trade than aid." "Trade  barriers" must be removed quickly. There is no point in  "applauding market reforms" while only "offering selective  access to our markets." Markets mean growth, and prosperity  legitimizes the democratic reform policy -- probably more than  an abstract alliance membership. Moreover, this method has the  advantage of really helping the East Europeans without offending  the Russians.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures tumble SHORT-DATED sterling futures fell sharply yesterday after better-than-expected figures for UK industrial production quashed fledgling hopes of another cut in UK base rates, writes James Blitz. There had been slight optimism at the start of the week about a near-term rate cut following sterling's strong performance on the foreign exchange markets. However, yesterday's industrial production figures for February, which showed a 1.6 per cent rise in the month came as a complete surprise to the market. There was an especially strong focus on the figure for manufacturing output, which showed a 1.2 per cent rise against forecasts of 0.2 per cent. As a result, the June short sterling contract fell 12 basis points from its opening level to bottom out at 94.13, before closing at 94.15. The September contract fell even more heavily, by some 19 basis points, to a low of 94.20 before closing at 94.22. The 94.22 figure was the high point of the futures yield curve. Dealers were effectively pricing in no moves in base rates below 6 per cent. Rates in the cash market firmed by around  1/16 of a percentage point in the wake of the UK data. Three-month sterling deposit rates closed at around 5 15/16 per cent from around 5 27/32 per cent on Tuesday night. The rise in cash rates was remarkable considering the very small shortage of Pounds 450m forecast by the Bank of England at the start of the day. One dealer said that the raft of recent good news on the UK economy had removed any hope of another cut in base rates. The deposit rate yield curve closed flat last night with the bid rate at 6 per cent from 1 month out to 1 year. Another dealer suggested that bullishness could re-emerge if sterling breaks through the DM2.50 level against the D-Mark. He said that conditions in the discount market would make it unlikely that deposit rates would rise far above 6 per cent. In Europe, the 2 basis point cut in the Bundesbank's repo rate depressed sentiment in French and German futures markets. With the rate for 14-day funds reduced to 8.11 per cent, the June Euromark contract fell 7 basis points to close at 92.77. The September contract fell 9 basis points to close at 93.65.</p>

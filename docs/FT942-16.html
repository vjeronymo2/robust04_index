			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (8): Green tide reaches high water mark - Germany, with the world's toughest controls, may be having second thoughts Last December, when the German chemicals industry was still wallowing close to the bottom of the worst profits trough since the war, and still wincing from a media onslaught which followed a rapid-fire series of accidents at Hoechst, it was offered a few crumbs of comfort from an unlikely source. The opposition Social Democrat Party (SPD), in concert with the IG Chemie union, published a position paper on the industry's future. The main recommendations seemed unremarkable: the simplification of environmental legislation and acceleration of planning procedures to facilitate the introduction of 'environmentally-acceptable products'. But the paper, personally endorsed by Mr Rudolf Scharping, SPD leader, marked an important development. The senior opposition party, whose attitude towards the chemicals industry had long been fudged by a lingering attachment to the more rigorous environmental policies of the Greens, had shown that it had heard and deemed justified the industry's most serious complaints about the direction of German environmental policy. The costs of environmental protection are a sore point among chemicals producers in most industrialised countries. But it is the range and complexity of legislation which give the greatest cause for grief within the German industry. Federal laws, arguably the strictest in the world, are overlaid by separate legislation engendered in each of the country's 16 Lander. The result is a scarcely-penetrable entanglement which generates work for enthusiastic and meticulous bureaucrats and frustration for companies which see their attempts to innovate and regain competitiveness repeatedly bogged down. A company seeking to build a new chemicals production plant in the federal republic must observe more than 2,000 laws and regulations. According to industry calculations, the average time taken in Germany to win official approval - be it for planning permission, a new product, change-of-use in existing plant - is 13 months compared with six months elsewhere in Europe. Mr Horst Konig, head of research planning at BASF, says the time and costs involved are becoming increasingly critical as competitors race to be the first - or the cheapest - in the market with new products or techniques. R&amp;D projects, even though carried out with no guarantee of success and subsequent profits, were particularly vulnerable, he wrote in a recent article. He provided an example of a new dye intended for the textiles industry where cost-consciousness is especially keen. The dye was especially promising because it was almost entirely absorbed by cotton fibres and left barely any traces in the waste water. However, the manufacturing process generated three by-products. Even though they were used in other processes and never left the plant in their original form, each had to be checked and approved at a total cost of DM200,000, Dr Konig wrote. Meanwhile, the net of environmental legislation continues to expand and impinge on Germany's fourth-largest exporting sector. The planned Kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetzt - a catch-all law designed to complete the circle of development, production, use and re-use or recycling for new products - allows for no exceptions. The aim of the legislation is to oblige industry to develop new products and the techniques for recycling them in parallel. According to Mr Konig, this will apply even to one-off, low-volume manufacture of experimental materials or products even before a market has been found for them. If research and development in Germany continued to be obstructed by indiscriminate restrictions, valuable jobs in research and application technology would be lost, he wrote. Production would inevitably follow and, in the end, so would scientific knowledge. 'The widespread exodus of gene technology should act as a warning,' he added. The Bonn coalition has already acknowledged that deregulation has an important part to play in ensuring future growth in the German economy, and last year put forward a wide-ranging discussion paper on the subject which was clearly intended to prepare the ground for change. The SPD's position paper - part response to the now-fading cyclical crisis in the chemicals industry, and part campaign document - showed a similar intent. Whoever wins the forthcoming federal election, there are promising signs of a consensus that more flexibility and less red tape are in order. On the other hand, there are no indications from any side that German environmental legislation will be made less rigorous. The aim is more to reconcile the demands of the law with the desire to preserve jobs and encourage the evolution of a more specialised chemicals sector as the old, low added-value production drifts increasingly and inevitably abroad. Mr Klaus Topfer, the Bonn environment minister, recently proclaimed that one of his aims during Germany's impending European Union presidency, was to establish the EU's 'continuously developing' environmental policy as an example to the rest of the world. In consort with his French counterpart, Mr Michel Barnier, he said he would press for higher security and protection standards all round, and more stringent application of existing regulations. In the future, he said, he expected the four EU membership candidates, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria, to strengthen the ranks of the advocates of environmental protection. Europe must come to appreciate that a vigorous environmental policy offered economic opportunities. It was doubtless coincidental, but on the same day Mr Heinrich von Lersner, president of the federal environmental agency, chose to highlight some of the economic advantages. He argued strongly against the advocates of a 'pause' in environmental legislation. His 20 years' experience had taught him that neglect of the environment damaged the economy while investment in its protection almost always paid dividends. The world market for protection technology was now worth Dollars 285m a year. The US had 16 per cent, Japan 13 per cent, but Germany was still market leader with a 21 per cent share. There was a danger, Mr Lersner noted, that Germany would lose its lead if potential purchasers were put off by warnings that environmental protection was bad for an economy's health.</p>

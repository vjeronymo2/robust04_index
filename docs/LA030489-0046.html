			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SPORTS NEWS GETS LOST AMID THE GLOSS  </P> <P> If Scott Ostler really needs to keep tabs on sports news, I suggest he skip  Sports Illustrated and invest in a magazine without glossy pages and lots of  advertisements. You get more sports and less skin that way.  </P> <P> CHRIS KRECHTER  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

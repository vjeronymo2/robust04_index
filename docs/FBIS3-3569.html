The region has issued a total of 52 laws and regulations in  line with local conditions since 1978, safeguarding its economic  development, according to an official from the Standing  Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region People's Congress.    Tibet, one of the five autonomous regions in China, has been  given full minority nationality autonomy to make laws and carry  out the country's laws and regulations in line with its own  conditions.    The 52 new laws and regulations cover politics, economy,  culture, education, science and technology, and nationality and  religious affairs.    A law adopted in 1990 on mining has protected the region's  mineral resources against being excessively mined by collective  enterprises and private mining households.    Regulations formulated in 1992 on environmental protection  have put one-quarter of the region's areas under the region's  protection.    Meanwhile, the Tibetan Autonomous Region has also revised or  terminated laws which no longer suit the region's opening-up and  growing economy.</p>

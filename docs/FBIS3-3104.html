Addressing the China petroleum investment conference which  opened here today, he said China "offers much scope for oil  exploration and development" and has "bright prospects for  economic growth and the growth of the oil sector."    Therefore, he said, China "has a strong interest in helping  to maintain a reasonable level of oil prices, which will  encourage further investment."

Addressing the opening, Wang Tao, president of the China  National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), spelt out China's  strategy to develop its oil industry.    He said China has opened its petroleum industry to the  outside world and thus provided more opportunities to foreign  investors.

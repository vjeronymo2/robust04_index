			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Teachers oppose training proposal MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, yesterday added fuel to his confrontation with teachers' unions by announcing plans to allow non-graduates to teach in primary schools. The proposal, which is intended to take effect from September 1994, met with a furious response from teachers and head teachers on the day that the controversial national curriculum tests on Shakespeare for 14-year-olds were widely boycotted. One-year courses would be introduced for teaching children up to the age of seven. These would be open to mature students without degrees, provided they had experience of dealing with children, and had sufficient academic qualifications to gain entry to higher education. Mr Patten also intends to diversify entrance to the teaching profession with a new three-year BEd course which would qualify students to teach all six subjects of the national curriculum for primary schools. Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers said he strongly opposed the move away from graduate entry. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, said the union was considering a boycott of the new training arrangements. He said: 'There's certainly no requirement in our contracts to train people from scratch.' Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: 'The government's plan is an attack on the all-graduate agreed by Margaret Thatcher in 1974. Lady Thatcher must be turning in her ermine.' Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, described the plan as 'one of the barmiest government schemes to date'.</p>

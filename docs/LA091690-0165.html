			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INFANT TRAPPED AT BOTTOM OF HOLE  </P> <P> A toddler fell to the bottom of a 12-foot narrow construction hole Saturday  afternoon and firefighters, hampered by the danger of a cave-in, worked into  the night trying to rescue him.  </P> <P> Firefighters broke through a layer of hard clay shortly after 9 p.m. in their  efforts to dig a parallel shaft to rescue 20-month-old Kevin Davis from the  hole at his family's home in southeast Denver.  </P> <P> The shaft Kevin fell into is about 18 inches wide at the top and was to be  filled with reinforced concrete for a remodeling project.  </P> <P> Denver policeman W. C. Hoffman said the threat of a cave-in diminished after  diggers finally broke through the clay that had slowed digging efforts  throughout the night.  </P> <P> The boys' parents, Tom and Lisa Davis, were talking to Kevin, trying to soothe  him during the rescue effort. Oxygen was being pumped into the shaft.  </P></p>

The 18 EZLN representatives arrived in three groups from the  Lacandona Jungle, where the guerrillas have settled since the  war began on 1 January, in vehicles supplied by the  International Red Cross. "Subcommander Marcos," whose identity  is unknown, arrived in the first group, made up of eight  delegates, accompanied by Peace Commissioner Camacho Solis and  Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas and mediator  in the conflict. The group, which was greeted with applause and  shouts from people who gathered at the main plaza in San  Cristobal, arrived from the nearby town of San Andres Laraizal,  40 km west of San Cristobal.    A second group made up of seven rebels arrived from  Ocosingo,  some 90 km east of San Cristobal, and a third group, made up of  three guerrillas, arrived shortly after noontime (local time)  from Las Margaritas, 100 km south of San Cristobal.    The EZLN delegates gathered at the San Cristobal Cathedral,  site of the peace talks scheduled to begin at 1100 (1700 GMT) on  Monday [21 February].    "We will not turn in our weapons, definitely not. We have  learned from other countries where rebels disarmed and then were  repressed and exploited again," one of the rebels who arrived  from Las Margaritas said.    All the delegates, including "Marcos," wore EZLN uniforms  and  had their faces covered with ski masks or scarves. None carried  weapons.    The cathedral in San Cristobal de las Casas is protected by  three "security cordons," made up of members of the  International Red Cross, nongovernment human rights  organizations, and unarmed policemen.</p>

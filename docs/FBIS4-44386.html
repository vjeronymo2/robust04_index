			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Russian Marshal Yevgeniy </F> Shaposhnikov by Laure Mandeville in Paris on the occasion of the  "Eurosatory" land-based weapons fair; date not given: "Russia  Has Made Too Many Concessions to NATO"]    [Text] The former Russian defense minister, who is close  to Boris Yeltsin, is worrying about the Atlantic Alliance's  tendency to act as the world's policeman.    "In signing NATO's Partnership for Peace [PfP], Russia has  shown haste and passiveness. How can we be satisfied with the  expansion and strengthening of the NATO military bloc when we,  the Russians, have made concessions beyond anything that the  international community could have imagined!"    In the mouth of Russian Marshal Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov, on a  stopover in Paris for the Eurosatory arms exhibition, the  questioning of the "partnership" may seem particularly  unexpected. This reformist officer, who made a large  contribution to the failure of the August 1991 Communist putsch,  is known for his fidelity to President Yeltsin. Moreover, since  last winter, he has become his special representative within the  powerful state company Rosvooruzheniye, responsible for the  thorny question of Russian arms sales abroad. His "outburst"  must therefore be taken for what it is: a polite but strong  warning against marginalizing and humiliating Russia, a plea for  a new collective security system.    "No, I have not changed, I am still in favor of cooperation  with the West," he said smiling, when concern was expressed  about the hardening of his stance. "What I am trying to say is  that this cooperation has started badly, that it bears the stamp  of an extremely dangerous imbalance."    The marshal explained his fears: "If you stand back a little  from what has happened in recent years, you will understand more  clearly the concerns of the Russian military. They have the  impression that they have taken huge steps toward cooperation.  But without deriving any real benefit from it. Communist  ideology has been abandoned, the Warsaw Pact has disappeared,  the Soviet Union has collapsed, our troops are withdrawing from  the whole of East Europe and the Baltic countries.... And on  the other side, what do we see? That the NATO military bloc is  still there and that, far from disappearing, it is expanding and  growing stronger, even aspiring to the role of [becoming the]  armed wing of the United Nations, the world's policeman. You  must admit that there is reason to ask questions." Yeltsin's  opposition is doing so wholeheartedly, he stressed with some  anxiety. "The extreme nationalists grouped under the Rutskoy  and Zhirinovskiy banner can easily say that Russia has lost  everything and that the West is dictating its will. For the  average Russian, caught up in his everyday economic problems,  these remarks produce a special response. People are becoming  suspicious about the West's intentions."  <H5>  Security `On One Leg' </H5>   Marshal Shaposhnikov has not reached that stage. But he is  worried by the emergence of a NATO bloc which, through its  association with Russia, is complicating Russia's relations with  its big Chinese neighbor. "Russia is Russia, it cannot blindly  adopt the West's mechanisms, it must be able to continue to walk  its path between Europe and Asia. Remember that it has never  been able to accept foreign diktat for long."    What he rejects in the PfP is that, according to him, it  leads to "an extremely unbalanced international scene, based on  just one leg, one pillar." The marshal explained: "This  monolithism is not satisfactory. It introduces a hierarchical  organization among states, which is not acceptable. At the top,  there is the United States which leads, then come the NATO  member countries, then the states associated with NATO, like  Russia or Albania, then all the others...."    In his opinion, it would be better to vigorously reject this  bloc rationale and strengthen the military structures of the  United Nations. "The mechanisms exist, they must be brought  into play, we must create a veritable UN command for the  peacekeeping forces," the marshal said with enthusiasm,  brandishing the flow charts he has drawn himself: "At the  regional level, the various existing organizations -- the CSCE,  the CIS, ASEAN -- could, under UN control, equip themselves with  military structures and a security council. And NATO could  become the armed branch of the CSCE!"    For the time being, he admits, the Western countries are  not ready to really call things into question. "The NATO member  states felt that they needed to think about the future of their  organization, now that the enemy is down. But they have not  been capable of carrying through their reasoning. They have  only produced the PfP. That is not enough."    Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov admits that he can understand them.  "They are afraid of Russia, afraid of destabilization. They are  not therefore in any hurry to disarm."    However, Russia must not be driven into a corner, there must  not be constant attempts to weaken it. "We have reached a  threshold beyond which, if we are forced to back down further,  we will be driven into revanchist positions."  <H5>  From Rwanda to Georgia </H5>   Suddenly the marshal grew angry: "I am thinking of our  policy within the CIS, in the Caucasus for instance. I admit  that I was very surprised to hear some French officials accuse  Russia of hegemonic aspirations. The intervention mission which  we are carrying out in Georgia has been decided at the request  of the two sides in the conflict. It must not be forgotten that  this region has been part of Russian cultural and political  space for centuries. We therefore have obligations over there.  So why question our intentions? Am I expressing surprise at  the dispatch of a French military force to Rwanda? Am I talking  of hegemonism? And yet, the ties which bind France to that  African country are much more tenuous than those which we have  with Georgia!"    The same type of argument is behind his analysis of Russia's  access to the international arms market. "The Russians cannot  be prevented from having a presence on that market. Do we frown  when the French supply Mirage planes to Taiwan. No. We  therefore ask that nobody should express surprise when we sign a  contract to sell MIG planes to the Malaysians."    "You know," he added, "I do not represent the Russian  military-industrial complex, but I receive the directors of  military factories every day in my office. Their economic and  social problems are awful. They are trying to solve them...  Our aim is not to inundate the world with our weapons but to  find our place on the market, in accordance with the rules of  competition."    In the specific sphere of the control of Russian arms sales  by the state, the Rosvooruzheniye company has made great  progress, according to the marshal. The Mafia structures which  had seized control of this profitable sector at the time of the  USSR's collapse, have been "dismantled."</p>

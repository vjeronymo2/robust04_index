			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Phoenix-based Talley Industries Inc. said it has agreed to sell TRW Inc. its  air bag business for $85 million and a share of royalties on technology over  the next 12 years. The transaction could be worth $125 million, Talley Chairman  William H. Mallender said. Talley has developed the air bag modules in nearby  Mesa, Ariz. It has reserved the right to cancel the royalty entitlement any  time after the first two years in exchange for about $38 million in cash,  before adjustments, Mallender said. In August, 1987, Talley and TRW,  headquartered in Cleveland, signed a long-term contract for Talley to supply  TRW 100% of its requirements for driver-side air bag modules for some  automobile models.  </P></p>

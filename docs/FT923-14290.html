			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Arts: Quality in proportion some forty years on - Television The devotion of the entire BBC2 schedule on Sunday evening to A Night With Alan Bennett - with the programmes chosen by him - has been dismissed by some commentators as merely another way of dressing up a bundle of old repeats. This seems overly cynical. In the past 40 years British television has produced some superb material and it would be absurd if there were no repertory system enabling us either to see admired programmes again or to catch up on some we have missed. Though I had already seen the 1973 episode of Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads and possess a cassette copy of Mike Leigh's exquisitely embarrassing drama Abigail's Party, I was glad to watch both again and modify my feelings about them. The comedy is over-rated and suggests that today's sitcoms may not be as inferior as we tend to feel (One Foot In The Grave on BBC1 on the same evening was far funnier than the old Likely Lads episode, though to be fair Bennett's choice was doubtless limited by what is available in the archive). The Leigh drama is probably the best he has ever done, though its appeal seems increasingly clearly to depend upon sheer snobbery. Having never seen Melvyn Bragg's 1965 Monitor profile of Sir John Barbirolli or Malcolm Mowbray's bizarre and captivating 1981 drama Days At The Beach, I was delighted to be given 'another chance to see' both, and cannot understand why people who happily pay money at the cinema to see Casablanca for the umpteenth time (yes, yes, of course it is a terrific movie) claim that they are being cheated if television shows any programme more than once. As the number of television channels grows it is surely more important than ever that at least 20 or 30 per cent of material produced by any self respecting television service ought to be worthy of - indeed demanding - a repeat. Perhaps the most interesting aspects of this evening, however, were Bennett's remarks in introducing his choices. In contrast to Frank Muir's flippant and almost pointless comments in the Channel 4 series TV Heaven, Bennett's were thoughtful and pointed. The odd thing is that, seeing Bennett as such a devotee of the past, so ready to luxuriate in nostalgia, I found myself reacting against his pessimism about the present standards of British television, even though his remarks mainly chimed with the recent tone of this column. Rightly enough, Bennett criticised our recent governments for doing so much to harm British television. But when, like so many others, he sighs for the days of 'Play For Today' and the period of Cathy Come Home and Edna The Inebriate Woman, praising the regular stretching of the audience's imagination and giving the impression that there is no longer anything to compare with those days, somebody should remind him of GBH and Tumbledown, Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit, and even his own Talking Heads. At least until fairly recently British television has continued to produce a remarkable proportion of programmes which, judged against international standards, are outstanding. But there is that bogy word again: proportion. However many impressive programmes one can name from the past few years to challenge the supposed supremacy of sixties television, the rush down-market which is occurring right now is difficult to deny. What is so worrying for the future of television is not the feeling that there is nobody left with the desire or ability to make good programmes, but the feeling that they are being overtaken by a rapidly growing avalanche of trivia. The cheap, shallow, sensational and instantly forgettable is on the increase at the expense of that which is thoughtful, difficult, demanding and inspiring. Most disheartening is not merely the increase in formula programmes and the decrease in individual and idiosyncratic material, which I suspect is a major part of Bennett's complaint, but those rapidly changing proportions. Instead of just filling quite a lot of time, trivia is beginning to seem universally dominant. . . except on BBC2, which is already starting to look like the last redoubt of the thinking viewer. Take the big television topic of the week in the tabloid press: BBC1's Eldorado. As soap operas go, there is not a lot wrong with this one. It neatly folds in some of the glitz of Dallas with the sort of girls and boys who swarm in Neighbours, and raises the sex quotient a bit: today's episode has the faded blonde torch singer, Trish, in bed with her teenage German toyboy, Dieter. No doubt there will be protests about the nine o'clock watershed. The sun, sea and sand make a change from a Manchester terrace or an east London square; where the existing soaps are Anglo-dismal this one is Euro-fun. True it is tediously anti-man (the plumber can't plumb, the toyboy can't toy, a husband cannot even be relied upon to put a prepared chicken in the oven) but in today's television that is more than trendy, it is de rigueur. It would be curmudgeonly to deny viewers the right to bathe their work-weary minds in lukewarm soapsuds if that is what they want, and apparently millions do. But is it not a little worrying that BBC1 is using it to fill six half-hour slots a week (three episodes, each with a repeat)? Since the same network is already providing 10 doses a week of Neighbours and three of EastEnders it is a significant increase in soap at the expense of other material on a channel which seven years ago contained no soap at all. Of course soap opera is not the only symbol of this rapid and radical change. On Saturday, Channel 4 launched a current affairs series tellingly called The Big Picture Show, the sort of title hitherto used for children's programmes or cinema series. There is nothing wrong with the intention, which is to deal with some major topic (this week crime) by breaking it down into its constituents and having an 'expert', or a journalist willing to act like one, expatiate upon each bit. The ominous point is that instead of trusting the quality of their journalism, the producers have felt it necessary to 'sell' the thing by getting Clement Freud's buxom, bubbly daughter Emma to front it. Thus at every opportunity the camera comes back to her, so that she can read a bit of autocue and bounce the key light off her lipstick. All promotions for the programme - in listings magazines, press releases and so on - feature sultry photos of La Freud rather than the subject matter or the expert journalists. Yet however questionable that may be, it looks like dinner at All Souls when compared to ITV's new tabloid series at 7.15 on Sundays, The Richard And Judy Show. This employs the husband and wife team of Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan, presenters of ITV's daytime magazine programme This Morning. They sit in a studio and ask toe-curlingly embarrassing questions. The tone mixes cosiness, prurience and funk. Thus Roy Cornes, the man at the centre of the campaign by people in Birmingham to put the Aids frighteners on heterosexuals, was first handed an all-purpose Freudian get-out by Madeley, then encouraged to chat about condoms by Finnigan, but never required even to hear the words 'anal intercourse' from either. John and Jan Ward, parents of the young woman who disappeared in Kenya, presumed murdered, were interviewed about the state of their marriage, and so on. It is too soon to be sure that Alan Bennett is right about the decline of British television drama, but in television generally you can hardly miss the current leapfrog scramble to get as far down market as possible.</p>

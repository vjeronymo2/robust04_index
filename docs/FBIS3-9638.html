During the conference the two presidents stressed their  common wish to develop bilateral relations in all areas and  stressed that a climate of mutual confidence prevails between  the two countries. During Demirel's visit to Romania, the sides  have examined concrete means of further cooperation, especially  in the economic sphere. During the news conference the sides  stressed the importance of cooperation in the Black Sea area and  of next month's meeting in Bucharest within the framework of the  International Forum of Crans Montana.    Demirel said that the friendship between Turkey and Romania  does not harm anybody and added that it is most important to  ensure stability in our countries and throughout the region. He  noted that Romania and Turkey have a joint wish that, through  bilateral efforts, they should contribute to the establishment  of stability in the region.    Similarly, President Demirel wished to stress the extremely  important mission incumbent on our countries, namely, to be a  bridge connecting Europe and Asia.    In reply to journalists' questions, the Turkish president  declared that he welcomed the U.S. initiative in  Bosnia-Herzegovina as a way to stop the bloodshed, regardless of  which sides might cause it. President Demirel also said that he  did not understand the international opposition to having  Turkish soldiers sent to Bosnia within the framework of the  peacekeeping forces, given that this is a decision made by the  United Nations.    In turn, President Ion Iliescu said that Romania will not  send soldiers to the peacekeeping mission in the former  Yugoslavia in view of the UN decision stipulating that direct  neighbors should not contribute to the peacekeeping forces.    During the news conference the Turkish president mentioned  that he had invited Romania's president to pay an official visit  to Turkey, and Ion Iliescu had accepted the invitation with  pleasure.</p>

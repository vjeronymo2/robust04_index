			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Premek Houzvicka: "The Number of Classified </F> Facts on the Activity of the Interior Ministry Has Declined  Since 1991"]    [Text] The amount of classified data on the activity of  the Interior Ministry, to which the law on official and state  secrets applies and which cannot therefore be published, has not  increased over the past few years. On the contrary, their  number has declined since 1991. For instance, information  regarding the work and location of individual departments of the  ministry is still being kept secret for the time being.    This is what Jan Subert, Interior Ministry press spokesman,  said at a news conference yesterday. But, he added, the  situation in the Interior Ministry's car pool (amounting to  11,599 official cars and 7,729 passenger cars at present),  general information on the arsenal of Interior Ministry members,  and the management of financial funds from the state budget are  neither secret nor top secret information.    "A complex report on the ministry's conduct of economic  affairs, containing roughly 600 pages of text, has been  presented to deputies," Deputy Interior Minister Jaroslav  Kopriva said. "Of all this material, only about 2 percent can  be considered secret information," he added. He also said that,  according to him, the Interior Ministry's economic management is  not unintelligible, but it contains a lot of individual items.    According to Jan Frolik, archive worker at the Interior  Ministry, the state secrets act applies only to information, the  classification of which is in the interest of the state. [The  obligation not to divulge] official secrets can also be applied  to some parts of the public administration, such as the police,  counterintelligence, the courts, or the state attorney office.  The Interior Ministry will also consider publishing a so-called  white book, which should contain all information about the  activity of the Interior Ministry that has not been declared  secret. "The coordination of the work between the ministry and  journalists could also improve that way," Frolik added.  According to Frolik, publishing a white book has proved to be  very useful in some Western countries. On the subject of  lifting the vow of secrecy regarding various aspects of the  Interior Ministry's work, Frolik said that it could be lifted  during court proceedings, for example, but that does not mean  that the person's obligation not to divulge secrets would be  lifted in general. "This person's vow of secrecy was lifted  only to the benefit of specific bodies," Frolik added.    Press Spokesman J. Subert refused to comment on the question  of whether Czech intelligence members are active abroad at  present.</p>

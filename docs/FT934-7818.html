			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Banner seeks Pounds 3m and full listing BANNER HOMES, the Buckinghamshire-based housebuilder, yesterday called for Pounds 2.9m via a rights issue and also announced plans to move from the USM to the main market. The cash call is of 3.61m new shares at 89p, fully underwritten by Charterhouse Bank, on a 2-for-7 basis. Brokers to the issue are Charterhouse Tilney Securities. The money raised will enable Banner to 'finance its plans based on its strong land position.' It will also help to reduce debt. Mr Stuart Crossley, chairman and chief executive, together with connected interests, currently own 10.1m shares - or 79.8 per cent of the equity. In addition to the money raised, they are to place their rights entitlement, amounting to 2.88m shares, with institutions, leaving their interest in the company at 62.1 per cent. The move to a full listing is expected to take effect from December 13. Banner now owns or controls 38 sites with potential for building 800 units. Its target is to complete some 70 units in the year ending March 31 1994 and to increase this to about 150 units by end-March 1995. The group currently manages two BES housebuilding companies and holds a 10.7 per cent interest in each. It has entered into a put and call option to acquire all of the assets and liabilities of the two companies in April 1995.</p>

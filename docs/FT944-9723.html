			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (10): The importance of saying 'maybe' - The chequered fortunes of the state-owned Credit Lyonnais A decade ago, Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank, launched a publicity slogan that has haunted it ever since: 'The power to say yes.' In the past few months, its directors, customers and shareholders have all wished that, instead, it had exercised its power to say 'no' rather more often. A string of activities that look extremely embarrassing in hindsight continues to hover over its future prosperity: loans to MGM, the film comany, an extraordinarily unprofitable property portfolio, and financial support to Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial French businessman and politician, to name just a few. While the French government, the controlling shareholder in the bank, claims that it spotted troubles starting to emerge in 1992, action took rather longer. Mr Jean-Yves Haberer was removed as head of the bank last November - although initially to be given another important banking job. In his place, the state appointed Mr Jean Peyrelevade, formerly head of UAP, the French insurance group. However, the financial problems at Credit Lyonnais were brought into sharp focus only in March this year when the bank declared record losses of FFr6.9bn, and the state underwrote FFr42bn worth of its property portfolio. This was followed by a FFr4.9bn capital increase announced over the summer with money from the state and other - somewhat reluctant - shareholders. In July, a parliamentary inquiry criticised the bank and its directors, attacking its property investments but also - more controversially - the extent to which the state itself had pushed the bank into propping up state-owned industries. But the bad news did not end there. At the end of September, Credit Lyonnais reported further losses for the half-year of FFr4.5bn. It announced further provisions of FFr10.1bn, and is widely expected to require perhaps the same amount again before dispensing with the legacy of the past. Meanwhile, Mr Peyrelevade has been playing a delicate game against the state. While he pleaded for additional financial support to prevent the risk of the bank falling below minimum solvency levels, the government held back from publicly providing the necessary reassurance at the time of a high budget deficit. The result has been a diplomatic compromise. Mr Peyrelevade simply states in the passive voice that the problems of the past will no longer be an issue after the start of next year. The government emphasises that it will support depositors but everything must happen in the right order, meaning a full evaluation of the provisions that are really necessary before there is any offer of unconditional extra support. Observers have questioned whether Credit Lyonnais has yet gone far enough in its strategy for reform. It is proceeding with an asset disposal programme agreed by the government at the time of the recapitalisation, but the signs are that it is already falling behind in its timetable and in the value of realisations. It is also resisting attempts to sell any of its core activities, notably its operations in Europe including perhaps the most comprehensive retail branch network across the continent: something which it is convinced is the secret of success for the future. Others are less convinced. The events of the last few months have certainly had a powerfully detrimental effect on the bank's certificats d'investissement, its only publicly traded shares, although a number of analysts now believe the worst is over. But Mr Peyrelevade admits that the negative publicity may have also reduced the number of new customers attracted over the last few months. In an unprecedented effort to boost morale for clients and staff alike, Credit Lyonnais launched a FFr18m advertising campaign in some 70 newspapers early last month. The centrepiece was an 'open doors evening' at local branches across France to pose questions to the staff about its losses and financial stability. An estimated 40,000 people turned up between 5pm and 9pm to quiz several thousand volunteer staff in 1,900 of Credit Lyonnais' 2,100 branches around the country. Mr Peyrelevade himself went to a branch in his home town of Marseilles, with many other senior and middle-ranking headquarters staff getting out to different offices. An internal briefing document circulated to the bank's staff in the past few days gave them detailed responses to a number of Credit Lyonnais' critics. It told them to be natural, professional and positive, and advised them in the event of 'an incident' to take more emotional clients to a more isolated place to discuss and maintain the bank's position 'but always with a smile'. Much of the French press was sceptical about the success of this event. Certainly, many customers in the bank's branches in Paris seemed more concerned about withdrawing cash from wall dispensers and struggling home in the rush hour rather than asking questions - although one manager suggested the problem was the competition from three televised football matches that evening. But, speaking on French radio, Mr Peyrelevade said that the critical reaction was typically Parisian, and that in many other parts of the country the evening was well received. An opinion poll conducted by Credit Lyonnais with 500 of the branches that participated suggested three-quarters came to ask questions, just over half to express support and 19 per cent to complain. Nevertheless, in the view of the staff afterwards, about 30 per cent of customers left still bearing concerns about the bank's financial difficulties or scandals. Such opinions will continue to haunt Credit Lyonnais, and remind its managers - if they get the chance - of the importance of continuing to say 'maybe' rather more often.</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Whisper of privatisation in the trees - James Buxton on the varied reactions to a review of the future of forestry in Britain 'NOTHING BUT good can come of it.' That was the reaction of a senior figure in the forestry industry to last week's news that the government has set up an inter-departmental committee to review the future of forestry in Britain. The committee, chaired by the Scottish Office but including civil servants from other ministries including the Treasury, is looking both at the future ownership of the Forestry Commission's woodlands, and at the effectiveness of government incentives for tree planting. Many in British forestry think the government now has a chance to give the industry a new structure, by both privatising the Forestry Commission's 900,000 hectares of woodland and improving the incentives for tree planting. But the Labour party and conservation groups fear privatisation would mean less access to woods for the public, and would weaken the drive for 'sensitive forestry'. In British forestry 1988 was a watershed year. In the budget Mr Nigel Lawson, the chancellor, announced the abolition of tax incentives for tree planting and their replacement with greatly enhanced grants. People in forestry now admit that the old system had brought forestry into disrepute, with the planting of trees on the environmentally sensitive Flow country of Caithness in Scotland as a tax shelter for the wealthy being a final excess. But since then the rate of tree planting has fallen from its all-time peak of 29,000 ha in the year to March 1988 to 17,300 ha in 1992 (the government's target of 33,000 ha a year has never been attained). As before, most trees are planted by private landowners, with the Forestry Commission planting only 3,000 ha in 1992. A greater proportion of newly planted trees, especially in England, are broad-leaved rather than conifers, The forestry and timber industries would like to see more trees planted. Mr Peter Johnson, chairman of Tilhill Economic Forestry, a Booker subsidiary, says: 'Forestry is a wonderful industry. Trees grow twice as fast here than in most of the countries we import from. Our processing industry is state of the art. But we are being held back.' He would like to see changes in the tax regulations to encourage individual savers to invest in forestry, by granting forestry unit trusts the same tax treatment as forestry owners enjoy. 'Productive timber is currently owned by fewer than 5,000 individuals in Britain. Yet 200,000 people make voluntary contributions for tree planting to the Woodland Trust. We need to create a vehicle through which they can make a return.' Mr Robert Rickman, a forestry specialist who is a director of Forestry Investment Management, a consultancy, says forestry now has a chance to 'shake off the stigmas of the past. It could be a successful industry but we cannot benefit from it because we don't have the right structure.' He is a strong advocate of privatising the Forestry Commission's woods. The commission split itself into two in 1992, with the Forestry Authority regulating planting and handing out grants, and the Forestry Enterprise running the commission's forests. Privatisation, he and others believe, would generate efficiencies and free the Forestry Enterprise from stultifying Treasury constraints. He now thinks privatisation would best be achieved by breaking up the estate and selling it in large geographically defined chunks, which would mostly be acquired by financial institutions, landowners and timber users. Mr Rickman believes the Forestry Enterprise might be worth Pounds 1.5bn on the basis of the real rate of return which he thinks it capable. Woods with high amenity value would be separated out and handed over to conservation bodies or local authorities. Although the Ramblers Association last week was quick to voice its disapproval of privatisation, on the grounds that it threatened people's 'freedom to roam', Mr Rickman says: 'Public access on foot causes forestry owners no problems at all. The only problems might occur where the local gentry go shooting.' The Forestry Commission, based in Edinburgh and digesting its latest change of structure, is watching events with foreboding, but is unable to comment. It is aware that stripped of its woods, it would be a slender organisation. Mr Robin Cutler, its chief executive, was formally head of forestry in New Zealand where commercial woods were privatised. He is said to have found it an unhappy experience.</p>

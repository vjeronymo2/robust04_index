			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Leticia (Colombia), 22 Jan (EFE) -- Colombian  President Cesar Gaviria today rejected the wave of criticisms  leveled against his government for allowing U.S. troops to enter  the country for cooperation missions and asserted that Americans  have been in Colombia since World War II.    The statement has prompted strong criticism of the  government  and president, particularly from the opposition, although some  of the president's own party members have also been critical.    Gaviria said that although citizens have a right to protest,  behind these criticisms he perceives the presence of "dark  forces" with personal interests that include drug trafficking.    "I want to point out that U.S. soldiers have been in  Colombia  since the end of World War II. In every administration,  military missions have provided cooperation in accordance with  the Inter-American Reciprocal Assistance Treaty," Gaviria said.    Gaviria asserted that this cooperation is intended "to  train,  equip, and professionalize our Armed Forces in aerial matters  and to provide cooperation in the struggle against drug  trafficking."    The president said it is a paradox that while numerous  clandestine flights "violate our sovereignty every day," such a  fuss is being made over "cooperation requested by the Colombian  Armed Forces."    "Joint engineering exercises have also been carried out,  such  as those in Juanchaco, those in San Jose del Guavi, and those  under way in Puerto Lopez, where a river outpost is being built.  Most of the residents of the regions in question want these  projects" Gaviria said.    "This," he added, "does not mean that citizens should not  demand explanations or ask why the cooperation is taking place,  but many of the criticisms are ill-intentioned and the result of  obscure interests linked to drug trafficking."</p>

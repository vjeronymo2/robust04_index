Speaking at the London launch of "Climate Change: The  Challenge and the Opportunities", the 1994 Energy Efficiency  Roadshows, a series of high profile regional conferences and  exhibitions featuring top speakers from all sectors of industry  and commerce, Mr Gummer said:    "Although the UK economy has grown by a quarter since 1979,  we are still using the same amount of energy. With cost  effective improvements, some 20 per cent of current energy  demand can be cut, therefore cutting CO2 emissions and helping  to reduce the threat of climate change.''    "Everyone - from local and central Government, households,  businesses and the public sector - has a part to play.  Businesses, which account for nearly half of all UK CO2  emissions, should aim to implement a four-point plan of action:''    "First - board level commitment must be made to energy  management. The 'Making a Corporate Commitment' campaign is the  ideal vehicle. It calls for the development of energy and fuel  efficient strategies, and asks organisations to set performance  improvement targets and ensure that plans are considered  regularly at board level;''    "Secondly - energy management must be integrated with other  environmental initiatives and with environmental reporting;''    "Thirdly - combined heat and power [CHP] schemes produce  more  energy than by conventional electricity generation. CHP produces  fewer greenhouse gases and fuel bills are in many cases up to 40  per cent lower; and''    "Finally - we need to encourage good habits at home which  will be carried over to the work-place - and vice versa. The  need to change attitudes and habits is just as great as making  buildings, products and technologies more energy efficient."  <H5>  Mr Gummer Continued: </H5>   "With this plan, the Government can look confidently at a  partnership with business to save 2.5 million tonnes of carbon  by the year 2000. And I am pleased to announce the launch next  week of Energy Advice Week, which will be encouraging  householders to become energy efficient and save money on fuel  bills. This emphasises the Government's commitment to energy  efficiency in all sectors of the community - indeed, we are  encouraging the domestic sector to cut its carbon emissions by 4  million tonnes by the end of the century.''    "The Week, which runs from 12 to 20 February, aims to make  the public aware of the simple energy efficiency measures they  can take every day, and will provide advice and information on  how to make savings of up 100 pounds annually on fuel bills."</p>

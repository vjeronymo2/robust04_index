			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Tyagniryadno: "How To Make St. Petersburg </F> a Safe City"]    [Text] Leaders of the preelection bloc Democratic Unity of  St. Petersburg rejected the idea of coming to an agreement in  the first round of voting with other blocs concerning the  consolidation of votes and the coordinated withdrawal of  candidacies in favor of aspirants having the greatest chance of  getting elected. Aleksandr Belyayev, leader of the bloc,  reported this at a news conference yesterday.    However, according to his words, such a position does not  mean that the DUP [Democratic Unity of St. Petersburg] will not  cooperate with other blocs in the second round of the elections.  The bloc is conducting negotiations on the possible mutual  support of candidates who won the sympathy of the voters in the  first round.    But yesterday the DUP finally published its preelection  program. Its main thesis--St. Petersburg should become a safe  city, which includes the guarantee of the personal safety of  citizens, a fight against crime and corruption, a fight against  ecological crimes, and the prevention of social conflicts. The  social and economic policy of the municipal authorities should  be subordinated to these tasks.    As for the fate of the head of the executive authority of  the  city, Aleksandr Belyayev did not agree with certain preelection  associations that are proposing holding mayoral elections before  the end of this year. In his opinion, conditions have not yet  ripened for early elections.</p>

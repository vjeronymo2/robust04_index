			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- Japan's benchmark money  supply grew 1.6 percent in January from a year before, the Bank  of Japan said in a preliminary report Thursday [17 February].    That was up 0.2 percentage point from a revised 1.4 percent  year-to-year expansion for December, the report said.    The broader measure of liquidity, including postal savings,  government bonds and investment trusts, rose 3.0 percent in  January from a year before, after a preliminary 2.9 percent  year-to-year gain in December.    The closely watched money supply figure measures cash in  circulation, time and demand deposits and certificates of  deposit (CDs). Its outstanding balance for January averaged  513.7 trillion yen, the central bank said.    The January 1.6 percent year-on-year increase marked the  first growth pace pickup in four months.    Although January's year-to-year money supply growth exceeded  that of December, it represented one-time factors rather than a  change in trend, a central bank official said.    He predicted money supply growth would stay in the 1.0-2.0  percent range for the next couple of months, as it has since May.    One factor making the January figure look bigger was the end  of the effect on year-to-year comparisons caused by a change  last year in the tax system to monthly payments of inheritance  taxes, the official told reporters. They had been paid in  twice-yearly lump sums before that.    Also, a weaker yen last month inflated the value of foreign-  currency holdings in yen terms, he said.    Asked about the effect of this week's sharp surge by the  yen,  the official said it is too early to tell if it will continue  and contribute to lowering the February money supply results.    During January, CDs declined from a year earlier, but growth  picked up in time and demand deposits.    January's 1.6 percent money supply growth roughly met the  expectations of economists at 12 financial institutions who had  predicted 1.5 percent year-to-year growth for January.    The survey earlier this week by KYODO NEWS SERVICE found  predictions ranging from 1.3 percent to 1.9 percent.</p>

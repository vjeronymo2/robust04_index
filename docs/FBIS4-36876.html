			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "60 Minutes" program] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] 'Abdallah Ahmad Ghanim, Yemeni minister  of justice and envoy of the Yemeni Government, arrived in Amman  today from Damascus with a message for His Majesty King Husayn  from His brother Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih.    The Yemeni envoy made a statement to our political affairs  correspondent:    [Begin recording] [Ghanim] My current visit to the fraternal  Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is to convey a message from  Presidential Council Chairman 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to his  brother His Majesty King Husayn dealing with the latest  developments in the Republic of Yemen, with stopping this war  which was ignited by the secessionist rebels, and with the full  implementation of the UN Security Council resolution which  safeguards Yemen's territorial integrity.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, is there Yemeni action on the  Arab level?    [Ghanim] Yes, there is Yemeni action. My visit to Jordan is  part of this action. It is the first leg of a tour of a number  of fraternal Arab states in order to brief them on the true  situation in Yemen.    [Correspondent] What is the true situation in Yemen  regarding  the cease-fire?    [Ghanim] The true situation in Yemen is the tragedy that has  been caused by some of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leaders  through their rebellion and insurgence against the authority and  public order. They did this to pave the way for announcing  secession in order to take Yemen back to the pre-22 May [1990]  era in violation of the Yemeni people's will, the constitution,  and the April 1993 elections, which the whole world admitted  were clean elections. Regarding the cease-fire, the Republic of  Yemen has from the very beginning welcomed the UN Security  Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire although  we are convinced that this resolution is interference in our  internal affairs. Despite this, out of our respect for  international legitimacy, we welcomed this resolution and  complied with it. As of yesterday, the legitimate leadership in  the Republic of Yemen had announced a cease-fire three times.  Regrettably, every time, the rebels violate this cease-fire,  foment sedition, and renew fighting. There objective is to  continue the battles to create an appropriate atmosphere to  bring forces to disengage both Yemeni sides' troops, or  international observers. We consider this a flagrant  interference in the internal Yemeni affairs.    [Correspondent] In a statement, the UN envoy said that  officials in Sanaa accept dialogue, and the other party might  accept dialogue. Do you consider this a turning point in the  situation in general?    [Ghanim] We have accepted dialogue from the beginning. We  have never refused to extend our hand for the sake of dialogue  and national reconciliation. After the declaration of  secession, dialogue has become possible only with the YSP  leaders who believe in unity and democracy. However, it is  difficult to hold dialogue with the members who do not believe  in unity, declared secession, and disavowed democracy.    [Correspondent] Thank you Mr. Minister. [end recording]</p>

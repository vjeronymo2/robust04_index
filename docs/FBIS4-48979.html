			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] A mainland Chinese hijacker Thursday [28 April] was  sentenced to 12 years in prison. (Hsu Ta-chun), 23, received  the sentence after being convicted of air piracy. He was a  salesman of the mainland's state-run China National Light  Industrial Products Import and Export Corporation in the  northeastern Chinese city of Harbin.    Hsu used a fake bomb to hijack a Xiamen Airlines Boeing 737  to Taiwan on 12 December last year and asked for political  asylum. None of the 92 passengers and crew on board were hurt.    Hsu is among 12 asylum seekers who have hijacked 11 mainland  airliners to Taiwan since last April. Ten have been sentenced  to up to 30 years in jail while the rest are waiting trial.    Taipei has so far rejected Peking's demand that hijackers be  repatriated for trial on the mainland, citing judicial  sovereignty over the criminals. But Taipei, trying to deter  further hijacks, said hijackers will be heavily punished and  deported after serving their terms.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian sugar may lose its sweetener - Kevin Brown on the bitter debate over plans to abolish tariff protection for the industry WHY DOES a highly efficient industry which exports nearly 80 per cent of production need tariff protection against import competition? And why does the industry resist the reduction of strict government control when the evidence shows it would benefit from deregulation? These questions are at the heart of a bitter debate raging in Australia over the future of the Queensland-based sugar industry, the country's fourth largest agricultural producer after wool, wheat and beef. The tariff debate dates back to the federation of Australia's six British colonies in 1901. Queensland won protection for its sugar producers in return for accepting a whites-only immigration policy which required the repatriation of low-wage Melanesian cane cutters. The initial limited protection eventually grew into an embargo on sugar imports which lasted until 1989, when the federal Labor government finally included the industry in its general tariff reduction programme. Against strong opposition from growers, the government replaced the embargo with an ADollars 115 per tonne levy on imports, which fell to ADollars 76 last year, and will fall to ADollars 55 in July. However, the government did nothing to reduce the tight control exercised by the Queensland government, which restricts the supply of land, sets production and milling quotas, and is the monopoly purchaser of raw bulk sugar. Against that background, there was outrage among growers earlier this month when the Industry Commission, a government advisory body, recommended the immediate abolition of both tariff protection and regulation. The commission said there was no justification for the tariff, which increases the profitability of sugar producers at the expense of downstream users and consumers. It also claimed the Queensland regulations were responsible for lost production worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The report was sympathetically received by Mr John Dawkins, the federal Treasurer (finance minister), a supporter of the general tariff reform programme implemented in the mid-1980s by Mr Paul Keating, now Prime Minister. However, it was angrily rejected by Queensland's Labor government, indicating that the issue had the potential to provoke a damaging split in the run up to the next federal election, due by mid-1993. The federal government headed off the political danger last week by appointing Mr Brian Courtice, a Queensland sugar grower, to chair an inquiry into the Industry Commission's recommendations. The effect will be to delay a decision until after the election. However, the establishment of a second inquiry merely underlines the difficulty of dealing with the Industry Commission's argument that the structure of sugar growing damages both the industry and the wider Australian economy. No one disputes that the sugar growers are highly efficient, partly because Australia's tropical regions have a natural comparative advantage, and partly because high wage costs have encouraged technological innovation. As a result, the industry has increased exports from 153,000 tonnes in 1946 to 2.8m tonnes in 1990, worth nearly ADollars 1bn. Total production has risen over the same period from 677,000 tonnes to 3.7m tonnes. However, the commission argues that the industry's ability to compete profitably in the world market shows it does not need protection in its home market. Removing the tariff would cut the cost of sugar to user industries, and increase the potential for the development of export refining and other downstream industries. The commission also concludes that Queensland's regulatory system prevents Australia from reaping the full benefits of the farmers' efficiency by artificially restricting production. All but 400 of Australia's 5,000 cane farmers are in Queensland. This view is supported by Mr Brent Borrell, chief market economist at the Centre for International Economics (CIE) in Canberra, who says the regulations reduce gross domestic product by about ADollars 200m a year. A CIE report on the industry* suggests that the chief constraint is the Queensland land assignment system, under which the state government specifies the amount and location of land to be used for sugar production. The system is intended to match production to forecast supply. Historically, however, increases in available land have usually followed periods of high prices and coincided with periods of falling demand. Queensland recently responded to criticism of the system by guaranteeing an increase of 2.5 per cent per year in assigned land. But the CIE report says land use would expand by 7.9 per cent a year if controls were lifted - providing additional net income of ADollars 1.1bn over 15 years. The report also forecasts that land prices would increase as farmers switched from beef production to more profitable sugar cropping, that incomes in sugar growing areas would rise, and that up to 140,000 jobs could be created in the long term, many in the sugar industry. None of this impresses the Queensland Sugar Corporation, which claims that both the costs of tariffs and regulation and the benefits of abolition have been overstated. Mr Ian Ballantyne, general manager of the Australian Cane Growers Association, says growers need tariff protection because the high cost of transport in Australia puts them at a disadvantage in large parts of the home market. He also argues that the regulatory system acts as a buffer between the growers and the market, and helps to keep production and milling capacity in balance. The Industry Commission, he says, is advised by free market economists (known in Australia as economic rationalists) who have failed to understand the industry. 'The most disturbing thing about the Industry Commission process has been that the (sugar) industry's submissions have gone very largely unheeded, and they have been very selective about the data they have been willing to take on board. 'The commission has in the past had a very economic rationalist view, and I don't think their report represents a very credible attempt to deal with the industry's problems,' he says. However, the commission suggests other reasons for the industry's uncritical support of regulation. It says the rules protect farmers from competition by restricting entry into the industry and discouraging the amalgamation of farms that has taken place in other rural industries. The regulations also protect producers from the need to respond to changes in market conditions, market their own sugar, and develop expertise in risk management through hedging and other financial instruments. 'The comparison I would draw is with the wool industry, which was also highly regulated and got in an awful mess,' says Mr Borrell. 'By contrast, the cotton industry, which has never been regulated, attracts some of the smartest farmers around. 'But even in the sugar industry the penny will drop and change will come eventually. This sort of thing just cannot go on for ever.' Sugar: winning in a corrupt world market. CIE, GPO Box 2203, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.</p>

The  four projects include Vina Siam Bank, a joint venture between  Siam Commercial Bank (33 per cent), Charoen Phokhaphan Group (33  per cent) and Bank for Agriculture of Vietnam (24 per cent).  The investment in the new venture is US$15 million.    The second project is an industrial estate between Bang  Pakong Industrial Park and Sonadezi Bien Hoa of Vietnam. The  project is worth around Bt10 billion.    Third is a mining project between Usrint Industrial Groups  and the provincial authority of Vinh Fu with an investment of  Bt400 million.    And last is a joint project by Advance Paint &amp; Chemical  (Thailand), Ngan Ha Economic &amp; Engineering Consultants and  Dong  Tam Co with an investment of US$2 million.    Chuan said that the agreements well reflected Thai  investors'  interest in entering the emerging economy. Speaking at a  meeting on investment opportunities held by the Board of  Investment (BoI) in Vietnam, Chuan said that the government has  assigned the BoI to support Thai investors who wish to explore  business opportunities in Vietnam.    Sunthon Arunanonchai, president of CP Land Co Ltd, said that  the banking venture is a follow-up to CP's finance business  overseas after CP succeeded in setting up a finance company in  Shanghai.    The new banking venture should come into operation four or  five months after receiving a banking licence. The headquarters  of the bank should be located in Hanoi, Sunthon added.    Vietnam's Bank of Agriculture is the biggest  state-enterprise  bank in Vietnam with about 300 branches nationwide. It is the  fourth local bank which has a joint venture with foreign banks.    Wikrom Khuwatcharacharoen, chief of Bang Pakong Industrial  Park, said that the new industrial estate project will have a 30  per cent stake on the Vietnamese side, while the remaining 70  per cent will be shared among Bang Pakong Industrial Park,  Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand, Exim Bank, CP Group,  Bangkok Bank and some other Thai and foreign firms.    The site, covering 5,000 rai, is 32 km from Ho Chi Minh  City.  The area will be developed into a comprehensive industrial  estate and can handle more than 100 plants.    After finalizing the size of the registered capital, the  companies will start constructing the industrial estate a few  months later.</p>

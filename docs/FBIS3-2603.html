			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 23 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The  "State Compensation Law" (draft), an important law formulated by  China to develop a socialist market economy and guarantee the  rights and interests of citizens, has been submitted to the  National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee for  examination and approval. It is expected to be promulgated very  soon.    Hu Kangsheng, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee's  Legal System Work Committee who took part in the drafting of the  law, said in Beijing the other day that the draft law stipulates  that the state organs must undertake the responsibility for  compensation in light of the "State Compensation Law" if state  organs and functionaries are involved performing their functions  in an illegal manner that encroaches on the legitimate rights  and interests of citizens, legal persons, and other  organizations.    Hu Kangsheng said that the range of compensation mainly  comprises two fields: First, administrative compensation, which  is aimed at duly expanding the scope of administrative  compensation on the basis of administrative procedural law and  in view of the currently existing problems. Second, criminal  compensation, which is aimed at compensating the innocent who  were mistakenly detained, arrested, or sentenced in the criminal  suit.    Hu Kangsheng pointed out that the standard and method of  state compensation are determined in light of the following  principle: The losses of the victim must be duly compensated,  the state's economic and financial capacity should be taken into  account, and it should be easy to calculate.    Regarding the organs responsible for making compensation, Hu  Kangsheng said that the losses caused by administrative organs  and personnel in performing their functions in an illegal manner  that encroaches on the rights and interests of citizens, legal  persons, and other organizations should be compensated by that  organ and those personnel. Criminal compensation for mistaken  detention, arrest, and sentence is to be made by the organs  responsible for making compensation.    While discussing the procedures for state compensation, Hu  Kangsheng quoted the draft provisions: The victims first should  file an application to the organs responsible for making  compensation and the latter should reach an agreement on  compensation with the former within two months. The latter also  may reach an agreement with the former on compensation right  away, through consultations.    When this State Compensation Law is made public soon, Hu  said, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens  will be further ensured. It also will impel state organs and  their personnel to perform their functions according to law, to  improve their work, and to run a clean administration.</p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIPS TO HOMEOWNERS  </P> <P> Question: We are preparing for a fairly extensive remodeling project on our  home and have interviewed several contractors. We have narrowed the field to  two. One is a very small contractor who works out of his house, and the other  is a very large operation. Do you have any suggestions?  </P> <P> Answer: Before you make a decision, you should call homeowners for whom these  firms have done remodeling projects and find out if they were satisfied.  </P> <P> Small contractors usually will cost you less money because they normally have  lower overheads. On the other hand, the large contractor usually has better  relationships with his subcontractors and is able to schedule work in a more  sophisticated manner. (However, this is not always the case.)  </P> <P> Many of the larger construction firms have their own designers who will design  a project for you. The smaller contractor will usually work from your  architect's or designer's plans or subcontract that work. Very often, people  with large, costly projects will hire a reputable architect who has expertise  in the area of home-improvement design, while others will go to a design/build  construction firm, which will furnish the entire project. These firms usually  charge for the design work and architectural renderings if their firm is not  hired to build the project.  </P> <P> One of the most important things that you can do prior to signing a contract is  to inspect at least two or three of the contractors' recently completed  projects and talk to the homeowners.  </P> <P> There are contractors that specialize in luxury housing only and will not  accept jobs under $100,000. Other contractors only do budget home-improvement  projects on a volume basis.  </P> <P> Q: I understand there is a tinting film applied to windows that also acts as a  security film on broken glass.  </P> <P> A: ArmorCoat security films act both as sun-resistant products and add  security. The product, being much thicker than ordinary tinting film, is more  than just a sun screen, offering an affordable source of security.  </P> <P> Although the glass can be broken, they tell me that it is nearly impossible to  penetrate the glass. The product provides energy efficiency and is good  protection for earthquake safety, since it will prevent shards of glass from  flying through the air.  </P> <P> This product is available through Designer Glass by SGO at 1721 W. Verdugo  Ave., Burbank, Calif.  </P></p>

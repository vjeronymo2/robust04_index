			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Curbs on regulators' powers urged INVESTORS in Britain's priv-atised utilities are being treated unfairly by regulators who take unpredictable decisions and operate in excessive secrecy, according to a report published today from the European Policy Forum, the free market think-tank. The EPF was launched six months ago with the public support of Mr John Major, the prime minister, and is headed by Mr Graham Mather, the former director of the Institute of Economic Affairs. The report says utility regulators rely excessively on the personal styles of their heads, whose discretionary power makes them prey to short-term political interference, especially in the energy market. The report recommends merging many of the regulators into fewer bodies with reduced powers to amend utility licences. It says regulators' decisions are often shrouded in secrecy - most do not hold public hearings - and there is also too little consultation by the regulators. Appeal systems are also inadequate. The report is likely to fuel controversy over the role and performance of the utility regulators, not least among the companies they regulate. Yesterday Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, which has been involved in a protracted and acrimonious struggle with Ofgas, its regulator, welcomed the study. 'Obviously, we need a regulatory framework but one that is fair, more accountable and responsible,' he said. 'This will ensure the balance of interests of all concerned. What regulation needs is a code of behaviour consistent with the Cadbury report on good corporate governance.' The Cadbury report was published last May. But Sir James McKinnon, the director-general of Ofgas, said the EPF appeared to be under a serious misapprehension about the power of the regulators. 'To suggest regulators act at their own discretion flies in the face of the fact that there is law covering these matters. Regulators take their steps by following the law.' He implied it would be wrong to merge Ofgas and Offer, the electricity regulator. 'Gas and electricity are competitors and the industries have entirely different dynamics.' The EPF, he added, seemed to want to tip the present balance between customer and shareholder interests in favour of shareholders. The report recommends merging regulatory bodies and reducing their powers to amend utility licences: Ofgas and Offer should be combined into a single Office of Energy Regulation. An Office of Communications should replace Oftel, the Independent Television Commission, the Radio Authority and the Broadcasting Standards Council. The proposed rail regulators and the regulatory arm of the Civil Aviation Authority should merge into an Office of Transport. The Future of Industry Regulation in the UK.

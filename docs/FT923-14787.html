			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / IMF pledges Dollars 1bn for Russia: Fund chief's Moscow visit gives boost to Yeltsin ahead of G7 summit THE International Monetary Fund has agreed to give Russia a first Dollars 1bn (Pounds 524m) credit after a weekend visit to Moscow by Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director. The meeting gave President Boris Yeltsin a political boost ahead of his meeting with leaders of the the Group of Seven industrialised nations. After Mr Yeltsin publicly accused the IMF and Mr Camdessus of not knowing 'the limits of the people's patience', the Russian government clinched an accord with IMF negotiators on a short-term economic stabilisation programme which is the condition for the release of the money. Mr Camdessus, who flew into Moscow on Friday to speed up negotiations which had been dragging on for at least a week, will ask the IMF's executive board to disburse the funds at the beginning of August. The agreement on the first tranche of the Dollars 4bn in IMF resources which Russia is liable to receive this year was concluded after often acrimonious negotiations in which much was at stake for both Moscow and the IMF on the eve of the G7 world economic summit in Munich. Although the terms of the accord were unclear last night, IMF requirements had included progress by Russia in dealing with more than Rbs1,000bn in accumulated debts owed by its enterprises to each other, and in co-ordinating economic policy with other republics which continue to use the rouble. Mr Camdessus, who yesterday travelled on to Munich for the summit, which starts today, has come under considerable political pressure to show the IMF is sensititive to Russia's difficulties. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting Russian prime minister who has led market reforms, needs to show some concrete gains for public opinion from his aggressively 'pro-western' stance. Before meeting Mr Camdessus on Saturday, Mr Yeltsin expressed exasperation with the west's hesitation in unblocking a promised Dollars 24bn aid package until it is satisfied that the money will not be wasted. 'This is a normal credit and you cannot force us to our knees. Russia is a great country and it will not permit such a thing,' he said. Mr Yeltsin also said he would not leave his meeting with the G7 in Munich on Wednesday without obtaining a grace period of at least two years for repaying the former Soviet Union's foreign debt. The G7 leaders in turn have made IMF support a condition for large-scale financial assistance of their own to Russia. They are considering a debt rescheduling package for Mr Yeltsin, but there was no mention of this in a joint communique issued by Mr Camdessus and Mr Gaidar yesterday. Mr Camdessus is expected to brief the summit about his talks in Moscow. The expectation was that he would meet the finance ministers of the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada tomorrow, before Wednesday's meeting between G7 leaders and Mr Yeltsin. Among the key issues to be discussed are the conditions to be attached to economic assistance being prepared for Russia and other former Soviet republics by the industrialised countries. On Saturday, Mr John Major, the prime minister, warned that conditions should not be so strict as to be politically unacceptable in Russia. Mr Major said that conditionality was necessary to ensure that the assistance was properly used and accelerated the reform process in Russia. 'There is no point in those resources being made available unless the reform process accelerates,' he said. But he warned that a 'difficult balance' has to be struck in ensuring that Russia would be able to meet the conditions set by the west and 'that the terms set are not so severe that they are politically undeliverable in Russia'. These were issues to be decided collectively by the industrialised countries and discussed with Mr Yeltsin in Munich this week. Reuter adds from Moscow: Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, predicted yesterday that Russia would eventually join the G7. President Bush said last week he was prepared to discuss admitting Russia and the question would appear on the Munich agenda.

Karim: "Rabah Kebir Persona Non Grata in </F> Germany"]    [Text] According to a statement issued yesterday in Bonn,  Rabah Kebir will be forbidden to engage in any political  activity on German soil. The German foreign minister announced  that Kebir had made public statements about Algerian political  matters in a manner conflicting with the foreign policy of the  German Federal Republic and endangering Germany's interests.    The German Foreign Ministry statement added that the  situation in Algeria was disturbing. Many assassinations of  foreigners had been reported. The danger to foreigners in  Algeria, continued the statement, had real effects on German  citizens.    The German Foreign Ministry indicated that Kebir had  requested political asylum some time ago. The declaration  forbidding him to engage in political activity on German soil  follows the statement that AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE carried quoting  from a close associate of Kebir, the head of the FIS' [Islamic  Salvation Front] provisional executive body overseas. The  statement, made in the name of this body, announced that in the  period between 26 and 31 January, 45 persons had been killed by  armed groups in Algeria. The source close to Kebir said that the  executive body was announcing these assassinations but not  claiming credit for them.    The announcement forbidding Kebir to engage in his political  activities, including contacts with FIS partisans and statements  to the press, will be made by the interior minister of the state  of North Rhine-Westphalia, who made the request to the German  federal foreign minister. Kebir has made the state of North  Rhine-Westphalia his headquarters since 6 September of last year.    Last Saturday, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl made an appeal  to Europeans in which he indicated that a fundamentalist regime  might come to power and that this would represent an immediate  danger to the Mediterranean basin. Referring to the influence of  the Algerian Islamists, the German chancellor added that the  missiles that Iraq launched against Israel and Saudi Arabia  during the Gulf war could be refurbished and placed in other  countries.    Following these changes in the official German position on  the presence of Algerian Islamists in Germany, German  authorities are expected soon to announce a decision forbidding  Kebir from engaging in political activities. If his request for  political asylum is rejected, he may be asked to leave German  territory. One should bear in mind that his German residence  card has almost expired.    Rabah Kebir, 36 years old, a high school teacher, head of  the  FIS' information committee following the Batna conference in  summer 1991, became the FIS's official spokesman after the  arrest of Abdelkader Hachani. He was placed under house arrest  in the city of Collo after January 1992. He has lived in Germany  since August 1992 with his wife and five children after being  able to leave Algeria in the company of Oussama Abassi. He began  to move politically in November 1992 and requested political  asylum from the German authorities.    Although he has received no response to date, he continues  to  enjoy German laws that allow foreigners to engage in political  activities normally, including making statements to the press.  At the end of May 1993, the special court in Algeria sentenced  him to death in absentia in a case involving the bombing of the  airport. Through Interpol, Algerian authorities presented the  German Federal Republic with a request for his detention.    The German police detained him on 7 June 1993. He was  released three months later, on 6 September 1993. The Munich  court stated that the documents submitted did not prove that  Kebir had participated in the bombing of the airport. Kebir  subsequently chose the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where he  has resided until now.    Perhaps for security reasons, Rabah Kebir has chosen secrecy  during the last three months. His contact with the press now  takes place through one of his close associates. On 17 December,  he emerged to hold a press conference in Bonn, where he  enunciated positions described as "a positive turn" in the  position of the overseas FIS leadership regarding the  appointment of President Liamine Zeroual and continued dialogue,  though with conditions.    With the decision to forbid Kebir from political activity,  the EC's appeals to combat violence and terrorism and tighten  the grip on FIS partisans on European soil have gained a  response from German Chancellor Helmut Kohl after an initial  step taken by Charles Pasqua [the French interior minister] last  December.</p>

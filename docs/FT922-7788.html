			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Tower of trouble on the waterfront: Olympia &amp; York's crisis spells decision time at Docklands The men responsible for Canary Wharf sat on its 30th floor yesterday, deflecting criticism of the scheme that has brought the world's largest property developer to its knees. 'Wasn't the project a great disappointment?' insisted a questioner. Steve Miller, Olympia &amp; York Development's chief bank negotiator, came back: 'You are sitting in the most important commercial development in the country. I don't see how you can even ask the question.' That question, however, is being repeatly asked by government ministers, tenants and, most of all, the bankers who are deliberating whether to put the project into administration. Whatever its fate, the project has played a disastrous role in draining O&amp;Y's cash to a point where it has sought protection from its creditors under US and Canadian insolvency laws. The 4.5m sq ft office complex is only 60 per cent let. But in one respect, Mr Miller had a point. As a construction project, Canary Wharf is an astounding achievement. In just five years it has transformed a derelict area of disused docks into the highest-quality offices in the country. The scale and panache of the Canary Wharf buildings present an astonishing contrast to its surroundings. Too astonishing, perhaps. The opulence of the development sits oddly with the neighbouring buildings on the Isle of Dogs and the shabby housing of the East End. Its critics in the neighbouring local authorities believe that a massive office complex is an inappropriate way of revitalising the area and its community. Its critics in the property market wonder whether the image of Docklands will ever be able to overcome the down-at-heel neighbourhood. It is too early to assess whether the scheme will succeed or fail. In the long run, Canary Wharf could become a prestigious cornerstone of a revitalised East End. But in the near future it is hard to see the project living up to its developers' vision. Its goal of creating a third business centre to rival the City and West End was always ambitious. Certainly, Canary Wharf had little in common with the government's original intention for the area which, at the start of the 1980s, was a wasteland. The vision was a modest one. When Mrs Thatcher's first government set up an enterprise zone in the Docklands, it only expected to attract industrial companies to the area. The stakes were quickly raised. Private developers, supposedly the best forecasters of demand, were willing to invest ever-larger sums in the Docklands. The London Docklands Development Corporation, set up in 1981 to oversee the regeneration of the area, also worked tirelessly in attracting new tenants. Even before O&amp;Y arrived on the scene, the area enjoyed a feverish period of commercial and residential expansion. For a time, the Docklands was a magnet for investment - attracting five times as much private money as public funds. But many who entered the market have regretted it bitterly. Well over half its building never found tenants, making the Docklands a developer's graveyard. The latest casualty is South Quay, the developer of a 300,000 sq ft building just across the water from Canary Wharf, which yesterday went into administrative receivership. The question now facing the Docklands is whether it can fulfil the lofty aspirations symbolised by the Canary Wharf project. Or will it take on a more modest role, poor relation to the business headquarters of Central London. Part of the answer depends on whether it has already achieved sufficient momentum to build itself up as a centre for international companies in London. Canary Wharf already has an impressive roster of US-owned tenants, ranging from American Express, to Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, which could attract others to the area. But to a greater extent, the future of the Docklands rests with the government, which can influence events in two crucial ways. First, it is considering moving at least 2,000 and possibly up to 5,000 civil servants to the area. Second and equally important is its willingness to finance the extension of the Jubilee Underground Line, due to be completed in 1996 at a cost of Pounds 1.7bn. The government is divided on what to do. It is unwilling to send civil servants to the Docklands unless the future of the Jubilee Line extension is assured. But it is unclear whether Canary Wharf's banks will honour O&amp;Y's commitment to fund the extension. The company is due to pay Pounds 100m over the next year and a further Pounds 300m when the line is completed. If the banks refuse to provide the funds, some ministers would like the government to make up the difference. The cost, they argue, is a relatively small price to pay for salvaging the world's biggest urban redevelopment project. The Treasury sees the matter in a different light. At a time of a ballooning budget deficit, it needs to cut expenditure. It thinks that Canary Wharf's owners will, eventually, be willing to help finance the Underground extension that will greatly add to the buildings' value. An extra twist is provided by the negotiations with the Department of the Environment, which is moving from its current offices in Marsham Street and is considering several Docklands locations. Although the department was close to clinching a deal with Canary Wharf earlier this week, it has yet to be sure that it is obtaining the best possible value for money. The government's need to find a satisfactory route out of this maze is complicated by the symbolic role that Canary Wharf has played as a flagship of the enterprise culture of the 1980s. The government cannot totally divorce itself from the fate of the project, which it promoted as a prominent example of a partnership between the public and private sectors. The prime incentive for the government to rescue the project and the Jubilee Line extension lies in its commitment to develop the east of London. This is reflected in the concentration of infrastructure spending in the area, the routing of the high-speed rail link from the Channel through Stratford and the grandiose, although sketchily defined, plans for development along the East London Corridor, a tract of land stretching through Essex that is earmarked for urban renewal. The three borough councils abutting the Docklands Development Corporation - Southwark, Newham and Tower Hamlets, gateway to the 'East London Corridor' - are watching developments with anxiety. For all three, Canary Wharf is a symbol of hope - or more particularly, jobs. The Jubilee Line is seen as vital to reviving the whole area. Unemployment levels are high: about 19 per cent in the Peckham and Southwark and Bermondsey constituencies, and higher still in Bow and Poplar (21 per cent) - which includes the South Poplar district, for which the council is currently seeking urban regeneration funding under the government's City Challenge scheme. East London regeneration projects are only weakly tied to Canary Wharf for the most part, but Tower Hamlets has recruitment, amenities and education agreements with Olympia &amp; York, which may be nullified in the event of a collapse. 'Development in the southern side of the borough was driven by Docklands,' says Ms Janet Ludlow, the Tower Hamlets representative on the Docklands Development Corporation. 'It's slumped since the recession, but could take ages to revive if Olympia &amp; York go under.' There is a certain irony in the possibility that the government will come to the rescue of the project. A key reason for Canary Wharf's problems has been the slow progress made by the Department of Transport in improving the Dockland's transport links. O&amp;Y's executives were incensed at the inefficiency and poor management of the Docklands Light Railway, which sullied the reputation of the entire area. When O&amp;Y appeared before the House of Commons transport committee in 1990, it said the average delays experienced by DLR passengers were between 10 and 100 times greater than those found on any comparable system in the world. Transport has not been the only problem facing O&amp;Y and other Docklands developers. Canary Wharf might have pulled its ambitious plans off had it not been for the deepest slump in London commerical property prices in living memory. The recession bit at the same time as a record number of new buildings came on stream, the legacy of the property boom of the late 1980s. There is now no shortage of large, modern air-conditioned buildings in the City where one in five buildings is empty. Together with other Docklands projects Canary Wharf inspires mixed reactions from its tenants, with some bemoaning a shortage of shops, difficult transport and a sense of isolation. However, the developments also have ardent admirers, whose enthusiasm is undimmed by O&amp;Y's problems. 'Whatever happens to the owners, it is still an extraordinary facility,' said Mr Jerry Roberts, general manager of Ogilvy and Mather Europe, the advertising agency. 'There is still a tremendous shortage of this kind of quality of place with as much flexibility as one has in Canary Wharf.' But O&amp;Y has had difficulty is persuading UK companies of the merits of the high-quality, large buildings at Canary Wharf, leaving the overwhelming majority of buildings to North American tenants. The developers found many UK companies resisted moving. 'We have to identify people who have the courage and personal leadership skills to risk the disdain of their colleagues,' said a senior O&amp;Y executive last year. Is there, the developers mused, something intrinsically conservative about the British that deterred them from pioneering a new district? Were they so prejudiced against the East End that they could not see its potential? Were they so tightly bound to familiar streets and watering holes that they were unwilling to explore new locations? The fate of London's Docklands hangs in the balance. If the Jubilee Line extension is completed and the government takes a lead in mopping up the surplus space, it will have gone some way to overcoming the pyschological barriers of potential tenants as well as its physical isolation. The development of the area moved faster and further than anyone thought possible during the 1980s. Decisions made in the next few weeks will determine whether that impetus has been lost for good.</p>

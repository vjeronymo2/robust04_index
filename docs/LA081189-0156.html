			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MERRILL LYNCH SELLS REALTY OPERATIONS TO PRUDENTIAL  </P> <P> Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. said today it will sell its residential real estate  operations to the Prudential Insurance Co. of America for more than $300  million.  </P> <P> The transaction, which includes Merrill Lynch Realty, a residential broker with  18,000 sales representatives in 450 offices nationwide, will not have a  significant effect on Merrill Lynch's net earnings, the company said in a news  release.  </P> <P> The announcement marks the final stroke of a divestiture that began four years  ago when Merrill Lynch moved to focus on its core broker-dealer businesses.  </P> <P> Merrill Lynch said it will spend about $140 million to buy back publicly traded  units of the Fine Homes Limited Partnership at $18 a piece before the  partnership can be sold to Prudential.  </P> <P> The brokerage formed Fine Homes, a master limited partnership, to run its  residential real estate operations after an unsuccessful attempt to sell the  operations outright. It was reported that Merrill Lynch had hoped to reap at  least $500 million from such a sale, which would have included a residential  mortgage business that was eliminated in 1987.  </P> <P> Instead, Merrill Lynch sold a minority interest in Fine Homes to the public in  late 1986. The brokerage retains a 74% interest in the partnership.  </P> <P> "This transaction culminates Merrill Lynch's divestiture of a business, which,  while profitable, is not part of our long-term global strategy," William A.  Schryer, Merrill Lynch chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.  </P> <P> Last year, Fine Homes reported revenue of $792.2 million and pretax income of  $37.1 million.  </P> <P> Also included in the transaction is Merrill Lynch Relocation Management, which  provides relocation services to the transferees of more than 400 corporations;  Landvest, a marketer of luxury properties; Network 50, an international real  estate referral network, and Moran, Stahl &amp; Boyer.  </P></p>

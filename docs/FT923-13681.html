			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / China's GNP up by estimated 10% CHINA'S economy moved into high gear in the first half of 1992, with gross national product rising an estimated 10 per cent over the same period last year, according to the official People's Daily, Reuter reports from Beijing. The newspaper attributed the high growth rate, which outstripped even the government's most recent increased estimate, to a call in January by Deng Xiaoping, the country's senior leader, for faster economic reform. Preliminary statistics show that industrial production rose by 18 per cent over the first half of the year. Retail sales rose 14 per cent. Customs figures show exports rising 17 per cent to Dollars 35.6bn (Pounds 18.6bn), and imports growing 23 per cent to Dollars 33.1bn. Though the rapid growth has caused fears of overheating, the People's Daily said market retail prices were basically stable, while commodity prices rose by about 5 per cent over the first six months of 1992. Premier Li Peng, a conservative who oversaw a three-year austerity programme from 1988 designed to bring the economy back under control after a similar period of rapid growth, told parliament in March the 1992 growth target was 6 per cent. In a humiliating reversal, he was forced to amend his report to allow for the possibility of higher growth in some areas. Last month, he climbed down further by admitting that GNP growth would probably surpass 9 per cent. Growth was 7 per cent in 1991.</p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STANTON;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO CONSIDER DEVELOPER SWITCH  </P> <P> Plans to switch developers of a proposed seniors apartment complex will be  considered tonight in a joint session of the City Council and the Stanton  Redevelopment Agency.  </P> <P> A new development agreement has been prepared by the city, and if approved,  Beverly Hills-based Jan Development Co. will assume the responsibilities of the  original developer, Newport Pacific Development Co., to build the 335-unit Park  Stanton Seniors Apartment project at Beach Boulevard and Katella Avenue.  </P> <P> The City Council approved the concept for the complex in January. The low-cost  apartments were the first part of a three-phase, $61-million project that could  eventually include a new City Hall, a recreation center and a large commercial  development.  </P> <P> The go-ahead for the first phase hinged on the issuance of a $17.75-million  state housing bond to buy the land from the city and to pay Newport Pacific to  build the complex, according to Greg Beaubien, assistant city manager.  </P> <P> The state approved the bond in August, and the developer was given until Nov.  17 to put together financing for the bond issue.  </P> <P> When it appeared the financing might not materialize, Jan Development began  negotiations with the city as an alternate developer, according to Beaubien.  </P> <P> The new agreement with Jan Development is "essentially the same" as the  agreement approved for Newport Pacific, said City Manager Terry Matz.

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Troubles pile up for the Post Office: The threat of foreign competition as mail chiefs' plans are stalled PTT International, the business arm of the Dutch post office, says it is close to winning a large bulk-mail contract from a former Royal Mail customer. The Post Office confirms the Dutch claim, and says it is evidence of the damage to its business arising from the government's delay in concluding a two-year review of its future status. It says investment is being curtailed, its core markets eaten into by competitors and planned joint ventures refused. Underlying its concerns are a surge in competition for letter and parcel delivery, a rise in the fax machine as an alternative to mail, and a decline in the cash payments that dominate its counter service. With privatisation of its European counterparts imminent, the Post Office believes its troubles are coming to a head, notably in the lucrative junk-mail market that has been crucial to Royal Mail's move to near break-even point. Bulk mail accounts for a third of Royal Mail business, with deliveries up 8 per cent last year and a forecast 12 per cent this year, as standard mail is declining. The Post Office emphasises the ease with which European postal services can offer to take a company's computer discs, and print, sort and send its mail. 'We then earn only a fraction of the stamp fee on mail coming into the UK, and nothing on mail going elsewhere,' says Mr Bill Cockburn, Post Office chief executive. The Post Office's fears are not without substance. American Express says it has long posted its mail elsewhere in Europe 'because it is so much cheaper'. But PTT International has far grander plans than the simple disc-to-door mechanics of bulk mail. It sees its core business as forwarding and is quickly developing add-ons. In the UK, PTT's London sales office is offering Royal Mail customers free trials of its European truck network, which drops mail into the European postal system at its most efficient centres. 'We know where the weaknesses and bottlenecks are from east to west and we can offer a service which plays to the system's strengths,' says Mr Theo Jongsma, PTT International's managing director. In addition, PTT is offering target-group lists for mailshots, through tie-ups with local direct-marketing companies, and is covering companies financial risks. Mr Jongsma adds: 'We are buying bulk subscriptions from publishers and taking responsibility ourselves for shifting them, giving the publisher both access and delivery. We have also set up links with banks in 60 countries so that we can get subscriptions back to our customers at a very low cost, and we are offering pre-financing.' PTT believes the European market for the distribution of publications alone is worth Pounds 60m, and is aiming initially at a 15 per cent market share. Mr Cockburn says this is happening 'at the very time that our investment and development are being curtailed by the overriding needs of the public sector borrowing requirement'. The Post Office argues that it not only needs 'commercial freedom' to meet such challenges, but that until it gets that freedom it is losing opportunities by default. 'We are just weeks away from serious damage,' says Mr Cockburn. The Post Office wants to be able to develop joint ventures with the private sector, such as European courier companies, printers, mailroom operations and warehouse companies. It is also keen to raise investment funds on the capital markets. The Treasury is resisting such moves. Thus, while PTT has a stake in the Dutch airline KLM, a Post Office proposal for its own aircraft joint venture has been turned down. The Post Office argues that this refusal left it paying between Pounds 1m and Pounds 2m more for air services than it would have done with the joint venture. The Post Office is suffering a longer-term trend of decline at its counters. Pension and child allowance payments make up some 25 per cent of counter business, with a further eight cashiering services accounting for 50 per cent. But the proportion of pensioners holding bank accounts has risen to about 82 per cent, so the era of weekly queueing is drawing to its close. The Post Office believes insurance and travel agency services could stem the effect of the disappearance of cash, although the market potential for these additions in a heavily subsidised village sub-post office might not be great. The Post Office has the country's largest retail network and vehicle fleet at its disposal, and although there have been few signs of radical initiatives so far, it is a potential that the Post Office is keen to tap.</p>

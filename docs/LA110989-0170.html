			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> T-BILL AUCTIONS RESUME AFTER NEAR DEFAULT  </P> <P> The Treasury began to replenish its coffers Wednesday after last-minute  congressional action raising the debt limit averted the government's first-ever  default.  </P> <P> The Treasury sold $16 billion of new three- and six-month bills at its weekly  auction, which was postponed Monday because the government's borrowing  authority had dropped to $2.8 trillion, a level its debt already surpassed.  </P> <P> The drop also forced postponement of $40 billion in quarterly refunding  auctions; Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said the government would  default if Congress failed to act by midnight Tuesday.  </P> <P> Without congressional action, the Treasury would have been unable to redeem  $13.8 billion in bills that mature today.  </P> <P> Congress approved legislation shortly before the midnight deadline raising the  debt ceiling to $3.1 trillion for the fiscal year ending next Sept. 30.  President Bush signed the bill on Wednesday morning and the Treasury  rescheduled its auctions, starting with the short-term bill offering that  afternoon.  </P> <P> The Treasury on Wednesday also resumed sales of U.S. savings bonds and special  securities for state and local governments, the temporary investment vehicles  for money those governments raise in the bond market, that had been suspended.  </P></p>

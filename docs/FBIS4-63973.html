			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 26 May (ITAR-TASS) -- President Boris  Yeltsin called on Russian counterintelligence to intensify its  counter measures against foreign special services which have  stepped up their activities on Russian territory recently.    Speaking today at a conference of leaders of the Federal  Counterintelligence Service [FSK], he set out the main  objectives facing the FSK. ITAR-TASS has learned that, among  other things, Boris Yeltsin called for greater efforts to  forestall interethnic conflicts and a greater drive against  organized crime, terrorism, and the drugs mafia. Success in  these areas, the president believes, will help to boost the  prestige and authority of counterintelligence agents in society.    The FSK, Boris Yeltsin stressed, must also safeguard the  country's economic security. In order to meet these objectives  the security organs must be strengthened, the president  believes. Attestation carried out within the FSK has helped to  increase their professionalism, he said. Boris Yeltsin  expressed hope that counterintelligence agents will cope with  the tasks they have been set.</p>

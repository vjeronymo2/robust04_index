			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GINGRICH PASSES FOR 363 YARDS, FIVE TOUCHDOWNS FOR EDISON  </P> <P> Quarterback Josh Gingrich threw for a school-record 363 yards and five  touchdowns to lead Edison High School to a 35-6 victory over Servite in a  nonleague football game in front of about 4,500 at Orange Coast.  </P> <P> Gingrich left the game late in the third quarter, but when Edison Coach Dave  White discovered he was three yards short of the school single-game passing  record, he sent Gingrich back in for one play.  </P> <P> He completed a 20-yard pass to Brandon Jessie with three minutes left.  </P> <P> Gingrich, a senior, completed 23 of 32 passes with one interception. He was 14  of 22 for 214 yards and three touchdowns in the first half.  </P> <P> "It was nice to see Josh get the record," White said. "I'm not a records type  of coach. I'm more of a team coach, but when I found out he was only three  yards away, I decided to put him back in for one more play."  </P> <P> Jessie tied an Edison single-game record with three touchdown catches and had  165 yards in nine receptions.

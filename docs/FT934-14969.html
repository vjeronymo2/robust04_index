			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / National Grid proposes discounts for cut-offs UK HOUSEHOLDS could reduce their electricity bills by opting to install special meters that cut off some domestic appliances during periods of peak demand, according to proposals put forward by the National Grid yesterday. The Grid, which runs the electricity transmission system in England and Wales, also asked large industrial users to consider signing up to be cut off at short notice in return for savings on their annual bills of around 10 per cent. The proposals mark the latest move to increase the flexibility of the electricity supply system where power generation is currently in the hands of the duopoly made up by National Power and PowerGen. National Grid currently pays Pounds 310m a year to the two generators for a series of back-up services required to run a safe, and economic electricity supply. These costs are, in turn, passed on to consumers. If large users, and eventually, domestic customers, agree to be cut off during peak periods, the Grid will not require certain back-up services such as plant held in reserve (by the generators) to meet surges in demand. 'By securing an alternative supply for these vital services, we are expanding competition into this area. 'There is a potential for significant cost reductions,' Mr Charles Davis, the Grid's commercial manager, said at a seminar for 100 representatives of the UK's largest electricity-using businesses. At the same meeting, speakers from Florida outlined the state's success in getting domestic consumers to agree to be cut off at certain times. They estimated that by the year 2000 all of the state's reserve requirements will be provided in this way. However, UK industry experts said that the metering technology for households to be involved in such a scheme is expensive. National Power welcomed the Grid's proposals, but said the room for cost savings was limited as a certain number of back-up services could be provided only by power stations.</p>

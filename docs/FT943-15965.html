			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Bonn threatens action on petrol pollutant Mr Klaus Topfer, Germany's environment minister, warned yesterday that his country would take its own steps to reduce the level of benzene in petrol unless the European Union could find a solution. Benzene makes up around 2.5 per cent of petrol and has been identified as a cancer-causing compound. It also creates low-level ozone, better known as summer smog, which causes coughing, eye irritation and lung damage. Mr Topfer's remarks, only days after Germany took over the EU presidency, are further evidence of Bonn's determination to take unilateral action where it feels other Union members are dragging their feet. The Bundesrat, the upper chamber of parliament, will decide tomorrow whether to approve an import ban on British beef, a measure Mr Horst Seehofer, health minister, has been campaigning for on the grounds that British imports may be contaminated with BSE or mad cow disease. Although the European Commission this week approved a draft directive designed to reduce the number of air pollutants, repeated German attempts to start a European initiative to reduce benzene levels have come to nothing, Ms Marlene Muhe of the environment ministry said. Ms Muhe said reducing benzene to around 1 per cent of petrol would reduce exhaust pipe emissions of the chemical by up to 40 per cent, a measure supported by the Netherlands and Denmark. 'If we want to fight the summer smog we have to do battle with the substances that create it,' she said. Unlike lead, benzene is not added to petrol but is created during the refining process. The environment ministry said German refineries had the technology to reduce levels to create 'cleaner' petrol. Ms Muhe said that if Germany opted for unilateral action the European Commission would be informed of the reduced levels but this would not require engines to be modified. According to Mr Topfer, the refining changes would add up to two pfennigs to the cost of petrol.</p>

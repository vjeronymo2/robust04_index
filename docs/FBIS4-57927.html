			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Lima, 25 (EFE) -- On 26 May, the Andean Group  will celebrate its 25th anniversary without having attained the  objectives of social integration and an improvement in the  living standards of all its inhabitants, who number some 100  million. [passage omitted]    On the occasion of its anniversary, the Andean authorities  have issued a series of documents referring to the current  status of the integration process. One of these documents admits  that, despite the obvious progress made, "there are still great  differences between the social groups within the member  countries."    Therefore, it adds, "the challenge that the Andean  countries,  in an individual and collective manner, must undertake is to  promote equal opportunities; grant the great majority access to  the right to education, housing, and health; improve the living  standards of the population emigrating from the rural areas to  the cities; and strengthen the institutions of civil society."    The document explains that from a closed model at the  beginning, the group has moved to an open one with automatic  community mechanisms where the market system prevails, starting  with genuine competitive advantages and the adjustment of  community regulations to international levels.    According to the document, in 1993, the Andean GDP amounted  to $142 billion and increased at a greater rate than its  population, that is, at a 3.2 percent rate per year, "which  means the Andean Group has increased its available assets and  services." Per capita income in the Andean Group increased by  three times between 1970 and 1993, going from $515 to $1,850.    Services have made the greatest contribution to the increase  in GDP, with $70 billion which represents approximately half of  the total $142 billion, followed by the manufacturing and  agricultural sectors, which in 1993 amounted to $26 and $21  million respectively.    Inflation has been curbed and shows a tendency to decrease  by  a monthly average of 0.5 percent in Bolivia, 1.8 percent in  Peru, 2.8 percent in Ecuador and Colombia, and 3.1 percent in  Venezuela.    Trade between the Andean Group member countries has also  increased. In the seventies, it amounted to $112 million and in  1993, it amounted to $2.88 billion, which represents  approximately 10 percent of the Group's total exports of $29.459  billion. Foreign investments in the region have also increased,  from $3.4 billion in the seventies to almost $14 million in 1993.</p>

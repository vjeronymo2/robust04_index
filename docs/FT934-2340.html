			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow surges as long bond fall is shrugged off Wall Street US blue chip stocks staged an impressive late rally yesterday after shrugging off weakness on the long end of the bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 23.76 ahead at 3,764.43, setting a record in two consecutive sessions. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.77 at 465.70, but the secondary markets were down, with the American SE composite off 1.51 at 464.77 and the Nasdaq composite 1.02 easier at 759.72. New York SE volume was 256m shares and advancing issues trailed decliners by 969 to 1,053. Lacking fresh economic news to guide sentiment, investors turned to the listless US Treasury market. With the 30-year government bond posting a moderate loss in reaction to higher gold prices and an early jump in commodity prices, equities quickly slipped into negative territory. The closely watched Commodity Research Bureau index later shifted direction and eased. But the inflation-sensitive long bond failed to recover and was down  13/32 at 100 5/32 in late trading. However, blue chips managed to establish a degree of independence in mid-afternoon, buoyed in part by the recent spate of favourable economic indicators. A two-point Dow gain at 2pm snowballed into a hefty advance. With gold bullion up sharply on the Comex, precious metal issues advanced. American Barrick rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 28 3/8 , Lac Minerals Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 9 1/8 , Homestake Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 22 5/8 and Newmont Gold Dollars 1 to Dollars 47 1/8 . Among non-ferrous metal producers, Phelps-Dodge added Dollars 1 at Dollars 49 3/4 , Reynolds Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 48 1/4 , Alcoa Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 73 5/8 and Cyprus Minerals Dollars 1 at Dollars 26 1/8 . At the top of the NYSE's most active list, IBM climbed Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 56 3/8 on news of the sale of its Federal Systems division to Loral for Dollars 1.58bn, about 50 per cent more than initially expected. Loral forged ahead Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 35. In the banking sector, BankAmerica was down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 45, Chemical Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 39 1/4 and Golden West Financial Dollars 3/8 at Dollars 38 1/8 after Smith Barney Shearson removed the stocks from its 'recommended' list. US Surgical jumped Dollars 2 to Dollars 22 7/8 after Smith Barney upgraded the issue to 'outperform' from 'sell'. Healthsouth climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 21 3/4 . Nutmeg Industries surged Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 17 3/8 on the announcement that VF Corp had agreed to acquire the company for Dollars 17.50 a share. VF put on Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 44 3/4. Southwest Airlines advanced Dollars 2 to Dollars 36 after agreeing to acquire Morris Air. Other airline stocks failed to benefit from a further drop in Nymex crude oil futures. UAL lost Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 149 1/2, AMR Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 68 3/8 and Alaska Air Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 14 7/8. On the Nasdaq, ProCyte plummeted Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 10 7/8 after suspending clinical trials of its lead product at the request of the US Food and Drug Administration. Canada Toronto ended higher on strong gold issues and advancing mining stocks buoyed by signs of improving metal market conditions. The TSE 300 index put on 13.1 at 4,293.4 but declines led advances by 464 to 371 after volume of 66.7m shares. Golds and other mining climbed 1.90 and 1.55 per cent respectively.</p>

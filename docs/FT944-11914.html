			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Vickers hint Vickers continued to move against the market, adding a penny at 179p for a three-day advance of more than 8 per cent. The company is due to make a City presentation to analysts and the suggestion is that it could use the opportunity either to clear the air over persistent rumours of a link-up outside the UK or to say something about US demand for Rolls-Royce cars. Vickers is known to be searching for a joint venture big brother in order to provide a new 3.5 litre engine for its new, smaller Bentley model. According to the market, it may have managed to sew up a deal with Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial company. There is also something of a buzz in the air over North American sales of Roll-Royce cars. The group needs to sell 1,300 of the marque to break-even. Some analysts have begun to make bullish noises about the company's operational gearing in this division. Food retailers sprang to life following top of the range interim profits from J. Sainsbury which - read in conjunction with Tesco's recent results - suggested that the stock market's price-war fears could be down-scaled, at least as far as the sector leaders were concerned. Sainsbury moved ahead 12 to 411p and Tesco put on a penny at 235 1/2 p. In active trading, Argyll gained 6 1/2 at 269 1/2 p and Asda firmed a penny to 61 1/2 p. Turnover in Argyll was 8.8m and no less than 16m Asda shares changed hands as concern over possible loss of market share triggered a significant two-way pull. There was some slight disappointment with the interim dividend increase, but Sainsbury's comments about the resilience of sales in the current six months led an all-round upgrading of forecasts. BZW is now going for profits of Pounds 825m, against earlier expectations of Pounds 800m. Most securities houses were expecting current half sales to be on the flat side so growth of 1.5 per cent was seen as a clear bonus.</p>

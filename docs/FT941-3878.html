			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo With seasonal profit-taking ahead of the March year-end almost over, volatility on the government bond market is expected to subside this week. Bond traders believe the worst is over for the JGB market, as the yield on the No 157 10-year benchmark closed last week at 3.94 per cent, off its week's high of 4.1 per cent. Brokers SG Warburg in Tokyo believes bond yields have risen too quickly. It says the recent plunge has pushed real bond yields up to the average of 1991 and 1992 and considering the still sluggish economic conditions, there is room for the 10-year bond yield to fall to 3.6 per cent. Japanese bond market participants will also be focusing on US interest rates this week. The recent fall on the Tokyo market has been exacerbated by the sell-off in international bond markets. Sentiment will remain jittery as long as the US Treasury bond market is unstable. The Bank of Japan is expected to keep a loose grip on short-term money market rates. Demand for funds is expected to rise as a new reserve maintenance period for banks' deposits at the central bank starts on Wednesday. Mr Yasushi Mieno, BoJ governor, last week warned of the negative impact of higher long-term interest rates on the economy, and is likely to continue to prevent a rise in overnight call rates.</p>

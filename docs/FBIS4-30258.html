			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] As reported earlier, American and Vietnamese experts  Thursday began the 30th joint search for MIA's as diplomatic  thaw between the two countries begins to triumph over postwar  disputes. Here is our radio comment on this event:    The MIA Office in Hanoi said: A total of 102 U.S. experts  will take part in the operation, which will run until 19 July,  covering 27 northern, central, and southern provinces of  Vietnam. One hundred Vietnamese will join the eight search  teams, five of which will excavate U.S. Air Force crash sites,  while the three others make interviews with the local population.    By its concrete deeds, Vietnam has always proved its  goodwill  in solving the MIA issue. It has many a time confirmed that the  MIA issue is a pure humanitarian question. Vietnam has done and  will do its best to cooperate with the U.S. in solving the MIA  issue. It is suitable to Vietnam's humanitarian tradition.    In 1993, the two countries also gained encouraging results  in  solving this question. Vietnam has handed over to the U.S. side  580 sets of remains of the American servicemen, and joint expert  teams of both sides have conducted three searches in northern,  central, and southern provinces of Vietnam. Colonel of the U.S.  Marines Mr. (John Brennon), head of the MIA Office in Hanoi,  said thanks to Vietnam's effective cooperation and support, they  have achieved encouraging results in solving MIA issue.  Especially in late 1993, for the first time, Vietnam and Laos  cooperated with the U.S. to conduct searches in areas between  Vietnam and Laos border.    Recent developments prove that the past has been closed and  the relations between the two countries has been developing  positively, creating favorable conditions for the solution of  the MIA issue. Vietnam remains cooperative with the U.S. to  effectively solve this issue.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Conflict of interest: The US move on Bosnia disregards broader strategic goals Monday's meeting of foreign and defence ministers of the Western European Union was an object lesson in the current acceleration of history. The occasion was supposed to break ground in two ways: with a first substantive debate on the development of a distinctively European defence policy; and with a first joint session with ministers from eastern Europe. In the event, both these innovations fell flat, because they were over-shadowed by another bit of history-making that was not supposed to be on the agenda: uproar and agitation at the US decision to break ranks over the UN arms embargo on Bosnia. This American decision may not, perhaps, make much practical difference to the effectiveness of the embargo or to the war in former Yugoslavia. But no one can disguise the potential political damage that it could inflict on the transatlantic relationship. First, this conflict goes symbolically to the heart of the future of the Atlantic alliance. The US has on many previous occasions pursued military policies which the Europeans did not like: the Vietnam war, for example, or the bombing of Libya. But this is the first time that the US has deliberately engaged in strategic conflict with the European allies in the European theatre. What makes this so worrying is what it says about American attitudes towards the alliance after the end of the cold war. That relationship must mean much less to the Americans than we used to be told if they are prepared to jeopardise it for the sake of what they have so little reason to hope will be a 'fairer' war in Bosnia. The second cause for concern is that the US move seems to have been made in disregard of bigger geo-strategic objectives. By any rational assessment, the west ought to give a higher priority to the general strategic relationship with Moscow than to a unilateral and unpredictable intervention in the Bosnian war. But the Russians also have an essential practical role in international efforts to deal with the Bosnian war: the west persuaded them to join the five-nation 'contact group', precisely because outside pressure had much less chance of persuading the belligerents to settle without co-operation from the Russians, traditional allies of the Serbs. These strategic considerations are now in jeopardy. Any lifting of the arms embargo on the Bosnians will provoke a parallel lifting of the embargo on the Serbs, either overt or covert; the Russians will be under domestic pressure to help their Serbian proteges; and the anti-western camp in Russia will be strengthened. It is hard to believe that this adds up to an advantageous strategic bargain for the US, for the sake of an intervention in Bosnia whose effects must be marginal. It is certainly not a good strategic bargain for western Europe. The over-riding priority of the members of the European Union just now is to work out, ahead of the Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) in 1996, a new European architecture for the post-cold war world. By now, there is fairly common agreement that this must include the expansion of the EU to include the countries of eastern Europe. But there is so far no consensus whether this means a loose and floppy organism with opt-outs galore (the British vision), or a tightly integrated structure with a semi-federal 'hard core' (the German model). This conundrum will be much more difficult if western Europe also has to deal with a bigger war in the Balkans. And yet the row over Bosnia has one large compensation: it should ensure that future discussions of the new architecture for Europe take account of the fact that the transatlantic relationship is now unavoidably different from what it was during the cold war. The UK government's argument for a loose, floppy, amoeba-like organism has rested on the assumption that Nato, the American leadership of Nato, and the Anglo-American 'special relationship' would all go on as before. That assumption has been crumbling in the face of the facts; now it is no longer tenable. In the post-cold war world, the transatlantic Alliance is losing its pulling-power on policy in Wash-ington. Some European diplomats minimise the US move away from the arms embargo, under the pretext that it was imposed on President Bill Clinton by Congress. Yet the fact is that Clinton himself has been at odds with Europe over Bosnia; and if the latest move was imposed by the old Congress, just wait to see what the new one will do. The chances are it will be more hostile to Russia, more hostile to the UN and all the constraints of multilateral diplomacy, and more impatient with what it sees as the wimpish Europeans. This cannot fail to have repercussions on the 1996 debate. All European countries would much prefer the Americans to lead the alliance as before, because that would save them so much trouble; above all, it would exonerate them from taking charge of their own destiny. But if the alliance has become less central to US policy, as is inevitable, then it must also become less central to European policy. You cannot follow a leader who does not want to go anywhere you want him to go. The Americans have just raised the stakes for the 1996 European negotiation in ways they may not have expected. If the EU expands to the east, it will need a real foreign and security policy: the combination of the east Europeans inside, and the Russians outside, will make it almost unavoidable. It will become inevitable if the west Europeans come to believe that their strategic objectives and those of the Americans are no longer the same.</p>

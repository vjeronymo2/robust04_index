			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Arts: Messages in Broken Glass / Review of the British premiere of Arthur Miller's latest play Broken Glass is the kind of play that only Arthur Miller knows how to write any more. At its British premiere on Thursday there were starry eyes and cheers amid the audience, and, when the 78-year-old playwright rose to acknowledge the applause, a good many people leapt to their feet. Indeed, Miller has not given us so echt a play in quite a while. Which means that it is about the point where private repression and public events overlap: in this case, the point where the twin causes of the heroine's partial paralysis are sexual problems and Jewish consciousness. The play, which has six characters, is set in Brooklyn in 1938. It is some feat to make the sudden psychosomatic non-functioning of Sylvia's lower body be prompted simultaneously by (a) 20 years of marriage without sex, and (b) Kristallnacht. Miller, however, is not the man to stop there. He lards his play with questions-and-answers like this. Patient: 'So why is it so hard to be a Jew?' Doctor: 'It's hard to be anything'. Or this one. Patient: 'So what is the solution?' Doctor: 'To forgive yourself, I guess. And the Jews.' Oy vey. If you think the test of a play is its message or messages, then you may like Broken Glass a good deal. The messages here include the following: women are people too; Jews can be anti-semitic; you should be aware of what is happening outside your own four walls; repressing guilt is bad for you and others. Miller has been saying worthy things like these for so many years that he should get a Nobel prize. Not, however, the one for literature. The messages of Broken Glass thud around like so many missiles; but they do not constitute serious drama. Those of you who have been trying to forget the ending of Peter Shaffer's Gift of the Gorgon (with poor Judi Dench yelling 'I forgive] I forgive] I forgive]' to the angry shade of her dead husband) would be well advised to leave before the close of Broken Glass, a triple whammy of the second onstage heart-attack and probable death of Sylvia's husband Philip; Sylvia's cries of 'Wait] Philip] There's nothing to blame]'; and a stand-up-and-walk miracle for Sylvia. And who could have predicted that even Miller, writing a play about a doctor trying to get a woman to use her pelvis and legs and realising that her real problem was psychosexual, would call the doctor Hymen? There are some cute jokes. Sylvia: 'I never saw an opera. They must be hard to understand. Doctor: 'Nothing to understand . . . Either she wants to and he doesn't or he wants to and she doesn't. Either way one of them gets killed and the other one jumps off a building.' Miller could be writing gags for Bob Hope. Instead, he writes plays. He has been called a realist, but he is a lot too schematic to be realistic. There is nothing seriously individual about his characters; each seems to function like a demographic diagram. The stage world they inhabit has no persuasive reality. Everything is subordinated to message. OK, the doctor likes opera and riding, while Sylvia likes Bing Crosby. But this is mere tokenist realism. And would anyone in 1938 have said 'This Crosby's the one I like. You ever hear him?' (My Crosby discs date back to 1927.) Acting these roles is a matter less of serious impersonation than of tact; and David Thacker, directing, paces the dialogue so well that you always want to know what will happen next. The leading actors here - Margot Leicester as Sylvia, Henry Goodman as Philip, Ken Stott as the Doctor - perform as well as their roles permit, though Leicester is not the beauty that the Doctor describes. Some American accents are creaky, and Sally Edwards is distinctly weak as the doctor's wife. Shelagh Keenan has provided an interesting steep-raked set with a lot of reflecting glass - alas, because of the title, half the audience must be waiting for it to break - which makes characters at the back loom out above those speaking in the foreground. Between scenes, an onstage cellist, Andrea Hess, plays music by herself and Gary Yershon which suggests a climate of psychological tension as effectively as anything else in the play.</p>

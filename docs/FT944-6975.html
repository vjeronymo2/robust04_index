			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Tales from London's rebuilt riverbank: Peter Marsh went for a walk in Docklands and found a world transformed. But have the changes been for the better? This summer I was given an unusual assignment: to design a series of walks through London's formerly derelict dock sites. The commission came from the London Docklands Development Corporation which believes tourism can lift the Docklands economy. 'The trouble is that when visitors get here, they often don't have a clue as to which bits are worth seeing: you'll change that,' I was told. In the past decade, a forest of office and housing blocks has sprung up from the relics of London's old docks. For 150 years until the 1960s, the area was one of Britain's industrial hubs. In the 1930s its docks and associated businesses employed 100,000 people. In the aftermath of the docks' closure in the 1970s the area became a wasteland, but in recent years it has been transformed. Not everyone believes this change has been for the better. I called on Sir Peter Levene, chairman of Canary Wharf, Docklands' Pounds 1.5bn flagship development. It has 5m sq ft of office space. Its 800ft high tower, the tallest in Britain, contains enough marble to cover a soccer pitch. Sir Peter looked out of his 30th-storey office and said: 'Fifteen years ago Docklands was a dump. Now it feels like a district of central London and it's a wonderful place to work.' John Fox, a 37-year-old sculptor, is less upbeat. On the balcony of his 19th floor flat in the unattractive local-authority Barkantine estate, Fox said: 'I've lived here 11 years and watched something new go up virtually every day. A lot of the architecture has been execrable. The developers tried to build a new Jerusalem, but they've created a monument to themselves. What the local people have got out of it is questionable.' In 1985, the corporation talked airily about its plans: 'Docklands will be rare among new developments in post-war Britain for having industry and commerce, housing and leisure facilities, co-existing instead of being kept apart. In consequence local people will be able to live, work and play in the same area. The sterility of so many developments elsewhere . . . will have no place in Docklands.' The corporation was established as a Thatcherite vehicle two years after the former Conservative leader took power. It effectively became a monster estate agent, buying land either from the private sector or from public authorities and selling it to the highest bidder. It hoped the area would be transformed by private money and the laws of the market. The inflows of wealth would trickle down to the existing population, with new and old interacting harmoniously. Using a mixture of tax concessions, loose planning controls and unbridled hype, the corporation has levered Pounds 6bn of private investment into the area for a public outlay, according to the corporation's figures, of Pounds 1.6bn. But little has trickled down. The harmony has turned out to be discordant. The gleaming Canary Wharf is one leitmotiv of Docklands, but another is Beckton Gasworks, on the eastern fringe of the area. Once the world's biggest gas plant, Beckton is now half demolished, a surrealist array of vast concrete blocks leaning at crazy angles and sitting on land grossly contaminated by industrial chemicals. Although plans exist to turn the land into a retail and industrial park, the site is effectively abandoned. Market forces are powerless to bring it into the 21st century. The brave new Docklands world has turned out to be a mish-mash of ideas and experiences, a mixture of ambition and alienation, achievement and angst, City slickers jumbled with Clockwork Orange. The area has been changed without a lot of thought for the people living there. The changes have been all the more difficult for those residents of the Isle of Dogs, a wedge of land trapped in a loop of the Thames, who have lived there since before the redevelopment. The people here, mostly former dockers or industrial workers and their families, and comprising probably about a tenth of Dockland's total 65,000 population, have a peculiar insularity. The Isle is cut off both geographically and socially. It has been a recruiting ground for the racist British National Party. 'The Docklands dream was sold to these people on the basis that they would benefit,' said Nick Holtam, vicar of Christchurch on the Isle of Dogs. 'A lot of them feel let down.' Such sentiments are evident on the 1960s Samuda Estate, a group of local-authority blocks about a mile from Canary Wharf. Housing officers know of at least three drug dealers on the estate. Muggings and car thefts are common. Millions of pounds are needed for improvements such as electrical rewiring and replacing worn-out concrete. Brian Poole, a Docklands resident for 17 years, sat in his sparsely furnished maisonette on the estate and said: 'The new developments have passed the local people by. They've brought in a lot of yuppies, people with mobile phones and Filofaxes who have nothing in common with the area. As for jobs, I hardly know of anyone who's benefited.' Another long-term resident paused while fishing in the Thames, putting down his can of beer long enough to gesture towards Canary Wharf: 'It's all shit. I wish the IRA would blow it up.' Many of the Thames-side views and those of the old docks are magnificent but a lot of the buildings are a messy jumble, in keeping with the unplanned way in which the docks have evolved since the first were dug early last century. In 1879, Joseph Conrad described Docklands as a 'a thing grown up, not made', whose buildings were 'confused, varied and impenetrable'. The area buzzes with entrepreneurial activity. More than 2,000 companies operate work in Docklands, double the number 10 years ago. Recent incomers include blue chip names such as Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse First Boston and Texaco. But there is disagreement over how many new jobs have been created since 1981. The corporation says this is 28,000, doubling the area's jobs total. Critics such as the Docklands Forum, an umbrella group of local community organisations, point out that most of these 'new' jobs - which have been predominantly white-collar - have been relocations from elsewhere. Allowing for job imports and those lost as traditional industries closed, the net number of new work places in Docklands may only be a few thousand. Also contentious is how many local people have filled the new employment places: no one knows the exact figure, but it is unlikely to be more than 2,000. Unemployment in Docklands is around 20 per cent, well above the average for London. Michael Pickard, since 1992 the corporation's chairman, acknowledged the frustration of many local people but said it is difficult to tackle this while many 'have difficulty leaping the educational barrier to white collar jobs'. The corporation has put Pounds 13m into local training projects over the past seven years to supplement the efforts of other agencies. Critics say the corporation's efforts on training have been too little, too late - and that it has put insufficient resources into attracting light industrial jobs more directly suited to locals. But there are success stories. Tammy Read is 17 and has lived on the Isle of Dogs since she was five. Ever since she saw Canary Wharf go up, she wanted to work there 'but I never thought I was bright enough'. Helped by a secretarial course, she now works there as an office clerk for Drake &amp; Scull, a big engineering contractor. 'It's a dream come true,' she said. Janice Devereux, another local who is contracts co-ordinator at Encom, a TV and telecommunications company on the Isle of Dogs, said many residents take too rosy a view of the past. 'In the 1960s we had the docks and nothing else. What's happened has been for the better.' Sharon Smith, an 'islander' who three years ago set up A &amp; B Couriers, a delivery service, said: 'Sitting back and moaning doesn't get you anywhere.' As for the new wave of Docklands employers, Peter Corfield, a director of advertising agency Ogilvy and Mather and chairman of the 600-member Docklands Business Club, said more of them will take on locals as they become more established in the area. But Genny Sutcliffe, placement officer at the Docklands information technology centre, a training agency funded by the corporation and central government, said too few of the new employers had tried to understand the school leavers who passed through her centre. 'Not enough of them seem to realise we're an East End training agency rather than an extension of Roedean (the girls' public school),' she said. Physically and socially, Docklands is a long way from fulfilling some of the early visions. It may take a decade more for the area to gel. 'We've seen the start of physical regeneration, but social regeneration will take a lot longer,' said one corporation official. Ted Johns, a former Labour councillor, is a critic of the corporation. But he remains optimistic that the area will come alive: 'We've been hit by a maelstrom; it's been a bit like the Blitz. But we're dusting ourselves down and will carry on - we are that kind of people.' Peter Wade, an ex-docker and, since 1988, community relations manager for Canary Wharf, said: 'I grew up in the docks but I can't keep the attention of my grandchildren in ships for more than two minutes. We've got to adapt to the new industries - that's the future.'

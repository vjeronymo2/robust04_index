			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa closes firmer Johannesburg's equity market finished mostly firmer on follow-through support after Thursday's rally and renewed interest following recent losses; but gold shares remained depressed by a soft bullion price, and interest in the sector was limited. Industrials continued to lead the way, the sector index rising 31 to 6,355 after Thursday's 62-point gain. Sappi, the papermaker, exemplified the trend, rising R1 to R63 after a R5 jump the day before, as Monday's Dollars 1.6bn acquisition of a 70 per cent stake in SD Warren of the US continued to support the stock. The gold index slipped 13 to 2,288, brought down by bullion's continued uncertainty around current levels. Vaal Reefs fell R9 to R429, and Loraine 50 cents to R21.75. The overall index rose 15 to 5,627. Dealers said that further short-term gains would depend on Wall Street extending its uptrend, and that medium-term prospects remained dominated by currency and bullion concerns.</p>

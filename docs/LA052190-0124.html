			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GM TO LINK U.S. DEALERS TO SATELLITE SYSTEM BY '92;  </P> <P> PULSAT: PLAN WILL PROVIDE WORLD'S LARGEST PRIVATE NETWORK AND REPLACE PUBLIC  TELEPHONE LINES.  </P> <P> General Motors Corp. today announced plans to link its 9,700 U.S. dealers to a  satellite system by late 1992 that will replace public telephone lines and form  the cornerstone of a futuristic "Buck Rogers" communications network.  </P> <P> Called Pulsat, the new system will be the world's largest private satellite  network and connect virtually all operations of the giant auto maker.  </P> <P> GM will pay for the installation of a Hughes satellite at each dealership,  which is expected to be compatible with most computer screens at dealers, said  Duncan Brodie, director of dealer systems and communications for GM.  </P> <P> The cost of the system is not expected to increase dealers' current  communications expenses. GM will also pay for a comprehensive training program  for both dealers and GM employees, Brodie said.  </P> <P> GM declined to say how much the system or training will cost it, although  Brodie acknowledged that a key part of Pulsat is to realize future savings by  reducing its use of land lines.  </P> <P> While Pulsat will initially provide rapid exchange of information on purchasing  costs, warranty, service and recall data, it could also eventually provide  dealers with electronic shop manuals, electronic vehicle invoicing and the next  generation of vehicle diagnostics.  </P> <P> "The Buck Rogers concept is becoming reality," said Brodie.  </P> <P> Pulsat was also viewed as one of the first practical applications of GM's  multibillion-dollar purchases of Electronic Data Systems Corp. and Hughes  Aircraft Co. in 1984 and 1985, respectively.  </P> <P> "This is the most specific effort at this point in time, and it is the first  time we have combined the specific talents of both EDS and Hughes," said  Brodie, noting the concept of a massive satellite network began about 15 months  ago and included dealers to design the system.  </P> <P> Brodie conceded that Pulsat may in some cases allow dealers to reduce their  staff, noting that dealerships in general "are under tremendous financial  burdens."  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp. is now linking its 5,300 dealers via Hughes-built satellites  under a program to be fully operational this fall.  </P> <P> EDS will provide the development and implementation of the system, while GM  Hughes' Hughes Network System will provide the satellite technology and a  six-foot diameter dish.  </P></p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Observer: Politically correct Any city preparing to host the Olympics quickly becomes involved in the Pork Barrel Stakes, a lucrative game for local companies bidding to construct or consult on the myriad facilities for a modern Games. Atlanta is no exception. The Dollars 1m design contract for the city's new Atlanta Olympic Tennis Centre has gone to the locally based Tennis Design Group. This consortium of four Georgia firms will provide architectural and engineering services for the 15-court, 20,000-seat complex to be built at Stone Mountain Park. According to sources within the Atlanta Organising Committee, the factor in the proposal that was key to the consortium winning the work was a commitment to allocate 37.2 per cent of all assigned work to black and female businesses within Atlanta. How this percentage was arrived at is not revealed in the tender documents.</p>

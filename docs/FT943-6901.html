			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Labour's opinion poll lead grows A MORI poll for The Times newspaper today puts Labour's support on 56 per cent (compared with 51 per cent at the end of July), with the Tories unchanged on 23 per cent and Liberal Democrats down 3 percentage points at 18 per cent. The poll shows that support for Labour among the middle classes, women and southern voters has grown since Mr Tony Blair's election as party leader five weeks ago. Half the public is undecided about Mr Blair's performance as Labour leader, although he enjoys a favourable rating among the rest.</p>

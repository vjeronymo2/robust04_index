			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["U.S. Side Is Not Qualified To Talk About `Violation of </F> Armistice Agreement', Spokesman of KPA Panmunjom Mission" --  KCNA headline]    [Text] Panmunjom, June 10 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the  Panmunjom mission of the Korean People's Army [KPA] in a  statement today denounced the U.S. side for bringing forward on  June 6 the question of holding a meeting of secretaries of the  Military Armistice Commission (MAC) which had already ceased to  exist and raising outcries over DPRK's "violation of the  Armistice Agreement".    The step of setting up the KPA mission at Panmunjom was a  realistic and timely one taken to tide over the present  situation in which the Korean Armistice Agreement had been  reduced to a mere sheet of paper and the MAC remained only in  name due to the unreasonable behavior of the U.S. side, the  spokesman said, adding the U.S. side knows this and has  manifested its stand to make a contact with our members.    He went on:    The U.S. side, however, on June 6 abruptly came up with a  proposal to hold a meeting of secretaries of the MAC which had  ceased to exist.    In this regard our side called attention of the U.S. side to  the fact that all the members of our side had been recalled and  notified that an official of the KPA mission at Panmunjom might  meet with the U.S. side.    Then, the U.S. side showed up at the conference hall and  read  a prearranged text and made a show of publishing a statement  saying the act of our side was "a violation of the Armistice  Agreement".    Such act of the U.S. side was nothing but a ridiculous drama  aimed at evading its responsibility for having destroyed and  obliterated systematically the Armistice Agreement and the  armistice mechanism.    In fact, the U.S. side, at this late hour, is neither  qualified nor has the face to talk about "violation of the  Armistice Agreement".    It is the United States that expelled in June 1956 the  neutral nations inspection teams which had been overseeing and  controlling the introduction and carrying out of military  equipment, staying at appropriate entry ports of South Korea  according to Article 2 C of the Armistice Agreement. It is also  the United States that unilaterally proclaimed in June 1957 that  it would renounce the implementation of Subparagraph 13 D of the  Armistice Agreement that stipulates the cessation of  introduction into Korea of combat equipment.    It is the U.S. side that not only completely paralyzed the  armistice mechanism by appointing a "general" of the South  Korean Army who has neither legal justification nor  qualification, as the "senior member" of its side but also is  beefing up the Armed Forces in South Korea, taking issue with  the fictitious "nuclear issue".    It is preposterous for the U.S. side that had unilaterally  wrecked the major articles of the Armistice Agreement and the  armistice mechanism to talk about an "agreement between the two  sides".    What the military armistice commission and the neutral  nations supervisory commission are needed for which have no role  to play in preventing either arms buildup or the recurrence of  war owing to the U.S. side query    Whether it accepts our new proposal or not is a touchstone  for the fundamental question of war or peace.    The U.S. side is well advised to choose to establish a new  peace arrangement whereby the danger of war can be prevented and  peace and security definitely guaranteed, instead of trying to  revive the armistice mechanism the function of which has been  completely paralyzed by it.    We will watch the future act of the U.S. side.</p>

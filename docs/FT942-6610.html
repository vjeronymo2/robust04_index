			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Ankara talks on Cyprus Turkey's President Suleyman Demirel will hold talks this weekend in Ankara with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas in a last-ditch attempt to secure agreement on the current round of United Nations-sponsored talks on the Cyprus dispute. With the UN secretary general due to issue a report on progress on the talks next week, diplomats say this meeting is the last chance to win Mr Denktas's backing for the UN's confidence-building measures, aimed at finding a solution to the 20-year division of the island.</p>

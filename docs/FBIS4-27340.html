			<p>CSO     [Text] Calsonic will double its sales in the European  region to 200 million pounds (about 30 billion yen) by 2000 with  "Llanelli Radiator," a local production subsidiary purchased  from Rover of Great Britain, as the axis. Currently, it is 96  million pounds (about 15 billion yen). It has acquired orders  for aluminum radiators for next-model compact cars such as VW  and Audi of Germany and Renault of France, as well as for the  locally produced cars of affiliates Nissan Motor and Honda Motor  and will gradually expand production beginning this fall.    Calsonic has received an order for the next model of the  compact car "Concerto" from Honda of UK Manufacturing (HUM), the  British production subsidiary of Honda Motor. HUM plans to  produce 50,000 units annually beginning in the latter half of  1994 in order to build an annual production system of 100,000  cars, and Suranesurii received the order for the whole quantity.    They will supply 130,000 units annually beginning this fall  for the next model of the "Audi 80" for Volkswagen-Audi of  Germany.    They also have received an order for radiators for  "Netherlands Car" (abbreviated Nedocar), the joint-venture  company between the Dutch Government-Volvo-Mitsubishi Motors,  and will supply 180,000 units annually. Production is scheduled  to begin in the middle of 1995. Since full production of the  Nedocar will be 200,000 units annually, the order is for almost  the whole quantity.    The next car type from Renault is the compact car "Clio." It  is scheduled to begin production in 1997, and they will supply  100,000 units annually. Since previously Valeo, a major parts  manufacturer of Europe, had the monopoly on Renault cars, they  have destroyed a corner of that by this order.    Since they are bolstering a substantial development and  production system in Europe, Calsonic is building a new research  and development center at Calsonic International Europe (CIE)  which is its general controlling company in Europe. The total  amount of the investment is about 2.2 million pounds. The  development system also will be increased from the current 70  people to 90 people.    Llanelli was purchased from Rover of Great Britain in 1989,  and is supplying the whole quantity of a little less than  200,000 units annually of the aluminum radiators for Nissan  Motor United Kingdom (NMUK). Llanelli still has a cumulative  deficit of close to 10 billion yen, but as the result of broad  sales expansion activities, the outlook is for it to be able to  liquidate it by 2000.</p>

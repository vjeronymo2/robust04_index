			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 4 KYODO -- The wage gap between the  industrialized and developing worlds remains wide in nominal  terms but is on a steady decline in real terms, the Labor  Ministry said Wednesday [4 May] in an annual report. The report  comes amid a surge in industrialized nations' claims that their  economic hardships can be partly attributed to an export  offensive by developing countries in Asia taking advantage of  cheap labor costs.    Wage levels in newly industrialized economies (NIES) such as  Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea have shot up since  the early 1970s and the sharp wage increase has helped erode  their labor cost advantage, the report said.    In the early 1970s, wages in these Asian countries were at a  level of about 10 percent of those in industrialized nations, in  the mid-1980s at about 30 percent and around 1990 at nearly 40  percent, according to the report.    As for 1991, wages in these Asian NIES in the manufacturing  sector were at 37 to 40 against the base of 100 for the United  States, the report said.    The report also compared real wages between industrialized  nations and NIES through a means called purchasing parity and  calculated the purchasing power of a country's currency in  dollar terms.    Under this method, the wage gap between Asian NIES and the  U.S. was found to be smaller, with wages in Hong Kong and South  Korea calculated at 65 percent of those in the U.S. wages in  Thailand and the Philippines were tabulated at 20 percent of  those in the U.S.</p>

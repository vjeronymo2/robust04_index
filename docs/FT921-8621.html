			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Arts: Purcell Room recitals Not before time the South Bank is endeavouring to lift the image of the Purcell Room. After years of this venue providing a bald platform space for recitalists to perform in front of invariably meagre audiences, it is getting a bit of a face-lift, with avant-garde works of art on the walls, new curtains on stage and a few potted plants for evening events. If this is the Cinderella of the South Bank's three concert halls, one can hardly claim it is being dressed up for the ball. But then cosmetic trappings like these will never count for much. The hall has good acoustics, which matter far more. And audiences will only come if the programmes are seen to be more enticing than in the past. I attended a pair of events last Thursday and may have been lucky, for these proved to be two uncommonly enjoyable recitals. The first was at lunchtime, a Rossini birthday programme. As befits a mid-day audience, it was made up of popular items, including favourite excerpts from the comic operas and the Soirees musicales. But everything was put across in the right spirit, light-hearted without being winsome. The soprano Eileen Hulse, accompanied by Scott Mitchell, offered a few nicely-turned songs and Yvonne Howard announced herself as a Rossini comic heroine of noted promise, able to move her warm mezzo around with a real sparkle. Then, in the evening, came the first in a new series of song recitals. By and large the artists who will be appearing are not established figures on the recital platform, but this opening evening with the soprano Janis Kelly has set a standard for the others to follow - not least in the style and judicious touch of 1920s glamour with which it was presented. The programme was an all-French one. It may be that the voice itself wanted some of the glamour of the singer's appearance, but if that means that she is prepared to work harder on the words to compensate, then it matters little. There was no doubt here that we had a recitalist who understood what she was singing and could speak the poems aloud quite eloquently if she wanted to. The fast patter of her Poulenc Cinq Poemes de Max Jacob went with a deal of the zing which is quite crucial to them. The other virtue was an important one, shared equally between the singer and her accompanist, Iain Burnside: they both understand that in the French repertoire the less one does, the more the music is likely to respond. A group of Faure melodies was successful because the songs were so simply handled, just clear words and swift speeds, strictly no sentimentality allowed. Satie's word-play in 'Dapheneo' and his Mad-hatter in 'Le Chapelier' were dead-pan humour at its most killing. On the surface this looked to be a modest recital, a shortish programme by a singer not previously well-known in the field and schooled in a rigorous style of interpretation, a few too many physical gestures apart; and yet it delivered more than does many a lavishly-feted prima donna. At the end I could happily have sat through it all again.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Caroline Monnot: "Privatization of Bull Should </F> Begin by End of Year"]    [Text] Timing is nearly always important. With 2 weeks to  go before a decisive meeting with the European commission,  Jean-Marie Descarpentries has decided to break his silence. On 1  March, Bull's new CEO is supposed to explain the recovery  measures he envisages and convince European Commissioners who  are both irritated and of course skeptical. At stake is an 8.6  billion [French] franc [Fr] recapitalization, decided last fall  by the authorities, which touched a raw nerve in Brussels.  Patently less than convinced by Paris's pledge that this would  be the "very last" capital infusion, the Commission, which has  been waiting for Bull's strategic plan since last July, has put  a freeze on the second capital tranche, which would supplement  the initial Fr4.5 billion released in December 1993.    At this point, a public relations campaign would seem  imperative for Bull. Since mere protestations of good faith  would be unavailing, Mr. Descarpentries went straight to the  point in what was his first official meeting with the press  since 17 February, when he was named for the job: Bull's  privatization is to be launched sometime this year, he said. The  head of the state-owned computer group also has a fairly clear  idea who the group's shareholders will be 2 years down the road:  Employees will own as much as 20 percent; three industrial ("and  preferably financial") partners with prior experience in  cooperative ventures with Bull will each own 15 percent; the  state--"a fabulous shareholder," notes Mr. Descarpentries--will  keep as much as a 15 percent interest; and the rest will go on  the open market.    Privatization would have to be implemented in several  phases.  For Jean-Marie Descarpentries, the entry of industrial partners  is especially opportune because it will be accompanied by a  capital infusion, to be effected once the enterprise's balance  sheet is rectified. Nevertheless, in the next few months, and as  an earnest of its good faith vis-a-vis Brussels, "up to 10  percent of the group's stock" will be made available to  employees, and "between 10 and 20 percent" to the first  industrial partner. Bull's CEO broadly hinted that Japan's NEC,  a longtime partner of Bull--and one that closely followed the  state-owned group's recapitalization last fall--strikes him as a  solid candidate. He also wants France Telecom, which already  owns a 17 percent share in the state-owned computer group, to  keep its place at the table. According to Mr. Descarpentries, it  is time for the two enterprises, which in the past have had an  "almost neurotic" relationship, to turn over a new leaf. "There  are many joint projects for us to develop." The third candidate  might be Hewlett Packard (United States), with which Bull says  it is already discussing various industrial plans. But IBM,  which signed a financial and industrial partnership accord with  Bull over 2 years ago, is clearly being pushed out of the  picture. In private, Mr. Descarpentries is rather harshly  critical of that partnership. Also, the Bull CEO mentioned a  possible merger of Zenith Data Systems and Packard Bell, with  stock in the new entity to be listed on the Paris Exchange.</p>

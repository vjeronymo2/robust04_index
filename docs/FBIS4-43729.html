			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Joachim Geiger: "The SPD's Fear of the Voter"] </F>   [Text] Rudolf Scharping wants to become chancellor in  the fall. But five months before the Bundestag election, the  Social Democrats are losing confidence that they can take power  this time.    So that there will be no doubts, Rudolf Scharping says it  again and again: this fall the SPD [Social Democratic Party of  Germany] wants to supersede the Kohl government and take over  responsibility in Bonn. By this he naturally means a change of  power. But the chancellor candidate is not so fond of the term  "power." Somehow power sounds like an end in itself and somehow  that does not fit in the self-understanding of the SPD. For a  Social Democrat, political content comes first and then power.    Seen in this way, it was only logical for Rudolf Scharping  to  react angrily to the election of Roman Herzog as federal  president. Anyone who believed that it was necessary to elect  the most suitable candidate as head of state must be especially  disappointed that power-policy considerations alone decided the  issue.    But this understandable human disappointment also involves  an  imcomprehensible political naivete. After 12 years of experience  with power politician Helmut Kohl, had the Social Democrats  really thought that he would not put the liberals under massive  pressure? And does Scharping, who in his initial anger  characterized the FDP [Free Democratic Party] as superfluous but  then quickly called it a conceivable partner in the government,  seriously believe that there is another criterion for the Free  Democrats than participation in power?    It is one thing to criticize Kohl's instrumental  relationship  to power. It is another thing to change the political power  relations. In his short time as chief of the SPD, to be sure,  Scharping was able to maneuver his party out of the corner into  which the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social  Union] had pushed it with remarkable adroitness. But he was only  able to do this because the SPD largely took the course of the  Union in the dispute about the right of asylum, fighting crime,  and UN missions of the Bundeswehr. And the attempt to make the  fight against unemployment the focus of the election campaign  and thus to put the Bonn coalition on the defensive got bogged  down at the very start.  <H5>  The Most Dangerous Adversary of the Social Democrats Is the </H5> Social Democrats    First, in his, in principle, correct and honest attempt to  put a greater burden on the higher incomes and in exchange to  abandon the planned solidarity surcharge for everyone, Scharping  got entangled in the definition of the so-called higher earners.  Then Oskar Lafontaine reaped sharp criticism from his own ranks  for his likewise correct and honest statement that the social  expenditures must also be subject to review if it is a matter of  the consolidation of the budget. After the election for the  federal presidency, in turn, the party chief presented himself  as a poor loser. And finally, in the vote in the Bundestag on  the abortion paragraph 218, even renowned Social Democrats were  conspicuous in their absence. Instead of utilizing this  politically meaningless but symbolically important vote to give  a defeat to the governing coalition, the parliamentary group of  the SPD itself suffered a beating.    It appears that the Social Democrats are the most dangerous  adversary of the Social Democrats. Six months before the  Bundestag election, Chancellor Kohl and his Union once again see  themselves on the rise in opinion polls, just as the head of the  government had prophesied when the mood was worst at the  beginning of the year. Meanwhile, the confidence of many members  of the SPD that this time they can win the election is yielding  to the feeling that they will once again be losers.    What are the reasons why the opposition is not able to  profit  politically from the battered image of the Federal Government?    The party certainly does not lack unity. The ideas about  reform are also quite consistent, at least in their  fundamentals. Lower taxes on labor and higher taxes on energy  consumption, tax relief for investments, and consolidation of  the national budget--all of these are proper goals. But so far  the Social Democrats have answered the key question in a  fragmentary way at best: How is this to be financed?    If the Social Democrats were honest, they would have to  declare that for a few years all groups in society must tighten  their belts so that later on things can again get better for  everyone. And if they were courageous, they would be very  specific about naming the demands that are necessary to resolve  above all the most pressing problem of this society: the  unemployment that can no longer be eliminated through economic  growth alone.    Certainly there is a justifiable fear of thereby offending  voters. But what is the benefit of Scharping getting the  approval of socially weaker groups by offering them relief if he  also angers all those who by no means count themselves among the  higher earners but are supposed to pay higher taxes? And when  Lafontaine, in turn, calls for review of all social payments,  which at best gets the applause of employers? In terms of  election tactics, the two things really do not go together. But  do they not fit together into a plausible total concept?    What is lacking is not so much tactical skill but rather a  consistent election campaign strategy. For this reason, although  reconciled in the party program, three positions of the SPD  stand side by side:    --the position of social fairness, which certainly needs  correction after 12 years of Kohl's policy of redistribution  from bottom to top;    --the national position, which sees itself as participating  in the government on the basis of its majority in the Bundesrat  and which is therefore oriented toward what can be done in the  short term, toward economic interests and the restraining of the  national debt;    --finally the visionary position, which wants to achieve new  jobs through an ecological restructuring of the industrial  society through fundamental reforms of the basic conditions in  the state.    So far the Social Democrats have not been able to present  these three positions as indispensable components of a single  reform process.    For one thing, that is because different politicians of the  SPD express themselves on different details without truly making  the connection clear. Second, individual Social Democrats still  see themselves more as representatives of certain groups of  voters rather than as advocates of a comprehensive overall  concept, as is shown by Christoph Zoepel's reaction to  Scharping's bloated statement on the speed limit or Rudolf  Dressler's protest against Lafontaine's position on social  outlays. And third, the leaders of the SPD made the mistake of  thinking that they could vie for the sympathy of business  associations and conservative media.  <H5>  Successful Public Relations Work Looks Different </H5>   The SPD could copy Helmut Kohl in particular in dealing with  the media and managers. The fact that the chancellor avoids the  media that are critical to him has not hurt him in any election.  And although he might grumble, he absorbs criticism from  business associations. Rudolf Scharping, on the other hand,  reacted to the--probably expected--warning of Heinz-Peter Stihl,  president of the DIHT [German Industrial and Trade Association],  against the Social Democrats with a letter of several pages to  the entrepreneur. Out of understandable personal irritation,  Oskar Lafontaine, in turn, put through a totally  incomprehensible law in the Saarland Parliament to restrict  freedom of the press. That is not what successful public  relations work looks like. Are the Social Democrats unable to  realize this?    At the present time, the chancellor candidate and his most  important aspirant for minister are turning out to be not very  sovereign. And if any comprehensive strategy of the Social  Democrats is recognizable, then it is to make themselves as  unassailable as possible from the conservative side. This,  however, certainly gives rise to doubts about how serious the  party really is about reforms. Meanwhile, one can hear Rudolf  Scharping talk almost more about what he would like to preserve  as head of the government, whereas incumbent Helmut Kohl is  talking about fundamental change.    If one believes Guenter Verheugen, general secretary of the  SPD, then the speculation about the specific ideas of his party  is quite intentional. Verheugen is calling for the people to be  patient, saying that the veil will be lifted on 4 September. At  that time a detailed 100-day program will be presented for the  takeover of the government. Until then the motto will be: there  is much to do, let us wait and see.</p>

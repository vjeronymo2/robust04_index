			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DEATH;  </P> <P> CARDINAL DIES ON LOURDES VISIT  </P> <P> Roman Catholic Cardinal Tomas O Fiaich, the primate of all Ireland and an  ardent Irish nationalist, died Tuesday after falling ill on a pilgrimage to  Lourdes, France, the church announced. He was 66.  </P> <P> The cardinal, who was head of the church in both the Republic of Ireland and  Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland, died of cardiac arrest in a hospital at  Toulouse, 95 miles from Lourdes, officials said.  </P> <P> A church statement said O Fiaich had appeared unwell to doctors accompanying  the group of 600 pilgrims from his seat at Armagh in Northern Ireland.  </P> <P> Lourdes is a Catholic shrine where a peasant girl reported a vision of the  Virgin Mary in 1858. Miraculous cures have been reported there.  </P> <P> The cardinal was admitted first to a hospital in Lourdes, then flown by  helicopter to Toulouse. Philippe Giovanni, director of the Rangueil Hospital  there, said O Fiaich died of a "brutal cardiac arrest" soon after being  admitted.  </P></p>

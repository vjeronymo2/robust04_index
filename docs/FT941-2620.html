			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Options expiries leave bourses marked lower Yesterday's fall in the Eurotrack 100 accelerated in midsession. News that the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr Alan Greenspan, had been called to the White House exacerbated the derivatives expiry effect, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT fielded the expiry of stock and Dax future options. This inflated turnover from DM8bn to DM24.3bn but, in share price terms, it seemed to create little fuss during the official session which saw the Dax index ease just 4.84 to 2,155.61 from Thursday's post bourse close, still 2.5 per cent higher on the week. However, the afternoon was more volatile. It saw an instant reaction to Mr Greenspan's White House call; there was nervous anticipation of the German February M3 figure next week; bunds took a deep dive and the Ibis indicated Dax dropped nearly 26 points more to 2,129.66 before recovering to close at 2,140.39. Mr Detlev Klug, head of sales at B Metzler in Frankfurt, said that options which had been left overhanging the market, with a view to taking profits on Monday, were exercised at a known loss yesterday afternoon. In London, derivatives traders said that investors were selling baskets of equities and buying the Dax June future; the latter closed 27 1/2 points lower at 2,154 which, on a fair value basis (net of carrying costs), meant that the future was trading at a 12-point discount to the cash market. AMSTERDAM weakened on options expiry as well as being unsettled by the bond market. The AEX index lost 6.18 or 1.5 per cent to 418.32, barely changed on the week. Hoogovens fell Fl 4.60 to Fl 60.20 on reports of gloomy forecasts for its steel division. Elsewhere DSM lost Fl 2.20 to Fl 124.20, Akzo Nobel a more modest 70 cents to Fl 221.30, Unilever Fl 4.00 to Fl 205.50 and Elsevier, which reported results on Thursday that slightly disappointed some analysts, Fl 1.80 to Fl 175.60. ZURICH wilted under pressure from the expiry of Soffex futures and options and the market fell 1.5 per cent. The SMI index lost 44.2 to 2,843.5, 0.4 per cent up on the week. Mr Mirko Sangiorgio at Bank Julius Baer commented that the market had tried to move higher early in the week, after its recent consolidation, but turned back in the absence of foreign support. Domestic investors, who had recently taken profits, were unwilling to resume buying at current levels, and he expected that the market could ease further next week. Financials bore the brunt of the day's losses: SBC fell SFr13 or 3 per cent to SFr423 and CS Holding SFr16 or 2.5 per cent to SFr632. MILAN saw profit-taking which left the Comit index 6.08 lower at 674.52, but 1.4 per cent higher on the week. Mr Nicolo Braendli at Akros Sim in Milan commented that the market met resistance when the Comit index reached 680 on Thursday. Domestic investors, increasingly turning their attention to next weekend's election, were seen taking profits although foreign investors were ignoring short term political developments and were continuing to focus on the longer term economic and corporate outlook. Industrials were in retreat after their strong recent gains. Montedison fell L45 or 3.3 per cent to L1,224, Olivetti was L80 or 3.1 per cent lower at L2,525 and Fiat was down L75 to L5,034. BCI was L94 or 1.6 per cent lower at L5,804 as small investors who picked up privatisation stock at L5,400 continued to take profits. STOCKHOLM subsided, although the fall of 18.0, or 1.2 per cent to 1,500 in the Affarsvarlden General index left it a mere fraction lower on the week. Banks and forestry both had a bad day. The interest rate-sensitive SE-Banken reacted to weakness in bonds with the A down SKr1.50 at SKr59; and SCA's proposed SKr1bn international equity issue left the B SKr3 lower at SKr134 although the offer will only fund part of a French transport packaging acquisition.

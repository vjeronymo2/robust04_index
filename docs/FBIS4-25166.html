			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Chen Leqi (7115 2867 7871)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 6 Jun (XINHUA) -- At a recent meeting with  the press, Chen Hong, vice minister in charge of the State  Nationalities Affairs Commission [SNAC] said: As a functional  department of the State Council in charge of the country's  nationalities affairs, the SNAC will adhere to the policy of  regarding economic construction as the central task; strengthen  its macro-management capabilities; and endeavor to promote  equality, unity, mutual assistance, and common prosperity among  all nationalities, to preserve the nation's unification and  stability.    It has been learned that the State Council recently approved  the SNAC's plan on its functional setup, internal structure, and  organizational size [the "three settings" plan]. According to  the plan, the SNAC will further strengthen its macro-management  capabilities; carry through the party Central Committee and the  State Council's principles and policies on nationalities work  and the state's laws and regulations on nationalities affairs;  and step up work on conducting investigation and study, overall  coordination, and supervision and inspection, in order to serve  as a counselor and assistant to the party Central Committee and  State Council on nationalities work.    Chen Hong pointed out: The SNAC's "three settings" plan  approved by the State Council will not only strengthen its  functions, but also increase its responsibility. This is very  helpful in doing good nationalities work in the new period, and  it shows the importance the party Central Committee and State  Council attach to nationalities work, and the concern they show  for it. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the SNAC will  serve well as a counselor and assistant to the party Central  Committee and State Council, and will apply itself to serving  minority nationalities and minority nationalities areas.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: Interest grows in stability pact plan THE French plan for a new European stability pact, aimed at forestalling any future conflict over national minorities in eastern and central Europe, is today expected to receive broad endorsement from Community heads of government. It has already drawn a cautiously interested response from other member governments, and the 12 leaders will today ask their foreign ministers to examine it in greater detail, and report back in time for the next European summit in the autumn. Britain, which might have been expected to be sceptical of launching any new comprehensive plan for eastern Europe, has decided to give the plan a fair wind largely no doubt in the interest of fostering the improvement in Anglo-French relations. British officials said yesterday the government thought the plan was 'very interesting', and was 'happy to study it further'. They were wary in case the French plan should weaken the existing pan-European Helsinki (Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe) process, but thought it contained 'imaginative ideas', worthy of further study, for dealing with serious problems. The heart of the plan, launched by Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister, is that the Community should persuade the countries of eastern Europe to negotiate with their neighbours to resolve the problems of their minorities, in agreements which would subsequently be endorsed by a plenary European conference. The French argue that the break-up of the Soviet empire has revealed the seriousness of the problem of national minorities in eastern Europe, most acutely in the case of the ethnic war in former Yugoslavia. In the latter case the international community proved incapable of preventing the outbreak of violence. But the French claim that the EC has an important interest - and may have the influence - to ensure that this experience is not repeated elsewhere. The first stage in the plan would be a plenary conference to identify the problems of minorities and frontiers which needed settling. Stage two would be a series of negotiations by the relevant sub-groups of countries, assisted by other European countries as mediators. Agreements reached in these sub-negotiations would be endorsed formally six months later, by a second plenary conference of all the participating governments, and incorporated in a 'European pact'. The conference would be attended by most of the countries of eastern and central Europe, as well as by Russia, the US and Canada. But the French propose to exclude the countries of the Caucasus, on the grounds that ethnic conflict has already broken out there. The countries of ex-Yugoslavia would also be excluded for the same reason, unless in the meantime they should have negotiated an effective peace. The prime mover in the conference, as well as in the subsequent negotiations, would be the European Community, since it would be holding out the underlying incentive for the eastern European governments to engage in the negotiations, in the shape of ultimate rapprochement with the EC. The French argue that their plan should be regarded as the Community's first undertaking in the field of the common foreign and security policy as laid down in the Maastricht treaty.</p>

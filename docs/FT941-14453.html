			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Bank in first 'repo' operation The Bank of England yesterday held its first formal sale and repurchase  - or 'repo' - of UK government bonds as part of its sterling money market oper-ations, in an effort to iron out the volatility and liquidity problems that have beset the market since the September 1992 sterling crisis. The new procedures have already been tried and tested on a temporary basis and complement the Bank's existing market operations, in which it accepts bills from the banks in return for lending wholesale cash. The Bank yesterday allotted Pounds 3.84bn in 21-day repos and Pounds 137m of 35-day repos, both at 5 13/32 per cent to be allocated and settled today. This enables banks to borrow money from the Bank for three or five weeks at a rate of 5 13/32 per cent using their gilt holdings as security. While the Bundesbank's repo operations are closely watched by participants in the European financial markets for hints about the direction of Germany's key interest rates, the Bank of England's repo is unlikely to assume the same significance. The Bank has stressed that the repo will not be used to signal changes in monetary policy. 'The Bank of England's daily (bill) operations will continue to provide the main focus,' says Mr Philip Shaw, an economist at Union Discount. But he pointed out that if the liquidity shortages were reduced to such an extent that the Bank did not need to hold an early round of assistance in the money market, the repo rate would provide the first signal of the day - albeit only on the twice-a-month repo dates. When the Bank was forced to support sterling in autumn 1992, the heavy intervention resulted in a large drain of liquidity from the money market. As a result, daily shortages of more than Pounds 1bn have become a regular occurrence. The Bank introduced temporary repos to alleviate the problems. The intention is to extend this repo facility to all banks and building societies, but because of legal complications, this was not possible at yesterday's repo: only the biggest banks and building societies, as well as the discount houses and gilt-edged market makers, were able to participate.

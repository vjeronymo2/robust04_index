			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Yi Chang-sop] </F>   [Text] The American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Seoul  is calling on Korea to raise the foreign stock ownership  ceiling, currently set at 10 percent for each issue, and to end  the practice requiring foreign investors to get identification  cards (IDs) in order to invest in the stock market.    It is the first time that American brokers here officially  urge Korea to expand the foreign stock ownership ceiling.    Furthermore, AmCham says Korea no longer needs to require  foreign investors to get ID cards as it has already implemented  the real-name financial transaction system. Furthermore, it  said the ID card requirement is "costly" for international  investors.    It is also urging Seoul to introduce the "independent'  insurance brokerage system and speed up the pace of the  pre-announced schedule for the liberalization and opening of the  cross-border and reinsurance markets.    AmCham also is proposing that Korea give foreign insurance  companies operating here greater freedom to develop creative and  tailor-made policies and diversify premiums, adding that Korea  maintains a "sameness" in its insurance market.    An American insurer said, "Korea's Ministry of Finance has  implemented many changes since last year but we want to see the  (liberalization) pace quicker." He said change is coming and it  is good but the pace is slower than I anticipated.    Amcham Korea will send its "draft" paper, which is made up  of  the wish lists of American businessmen and financiers here, to  the Korean government, including the Economic Planning Board,  next week for comment. It will formally publish the position  paper early next month following discussion with the AmCham head  office in Washington, sources said.    The AmCham draft report also trains proposals from U.S.  bankers here who "want to see the expansion of their funding  sources, elimination of the remaining barriers in the  development of risk-management derivatives products such as  swaps, options, and futures as well as combinations of these  instruments."    It also indicated that foreign bankers want to be freed from  their obligation to limit credit extension to five or ten major  Korean conglomerates and the mandatory lending ratio for small-  and medium-sized companies. An American banker here said, "All  of our recommendations are "old issues," adding that "Our wish  list becomes thinner and thinner as Korea has made significant  progress in liberalizing the financial market in recent years."    AmCham also expressed the hope that Korea free foreign  enterprises and joint venture companies from paying taxes on  what Korea calls excessive retained earnings so that they can  recycle much of their earnings into investing and expanding  their operations here.    Early this year, the Ministry of Finance lowered the  so-called excessive earnings tax rate to 15 percent from 25  percent, following a strong request from Washington.    The AmCham report contains the hope of American businessmen  that Seoul will implement its foreign direct investment  promotion policy in a packaged, comprehensive and quick manner,  rather than in a gradual and piece-meal way, sources said.</p>

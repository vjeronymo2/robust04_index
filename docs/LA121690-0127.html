			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WANTS 'CRIME SECTION'  </P> <P> In my 43 years as a professional bail bondsman, and after thoroughly studying  and analyzing the overall picture of crime and punishment, I have come up with  the following observations:  </P> <P> Start publishing the names, addresses, occupations and charges of all the  prostitutes, johns, drunk drivers and all persons arrested or detained in a  24-hour period.  </P> <P> Make a "crime section" in your paper similar to your sports financial and  society sections. Crime is the most important activity in the minds of the  public, according to all the public polls that are taken.  </P> <P> Try it. The public will love it and the law breakers will hate it.  </P> <P> GEORGE STAHLMAN, San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria May 31 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela and  some of his colleagues are positive that the Afrikaner nation  should be accommodated, Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front --  AVF] leader Ferdi Hartzenberg said on Tuesday [31 May].    He told a news conference at Donkerhoek the AVF's aim was to  come to a settlement on an Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] within  the next two years while the new constitution was being  finalised.    He was very satisfied with negotiations with the government  so far, he said. The forum created for negotiations on a  volkstaat between the AVF, Freedom Front [FF] and the government  was a peaceful route to attain the volkstaat goal.    Ethnic violence was the most important source of violence  and  it was necessary that this be addressed to secure investments,  he added.    More and more people realised and supported the idea that  the  Afrikaner nation should be accommodated for a permanent  solution, he said. At least two-thirds of Afrikaners wanted  self-determination, also a "substantial number" of National  Party supporters, he claimed.    If the Afrikaner nation was free it would put "everything  into it" to develop the nation and the country as a whole.    There were many practical problems to attain a volkstaat but  those should be solved through negotiations, he added. "We have  always preferred the peaceful option".    The Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement] was  not taking part in the activities of the AVF, he said.    Signs were there that the volkstaat ideal would bring the  nation together.    After a report-back to his constituency, Dr Hartzenberg  would  contact FF leader Constand Viljoen about the tri-partite  negotiations forum for a volkstaat.    Very few people attended the Republic Day festivities at the  Radio Pretoria premises at Donkerhoek, but Dr Hartzenberg  ascribed this to poor publicity.    Ds Mossie van den Bergh, Radio Pretoria management committee  chairman told SAPA at the gathering that the station would  consider undisclosed "alternative methods" if the broadcaste?  had not been granted a licence by the end of June.    The station was in the process of applying for a licence to  the Independent Broadcast Authority. "We decided to obey the  rules and play the game until the end of June. If it seems our  efforts to obtain a licence are unsuccessful we will consider  alternative methods," he said.</p>

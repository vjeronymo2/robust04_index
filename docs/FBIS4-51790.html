			<p>BFN     [Text] Pusan, May 3 (YONHAP) -- A local Chinese Fishery  Office continues to hold 22 South Korean fishermen as hostages  in its attempt to obtain money from Korea.    An official at the Taeyang Fishery Co. here, to which part  of the captured fishermen belong, said Tuesday the Fishery  Administration Office in Luxi, Jiangxi Province of China was  demanding money in return for the release of the fishermen  without reporting the case to higher authorities.    Eleven of the 22 fishermen being unlawfully held in Luxi  were  the crew members of Taehung-ho No. 27 caught by a Chinese patrol  boat in the high seas 175 miles southwest of Cheju-do last April  29. The 11 others were the crews of Songkwang-ho No. 2 also  seized by a Chinese patrol vessel the same day roughly in the  same area.    The official said a message from Taehung-ho No. 28, a sister  boat of the seized Taehung-ho No. 27, indicated that the Luxi  Fishery Office forced the hostages to tell Taehung-ho No. 28 in  telex to go back to Korea and bring 50,000 dollars.    Chinese officials threaten that unless the money is given to  them, they would handle the captured fishermen according to law,  the official said.    Luxi fishery office people even intimidate the hostages into  surrendering all the money they have, he said.    Taehung-ho No. 28 which was near the scene of the seizure,  followed the Chinese patrol boat carrying the captured fishermen  all the way to just outside the territorial waters of China and  has been staying there.    The Luxi fishery office was making a similar demand toward  the 11 fishermen of Songkwang-ho No. 2, a source said.</p>

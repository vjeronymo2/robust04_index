			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Observer: Cash in hand Severely strapped for cash, Conservative party officials are having to become pretty resourceful in their quest to turn an extra penny. But the prize so far must go to the loyal workers in treasury minister Stephen Dorrell's seat of Loughborough. They are spending the week at the annual conference seeking out prominent Euro-sceptics to autograph Teresa Gorman's new book, The Bastards, billed as the inside story of the Euro-sceptics' revolt against Maastricht 'and how the government stamped it out'. The plan is to auction the embellished tome to raise money for Dorrell's local constituency. Signatures assembled to date include those of corporate affairs minister Neil Hamilton, Lord Tebbit, the former party chairman, who further identifies himself as 'one who knows who his father is', and John Carlisle, the MP for Luton North, who appends the legend 'barmy'. Thatcherite chief treasury secretary Michael Portillo is understood to have declined to lend his name to the endeavour. The views of ardently pro-European Dorrell on this display of local initiative are not known.</p>

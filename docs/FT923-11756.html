			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel The secondary market in bank loans is all well and good when it is confined to the debt of distant countries such as Argentina and Peru. It is a different matter when it comes to quoted UK companies. The revelation that a small amount of Eurotunnel debt has changed hands at a discount of about 30 per cent to its face value may have a significance out of proportion to the size of the actual deals concerned. Quite apart from the questions it must raise about the value of the company's shares, banks must also begin to wonder about the value of the Pounds 4bn or so of loans that the company has already drawn. Of course, the secondary market in sovereign loans has never been a perfect measure of value. In its early stages, particularly, prices fluctuated more in relation to regulatory factors affecting banks' ability to trade the debt than to real changes in the creditworthiness of the borrowers. The secondary market in corporate debt is also beset with technical factors which may make prices unrepresentative. One could easily imagine, for example, that Eurotunnel's debt price has fallen victim to a Japanese bank decision to run down its overseas loan book. That may provide an excuse for other lenders to relax at this stage. But Eurotunnel has had to negotiate a waiver on its banking covenants, and the fact that some of its debt has changed hands at such a large discount adds to the impression of risk inherent in the project. The textbook conclusion would be that if the bankers are under water they are already standing on shareholders' shoulders. There appears even less chance now of lenders providing additional finance beyond that which is already committed, except on terms which would be detrimental to the interests of existing equity investors.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] We have already reported that last Saturday a  meeting of the chairmen of the Supreme Soviets of Armenia and  Azerbaijan was held on the Armenian-Azerbaijani border. Today  the head of the Armenian parliament held a news conference on  its results.    [Correspondent Vladimir Nazaryan] Having simply described  the  meeting on the border as a useful and constructive one, Babken  Araktsyan informed journalists of the contents of the  conversation that took place in every detail. The main thing  that both sides agree upon is that there is an urgent necessity  for a lasting truce in the region which would make political  dialogue possible. Mutual understanding was achieved with  regard to the issue of the Lachin humanitarian corridor which  will be in place even when a separating buffer zone is created  around Nagorno-Karabakh. As a unilateral initiative and without  any preconditions, Armenia is ready to allow Azerbaijan to use  its communications to transfer necessary electric power and  freight to Nakhichevan. This would allow the unfounded  accusations regarding the blockade of this autonomous republic  by Armenia to be dropped.</p>

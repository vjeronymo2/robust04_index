			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The World Jewish Congress, which opened its first office in a Communist country  this week, could open one in the Soviet Union in the near future, the group's  president said. The new office, opened Monday in Budapest, Hungary, is designed  to work with Hungary's 80,000 Jews and with the small Jewish populations in  other East European countries outside the Soviet Union. "My guess is that (we)  will have an office in the Soviet Union within the next two years," Edgar M.  Bronfman, the group's president, said. But he said Soviet Jews, estimated to  number at least 1.8 million, would first have to become more organized.  </P></p>

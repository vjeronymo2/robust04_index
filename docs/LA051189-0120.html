			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DELAY ON CITYHOOD ACTION SPARKS ANGER  </P> <P> Angry Malibu residents screamed at Local Agency Formation Commission members  Wednesday after the panel voted to delay action on the community's  incorporation request for one week.  </P> <P> Nearly two dozen Malibu residents had pleaded earlier with the panel to spare  the community further delays and give residents a chance to vote on cityhood.  After LAFCO approved in August a previous cityhood application for Malibu, a  Los Angeles Superior Court judge rescinded the action and ordered an  environmental impact report on the impact of cityhood.  </P> <P> However, a majority of commissioners agreed with LAFCO member and county  Supervisor Ed Edelman, who said that postponing a vote on Malibu's  incorporation proposal one week would not harm the chances of placing the issue  before voters later this year.  </P></p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Rothschild eyes expansion in Germany ROTHSCHILD, the German banking arm of the Rothschild family banking group, is to expand its operations in Germany by providing additional services to private and institutional investors. The Rothschild empire was founded in Frankfurt in 1792 but the family left Germany in 1901, returning only in 1989 when it opened a joint representative office for its London, Paris and Zurich operations. Since 1989, Rothschild's German business has been concentrated on corporate finance and private client activities.</p>

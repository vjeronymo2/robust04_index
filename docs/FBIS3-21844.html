According to the Sichuan Provincial Bureau of Public  Security, on August 28 last year, police in the Jinmu District  of Chengdu Municipality learnt that a gang of people were  engaging in drug trafficking. Police were immediately sent to  track down and investigate the case after which they were joined  by another special police team, organized by the provincial,  municipal, and district public security departments, taking the  total number of policemen on the case to over 100. The case was  finally settled after over 170 days of efforts.    The drug trafficking gang was made up of illegal elements  from Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guangdong. Since the first half of  1992, these criminals, acting in league with overseas drug  traffickers, had conducted drug trafficking and smuggling  activities on several occasions, making profits of several  millions of renminbi.    In this case, the police also confiscated five imported  luxury cars, over 1 million renminbi, and a number of weapons,  ammunition, and equipment for drug processing.</p>

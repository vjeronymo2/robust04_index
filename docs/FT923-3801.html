			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Sweden Sweden continues to reap the consequences of its remorseless monetary squeeze. But with real interest rates in the mid to high teens, the pressure on the financial sector seems to be growing unbearable. Just as the central bank was bracing itself to raise its marginal overnight lending rate to 75 per cent yesterday, it became clear that the government would have to rescue Gotabanken, the country's fourth largest bank. It has little option but to do so. A large bank failure would undermine efforts to maintain the krona exchange rate because it would brutally expose the economic impact of present high interest rates. Trygg-Hansa, the insurance company which owns Gotabanken, simply cannot afford to continue pumping money into its banking subsidiary. Gota's position appears to have deteriorated at an alarming rate. Its problem loans now exceed by a wide margin the SKr13.5bn loss insurancetaken out as recently as June. Trygg-Hansa would be left with capital of only SKr8.4bn after writing off its investment in Gota and its exposure to Svenska Kredit, the credit insurance company which collapsed yesterday. It would still have a respectable solvency margin of 114 per cent on its Swedish property and casualty business. But the figure would be much lower with consolidation of its US business and the company has acquired a reputation for lurching from blunder to blunder. As long as the monetary squeeze continues, the problems of the financial sector can only grow worse. The government has already spent SKr25bn bailing out Nordbanken, another large bank. It looks as though taxpayers will have to pay for monetary rectitude for years to come. There will be precious little by way of economic growth to enjoy in return.</p>

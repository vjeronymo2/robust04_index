			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Koor Industries returns to profit after five years KOOR Industries, Israel's largest industrial conglomerate, yesterday reported its first annual net profit in five years. The company posted net earnings of Dollars 89m in 1991, after losing Dollars 48m the previous year. Faced with the threat of liquidation three years ago, Koor launched a recovery programme and last September signed a comprehensive debt restructuring programme with its local and foreign creditors. 'For the first time in 1991, our financial statements reflected the full extent of an administrative, operational and financial revolution that has taken place at Koor,' said Mr Benjamin Gaon, president. 'Comparison of the reported results since 1988 clearly indicates the constant improvement over those years.' Koor's operational profits were up by 84 per cent last year, to Dollars 134m. Sales fell 11 per cent to Dollars 2.4bn, compared with the previous year. This was attributed to reduced holdings in subsidiaries. Since 1987, Koor has registered Dollars 720m in accumulated losses. As part of its recovery programme, it cut its workforce by almost 50 per cent, to about 16,000 people. It also sold off more than Dollars 300m in assets. Under the terms of the financial restructuring signed last year, the Israeli banks, which were owed Dollars 600m, exchanged a third of their debt for equity and rescheduled the remainder over nine years. As a result, they have become collectively the biggest shareholders in Koor.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The decision of the National Assembly to allow the  passage of the UN convoy to Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] prompted the following statement  of Valentin Stoyanov, spokesman for the president of the  Republic:    [Begin Stoyanov recording] In connection with the numerous  queries as to whether there is a change in Bulgaria's position  toward the conflict in former Yugoslavia I must state the  following:    The president of the Republic of Bulgaria supports the  decision of the National Assembly to allow a one-time  transshipment of UN property and equipment through our territory  for the Blue Helmets in the independent and sovereign Republic  of Macedonia.    It is well-known that our country has good-neighborly  relations with Macedonia, which is not a participant in the  military conflict.    This is a prudent decision that conforms to Bulgaria's  national interests and the measures for security in the Balkans  and to ending the war in former Yugoslavia.    Bulgaria supports the efforts of the United Nations, NATO,  and the European Union to settle the conflict peacefully and  establish peace in the Balkans.    The decision of the National Assembly does not contradict  the  basic principles of Bulgaria's Balkan policy, to which our  country has firmly adhered since the beginning of the war,  according to which Bulgaria, as a neighboring country, should  not commit itself in any manner in the conflict.    Bulgaria insisted and continues to insist that all Balkan  countries, Yugoslavia's neighbors, strictly adhere to this  principle. Therefore Bulgaria opposes sending Blue Helmets from  Turkey or any other Balkan on neighboring country of former  Yugoslavia.    This is the essence of the special message that President  Zhelev sent one month ago to Butrus-Ghali, UN general secretary.    The equipment the United Nations sends to the Blue Helmets  in  Macedonia has a preventive and deterrent purpose. It is a  barrier against the eventual spread of the conflict in the  direction of Macedonia. This corresponds to our national  interests, because Macedonia's security means security for  Bulgaria.    As far as the party games and speculations are concerned  about some corridor through which Turkish Blue Helmets will pass  through Bulgaria, I am authorized to state most categorically  that no one has requested or discussed such a possibility. No  such commitment has been assumed. [end recording]</p>

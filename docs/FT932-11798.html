			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (18): Lure of the feel-good factor  -How They Go THE simple answer to the question 'How do the latest cars go?' is: at least as well as cars of twice their price 15 years ago. Giant strides have been made in improving the refinement and ride comfort, safety and sheer easy driveability of the medium-sized and medium-priced car. So much so that the executive car costing less than Pounds 20,000 is now so good that company car users demanding better must be more concerned with status than with the practicalities of business motoring. It is no exaggeration to say that today's superminis such as the Nissan Micra and Vauxhall Corsa are the equal of yesterday's small-medium cars in everything but bulk. Much the same comment applies to the small-medium cars  -such as the Rover 200-400, Ford Escort-Orion, Citroen ZX-Peugeot 306 and Vauxhall Astra - and the modestly-priced larger models from the high-volume producers, such as the Citroen Xantia, Ford Mondeo, Nissan Primera, Peugeot 405, Rover 600, Toyota Carina E and Vauxhall Cavalier. In fact, the latest crop of new models is so good one almost has to nit-pick to find fault. It is true that the Mondeo's ride deteriorates slightly as one moves up range and the tyres become wider and squatter - but the upside is handling and cornering of a standard confined to high-performing sports cars not long ago. The performance, refinement and comfort of cars in the size and price classes of the Mondeo must inevitably encourage some user-choosers to trade down and reduce the tax man's take. For example, the latest Vauxhall Cavalier automatic with a 2.5-litre, V6 engine, or a two-pedal Rover 623GSi, both way below a Pounds 20,000 list price, would probably please any Senator or 820i user untroubled by loss of perceived status. The slow but inexorable move towards diesels in company fleets - and pressure on executives to follow suit - need bring no loss of motoring enjoyment. The latest turbocharged and intercooled diesel cars such as the Audi 80 and 100, Rover 825, Citroen XM and Peugeot 605 - not to mention the BMWs due here in the very near future - are light years away from the sluggish diesels of the 1970s and early 1980s. Although they are still more noisy at start-up than petrol cars, they cruise on motorways in near silence, have lively acceleration and need tanking up at much greater intervals. Although the forthcoming abandonment of the over-1,999cc tax barrier on company cars removes some of their raison d'etre, the just-under-2-litre petrol engine with a turbocharger can provide the executive car user with the best of both worlds. Driven gently with an eye on the boost gauge, they offer 2-litre economy. Potential 3-litre performance (and, of course, fuel consumption) is there when required. Sensitive drivers, though, exploit the turbocharged engine's massive low-speed torque by staying in a high gear for overtaking and hill climbing instead of changing down, which benefits economy. Good examples of these 'split personality' cars are the Citroen XM, Lancia Thema and Saab 9000. But however good the under-Pounds 20,000 cars are, there are always user-choosers whose companies are prepared to pay more and who are themselves willing to find the extra income tax. Only in the highest reaches of the premium quality and luxury car market does the tax burden become oppressive. It can, in fact, be argued that lower rates of depreciation affect the total motoring costs so much that, a Mercedes 190E, for example, is a better financial bet, long term, than an apparently cheaper car. Its successor, the keenly awaited C-class, seems likely to be as much a benchmark car as the 190 has been for over 10 years. For some people, a BMW, Jaguar or Mercedes-Benz has a 'feel good' factor which is more easily recognised than described. My personal pick of this top-quality crop would be a BMW 5-Series or 7-Series with a 3-litre or 4-litre V8 engine and 5-speed automatic; a Jaguar XJ6 3.2-litre or 4-litre; or a Mercedes-Benz 320E. The only other saloon of comparable price that equals - and in some respects exceeds - their standards of performance and refinement is that bogeyman of the European luxury car maker, the superlative Toyota Lexus LS400.</p>

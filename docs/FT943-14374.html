			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Rifkind cuts 18,000 defence jobs: RAF faces heaviest personnel losses - Blow softened by weapons orders for Pounds 5bn More than 18,000 British defence jobs are to be cut, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, said yesterday, but he softened the blow by announcing orders for new weapons worth about Pounds 5bn. His announcement, which drew angry protests from opposition parties and trade unions, marked the conclusion of an eight-month study designed to cut Pounds 750m from the annual defence budget from 1997 onwards. Mr Rifkind told the Commons the cost-saving drive would make no difference to Britain's fighting strength and the money saved would enable some upgrading of capacity. The heaviest job losses will be in the Royal Air Force which will lose 7,500 personnel, while another 7,100 civilian jobs are to go. To offset the job losses, Mr Rifkind announced firm orders for Pounds 2.4bn tenders for additional hardware worth a similar amount. 'The orders will preserve and enhance our fighting strength and help sustain over 10,000 jobs,' Mr Rifkind said. 'Our plans for the armed forces reflect the challenges we are likely to face. We are determined to maintain that position and not drop our guard.' Mr David Clark, Labour's defence spokesman, rejected the contention that fighting strength was unimpaired. He said that in the event of war 'today's short-term financial savings could cost British lives'. Mr Rifkind announced orders for seven new minehunters for the Royal Navy, 259 Challenger-2 tanks for the army and a substantial upgrading of 142 Tornado aircraft in service with the RAF. Further orders will follow, including two new Royal Marine assault ships to replace HMS Fearless and HMS Intrepid, a further batch of three Type 23 frigates and up to six Trafalgar class nuclear submarines. The MoD also confirmed that the royal dockyards at Devonport and Rosyth are to be privatised. Several smaller RAF stations, including RAF Pitreavie in Fife, Scampton in Lincolnshire and Finningley in Yorkshire are to close, but the naval base at Rosyth is to remain open with a reduced role. Its ships are to be assigned to Faslane on the Clyde and Portsmouth in Hampshire, and 700 jobs will be lost at the base with an additional 1,500 naval personnel moved elsewhere. Some 900 jobs will remain. The cuts go to the highest level in the forces with some 20 military and civil service posts of the rank of major general or above being abolished. At the Ministry of Defence headquarters in London, a further 1,500 jobs are to go and two buildings are to close. Some 500 jobs will go at the defence procurement executive in Bristol. Logistic support is being rationalised with the closure of 17 stores and the loss of 1,500 jobs. Many of the orders spelt out yesterday had been expected for some time. However, Mr Rifkind made a surprise announcement that, in the light of experience in the Gulf war, the UK would be ordering laser-guided Paveway 3 bombs from the US manufacturer Texas Instruments. It was also opening negotiations with the US government to buy the Tomahawk cruise missile. These 'smart' munitions proved particularly effective in the Gulf. Mr Rifkind also announced that a frigate and a submarine which were previously to have been mothballed would be retained in active service. A joint service rapid deployment force, including paratroopers, marines and RAF aircraft, is to be formed. Several new institutions to be used by all three services will replace single-service facilities. Senior officers had apparently opposed the emphasis on tri-service operations, but ministers regarded it as an important change.

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Books: Poetic 'counter-culture' runs out of steam GRANDCHILDREN OF ALBION edited by Michael Horovitz New Departures (Piedmont, Bisley, Stroud, Glos.) Pounds 9.99, 416 pages CHILDREN OF Albion was an anthology of underground poetry in Britain 'edited and extradicted' by Michael Horovitz, published as a Penguin paperback in 1969. With its title and cover design from William Blake and long, dithyrambic Afterword by the extradicter, it was and remains a flavoursome product of its period, an authentic document of a 'counter-culture' vital enough in its poetic energies to win praise from such an 'overground' figure as Ted Hughes. Horovitz's canon of alternative writings comprised political protest poetry such as Adrian Mitchell's famous 'To Whom It May Concern', dialect poems like Tom Pickard's Geordie 'Shag', and poems influenced in general by the experience of public reading. Horovitz was an instigator of the first International Poetry Incarnation at the Albert Hall in 1965, an event which did much to set the fashion for poetry as performance. If it seemed paradoxical to establish a 'canon' of works whose thrust was precisely to de-academise the writing and appreciation of poetry, both of which had reached heights of hermetic irony in the preceding years of the 'Movement', the anthology read in retrospect has a satisfying and qualitative feel, and I find it rather more interesting now than when I first encountered it in the 1970s. But Horovitz regards the 'underground' impulse as having continued unabated, its radicalism having become a part of our everyday lives and at the same time been retained as a necessary protest against new ills. He himself has kept the flame alive by organising 'Poetry Olympics' for the performance of verse and by editing his irregular journal New Departures. These allied ventures are reflected in this new anthology to which he has given the logical but somewhat self-dismissive title Grandchildren of Albion. The book is strikingly inferior to its parent. Horovitz's generosity of spirit has led him to embrace just about any work that kicks against a poetry Establishment defined in terms of Craig Raine's 'Martian school' and the Penguin Book of Contemporary British Poetry. 'All-white's alright' is the motto imputed to the latter, whereas Horovitz's anthology bends over ideologically backwards to accommodate 'a quorum of the most energetic diversity of black, Asian, female and feminist, regional, urban and rural, communal, ecological and heterodox extremes based in Britain', as he phrases it in a much briefer though more militant Afterword than 1969's. His ethical stance seems to have impaired his aesthetic judgment, for many of the poems included here would be embarrassing in a school magazine, while the visual appearance of the book - with its eclectic graphics, roughly assorted illustrations, stretches of musical notation, and mysteriously dropped first 16 page numbers - bespeaks no great fastidousness. It is one of the messiest publications I've seen. The book's deeper problem is that the counter-culture has not survived as a significant force in the way that Horovitz would like to think. In the 1960s it was apprehended, even by its opponents, as a positive, central force, not to be confined to the margins of society, always threatening the whole. Adrian Mitchell's proud rhetoric ('Tell me lies about Vietnam') has an authority deriving from a profound political consensus; his bitterness is decidedly supra-personal. But the Thatcher years have reduced many of Albion's grandchildren to a smouldering personal rancour. They do not bear a global weight of responsibility so much as a chip on the shoulder. The over-generous selection from Carol Ann Duffy's work has an unappealing hardness of tone that is typical. Nor has the tradition of poetry-in-performance helped matters: virtually all these pieces have an eye on audience effect and poetry is all too often trivialised into anecdote. The strength of the anthology is probably its large quota of Caribbean dialect poems, though their consequence is not always easy to distinguish from their quaintness (but that's a problem with Chaucer too). Pieces like John Agard's 'Palm Tree King' and 'Listen Mr Oxford Don' and Valerie Bloom's children's ballad 'Don' Go Ova Dere' are funny, fetching and hard to forget. After Fiona Pitt-Kethley's scurfy anecdotes, the lower-case feminist doodlings of Michele Roberts, and Attila the Stockbroker's weak suburban satires, they come as a considerable relief.</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISOR URGES REPLACEMENT FOR HIGH DESERT HOSPITAL  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich plans to ask the Board of  Supervisors on Tuesday to approve replacing county-owned High Desert Hospital  with a new facility in the fast-growing Antelope Valley, the supervisor's staff  said Thursday.  </P> <P> "We can't keep up with the growth of this community," said Walter Gray,  administrator of the 171-bed hospital. "There really is a tremendous need."  </P> <P> Antonovich's proposal that a 270-bed hospital be built in Lancaster on 40 acres  of county-owned property is on the agenda for the board's Tuesday meeting. The  facility would cost about $171 million and would be completed in 1997.  </P> <P> Antonovich will ask the board to allocate $1.4 million for a site survey and  architectural plans for the initial phase of the proposed hospital. Some of the  money needed to build the hospital could be obtained from the state, the  supervisor said.  </P> <P> In the first phase, a birthing center would be built to handle the increased  volume of deliveries in the area. High Desert, which originally was built as a  tuberculosis hospital for jail inmates, is not large enough to have an  obstetrics wing. Instead, the county contracts with Antelope Valley Medical  Center in Lancaster to deliver county patients' babies.  </P> <P> Most of the women who would deliver their babies at High Desert are poor. They  now receive prenatal care at either the county health center in Lancaster or at  High Desert.  </P> <P> The Antelope Valley, like other areas of the county, is experiencing a boom in  births, said Dr. Dorris Harris, chief of public health centers in the North  County area.  </P> <P> A pregnant woman who calls for her first appointment has to wait 25 working  days to be examined initially at the county clinic, far longer than the  county's two-week guideline, Harris said.  </P> <P> Antonovich's motion said county health officials predict that the birthing  center, which would also provide prenatal services, could open by 1995 and  handle the anticipated volume of deliveries for at least 10 years.  </P> <P> The construction of surgical and medical facilities would complete the second  phase of the hospital's construction, Gray said. A third phase would build  housing for county nursing home patients and rehabilitation patients recovering  from strokes or accidents.  </P> <P> Gray said the hospital is operating at capacity, but is not overwhelmed yet. A  new hospital is needed so it can avoid having more patients than beds as the  community continues to grow, he said.  </P> <P> The county is exploring potential uses for the High Desert facility if a new  hospital is built. It might serve as a hospital for the county's Mira Loma  jail, across the street from the hospital, said Tim Moore, an administrative  assistant at the hospital. The state, which plans to build a prison nearby,  might also wish to use it, he said.  </P></p>

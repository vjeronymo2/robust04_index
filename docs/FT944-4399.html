			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Exports help Mansfield Brewery increase 17% Increased beer exports to the former Soviet Union helped Mansfield Brewery raise its lower margin take-home volumes by 39 per cent in the first half. The group reported pre-tax profits 17 per cent ahead for the six months to October 1, from Pounds 7.47m to Pounds 8.76m. Total turnover rose by almost 11 per cent from Pounds 60m to Pounds 66.5m. Earnings per share increased from 8.04p to 9.36p, and the interim dividend is raised from 1.25p to 1.5p. The shares closed yesterday at 236p, up 6p. Mr Paul Handley, finance director, said the group had begun exporting beer to the former Soviet Union 12 months ago, but it had 'taken off in the last six months'. The beer, sold in plastic bottles, is designed specifically for the market, and features new brands - Monarch and Majesty. However, the group warned that the Russian beer market tended to be quieter in the winter. In the UK, take-home beer volumes were ahead just 4 per cent, and margins were static. On-trade beer and cider volumes were 2.3 per cent higher. Mr Handley said that in a recessionary environment the group had pushed up profits in all sectors, driven by both organic growth and acquisitions. The results had been helped to some extent by the warm summer weather. Like-for-like volumes were static at the managed houses, but profits were 6 per cent up, reflecting higher margins and increased food sales. The group acquired 10 new houses in the half, and expects another 10 to be on stream by Christmas. It now owns 485 houses in Nottinghamshire and Humberside, and has started to expand southwards into Northamptonshire. Interest payable fell from Pounds 2.45m to Pounds 2.17m, and gearing edged ahead to 44.9 per cent. Mr Handley said yesterday's rise in interest rates would not affect the group before the end of the financial year.</p>

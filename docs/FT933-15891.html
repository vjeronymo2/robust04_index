			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / World Trade News: UK cover for Poland resumed THE Export Credits Guarantee Department, the UK's official export credit insurer, has resumed medium-term cover for Poland after an 11-year lapse which followed Poland's partial default on its foreign debt in 1982, writes Anthony Robinson. Mr Richard Needham, the UK trade minister, said cover would be available on standard OECD terms to support exports of capital goods, semi-capital goods and services to Poland. Resumption of ECGD cover, designed to improve UK exporters' opportunities in the Polish market, reflects Poland's successful re-negotiation of its Dollars 33bn (Pounds 22bn) debt to the Paris Club of official creditors in 1991. Polish-UK trade has grown over the past two years but has been held back by bank financing difficulties and the lack of EGCD cover. In 1992 UK exports, boosted by rising oil sales, increased to Pounds 605m from Pounds 347 in 1991 while Polish exports to the UK rose from Pounds 313m in 1991 to Pounds 356m last year. The first quarter of 1993 showed gains, with UK exports up 65 per cent to Pounds 170m while imports from Poland rose 20 per cent to Pounds 101m.</p>

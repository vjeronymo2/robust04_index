			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Markets: Metal exchange moves house - Commodities With many of its contract prices at or near recent highs and volumes booming in most of its markets, the London Metal Exchange could hardly have chosen a more auspicious moment for today's move to bigger premises. At about 26,000 sq ft the purpose-built premises in Leadenhall Street in the City doubles the exchange's space, allowing the provision of expanded technological facilities to cope with rising trading volumes. Total turnover this year is expected to grow by between 20 and 30 per cent from 1993's record of 35.28m lots, taking the average daily trading value to about Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.1bn). Traders may have little leisure to savour their new surroundings, if last week's performance is anything to go by. After a hectic five days, all six of the LME's base metals contracts ended with net gains, notably copper, the exchange's flagship, which rose by nearly 4 per cent, and aluminium, up 4.2 per cent. Fears remain that the speed of the recent price rises could result in sharp corrections for 'overbought' markets. But the bulls will have been encouraged by the fact that Friday's bout of end-of-the-week profit-taking generally found good support not far below ruling price levels. The LME will meet fresh competition from tomorrow, when the Shanghai Metals Exchange launches standard futures for lead, zinc, nickel and tin. But there seems no reason for concern that its pre-eminent position in international metals trading could seriously be threatened. Other events this week include a three-day conference, beginning today in Vancouver, Canada, on Latin American Mining and, possibly, the publication of the keenly-awaited official assessment of frost and drought damage to the 1995-96 Brazilian coffee crop. Uncertainty about this crop and weather prospects in coffee-growing regions has led to a slow-down in trading activity at the London Commodity Exchange and a substantial retracement in contract prices.</p>

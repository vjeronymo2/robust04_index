			<p>BFN     [Text] VILNIUS, Apr 13, BNS - Lithuanian Defense Minister  Linas Linkevicius says he does not intend to resign yet,  although conditions for work are "difficult." In an interview  with the leftist TIESA newspaper, Linkevicius, who is a member  of the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP], said  some of LDDP members have prejudices against national defense.    "I see ill-favored criticism in this, although I earlier  thought that I am criticized well-wishing," the minister said.    Linkevicius recently announced his decision to leave the  parliament's National Security Committee, which is dominated by  LDDP members.</p>

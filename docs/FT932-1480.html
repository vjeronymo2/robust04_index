			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tanzania says Dutch to halt cotton industry finance THE NETHERLANDS, which has financed Tanzania's cotton industry over the past 11 years, will stop funding next month, an official of the Tanzania Cotton Marketing Board said, reports Reuter from Dar es Salaam. 'They are pulling out. They have not been too happy with us,' said TCMB economist Mr Ali Ngongolo. Under the Dutch Cotton Assistance Programme, the Netherlands pumped USDollars 100m into Tanzania's cotton industry in the form of equipment and spare parts for ginneries, trucks, a new ginnery, technical assistance and training. Marketing board officials say the Dutch wanted rapid liberalisation of the cotton sector, including the removal of price controls and privatisation of the state-run marketing body. 'We agreed with the concept, but it had to be gradual,' Mr Ngongolo said. Agriculture ministry officials said that new proposals to liberalise cotton trading might be rushed through parliament in the current debate on the budget. These included new legislation to allow the private sector into the ginning business and individual investors to be allowed to buy and export cotton. In 11 years of Dutch assistance, the capacity of the country's 58 ginneries has soared from 200,000 bales. Some 462,000 bales were ginned in the 1991-92 season in the Lake Victoria cotton belt, marketing board officials said.</p>

			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of Italian Industry (8): Intelligence opens the door  -Turin Polytechnic pioneered research links with industry THE CONCEPT of linking universities and polytechnics with industry, both to raise funds and to cross-fertilise R &amp; D, has been little developed in Italy. University statutes have been structured so that they are centrally controlled from Rome - and dependent upon the government for funding. Thus there has been little incentive for them to seek external funding or offer their skills and facilities to industry. This position has been reinforced by the limited number of industrial concerns of sufficient size and technological advancement to consider collaboration. Within this broad overall picture, Turin Polytechnic has proved a notable exception. It has taken advantage of its location to pioneer research links with industry. Turin, the company town of Fiat, has been the centre of the Italian automotive industry while also hosting an important range of engineering establishments in the surrounding Piedmont. This has proved a fertile catchment area for contract work now both national and international in its scope. 'Today we obtain about 7 per cent of our total funding from outside contractual work,' says Professor Rudolfo Zich, the rector. These contracts now cover 40 per cent of the polytechnic's annual research budget; they will be worth L9bn this year. The activity, first developed in the early post-war years, has been helped by the polytechnic's status: it specialises in engineering, physics and mathematics, together with separate faculty of architecture. Contractual work was a logical extension of its prime function - supplying graduate engineers to north Italian industry. But it was not until the early 1980s that changes in the laws regarding universities permitted a leap in outside contract work with industry. It was novel to permit university staff, paid from central government funds, to earn up to 30 per cent more of their basic salary through outside work. This also coincided with the expansion of the number of fields under study; electronic engineering and information technology in particular. Turin Polytechnic now has 15 departments under the umbrella of its engineering faculty. 'Our aim in seeking contract work has never been to substitute state funding,' says Prof Zich. Public funding is still seen as necessary to guarantee the institution's primary function of teaching and pure research. 'Rather we see it as an intelligent way of opening up the university, acting as a form of self-analysis of our ability to carry out applied research. It also helps to get the student involved in the outside work,' he adds. Outside work with industry takes five forms: consultancy; teaching and information; the sale of information on research already carried out; help in testing; contributions to research. In this way the institutions aims to make maximum use of its own laboratories and facilities while also doing the same with those made available by companies and other research institutes. The real limit on outside work is the size of staff, which is controlled largely by the the ministries in Rome. By the end of the 1980s, 55 per cent - some 180 projects - consisted of consultancy; 38 per cent of research (127 projects). As a basic guideline, requests for outside work are weighed by a committee on the basis of quality and the length of research, with the emphasis on long-term projects begun at a 'pre-competitive stage.' But Turin is careful to ensure an equal share in intellectual property rights and patents. The maximum annual value of an individual contract is about L400m, with a minimum of about L10m. The polytechnic has had various contracts with Fiat, and in 1988 signed an agreement which enables recent graduates taken on by Fiat's research centre(CRF) to carry out joint research. The polytechnic denies, however, that it depends on this home-town industrial giant. Other local industries such as the state controlled Alenia aerospace group provide considerable work in radar, composite materials and wind tunnel projects; while one of its most profitable ventures has been in telecommunications, developing the Topsim software system and winning work from France's Alcatel. The polytechnic's expertise in radar also led to its most unusual contract: working for a group of families acting together as the civil party investigating the causes of the crash, in 1980, of an Italian civil airliner off the island of Ustica. The report just completed by the polytechnic's team has thrown new and dramatic light on the crash. It proves, from analysis of radar transcripts, that an aircraft, almost certainly military, was 'hiding'' under the civil airliner just before the crash, and another was also in the vicinity. Their work on the Ustica case looks likely to clarify one of the most mysterious civil airliner crashes in post-second world war history. Local groups still account for 51 per cent of all contracts, but other regions now generate 38 per cent of work undertaken, with 10 per cent coming from the EC. And more than threequarters of all this is directly for industry, as opposed to other research institutes. Significantly, private sector industry predominates, generating 42 per cent of the work. Consultancy tends to be with smaller companies; R &amp; D with the larger ones. As part of involvement with industry, in 1987 the polytechnic formed a consortium for research and higher education (COREP) as a venture with Turin municipality, the Piedmont regional council, the local industrialists' union, Fiat, IRI (the state holding company), Digital and Olivetti. On the one hand COREP offers short courses in informatics and robotics/automation to employees in local industry; it has also set up a laboratory for micro-electronics and optics. COREP has suffered from lack of the anticipated funding, and at present is marking time. in</p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / The European Market: Single market for TV still far off For the European consumer electronics industry, the single market is taking time to arrive, write Alan Cane and Michiyo Nakamoto. Mr Gerard Nauwelaerts, secretary general of the European Association of Consumer Electronics Manufacturers, sums up the gap between aspiration and reality. The single market, he says, 'has not happened because the consensus and co-operation process is still much too slow, and the consultation system is very costly'. Does Europe need a Community-wide communications agency to set and promote electronics standards along the lines of the US Federal Communications Commission? In an ideal world, the answer would be yes. Europe, however, already has a number of standards-setting bodies in the forms of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (Etsi), the Comite Europeen de Normalisation (Cen) and the Comite Europeen de Normalisation Electrotechnique (Cenelec). It could prove difficult to merge them into one organisation. And as Mr Hugh Peltor, director of Brema, the UK consumer electronics trade association, says: 'We should try to make our existing organisations work.' Mr Peltor says Europe's telecommunications ministers, who meet today in Brussels, should be able to carry out the job of a European-style FCC. The saga of high definition television (HDTV) in Europe, however, illustrates the difficulties of putting this idea into practice. Television is the most important element in European consumer electronics. But unless Europe can settle a strategy for HDTV - which will give cinema-like clarity and quality - it could fail to reap the full benefits of a harmonised market. The structure of the present EC market for conventional TVs and VCRs (video cassette recorders) highlights the problem. It is a largely disparate collection of national markets, employing differing transmission standards and specification requirements, with widely varying patterns of distribution and purchasing. European consumers have not benefited from the cross-border price competition the single market was designed to bring about. As a result, they are at a disadvantage compared with people in the US. Prices diverge widely from country to country and in some markets touch on the exorbitant. 'You may never be able to talk of Europe as a single market as far as TVs go,' says Ms Iris Merker, consumer electronics representative for Philips, the Dutch manufacturer which has the largest share of the European market. The diversity of standards is a headache for local manufacturers. There are two main television standards in Europe, PAL and SECAM. But a plethora of variations makes it necessary for manufacturers to produce several different versions of each model. Philips says it currently makes over 400 versions of several different models of televisions to meet the different standards and requirements for each EC country. For example, it produces 90 different types of a particular high-end model with stereo sound to meet different requirements in EC markets. In addition, safety and environmental regulations and bureaucratic paperwork differ from country to country. The result is that manufacturers of TVs and VCRs must operate several different production lines and employ specialist staff able to handle legal and social matters for different countries. The manufacturers hoped Europe's HDTV programme would offer a way through the EC standards morass. The Community's failure to agree Ecu500m (Pounds 395m) of HDTV funding dented this optimism, however, and ministers now have to recognise that the plan to harmonise standards is still a very long way from bearing fruit.</p>

At a news conference yesterday in Jerusalem, Faysal  al-Husayni, head of the Palestinian negotiating team, said: The  resolution is in the right direction although it came late. It  is also insufficient. He added: During this period we were not  endeavoring for resolutions or promises. What we need are  measures on the ground not resolutions on paper, which might or  might not be implemented. To date, we have not seen any  measures will convince us to resume the talks.    Al-Husayni said: We view with extreme gravity the U.S.  abstention on Jerusalem. He hoped that this had been caused by  reasons of procedure rather than substance, that the U.S. stance  on the issue of Jerusalem will remain firm, and that a suitable  opportunity will arise for the United States to modify its  position.    In answer to a question about Palestinian terms for resuming  the talks after the Security Council resolution, al-Husayni  stressed that implementation of measures on the ground leading  to the protection of the Palestinian people; measures against  the settlements, especially those situated in the midst of the  Palestinian populations such as in Hebron; and other measures  relating to the future of settlements will help to speed up the  resumption of talks.    Attorney Ziyad Abu-Zayyad, member of the Palestinian  delegation, said that if the Security Council resolution is  implemented, it will definitely open the way to the resumption  of talks.    Reacting to the resolution, Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi said  that it does not meet the requirements of the Palestinian  position. The insistence of the United States in excluding East  Jerusalem from the resolution's text and its reservation in  interpreting "the occupied territories," under the pretext that  this concerns an issue of sovereignty, are unacceptable excuses  that do not conform with an objective viewpoint and logic and  harm the peace process. 'Abd-al- Shafi added: I do not believe  that this resolution will advance the peace process, rather the  contrary, it will place obstacles to that process.    About his opinion on returning to the negotiating table,  'Abd-al-Shafi said: In fact, I have to repeat my constant  statement, namely, that the peace process will not succeed nor  will it achieve the necessary credibility unless settlement  activity in all the occupied territories, including Jerusalem,  is halted.    Dr Zakariya al-Agha said that this resolution is weak and  has  no value. It is weaker than previous resolutions and lacks any  mechanism for imlementing any of its clauses. The regrettable  thing is that the United States expressed reservations on the  most important clause, namely, not considering Jerusalem part of  the occupied Palestinian territories. Al-Agha added: This is a  very grave sign indicating that the United States supports the  Israeli viewpoint, which regards Jerusalem as part of Israeli  territory. In the future, the Palestinian leadership should  take this grave and important matter into account.    Al-Agha added: During all this time the United States  delayed the passage of this resolution and linked it to the  PLO's agreement to resume the talks. This indicates and exposes  the U.S. blackmail.    Al-Agha stressed his rejection of this resolution, and said:  I am not the only one who rejects this resolution. I believe  that all our people reject it also. We, in the occupied  territories, ask the Palestinian leadership in Tunis to study  the new situation well, because new things have become obvious  following the Hebron massacre. The PLO and the Palestinian  people have put forward conditions and legitimate demands for  returning to the negotiating table, especially real protection,  not just an international presence as stipulated by the  resolution.    Al-Agha emphasized that the issue of settlement activity and  settlements must be placed at the top of the agenda of the  negotiating process. He said that any delay in this matter will  be perilous.

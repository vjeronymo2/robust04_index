			<p>BFN     [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is preparing to  evacuate all forces from most parts of the Gaza Strip and their  deployment to the Qatif Bloc settlements and the northern edge  of the Strip. A Qol Yisra'el reporter says that IDF commanders  in the Gaza Strip and Jericho say that once the order is given,  they will be able to complete the redeployment within 72 hours.    Yesterday bulldozers began clearing land near the settlement  of Vered Yeriho in order to set up a crossing point to and from  the autonomous region of Jericho. An Army base and a police and  border police post are also to be built near the crossing point.    The Defense Ministry is considering setting up a special  body  which will deal with coordination between the IDF and security  forces and the Palestinians in the autonomous zones of the Gaza  Strip and Jericho. Qol Yisra'el's military affairs  correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that a senior Army officer  will head the committee.</p>

The war-torn nation needs a negotiated settlement to end the  tragic conflict, Evans said in a statement after U.S. planes  shot down four military aircraft in Bosnia yesterday.    He regarded the action as "in strict accordance with the  provisions of the U.N.-imposed no fly zone in Bosnia".    Meanwhile, he called upon all parties concerned in the  country not to take any retaliatory action against the U.N.  Forces or international relief efforts.    "It is essential that the humanitarian effort be allowed to  continue uninterrupted and that the current momentum for  restoring peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina continue," Evans said.</p>

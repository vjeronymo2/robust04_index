			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Packet of Measures We Should Adopt"; for </F> related reporting on this topic see FBIS-LAT-94-016 pp. 4, 5]    [Text] The Cubans, who, as we have said more than once in  these editorials, possess wonderful virtues, may sometimes allow  themselves to be overcome by a defect summed up in the popular  expression, "lamp in the street, darkness at home."    Thus, there now may be labor collectives full of the most  diverse and well-reasoned opinions on the steps our government  should take to straighten out the country's finances, yet they  have given little thought to the problems, weaknesses, and  errors that plague their own daily work.    This seems to be a good time, then, to emphasize the  importance of the first point on the agenda of the Workplace  Parliament assemblies. It is none other than the economic and  financial problems of each particular place. We have already  observed in the initial preparatory meetings a tendency to  devote less energy and time to debating internal affairs, and to  pay more attention to the exchange of opinions on what the  entire country should be doing. It would be a mistake to be  taken in by the false notion that the second point is more  important, while the first one is just a formality with no  practical purpose.    The financial imbalances that currently affect the national  economy can only be solved by taking action on both sides of the  supply-demand pair, and it is in workplaces where supply is  created. It is also there, given the difference between what is  spent and what is received from selling services or products,  where the scale can be tipped toward one side or the other of  the aforementioned pair.    Thus, the most decisive measures will not be the general  ones  taken to eliminate the consequences of the financial imbalance,  but rather those that are undertaken to eliminate the cause of  it, which is basically the fact that in the past few years there  has been much more money than goods circulating in the national  economy. If we were to take only general measures to reduce  excess demand by removing money from circulation, we would not  solve the underlying problem. The real solution lies in  achieving a proper balance between what is produced and what is  spent at the workplace.    For this reason, it would be illogical to have a brilliant  discussion at an enterprise, establishment, or shop, with  impressive knowledge of the cause and laudable proposals for  what the country should do to improve its finances, and then to  have a discussion of internal affairs that involved no pain and  no gain, or rather, more pain than gain.    Just as we reject the idea of a "packet of measures" hitting  the entire national economy at once, with equal fervor we appeal  today to all workers, to their union leaders, and to managers to  draw up their plans for the economic and financial  reconditioning of each unit.    For this purpose, any self-respecting management should  present to the assembly a true economic analysis of the  operation of the workplace, including specific proposals for  making improvements.    This report should not be written by anyone other than the  principal administrator of the unit.    The purpose of the report is to spark a debate and to  propose  courses of action. Therefore, the kind of account that is full  of incomprehensible jargon and weighed down with details that  hide the essential truth, the kind that is bred naturally by  incompetence, is to be avoided.    These reports should avoid taking a tone of either self-pity  or praise; otherwise, the assemblies would become mere  recitations of calamities, or celebrations of partial success.  In neither case would they address the issue of what could have  been done better and what failed to be done.    We caution that, from the standpoint of the workers and  their  union representatives, efficiency is not always indicated by the  fulfillment of the plan. We know full well that there are plans  that are rotten with paternalism, whose figures take into  account not only limitations on raw materials, energy, and labor  resources, but also major components of administrative  inefficiency that we are trying to combat.    It is important for workers, when discussing the first point  on the agenda of the Workplace Parliament assemblies, not to  allow the debate to get off track and focus on the impact other  workplaces have on their own. In one of the initial meetings, we  saw workers bitterly blaming the suppliers of a certain raw  material, while little or nothing was said of the well-known  fact that large quantities of that valuable and scarce resource  tend to be lost somewhere between the warehouse and the assembly  line.    These discussions also must be protected from the tendency  to  complain about the prices that are paid for certain goods and  services. Without denying that there are errors in the setting  of some prices, the fact is that real efficiency is not achieved  by demanding better prices, but by cutting costs.    And it is precisely this issue of costs, together with the  quantity and quality of production and services, that should lie  at the heart of the plan to be adopted at each workplace to  improve economic efficiency.    It is possible that not every place will have a cost system  that allows for an analysis based on the economic performance of  a workplace. Therefore, the first agreement, the first measure  that must be taken in these places, is precisely to create such  an instrument to at least indicate the principal expenditures  involved in every peso of goods produced. Beyond the limitations  imposed by the current economic situation in many centers, what  lies behind those unmeasured expenses is order or disorder,  discipline or laxity, rigor or leniency, controlling resources  or diverting them, talent or mediocrity in the administration, a  spirit of struggle or a sense of indifference, responsibility or  negligence, shoddiness or excellence.    Hence the importance of the first point on the agenda of the  Workplace Parliament assemblies that will take place in tens of  thousands of production or service units.    If each one of these places takes a step forward, a great  deal of progress can be made merely by compounding positive  actions.    Then the influence of the overall measures, those taken all  over the country, will be felt in the best possible way. These  measures can be truly effective only if action is taken in the  workplace.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 13/6/1994 -- Romanian Minister  of Foreign Affairs Teodor Melescanu is going to visit Denmark  and Finland in order to analyze the stage of Romania's relations  with the two countries, with a special stress on the economic  issues.    Before leaving for Denmark, the Romanian foreign minister  said his visit in the two northern countries was an "obligatory  leg" in a process of opening the bilateral relations,  considering also the fact that Denmark and Finland are both  members of the European Union. The Romanian chief diplomat  referred in his statement to Romania's interest in matters  concerning agriculture, food industry, and environment  protection, economic fields in which the two countries are very  advanced.    "It is a first good-will mission within an official visit  aiming to review the things that we have accomplished together  -- rather few so far -- especially in the economic field," said  Minister Melescanu.    The Romanian foreign minister is paying an official two-day  visit in Denmark on June 14-15, at the invitation of his  counterpart, Niels Helveg Petersen. On June 16-17, the Romanian  chief diplomat will be visiting Finland at Mr. Heikki Haavisto's  invitation. Minister Teodor Melescanu is scheduled also to  attend the Crans Montana forum in Switzerland, on June 17-18.</p>

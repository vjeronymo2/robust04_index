			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 23 (XINHUA) -- The world's big-name  auto producers today offered auto fans a feast for the eyes,  displaying their most up-to-date models at the '94 Beijing  International Automotive Industry Exhibition, which opened here  this morning.    The week-long exhibition, which has attracted some 900  well-known car companies and manufacturers as well as 11  government agencies and trade associations from all over the  world, is the largest ever staged in China, said sources from  the organizing committee.    Overseas auto enterprises, numbering four times as many as  at  the previous event in 1992, include France's Renault, Peugeot  and Citroen; Japan's Toyota, Mitsubishi and Honda; Germany's  Volkswagen, Audi and BMW; the United States' General Motors and  Ford, and dozens of others.    Official statistics indicate that China produced 1.34  million  automobiles last year, up 20.8 percent from a year earlier. A  further rise of 15 percent is expected for this year and the  output for the year 2000 is estimated at three million.    K.S. Tong, general manager of Adsale Exhibition Services  Ltd., one of the organizers of the ongoing exhibition, said that  auto companies worldwide are quite optimistic about the Chinese  market, despite a six percent drop in China's auto import volume  during the first quarter of this year from the same period of  the previous year.    "China will emerge as the world's potentially largest market  as a result of a sustainable growing Chinese economy," Tong said.    The fact that more and more of the world's auto giants have  been eager to enter the Beijing international auto fair  indicates that they are interested and confident in the China  market, he explained.    Official data show that 80 percent of the Chinese buyers of  sedan cars last year were government organizations. Private  enterprises and foreign-funded joint ventures accounted for 19  percent, leaving only one percent for individual buyers.    Conservative forecasts have put the Chinese auto parts  market  at some 5.7 billion U.S. dollars by the year 2000.    Many foreign companies and manufacturers have promised to  elbow in for a share of the China market, by developing new  models that suit Chinese living standards and transportation  facilities.    The Beijing international automotive industry exhibition,  first started in 1990, is held every other year. Some 200,000  people are expected to visit this year's exhibition, which ends  on June 29.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TOP-SEEDED MAYOTTE ADVANCES TO SEMIFINALS AGAINST WITSKEN  </P> <P> Top-seeded Tim Mayotte surrendered only nine points on his serve Friday in a  6-3, 6-3 victory over Australian Simon Youl to gain the semifinals of the  Sovran Bank tennis tournament in Washington.  </P> <P> Mayotte, ranked No. 11 in the world, won five of his nine service games at love  in disposing of Youl in 74 minutes. He will next face Todd Witsken, a 4-6, 7-6  (7-4), 6-3 winner over Jim Grabb.  </P> <P> In the other semifinal, Richey Renebert will play Brad Gilbert. Renebert  advanced with an easy 6-1, 6-1 victory over Ramesh Krishnam, while Gilbert  struggled to a 6-7 (7-5), 6-4, 6-4 win over Paul Chamberlin.  </P> <P> Mayotte, who has not lost a set in three matches this week, had little  difficulty against Youl, ranked No. 205. Mayotte, seeking his first tournament  title of the year, did not allow a point on his serve until he had built a 5-2  lead in the first set. Youl used his only break of the match to pull within 5-3  but gave the game right back when he double-faulted on set point.  </P> <P> "Considering I was slow to break in the other matches, I made a point of  getting out to a quick start today," Mayotte said. "Anything can happen in the  tiebreaker."  </P> <P> In Schenectady, N.Y., second-seeded Halle Cioffi rallied to defeat Sandra  Birch, 4-6, 6-1, 6-3, in the quarterfinals of the $200,000 OTB International  tournament.  </P> <P> In today's semifinals, Cioffi will play Marianne Werdel, who advanced with a  6-4, 6-1 victory over Stacy Martin.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Gretchen Magers won her quarterfinal match over Ann Henricksson,  6-4, 6-3. Magers will play eighth-seeded Laura Gildemeister of Peru, who  defeated Renata Baranski of Poland, 6-4, 6-4.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] John Major received the Portuguese prime minister  this afternoon at 10 Downing Street. Our special correspondent  Pedro Cid reports:    [Cid] As expected, Cavaco Silva and John Major had a lengthy  conversation, most of which was devoted to matters related to  the European Union [EU]. Cavaco Silva advocated no further  discussion of the present EU institutions before 1996, adding  that in the meantime, it was necessary to make an appraisal of  what had been achieved and of the implications of enlargement.  Any further enlargement should only be contemplated after 1996,  Cavaco Silva said. He said that Portugal has no objections in  principle to Cyprus and Malta joining the Union in the  short-term future, nor, in the medium-term, to the EU being  enlarged to include some East European countries such as  Hungary, Poland, and the Czech republic.    Cavaco Silva said that the present balances within the EU  should be maintained, but added that the EU should remain an  open and original model, evolving gradually and amenable to  readjustments.    All the above points were made during the conversation  between the two prime ministers.    Particular attention was also devoted to matters pertaining  to southern Africa, such as the elections in South Africa --  with regard to which Cavaco Silva expressed the hope they will  pass normally -- peace in Mozambique, and the situation in  Angola. On the latter the prime minister had this to say:    [Begin Silva recording] The Angolan situation is no less a  tragedy than that in Yugoslavia. The international community  ascribes great importance to, and, naturally, is very concerned  about the situation in the former Yugoslavia. however, Angola's  tragedy is of a much greater magnitude than Yugoslavia's. Many  more people are dying in Angola than in Yugoslavia. This is the  reason why I have asked several European leaders to bring all  possible pressure to bear, if need be through the UN Security  Council -- should this be deemed appropriate. Portugal would  not oppose a further meeting of the UN Security Council -- to  bring strong pressure to bear on the Angolan Government and on  UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] to  secure the signing of the agreement currently being negotiated,  and which has been practically completed. In our opinion, with  goodwill on all sides it could be signed in the not too distant  future -- and to insure that this would have repercussions on  the ground. The fact of the matter is that at present there are  no practical implications; The situation is now worse than it  was some time ago. [end recording]    [Cid] Cavaco Silva further stated that Portugal is willing  to  commit itself even more strongly to all ongoing processes. It  will not refuse its cooperation in the peace effort in  Yugoslavia, and is also prepared to involve itself even more  actively if required in the Angolan and Mozambican questions.</p>

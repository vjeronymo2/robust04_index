The recent  talk of the town in Guangzhou was that Deng Xiaoping would make  another "southern tour," and spend the spring festival in  Guangzhou instead of Shanghai as is the usual practice.    A renowned expert, who has familiar knowledge of Beijing's  political and economic situation, stated that China had already  pushed the market economic reform in a comprehensive way in line  with Deng Xiaoping's line of thought. However, because relevant  plans have involved interest redistribution, extremely great  differences remained inside the CPC, with intensified interest  contradiction between the central authorities and localities.  Deng Xiaoping recently said that he would stand up and speak  his mind.    Aside from paying attention to various step-by-step reforms  that have already been pushed, Deng has also shown great concern  for the issue of inflation. Some reports indicate that Deng  made a few points about the grain price rise that took place  toward the end of last year. He said that the matter showed  that the mass mentality remained comparative fragile; he  required governments at various levels to pay attention to  issues of a universal nature surfacing in the course of reform  as well as people's tolerance; at the same time, he praised the  central authorities for adopting prompt measures to stabilize  grain prices, saying that the action was an expression of the  collective leadership's maturity.    Deng's remarks have once again backed Vice Premier Zhu  Rongji. Not long ago, cadres in China studied Zhu Rongji's  recent speech delivered at a CPPCC meeting. In his speech, Zhu  stressed that differences in thinking inside the party and  between the central authorities and localities remained  regarding issues of reform, while frankly acknowledging that the  central authorities and he himself were under very great  pressure. It was learned that some conservative force had  recently impeded relying of reforms on the issue of inflation.  While Deng praised the central leadership for its practice, he  was obviously backing Zhu Rongji.    An official of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government  said that Deng was likely to take advantage of his appearance  during another southern inspection tour during the Spring  Festival to air his opinions. Ever since mid-December, news has  spread that Deng Xiaoping would make another tour of Guangdong.  The official said Deng southern inspection tour that took place  at this time in 1991 started a whirlwind of reform across China.  Today, China has already announced that it would build the  market economy; in addition, beginning with last July, the  central authorities have implemented macroeconomic regulation  and control. In a nutshell, the changes in Guangdong over the  past two years are worth Deng seeing with his own eyes. Another  point is that the finance and tax reform to be pushed in 1994 is  not favorable to coastal developed provinces including  Guangdong. Should Deng make another southern inspection tour,  that might play the role of appeasing localities.    Last month, Beijing Vice Mayor Zhang Baifa disclosed that he  accompanied Deng Xiaoping touring Beijing last October.  Presently, the north has become bitter cold, and Deng Xiaoping  should already have gone south to avoid the cold weather, or is  he making plans for another "southern inspection tour?"</p>

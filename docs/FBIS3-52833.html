If efforts have failed or have not been  made in this connection, the town of Layoune in Western Sahara  has been a focus of attention in recent days. The Saudi  interior minister is currently in Layoune, which was visited  recently by his French counterpart. This has aroused the anger  of the Polisario [Popular Front for the Liberation of Saquia El  Hamra and Rio de Oro]. Our correspondent Mourad has the details:    [Mourad] Polisario yesterday expressed its surprise and  displeasure at the visit of Charles Pasqua to Layoune two days  ago. In a communique the Front describes the French interior  minister's visit to be blatantly at variance with the  responsibility of France as a permanent member of the UN  Security Council. Nothing has filtered out about the Pasqua  visit, which coincided with the presence of Saudi Interior  Minister Prince Nayif Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz in Layoune. The senior  Saudi official has been in Layoune on a private visit since last  Thursday, according to MAP.    The situation in Western Sahara remains generally tense, as  admitted by special UN representative Yaqub Khan, who has  further said that he is making efforts to resolve the Saharan  problem. The special UN representative made this statement  after meeting President Maaouya Ould Sid Ahmed Taya of  Mauritania in Nouakchott yesterday.    It should be mentioned that the UN peace plan for a  referendum in Western Sahara is obstructed by a disagreement  between Morocco and Polisario, the conflicting parties, over the  number of voters.</p>

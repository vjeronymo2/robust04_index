			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> MT. CARMEL DOMINATES N.Y. RACE  </P> <P> They had to raise more than $10,000 to make the trip. Once there, they had to  deal with inclement weather, a new course and a 28-team field.  </P> <P> But the Mt. Carmel girls exceeded their No. 9 national ranking by defeating No.  3 Palos Verdes to win the Eastern States Championship race Saturday at the 18th  annual Manhattan College Cross Country Invitational at Van Courtland Park in  New York City.  </P> <P> It was the Sundevils' first appearance at the invitational, which, with more  than 8,000 runners, is the largest cross country race east of the Mississippi  River.  </P> <P> The day before the race, it rained three inches, but the Sundevils negotiated  the soaked 2 1/2-mile course and finished with 100 points. Palos Verdes had  114.  </P> <P> Six Sundevils finished in top 30, led by sixth-place Susan Scott with a time of  15:52. Other finishers were Rita Hermiz (19th), Jennifer Vergith (21th),  Charaighn Foss (26th), Marcia Larson (28th) and Kathleen Carl (29th).  </P> <P> "The challenge of going out there in a foreign environment with a different  layout and in the rain is a real positive, rewarding thing," Mt. Carmel Coach  Dennis McClanahan said. "The girls, how they ran, is probably one of the better  days we've ever had. They dominated everything."  </P> <P> McClanahan's request to enter two varsity teams was denied, so he had one team  in the first of two junior varsity races and then entered the two remaining  girls in the second race. Mt. Carmel won the first junior varsity race by 50  points by placing all six runners in the top nine. The Sundevils' Sara Smith  won in 17:24. In the other JV race, the two Sundevils entered placed first and  fourth.  </P> <P> Ramona was picked by every Avocado League coach to win the league, but now it's  struggling just to make the playoffs. After being shut out, 41-0, Friday by El  Camino, the Bulldogs are 3-3 overall and 1-2 in league.  </P> <P> Ramona, which had 17 of 22 starters returning from a team that last year  advanced to the 2-A semifinals, has lost two consecutive games since assistant  coach Jack Campbell was suspended indefinitely for directing a practice drill  that resulted in a player suffering a shoulder injury.  </P> <P> El Camino coach Herb Meyer, one of many who jumped on the Ramona bandwagon  before the season, offered his perspective on what has gone wrong with the  Bulldogs: "I'm sure there's been some chaos over the coaching situation.  Outsiders don't understand how much that can affect a program. Another one of  the major problems is, it's hard to be as good as everybody expects you to be.  When you read all those great things about you in the paper, it makes it real  hard to get your kids to focus."  </P> <P> Meyer also said Ramona's line, which averaged 250 pounds, might have been  overrated.: "When you start getting gigantic size, it really cuts down on your  mobility. We watched them against San Marcos. That kind of size in high school,  unless that person is a tremendous individual, can be offset by quickness."  </P> <P> There will be a plot within a plot when La Jolla (5-1) meets Kearny (5-1) at 7  p.m. Friday at Mesa College in a football game many believe will determine the  City Western League. That's because La Jolla running back E.J. Watson, the  county leader in touchdowns with 17, and Kearny's Darnay Scott, who led the  county with 13 touchdown receptions last season, will be on the same field.  </P> <P> Scott, a receiver/kick returner whose explosive speed has produced 11  touchdowns and attracted Division I college recruiters, met Watson two years  ago after Scott moved from St. Louis to Clairemont. Scott, a senior, quickly  grabbed the spotlight over his neighbor last year, compiling 903 receiving  yards for a 20.1-yard average. Now this may be Watson's year.  </P> <P> "I can't wait to play against him," Watson said of Scott. "It's going to be  fun."  </P> <P> Rancho Buena Vista's Markeith Ross rushed for three touchdowns against Torrey  Pines on Friday, giving him 15 for the year and a San Diego Section-record 58  for his career, eclipsing the previous record of 56 by Sweetwater's Terry  Rodgers (1983-85).  </P> <P> Ross was a slow starter this season. He didn't rush for a touchdown until the  fourth game of the season, when he scored a Section-record seven times against  Poway.  </P> <P> Through six games, he has gained 1,079 yards, but 761 of those have come in the  past three Palomar League games.  </P> <P> Dana Haddad, Martin Henderson, Jim Lindgren and Dave McKibben contributed to  this story.  </P></p>

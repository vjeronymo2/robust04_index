			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by Dmitriy </F> Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] In an interview with Interfax Deputy Foreign  Minister Sergey Lavrov said he hoped that in 1994 problems in  relations between Russia and Ukraine would be resolved, and that  bilateral ties would develop on the basis of "friendliness and  fraternity."    According to Lavrov, these problems, above all issues  connected with the destiny of nuclear arms and the Black Sea  Fleet, must not be dramatized. "We must not forget that a vast  country with an enormous infrastructure disintegrated," he said.  "As soon as the two major problems are resolved, onward  movement will begin in all areas of relations between Russia and  Ukraine."    Preconditions for resolving these problems were ensured when  the Russian and Ukrainian Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Leonid  Kravchuk met in Massandra.    According to Interfax's interviewee, there are not only  "sore" but also "healthy spots" in the Russian-Ukrainian  relationship. At their meeting in Odessa held at the end of  last year Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his  Ukrainian counterpart Anatoliy Zlenko agreed to cooperate in  resolving problems connected with the further development of  Eastern and Central Europe. "The Ukrainian side assured us that  Kiev's initiatives on the ways to promote cooperation between  local countries provide for Russia's participation, not  exclusion," Lavrov said.    According to him, Russia is interested in cooperating with  Ukraine and other CIS countries in international organizations.  At the latest UN General Assembly session the 12 CIS states  advanced, for the first time ever, joint initiatives concerning  the ways to combat drug trafficking, terrorism and environmental  pollution. "It is noteworthy that the resolution on monitoring  environmental protection from space submitted by the CIS  countries was adopted by consensus," Lavrov said.    Interfax's interviewee drew attention to the circumstance  that participants at the Ashgabat summit held at the end of last  year decided to jointly request the UN to grant the CIS the  status of observer of the kind enjoyed by, say, the European  Union or the Organization of African Unity.    As Lavrov said, this decision was taken unanimously. Ukraine  alone stood aside. "Ukraine abstained. Kiev voiced doubts as  to the CIS being an "organization." But this is a purely  terminological dispute," Lavrov noted. "There should be no fears  that the CIS is turning into some "supranational mechanism."  From the point of view of international law the term  "organization" does not reflect "supranationalism."</p>

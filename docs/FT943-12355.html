			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Paisley to urge devolved Ulster assembly The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionists, will today urge Mr John Major to press ahead quickly with plans for a devolved Ulster assembly as part of a drive to secure a durable political settlement in Northern Ireland. In a move likely to underline the delicacy of the task which the government faces in forging a deal between Ulster's constitutional parties, Mr Paisley will present the prime minister with a document setting out his party's proposed solution to the conflict. He will argue strongly that London should not offer Dublin anything in return for removing its constitutional claim to Ulster. News of Mr Paisley's plans emerged as Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, insisted that the Irish peace process would continue, in spite his party's refusal on Sunday to recommend an IRA ceasefire. Mr Adams said: 'The peace process is not dead, it is very much alive. I remain optimistic that we can move on. We need a process of demilitarisation and I am optimistic we can move towards that.' In London, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the IRA's political wing was isolated as never before. He added: 'Sinn Fein and the IRA, for whom they speak, are now seen to be continuing to use torture, murder, terror and indiscriminate violence for political purposes in circumstances where both governments say that the future of Ireland lies in democracy.' In Dublin, the Irish government took pains to play down the appearances of a split between Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, and Mr Dick Spring, the foreign affairs minister, over how it should react to Sinn Fein's response. In his initial reaction on Sunday night Mr Reynolds said he saw positive signals in Sinn Fein's response. Mr Spring was much less positive. He said many people would be disappointed. As Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, a senior Sinn Fein official, called in London for the immediate reinstatement of dialogue between the British government and the IRA's political wing, Irish government officials said channels of communication between Dublin and Sinn Fein would remain open. Today's six-page Democratic Unionist document is understood to draw on many points from an earlier submission by the party, 'Breaking the Logjam'. This called for the election of an assembly that would be given the task of agreeing a form of government for Ulster in the UK. Only once agreement had been reached and approved by voters in Ulster, and Dublin had removed its territorial claim, would the assembly start negotiations on north-south relations. Mr Paisley is expected to resist any pressure from Downing Street to return to the political talks process under Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister. Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

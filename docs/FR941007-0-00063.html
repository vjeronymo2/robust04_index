			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> H. Elimination of Supplemental Coordinated Care Grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> During fiscal years 1992 and 1993, supplemental grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were awarded to States for intensive, innovative approaches  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to making information, counseling, and/or assistance related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to coordinated care benefits available to Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficiaries. The purpose of the grants was to encourage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States with existing coordinated care programs to be more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> active in this area. We believe that States have now had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate opportunity and funding to establish supplemental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coordinated care materials and/or activities and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate funding is no longer warranted. States should make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision in a grant awarded under &sect;403.502 for any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous and/or current initiatives in ICA activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related to coordinated care. We may, however, make funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available from time to time to fund special ICA-related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> III. Collection of Information Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 403.510 of this document contains information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection and recordkeeping requirements that were approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 2, 1994. The approval number is 0938&hyph;0641 and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expiration date is January 31, 1997.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> IV. Response to Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Because of the large number of items of correspondence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we normally receive on documents published for comment, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nevertheless, we will consider all comments that we received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the date and time specified in the ``Dates'' section of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this preamble, and if we proceed with a subsequent document,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we will respond to the comments in the preamble to that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> V. Waiver of Prior Notice with Comment Period and of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Delayed Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> We ordinarily publish a general notice of proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and invite public comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the proposed rule. That rule would have included a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference to the legal authority under which it is proposed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the terms and substance of the proposed rule or a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> description of the subjects and issues involved. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure can be waived, however, when an agency finds good  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause that a notice and comment procedure is impracticable,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporates a statement of the finding and its reasons in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rule issued. Further, we generally provide for final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules to be effective no sooner than 30 days after the date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of publication unless we find good cause to waive the delay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of this rule, its principal effect is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue the funding of an existing program rather than to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement a new program. The affected entities, that is,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the States, are already familiar with the program and will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive separate, individual notice. Further, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> desirable that regulations that will govern the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration of FY 1994 grants be issued as soon as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible. Therefore, we find that it would be against the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public interest to delay the publication of this rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pending completion of a prior public comment period. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the above reasons, we also find that it would be against the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public interest to delay the effective date of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Regulatory Impact Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), we prepare a regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility analysis unless the Secretary certifies that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule will not have a significant economic impact on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial number of small entities. States and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals are not included in the definition of small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may have a significant impact on the operations of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule simply establishes the terms and conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of funding for grants. It has no independent or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequential effect on the economy. The activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted under the grant may improve competition by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informing consumers of health insurance alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1102(b) of the Act because we have determined, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary certifies, that this interim final rule with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment period will not have a significant economic impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a substantial number of small entities or a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact on the operations of a substantial number of small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rural hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12866, this regulation was not reviewed by the Office of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management and Budget. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

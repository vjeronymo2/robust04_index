			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Arts: A royal hunch comes off THE two-hour BBC programme documenting a year in the life of the Queen is the latest item in a public relations campaign which has been brilliantly conducted throughout the 40-year reign of Elizabeth II. Though Elizabeth R has none of the overt obsequiousness which has marred some royal programmes in recent years, it seems clear nevertheless that the picture it conveys is one of which the Queen thoroughly approves. Why should she not? It shows her as dedicated, hard working, devoted to her family, and occasionally funny. Confirming what the Crawfie types have always said, she seems to be most animated when dealing with dogs and horses. No British institution has exploited television more effectively than the royal family, though 'campaign' and 'exploit' may over-state: this success seems to have come from hunch and instinct rather than the expensive sort of adman's operation undertaken by political parties. In 1953 Winston Churchill and the Cabinet recommended excluding television cameras from the coronation, but the young Princess Elizabeth insisted that the cameras, and thus the viewing public, be allowed right into the abbey. Thanks to her shrewd move the coronation was the first great national occasion when television attracted a bigger audience than radio. In the following 39 years relations between Fleet Street and Buckingham Palace have ranged from bad to dreadful but, thanks partly to television's need to negotiate access for its equipment, the relationship with television has been, from the crown's point of view, excellent. Of course a law of diminishing returns applies here as anywhere: no subsequent programme can match the novelty value of Richard Cawston's memorable 1969 documentary Royal Family which first took us behind the scenes of Royalty Ltd. However, this week's programme, made by Edward Mirzoeff, is not an attempt to repeat that. Apart from a holiday scene showing the Queen taking her grandchildren pony riding it concentrates almost entirely on the activities of the sovereign herself, and thus shifts the focus of media attention from the troublesome younger members of the family back to the dutiful head of state. We see her with politicians, at a breathtakingly grand banquet for Lech Walesa in Windsor Castle, paying visits to the US and Africa, dishing out gongs, and teasing Edward Heath with the remark that he could be allowed to go to Baghdad because he was now expendable. We see the Queen run for the first time (to catch the finish of a horse race on which she wins Pounds 16) and we see her opening a little selection of the 200 or 300 letters she receives daily, though typically no one explains how the lucky few are chosen. However gratifying for royalists, these little revelations are as nothing compared to the major insight which this programme permits. It finally proves what we have so long suspected: that the British monarchy has gone from strength to strength in the second half of the 20th century because, instead of being traditionally 'aristocratic' in its outlook and attitudes, it is profoundly middle class. Watching this sturdy, bustling woman, switching efficiently from glad rags to Barbour and headscarf, countless viewers will have wondered 'Who does she remind me of?' Eventually the answer will have dawned: Auntie Betty, bulwark of the WI and the church flower committee.</p>

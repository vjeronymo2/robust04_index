			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Hong Kong XINHUA Deputy Director Zheng Guoxiong </F> Urges Britain to Give Up Confrontation, Effect a Fundamental  Change in Policy"]    [Text] Zheng Guoxiong, deputy director of Hong Kong branch  of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, talked about recent Sino-British ties  at an open occasion yesterday. He said that the key to  improvement in Sino-British ties lies in Britain's attitude and  action. Zheng urged the British side to give up its policy of  confrontation with China and effect a fundamental change in its  policy.    The Association of New Territories Mass Organizations held a  gathering yesterday to mark the ninth anniversary of its  founding and to congratulate its members being elected as  deputies of National People's Congress, members of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] and the  Preliminary Working Committee, Hong Kong affairs advisers,  deputies to the Guangdong People's Congress, members of the  Guangdong CPPCC, and Hong Kong district affairs advisers. In  response to a question by a reporter at the gathering, Zheng  Guoxiong said that everybody is concerned about recent  Sino-British relations. While meeting with state leaders in  Beijing, the same question was raised by members of delegations  from the Hong Kong Federation of Industry and the Hong Kong  Chinese Chamber of Commerce.    In accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Zheng  said, China and Britain should cooperate in resolving major  issues related to Hong Kong's transition because this will  benefit Hong Kong's smooth transition. This is also the  consistent stand and position of the Chinese Government.    The British Government had changed its policy toward China  at  the previous stage, made a mistaken evaluation of the situation,  and pursued a policy of confrontation with China, which produced  a negative impact on Sino-British cooperation, Zheng stated.    Now the key to resumption of Sino-British cooperation lies  in  Britain's attitude and action, Zheng continued, and the Chinese  Government hopes that the British side will give up its policy  of confrontation and will effect a fundamental change in its  policy. Zheng stressed that because of the unilateral action  taken by Patten, it has been impossible for China and Britain to  cooperate in the political system. Proceeding from the  fundamental and long-term interests of the Hong Kong residents  and for the sake of maintaining Hong Kong's stability and  prosperity, however, the Chinese Government still hopes to  cooperate with the British side in terms of economy, people's  livelihood, and other fields. This is also the consistent  spirit of the Chinese Government toward Hong Kong.    The Hong Kong government's proposal to increase openness in  information access involved a major change in government  operations and did not conform with the relevant spirit of the  Sino-British Joint Declaration, Zheng Guoxiong stated. As the  British Hong Kong government did not consult the Chinese side in  advance, it is unacceptable to the Chinese side.    Zheng also refuted the so-called statement that this was  Hong  Kong's internal affair. He said that the move involved the  transition to 1997 and exerted an influence on current, as well  as future operations. Therefore, the Chinese side must be  consulted. Otherwise, the Chinese Government will not undertake  any responsibility. Neither will the future government of the  special administrative region undertake any responsibility.</p>

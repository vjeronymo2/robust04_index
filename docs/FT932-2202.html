			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions THIS WEEK'S column is dominated by sales, many of which were option related. The heaviest selling, however, was in Rathbone Brothers, the investment management company. In the past Rathbone directors have been prepared to meet institutional demand with modest sales, but this week's grouping of nine directors is on an altogether larger scale. Against a difficult background, and in contrast to many of their peers, Rathbone Brothers has enjoyed considerable success over the past three years. Shares sold by directors have been placed with institutions and the tone of the chairman's most recent statement remained optimistic. Betterware has been one of the retail success stories of recession. The huge sales by Stanley Cohen, non-executive vice chairman, and Andrew Cohen, managing director, follow sustained outperformance over the last 12 months. The company says the sales were made to satisfy institutional demand. The Cohens, the directors and their families continue to speak for just over 50 per cent of the equity. Figures for the selling at T Cowie do not tell the full story. Gordon Hodgson, chief executive, exercised an option over 200,000 shares and sold the lot. At the same time however, three other directors exercised options over 700,000 shares selling a significant number. These latter transactions are not included in our column because they did not sell their entire holdings. They did, though, sell almost 400,000 shares between them.

			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Trump's Bid for Casino Temporarily Stopped: After a brief hearing, U.S.  District Court Judge Rosemary Gambardella issued a temporary restraining order  blocking Donald J. Trump's $63-million bid to buy the debt-ridden Elsinore's  Atlantis Casino Hotel. Creditors who hold mortgages on three of the Atlantic  City casino's parking lots asked for the order. The creditors said they weren't  given adequate notice of details surrounding the proposed offer. Judge  Gambardella scheduled another hearing for June 29.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MSZ] has received  with satisfaction the approval by the Ukrainian parliament of  the Lisbon Protocol, which provides, among other things, for  disarming nuclear missiles stationed in that country. Wladyslaw  Klaczynski, head of the MSZ press office, told us about a  statement on the matter.    [Begin Klaczynski recording] The ministry stresses that this  is a significant step toward consolidation of world and European  security. This step will undoubtedly open wider possibilities  for comprehensive cooperation of the Ukraine with the entire  Western world.    For us, for Poland, this is an indispensable factor for  stabilization in the region. We would like to express hope, and  the ministry expresses such hope, that the speedy implementation  of the right and very important decision will take place.</p>

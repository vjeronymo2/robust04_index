			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Arthur D. Little also was critical of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturer Impact Model's inability to take into account (or try to predict)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some of the consequences of the low profitability that the model sometimes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> predicts. In particular, its report points out that if the rate of profit did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decline significantly in real terms, the industry would have a very hard time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raising additional equity. Arthur D. Little points out that, in actuality,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both owners and financial backers of firms would limit capital until expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> return matched their required return. According to the comment, the Lawrence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model, therefore, ``*&blank;*&blank;* sacrifices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> realism in modeling the relationship between expected return and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> willingness of owners and financial backers to commit capital for retooling.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61E at 27&hyph;28.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department agrees with Arthur D. Little's statement regarding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficulty that industry likely would have in raising capital as a consequence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of significantly reduced profitability. Furthermore, it is true that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model is limited to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimating the impact of potential standards on an industry, whether positive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or negative, as characterized by profitability. The model does not attempt to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> predict the specific forms of the damage and the complex reactions (inability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to raise capital, failures of some firms, foreign buy-outs, mergers, capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions, etc.) that could occur within a negatively affected industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Department does not believe that it is necessary to attempt to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> predict that sort of detail. Rather, DOE believes it is obligated not to set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards that would cause serious damage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes that the magnitude of the hypothetical profit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loss is a very good indicator of the magnitude of the impacts that will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed on the industry. When the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Impact Model predicts a precipitous decline in profit, this should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpreted as damaging to the industry. Indeed, in many cases, as discussed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Section IV below, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Model does predict a sharp drop in profitability, and this prediction figures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strongly in rejecting the standard in question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of all the ``deficiencies'' in the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturer Impact Model, Arthur D. Little's report suggested that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department abandon the model, and proposed, instead, that the Department use a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cash-flow model. The cash-flow model determines the economic impact of energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservation standards on manufacturers by estimating the cash flows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with meeting the standards, and calculating a value for those cash  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flows. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61E at 19 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix C.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, Arthur D. Little's cash-flow model submitted does not predict  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether a manufacturing industry will or will not be hurt by standards. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allows one to make various assumptions about the market's behavior, and then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to predict the impact of those assumptions on cash flow; but, it tells nothing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about the market's behavior. As a result, the Department notes that Arthur D.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Little has run three scenarios with radically different implications for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry, with no way to choose among them. The model is equally capable of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing the optimistic and the pessimistic scenario, but it does not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an expected scenario. The Department, therefore, does not believe that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cash flow model, as presented in Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments, could serve to replace the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Impact Model for use in the analyses of the impacts of appliance standards on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Arthur D. Little report also stated that one of the key  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumptions in the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proportion of costs that are fixed. The Arthur D. Little report went on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to state that, ``After interviewing all five domestic manufacturers, Arthur D.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Little was unable to verify that the washing machine manufacturers have any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sense as to the proportion of their costs which are long-term fixed costs *&blank;*&blank;*. Basing a model upon an assumption that is not empirically verifiable is a risky proposition.'' (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department agrees that one of the key assumptions in the Lawrence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model is the proportion of costs that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are fixed and variable. The Department is sensitive to the claim that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> key input parameter to the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Model is ``completely alien to manufacturers.'' The Department would certainly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider alternate manufacturer impact models that utilize more known and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verifiable inputs. However, to be an acceptable alternative model, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department believes that such model would have to have forecasting ability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar in scope and sophistication as the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturer Impact Model. As discussed above, the cash-flow model submitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers does not meet this test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the Department would be interested in any analyses that indicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse manufacturer impacts at any of the proposed standard levels, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opposed to arguments over the severity of the adverse impact of rejected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

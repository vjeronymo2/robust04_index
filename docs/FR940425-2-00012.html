In accordance with section 5a(a)(12) of the Commodity Exchange Act and acting pursuant to the authority delegated by Commission Regulation 140.96, the Acting Director of the Division of Economic Analysis (``Division'') of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'') has determined, on behalf of the Commission, that the proposed amendment is of major economic significance. On behalf of the Commission, the Division is requesting comment on this proposal. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before May 25, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Interested persons should submit their views and comments to Jean A.

Under the contract's existing terms, coffee is deliverable at par in the Port of New York, at a discount of three-quarters of one cent (75 points) in the Port of San Francisco, and at a discount of one and one-quarter cents per pound in the Port of New Orleans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendment would establish the Port of Miami, Florida as an additional coffee ``C'' futures delivery point, with futures deliveries at Miami being subject to a discount of one and one-quarter cents per pound. Under the proposed amendments, the Port of Miami is defined to include both the Port of Miami and Port Everglades. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The CSCE proposes to apply the amendment to all currently listed contract months following the last contract month in which there is an open position on the date that the amendment is made effective and to newly listed contract months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Port Everglades is located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CSCE indicates that the proposal to add Miami as a delivery point is justified by the amount of trading activity in the cash market at that location and that the proposal will be beneficial to those CSCE members and others who use the contract for hedging. In this respect, information submitted by the CSCE indicates that, during 1992 and 1993, the Customs District of Miami was the fifth-ranked port of entry in terms of the quantity of coffee imported into the United States and accounted for eight percent of all coffee entering the United States in 1993. The CSCE also indicates that there are adequate delivery warehouse facilities in the Port of Miami.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the proposed one and one-quarter cents per pound discount for futures deliveries at Miami, the CSCE also indicated that the proposed discount falls within the range of prevailing differences between the total costs of shipping coffee to warehouses in Miami and New York from major coffee producing countries in Central and South America. The CSCE indicated that the total costs of shipping the same growths of coffee to warehouses in Miami and New Orleans from the producing countries are essentially the same. The CSCE also indicated that information provided to the Exchange by members of the coffee cash market regarding cash market pricing relationships between Miami and the futures contract's existing delivery points confirms that the proposed discount is appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is requesting comments specifically in regard to the extent to which the proposed discount of one and one-quarter cents per pound for futures deliveries in Miami reflects cash marketing pricing relationships between Miami and the coffee ``C'' futures contract's existing delivery points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of the proposed amendment will be available for inspection at the Office of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20581. Copies of the amended terms and conditions can be obtained through the Office of the Secretariat by mail at the above address or by telephone at (202) 254&hyph;6314.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The materials submitted by the CSCE in support of the proposed amendment may be available upon request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and the Commission's regulations thereunder (17 CFR part 145 (1987)). Requests for copies of such materials should be made to the FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Act Compliance Staff of the Office of the Secretariat at the Commission's headquarters in accordance with CFR 145.7 and 145.8.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person interested in submitting written data, views or arguments on the proposed amendment should send such comments to Jean A.

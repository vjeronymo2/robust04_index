			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / International Company News: Swedish bourse in London move The Stockholm Stock Exchange has taken the first step towards enabling London-based members to trade directly on the bourse through its electronic SAX system, instead of through a Swedish-based broker. The exchange said it had approached the British Securities and Investment Board for the conditions to allow direct trading from London. The move follows last week's approval of similar applications by the Paris bourse and the Paris-based Monep options exchange, which became the first European exchanges to gain permission to operate in London. Several North American exchanges and the Sydney futures exchange do so. The Stockholm bourse said it wanted to ensure that it remained the main forum for trade in Swedish stocks as the extension of technology and deregulation broke down traditional restraints on trading. From 1996, no official approval will be required within the European Union for member's exchanges to operate in other member states. Sweden is due to join the EU next year if membership is approved in a referendum in November. Two Danish and one Norwegian member of the Stockholm exchange trade through SAX from their bases in Copenhagen and Oslo. Stockholm has three other foreign members, one each from France, the UK and Switzerland, and wants to attract more. Since the last restraints on foreign buying of Swedish stocks were dropped at the end of 1992, foreign investment has grown. More than one-quarter of the value of Swedish equities are foreign-held. The stock exchange said direct trading from overseas would hit Swedish-based brokers, but it believed overall volumes traded would rise.</p>

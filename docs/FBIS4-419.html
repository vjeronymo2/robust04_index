			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] And as if the situation in the war zone in Sierra  Leone was not confused enough, a new factor has emerged on the  side of the government forces battling the RUF [Revolutionary  United Front] rebels. Alhaji Koromah, whose ULIMO [United  Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] faction in Liberia  has been torn by splits between him and another faction based in  Freetown, has now taken on the RUF as well as Nii Nartey Allison  reports in this telex from Monrovia.    It was confirmed here today that ULIMO is engaged in  fighting  inside Sierra Leone against Foday Sankoh's rebels. ULIMO leader  Alhaji Koromah said today that his forces, under the command of  Loseni Yamah, have set up a command post at the Sierra Leone  border and are advancing toward Kekema, 10 miles inside Sierra  Leone. This, said Koromah, was to open a security corridor so  that Liberian refugees in Kenema could return home. Koromah  said: It is a full- scale operation, and we have informed the  government of Sierra Leone and the United Nations of our battle  in Sierra Leone. But the situation remains confused, because  later today, the Lofa Defense Force, a new faction fighting  ULIMO for control of Liberia's northern Lofa County, said here  that their forces have successfully dislodged Koromah's units  and have secured control of the territory stretching from the  Saint Paul River Bridge bordering Lofa and Bong counties to the  Foya District on the Sierra Leone-Guinea access. They boasted in  a statement of being in control of the administrative seats of  Voinjama and the towns of Golu, Salaye, Zosa, and Konia.</p>

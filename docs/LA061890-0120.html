			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: 'MORNING AFTER' PILL WAS FOUND TO HOLD FUTURE RISKS  </P> <P> Q. I was married until last year and had been on birth control pills. After the  divorce I didn't plan on needing any contraception for a long time so I stopped  taking them.  </P> <P> To my surprise I met someone recently I really like and got carried away one  evening. I remembered that when I was in college the student health center  provided a "morning-after" contraceptive for such situations. But my doctor  didn't know what I was talking about when I called for a prescription.  </P> <P> Luckily I didn't get pregnant, but I've been wondering what happened to the  morning-after pill.  </P> <P> A. Several decades ago DES (diethylstilbestrol) was used as a morning-after  contraceptive. Unfortunately, it often caused nausea and vomiting in the high  doses required.  </P> <P> Worse, DES posed a long-term threat. Some young women exposed to DES before  birth, when their mothers took it during pregnancy, develop a rare vaginal  cancer. Once this danger of DES was discovered, most doctors stopped using it  as a morning-after pill for fear that if it did not work and a daughter were  born, she would be at risk.  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration has not approved any medication for use as a  morning-after contraceptive but some physicians prescribe the birth control  pill Ovral for this purpose. According to the Medical Letter of Drugs and  Therapeutics, in the appropriate dose this medication is usually effective  against pregnancy if it is taken within one to three days after intercourse.  </P> <P> Q. Your column once carried a letter from a man who used a prescription  athlete's foot cream for his itchy and scaly scalp. I think the medicine  started with the letter "N." I wanted to save the article and ask my doctor if  he'd prescribe that cream for me to try. Unfortunately, I've misplaced it. What  was that stuff?  </P> <P> A. The medicine in question was Nizoral (ketoconazole), a prescription  anti-fungal agent effective for a variety of skin conditions. The cream has  been shown to work against the scaling and flaking of seborrheic dermatitis.  People with severe dandruff may also benefit.  </P></p>

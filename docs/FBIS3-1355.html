The  OAU's central organ of mechanism for conflict resolution, in a  resolution adopted Thursday [24 March] in Addis Ababa, called on  both countries to "exercise restraint" and take appropriate  measures to restore confidence and continue with the dialogue  already initiated.    In the resolution adopted at the end of its one day meeting,  the organ reaffirmed its "attachment to the respect of the  principle of the inviolability of frontiers inherited from the  colonial period" as well as the respect of sovereignty,  territorial integrity and independence of all states.    The organ, while expressing grave concern at the escalating  situation and its implications for the two countries and the  region as a whole, expressed satisfaction that the two nations  "are for a peaceful settlement of the dispute." It noted with  appreciation the efforts of Presidents Eyadema of Togo and  Mubarak of Egypt aimed at defusing the situation and reaching a  peaceful settlement.    However both Nigeria and Cameroon expressed reservations  over  the wording of the text of the resolution. The Nigerian  delegation called for the withdrawal of non-African troops from  the peninsula to be included in the text, while Cameroon  specifically wanted the withdrawal of Nigerian troops from the  peninsula saying Nigeria invaded the peninsula.</p>

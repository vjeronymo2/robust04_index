			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Paramount to Take Charge: Paramount Communications Inc., which failed in its  bid for Time Inc. last summer, said it will take a $140-million fourth-quarter  pretax charge on its publishing operations, which include Simon &amp; Schuster,  Prentice Hall and Pocket Books. The charge reflects a writedown in the value of  some publishing assets and accruals for costs associated with improving  publishing technology. Despite the charge, the company's overall results are  expected to be sharply higher because of a previously announced a $1.2-billion  after-tax gain on the sale of its consumer and commercial finance business.  </P></p>

During his speech, he said that the DPRK and the United  States released a joint statement on the principles which the  two sides discussed and reached agreement on in the talks and  that talks and contacts have taken place to implement the joint  statement.    Referring to the details of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement,  he  said that based on the principle of the joint statement, on  which the agreement was reached, we have up until today taken  practical measures to fairly resolve the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula and made sincere efforts to implement the joint  statement.    He went on to say: The DPRK has unilaterally, temporarily  suspended the effectuation of its declaration on withdrawing  from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and resumed dialogue  with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Even under special  circumstances, to implement its promise to prove the  transparency of its nuclear activities, the DPRK has completely  frozen the movement of nuclear materials in its territory and  even accepted inspections for guaranteeing the continuity of  safeguards. In particular, to fundamentally bring an end to  suspicions over our nuclear development, we have even taken a  bold decision to replace the existing graphite-moderated atomic  reactors with light-water reactors even at the cost of the  independence of our nuclear power industry. However, we have  not seen any corresponding practical action by the United States  [kurona urinun miguk chuguro puto silchonjoguro houngul patchi  mothayossumyo], and the recent situation is developing toward  the extreme opposite direction. This is completely due to the  insincere, unjust acts of the United States, the dialogue  partner.    He stated a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman released a  statement on 31 January in connection with the prevailing  situation. He introduced the details of the statement.</p>

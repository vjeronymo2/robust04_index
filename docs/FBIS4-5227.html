			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata brushed aside suggestions Friday [8 April] that he become  the next prime minister in the wake of Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's announcement that he will resign.    Hata, who concurrently serves as the deputy prime minister,  told a hastily arranged press conference at the Foreign Ministry  that he considers it important to play the role of making  adjustments within the coalition government rather than becoming  the next prime minister.    Hata also indicated he may go ahead with his planned trip to  Marrakech, Morocco, next week to attend the signing ceremony of  a global trade accord under the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT).    Since Hosokawa instructed cabinet ministers to fulfill their  duties until the end, his scheduled trip to Marrakesh has not  been totally scrapped, Hata said.    As for Hosokawa's successor, Hata said he wants the person  to  be someone who has the "same ambition to further promote  reforms" and who wants to create a more stable government.    Turning to the possible effects the latest development would  give to international affairs, Hata said it would give negative  influence not only on Japan-U.S. relations, which has been sour  over trade disputes, but on the rest of the world.    He said it would give the world anxiety concerning Japanese  politics so that it is important to stabilize the government as  early as possible.    He also said Japan should explain about the course of  Japanese politics at the Marrakech meeting.    "Japan has become a country which could influence various  countries," Hata said. "So there should not be a delay in  politics not even for a day."    Hata, who was expected to meet U.S. Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor in Marrakech, Morocco, said he thinks it possible  to hold "frank" discussions with Kantor since Japan's  determination to promote free trade and to make efforts to make  a more open market remains unchanged no matter how the domestic  political situation is.    "There aren't many options concerning what Japan can do," he  said.    The foreign minister also indicated there will be no problem  in dealing with the problems involving North Korea's alleged  development of nuclear weapons because the Japanese  administration has the consistency and continuity of policies.    Hata, also the leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]  which broke away from the Liberal Democratic Party, said he told  an extraordinary cabinet meeting that he wants Hosokawa to stick  to the post.    But Hata said he cannot dissuade Hosokawa because he has  already officially announced his intention to step down.    He described Friday's development as one of the  "aftershocks"  from a major "diastrophism" last June, when Shinseito split from  the LDP, which led to the birth of the coalition government,  indicating that it may be a chance toward a major reorganization  of the political world.    He reiterated the need to create two stable political  forces,  saying the coalition government of seven parties had difficulty  in making a single decision.</p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Choose your own broker My shares are held by nominees (Barclayshare) and, in view of the recent reinstatement of indexation on capital losses, I wish to achieve some major bed and breakfast deals. This can be done at a lower cost through one of the brokers listed in a recent (March 12) Weekend FT article. Is this permissible and valid (share certificates are not required) or must I use the more expensive nominee brokers? As it is not necessary to present the share certificates on bed and breakfast deals, in our opinion you can use any broker you wish. (Answer by Murray Johnstone). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

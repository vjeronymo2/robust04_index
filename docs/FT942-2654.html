			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / French treasury lays claim to Tapie's furniture The French treasury, competing with Credit Lyonnais bank as a creditor of Mr Bernard Tapie, laid claim yesterday to the politician's furniture. The Budget Ministry said that, in a near replay of a swoop by the state-owned bank last month, two bailiffs went to Mr Tapie's 16th-century Paris mansion to stake the tax authorities' claim on antique furniture and art works. Mr Tapie has said his collection represents some 40 per cent of his FFr800m (Pounds 93m) worth of assets. The authorities, alleging tax evasion and business fraud over Mr Tapie's pleasure yacht, have asked for his parliamentary immunity to be lifted so that investigations can go ahead. The ministry said the treasury, in principle, has priority claim among creditors. But sources close to the loss-making bank, while stressing that it had no intention of engaging in open battle for the assets, pointed out that his belongings are guarantees on part of the FFr1.2bn it lent him.</p>

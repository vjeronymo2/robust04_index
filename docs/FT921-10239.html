			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: SelecTV shows sharp advance at Pounds 178,000 SelecTV, the USM-quoted independent producer of television programmes, doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 85,000 to Pounds 178,000 in the six months to September 30. Mr Michael Buckley, chairman, said the most significant factor was the award to Meridian Broadcasting, of which the company was a founder member, of the Channel 3 franchise for south and south east Eng-land. However, SelecTV limited its investment to 15 per cent in order to retain indepen-dent producer status for the BBC. The company will be the sole supplier of comedy and comedy/drama programmes for the Meridian franchise which will lead to more programmes being produced for the ITV network, Mr Buckley said. Turnover rose to Pounds 5.43m (Pounds 4.26m), with operating profit working through at Pounds 173,000 (Pounds 87,000). Earnings per share came to 0.16p (0.13p).</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / N-ship anger startles Tokyo: French plutonium JAPAN yesterday admitted it had underestimated the scale of the international outcry provoked by its controversial shipment of plutonium from France last weekend. The specially equipped Akatsuki Maru set sail from Cherbourg last Saturday, carrying one ton of plutonium to be used for Japan's fast-breeder nuclear reactor. The criticism has become a serious embarrassment, as governments from 10 countries, including Chile and South Africa, have forbidden the entry of the ship into their territorial waters. Mr Hiroyuki Kishino, director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' nuclear energy division, said: 'We didn't expect such high international attention.' The route of the Akatsuki Maru, thought to be now sailing around the Canary Islands, has not been disclosed: it could head for the southern tip of Africa, or the tip of South America, or the Panama Canal. Environmental activists argue that an accident at sea could cause an environmental disaster, and Greenpeace, the international environmental pressure group, has vowed to follow the ship, meeting it at every port. Greenpeace maintains that one millionth of a gram of plutonium is enough to cause lung cancer and that eight kilograms can easily be turned into a nuclear bomb. Japanese officials claim that they have taken all necessary precautions, including protection against a terrorist attack. They also say that, even if the plutonium was discharged into the ocean, the environmental impact would be minimal. Japan is unlikely to change its plans for shipping a total of 30 tonnes of plutonium from Britain and France over the next 10-15 years. Mr Reiji Nagashi, director of the nuclear energy industry division at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti), stressed the importance of energy self-sufficiency for a nation with few natural resources. Japan has long tried to develop plutonium-based fast-breeder reactors, which create plutonium as the fuel emits energy. It has 41 conventional nuclear reactors operating on imported uranium, which can only be used once, and needs to send its uranium waste abroad for reprocessing. However, the economic viability of using plutonium is still under scrutiny, since the price of uranium has plunged in recent years. Moreover, Japanhas only one fast-breeder reactor, which is used experimentally. Technology for commercial fast-breeder reactors will not be ready until 2030, and full-scale use of plutonium may not happen till the middle of the next century. The Maritime Safety Agency has blamed Greenpeace for last week's collision between the Shikishima, a Japanese escort vessel, and the Solo, the Greenpeace protest boat shadowing the Akatsuki Maru. The agency warned that it would not refrain from warning shots in future such incidents.</p>

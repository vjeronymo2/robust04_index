			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Investors Warm to WPPSS Bonds: Apparently unconcerned over the spectacular 1983  bond default by the Washington Public Power Supply System, investors snapped up  the new WPPSS refunding bond issue. Underwriters had set a preliminary pricing  of $738 million for WPPSS projects one and three refunding bonds, but the issue  was oversubscribed. The strong demand is expected to increase the size of the  issue to about $835 million to $840 million and to decrease yields, officials  said.  </P></p>

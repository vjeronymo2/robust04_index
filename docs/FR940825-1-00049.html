			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because a responsible entity that follows the verification and due process requirements established in the final rule is statutorily protected from liability, HUD has not revised the requirements in the 1994 proposed rule to include any additional protections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> O. Reexamination of Income <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters argued that the requirement for annual verification of the immigration status of any tenant family containing one or more non-citizen members is an unnecessary burden for project owners, HAs, and tenants. The commenters that immigration status rarely changes, and that any additional burden encountered because of an applicant's lack of citizenship might result in discrimination by project owners against all noncitizens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD agrees that the burden of requiring an annual recertification and verification of immigration status of all noncitizen members of tenant families outweighs any benefit to be obtained, and the 1994 proposed rule revises the reexamination provisions to restrict the requirement for submission of a declaration (and documentation and verification of immigration status, where an alien is involved) to new individuals joining the household_other than by birth to one of the occupants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> P. Miscellaneous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Cost <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several of the commenters on the 1988 proposed rule complained that the requirement that the immigration status of all applicants be documented and verified under these procedures which include the offer of hearings at several points would be expensive and time-consuming. One commenter estimated that it would need to hire 56 additional housing assistants, at a cost of $2 million, as well as conduct training of its employees, at a cost of $250,000, and spend $800,000 on notifying applicants of the requirements. Several HA commenters suggested that HUD reimburse them for additional staff time. Another commenter speculated that some landlords would withdraw from participation in HUD programs rather than put up with the extra burdens and costs of the new requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD is aware that the verification procedure prescribed by IRCA is not without cost. The Federal government will incur the cost of the computerized verification system (SAVE) operated by the INS. The cost of operating that system will not be billed to the HA or project owner accessing the system but to HUD, for each inquiry made to the system. For HAs and project owners in most areas of the country, the cost of the verification system will not be substantial, because most applicants and tenants will certify that they are citizens. For HAs and project owners located in the parts of the country where the concentration of noncitizen residents is greatest, there will be greater impact. However, the additional cost will be only a small, incremental change in the overall cost of processing applications and reexaminations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One small HA advocated that HUD at least provide grants to small HAs who must computerize to accomplish the required verification. HUD sees no reason that any HA would need to computerize in order to implement these requirements. All that is necessary to access the SAVE system is a touch-tone telephone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Implementation Timing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HAs indicated that the rule should not be implemented until the INS verification program is fully operational and readily available for their use. As stated earlier in this preamble, HUD is in full agreement with that desire. The SAVE system is operational. Funds have been budgeted for billing the cost of SAVE access for HUD programs to HUD. After the publication of the final rule, arrangements will be made to issue identifying codes to the many administrators of HUD-assisted housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Other Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of the sections in the 1994 proposed rule have been revised and restructured for ease of understanding and clarity of complex provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the 1994 proposed rule, HUD has changed the minimum retention period for documents from 3 years to 5 years. This makes the retention period coincide with the statute of limitations for criminal prosecution and the ongoing needs for computer matching to verify tenant income. The five-year retention requirement does not impose a burden on HAs and private project owners, because HAs and project owners currently retain the records concerning the initial certification, regular recertification and interim recertification for at least five years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Other Matters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 as a significant regulatory action. Any changes made in this proposed rule as a result of that review are clearly identified in the docket file for this proposed rule, which is available for public inspection in the Office of HUD's Rules Docket Clerk, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410&hyph;0500.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment was made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR part 50 that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). The Finding is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this proposed rule before publication, and by approving it, certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. HUD believes that the rule, when implemented, will have only a minimal impact on small housing project owners, small mortgagees and small housing agencies, since the procedures specified to implement the restrictions are to require owners and HAs to use an easily accessible (by telephone) automated system for verifying immigration status. HUD has arranged for the cost of the automated verification system, established by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to be billed directly to HUD. The only other significant element of cost or delay in administration of HUD programs that may be encountered by small entities as a result of this rule is the requirement for a fair hearing, on request, for any applicant or tenant found to be ineligible. This procedure is specifically required by 42 U.S.C. 1436a. However, HUD does not believe that the cost or delay will be significant because HUD anticipates that small housing agencies, project owners and mortgagees will find that the majority of applicants or tenants are eligible to receive HUD assistance, and therefore fair hearings to determine eligibility on the basis of immigration status will be minimal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, HUD concludes that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and that to the extent possible, HUD has minimized the economic impact on all entities, consistent with the Secretary's responsibilities under section 1436a.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order on Federalism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this proposed rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. This proposed rule addresses immigration, a topic exclusively the province of the Federal government, and the effect is the direct result of the statute that imposes the restriction against assistance to noncitizens, rather than a result of HUD's exercise of discretion in promulgating a rule to implement the statute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

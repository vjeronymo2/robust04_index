			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Microsoft's conduct also substantially lengthens the period of time required for competitors to recover their development costs and earn a profit, and thereby increases the risk that an entry attempt will fail. In combination, all these factors deter entry by competitors and thus harm competition. By deterring the development of competitive operating systems, Microsoft has deprived consumers of a choice of potentially superior products. Similarly, the slower growth of competing operating systems has retarded the development of applications for such systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed Final Judgment will end Microsoft's unlawful practices that restrain trade and perpetuate its monopoly power in the market for PC operating systems. In addition, the proposed Final Judgment contains provisions that are remedial in nature and designed to assure that Microsoft will not engage in the future in exclusionary practices designed to produce the same or similar effects as those set forth in the Complaint. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In particular, Sections IV (A), (C), and (F) prohibit Mirosoft's use of the specific exclusionary practices alleged in the complaint_``per processor'' contracts, lengthy terms, and minimum commitments_that foreclose competing PC operating system vendors from much of the OEM channel. Sections IV (K)&hyph;(L) prohibit the use of anticompetitive non-disclosure agreements in conjunction with Mirosoft's distribution of pre-commercial releases of operating system software products. Sections IV (B), (E), (G), and (H) impose prohibitions that go beyond the alleged exclusionary practices in order to ensure that Microsoft's future contracting practices_not challenged here because not yet used_do not unreasonably impede competition. Sections IV (J) and (M) are designed to bring existing contracts into immediate compliance with the proposed Final Judgment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of the Final Judgment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The injunctions in Section IV generally apply to ``covered products'' which are defined, in Section II(A), as the binary code of MS&hyph;DOS 6.22; Microsoft Windows 3.11; Windows for Workgroups 3.11; predecessor versions of those products; the product currently code-named ``Chicago'' (the planned successor to Microsoft Windows 3.11); and other successor versions of or products marketed as replacements for the aforementioned products. This definition includes all Microsoft's PC operating system products in which the defendant currently possesses a substantial degree of market power. The definition does not encompass and specifically excludes, Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Advanced Server, neither of which has a significant share of a relevant market at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``covered product'' was drafted with the recognition that Microsoft will continue to modify its operating system products throughout the duration of the Final Judgment. The prohibitions in the decree will apply to the successor and replacement products of those existing operating system products that have substantial market power. The decree will govern the licensing of such products if they are made available as stand-alone products to OEMs pursuant to license agreements, or as unbundled products that perform operating system software functions now embodied in the specifically listed existing products. Moreover, the decree will govern the licensing of successor versions of or products marketed as replacements for MS&hyph;DOS 6.22, Microsoft Windows 3.11, Windows for Workgroups 3.11, and ``Chicago,'' even if such successor or replacement products could also be characterized as successors or replacements of operating system software products that are not covered, such as windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Advanced Server. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Prohibition of the Licensing Violations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The three anticompetitive factors of Microsoft's license agreements that are challenged in the complaint_the excessive duration of those agreements, the requirement of royalty payments on a ``per processor'' basis, and large minimum commitments_are addressed principally in Sections IV(A), IV(C) and (IV)(F) of the Final Judgment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Duration: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section IV(A) limits the duration of Microsoft's license agreements with OEMs to one year, with OEMs having the option to renew a license for one additional one year term on the same terms and conditions as in the first year. This limitation on the duration of license agreements, along with the safeguards provided in Section IV(G), will ensure that vendors of competing operating systems will have regular and frequent opportunities to attempt to market their products to OEMs. Absent such opportunities, Microsoft's competitors might be unable to reach the level of market penetration needed for profitable operation in a reasonable period of time, even if they are offering products that are deemed superior by those customers who have an opportunity to buy them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Per Processor Licenses: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section IV(C) prohibits the use of per processor licenses. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Section II(K) defines per processor licenses as licenses that require the OEM to pay a royalty for all personal computer systems that contain specified microprocessors. As noted above, the requirement to pay a royalty to Microsoft on the sale of a PC that has a non-Microsoft operating system is comparable, in its economic effect, to the imposition of a ``tax'' on the competing operating system. Per processor licenses are also very similar to exclusive dealing or requirements contracts; the OEM in effect is obtaining the right to use Microsoft's operating system, and is paying an operating system royalty, for all of its operating system ``requirements'' for use on PCs using the designated microprocessors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section IV(J)(1) converts all per processor licenses to per system licenses, except those models which an OEM excludes, which will thereafter be subject to the limitations imposed on Microsoft by Section IV(G). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Minimum Commitments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section IV(F) will bar Microsoft from entering into any license agreement containing a minimum commitment. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  While minimum commitments are not in and of themselves illegal, they can be used to achieve a similar effect as that accomplished through per processor licenses or exclusive dealing contracts. If the minimum commitment is greater than the number of units of Microsoft software that the OEM expects or would otherwise desire to use at any time during the term of the contract, the minimum commitment creates a disincentive for an OEM to make incremental purchases of non-Microsoft operating systems. In that context, the minimum commitment also operates in effect to require a royalty payment to Microsoft, even for PCs that use a non-Microsoft operating system. This effect will be ended by Section (IV)(F). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section IV(J)(2) prohibits Microsoft from prospectively enforcing minimum commitments in existing license agreements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Restoring Competition to the Market Through Prophylactic Additional Relief <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed Final Judgment not only bans Microsoft's unlawful practices, but also contains additional provisions which are prophylactic in nature, and are intended to ensure that the anticompetitive effects of those practices are not replicated through use by Microsoft of other exclusionary practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

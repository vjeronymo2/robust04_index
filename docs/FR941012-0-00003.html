It also amends the regulations to allow the operators of foreign trade zones, container station and centralized examination stations and the proprietors of bonded warehouses to transport merchandise from within the district to their respective facilities. These amendments will result in savings of time and money for both the trade and Customs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  November 14, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ernie Cunningham, Office of Cargo Enforcement and Facilitation, Office of Inspection and Control, at 202&hyph;927&hyph;0510.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Customs requires that the carriage of imported merchandise, for which duty has not yet been paid, only be accomplished by certain bonded carriers. A cartman is one who undertakes to transport goods or merchandise within the limits of a port. A lighterman is one who transports goods or merchandise on a barge, scow, or other small vessel to or from a vessel within the port or from place to place within a port. The regulations regarding cartage and lighterage of merchandise are set forth in Part 125 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 125). The regulations regarding the bonding of carriers which receive merchandise for transportation in bond, and the licensing of cartmen and lightermen are set forth in Part 112 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 112).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, pursuant to &sect;&sect;112.2(b) and 112.21, Customs Regulations, Customs requires a bond and a license to transact business as a cartman or a lighterman for the cartage or lighterage of merchandise entered for warehouse, designated for examination, taken to container stations, or taken into custody as unclaimed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 29, 1992, Customs published a Notice of Proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rulemaking (NPRM) in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (57 FR 49049) proposing to consider within port transfers by cartmen and lightermen like other in-bond movements and to allow bonded carriers, in most instances, to carry in-bond cargo within a port without requiring them to obtain cartman or lighterman licenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the document, it was proposed that cartage and lighterage of merchandise designated for examination, taken to container stations, taken into custody as unclaimed or destined for admission to a foreign trade zone either may be done under the bond of a licensed cartman or lighterman, or if approved by the district director, under the bond of a foreign trade zone operator, container station operator, centralized examination station operator, or a bonded carrier. However, a license would still be necessary to obtain to carry in-bond merchandise within a port for the cartage of merchandise entered for warehouse; the reason for this exception was that 19 U.S.C. 1565 contained a statutory requirement that a cartman be licensed for cartage of merchandise entered for warehouse. Customs issued the proposal because it believes that the elimination of the license requirement will save Customs and the trade time and money.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statutory Change Since Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 8, 1993, the President signed the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 2057). Section 666 of Title VI (Customs Modernization) amended 19 U.S.C. 1565 to allow the cartage of merchandise entered for warehouse by bonded carriers as well as by licensed cartmen. Accordingly, the statement in the proposal that a license is required to transact business as a cartman and lighterman for the cartage or lighterage of merchandise entered for warehouse is no longer consistent with the statute. The statutory impediment to allowing the cartage of merchandise entered for warehouse by bonded carriers that existed at the time the proposal was published no longer exists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

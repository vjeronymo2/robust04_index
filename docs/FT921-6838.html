			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Letter: Circle must be squared on monetarist question Sir, Mr Samuel Brittan derides and condemns all forms of monetarism expounded by Patrick Minford, Tim Congdon, myself, and presumably all other British monetarists ('UK monetarist golden age - alas a myth', February 24). Fair enough. But what I do not understand is how Mr Brittan can square this contempt for British monetarism with his great enthusiasm for German monetarism. The Bundesbank announces monetary targets and, as has been amply demonstrated over the last six months, it adjusts interest rates and open market operations to bring the money supply into its target band. Is this not a monetarist policy as practised by the Bundesbank over the last three and a half decades? Indeed so great is Mr Brittan's admiration for German monetary policy that, since 1985, he has urged that, by joining the ERM, Britain should be subject to German monetarism. One can appreciate the argument that one can trust the Bundesbank and perhaps the European Central Bank more than the politicians who controlled British policy. But embracing German monetary policy does necessarily imply that one accepts the fundamental relationships between money, incomes and prices, in short monetarism, that underlies and guides Bundesbank policy. We would all benefit if Mr Brittan could explain how this circle is squared. Alan Walters, vice-chairman, AIG Trading Corporation, 1200 19th Street NW, Washington DC 20036, US</p>

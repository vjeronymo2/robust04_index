			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SKIING;  </P> <P> PFEIFER'S FALL GIVES LINDQVIST SLALOM TITLE  </P> <P> Ingemar Stenmark decided against joining the U.S. Pro Tour this winter, but  Swedish skiers on the circuit are doing well without him.  </P> <P> Niklas Lindqvist, born in Stockholm 25 years ago, won the slalom of the  America's Opening Cup Sunday and left Alpine Meadows with $7,100. He trailed  Roland Pfeifer by 0.108 of a second after the first run of the final, but  Pfeifer, from Austria, fell near the finish of their second run, giving  Lindqvist the victory.  </P> <P> Phil Mahre of Yakima, Wash., made it to the quarterfinals after going out in  the round of 16 during Saturday's giant slalom, but the three-time World Cup  champion crash-landed off the first of two jumps and fell an automatic 1.5  seconds behind Austrian Werner Herzog after their first run.  </P> <P> His 0.236-second margin over Herzog in the second run left him well short in  the combined reckoning.  </P> <P> "The heel binding ripped right out of my left ski when I landed," Mahre said.  "It was weird, something that's never happened to me before."  </P> <P> Tom Kelly, a former assistant coach on the U.S. Ski Team now with the firm that  supplies Mahre with bindings, was dumbfounded afterward. "I didn't mount Phil's  bindings myself," he said, "and I can't really explain how it happened."  </P> <P> But Kelly did a double-take when he opened a fortune cookie after eating the  Oriental meal served in the hospitality tent. Said the fortune:  </P> <P> "You will soon be in another line of work."  </P> <P> In the second round, Mahre had won a battle of 1984 Olympic gold medalists when  he defeated Max Julen. Mahre, who took the slalom at Sarajevo, Yugoslavia,  edged Julen, the 1984 giant slalom champion, by 0.149 of a second in the first  run, then breezed into the quarterfinals as Julen fell near the end of their  second duel.  </P> <P> Lindqvist appeared to be on a collision course to meet fellow Swede Jorgen  Sundqvist in the semifinals. Last season, the first for both on the tour,  Sundqvist was the overall champion, and Lindqvist was third, just behind Mahre.  </P> <P> However, Sundqvist fell on his second run in the quarterfinals against Joerg  Seiler of Switzerland, who went on to give Lindqvist a scare before losing  their semifinal by a slim combined time differential of 0.009 of a second.  </P> <P> Lindqvist had been eliminated in the second round Saturday as Bernhard Knauss  of Austria won the giant slalom, but he said Sunday: "I wasn't worried. Today  was a new day."  </P> <P> And besides, Knauss had to scratch from the slalom because of a partial  ligament tear in his right knee and a partial separation of his left shoulder  suffered in a finish-line spill the day before.  </P></p>

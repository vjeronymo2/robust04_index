			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Offer of payment after 27 years AFTER 27 YEARS, creditors of an insolvent insurance company have been offered their first payment, signalling an end to one of the longest company liquidations. Liquidators of St Helen's Insurance, which stopped writing new business in 1966, have offered to pay a dividend at the end of next year provided creditors agree to make no further claims against the business. The company has less than Pounds 30m in assets against liabilities of nearly Pounds 87m, indicating a maximum dividend of 34p in the pound. Creditors have been warned that they may have to wait until next century for their money if they refuse to accept the offer. The misfortunes of St Helen's are typical of the calamities which have hit insurers in the past 30 years. The company, founded in 1938, temporarily ceased underwriting in 1965 after receiving claims for more than Pounds 1m following Hurricane Betsy. This generated what was then the largest insured loss from a single disaster - more than Dollars 1bn. A capital restructuring in 1966 failed to remedy the company's difficulties. Since then St Helen's has been hit by a growing number of claims for asbestosis, medical negligence, and product liability. Shareholders in the company - mainly Lloyd's syndicates and corporate insurers - continued to keep it solvent with new equity until 1984, when liquidators were appointed.</p>

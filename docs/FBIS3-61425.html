			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by L. F. Bakhturova, V. V. Bakovets, I. P. </F> Dolgovesova, B. M. Ayupov, S.B. RAS Institute of Inorganic  Chemistry, Novosibirsk, Russia]    [Abstract] Silicon samples, implanted by [.sup]40[/]  Ar[.sup]+[/] (10[.sup]15[/]cm[.sup]-2[/]  dose) ions and P[.sup]+[/] (10[.sup]16[/] cm[.sup]-2[/]  dose) ions with 40 keV energy, were examined employing the  methods of multiangular ellipsometry and selective moistening  with a layer-by-layer removal of the implanted section using  anode oxidation. With implantation by Ar[.sup]+[/] ions, the  maxima of the experimentally obtained profiles _th_, n and k  lie  nearer to the surface, than with implantation by ions  Ar[.sup]+[/]. This can be explained by the fact that the mass  of Ar[.sup]+[/][[.sup]2[/]] ions is greater, and the  implantation dose is slightly smaller than for P[.sup]+[/].  With implantation by Ar[.sup]+[/], as well as by  P[.sup]+[/] ions, the profiles _th_ and k are identical, and  correspond to the defects' distribution profile in the implanted  layer. The profile of the n changes is, probably, determined by  a joint action of the defects and impurity. Figures 3,  references 20: 16 Russian, 4 Western.</p>

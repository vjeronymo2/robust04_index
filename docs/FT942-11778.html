			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / India postpones VSNL Dollars 1bn issue The Indian government yesterday postponed a planned Dollars 1bn (Pounds 663m) international equity issue by Videsh Sanchar Nigam (VSNL), the state-controlled international telecommunications monopoly. Fund managers balked at the high price set by the government in consultation with the company and the global co-ordinators, Salomon Brothers of the US and Britain's Kleinwort Benson. The postponement is India's biggest setback in the international capital markets since Indian issuers first raised funds in late 1992, after the government's liberalisation programme permitted increased foreign trade and investment. The decision could harm the prospects for future Indian issues and will do little to help confidence in investing in emerging markets, which have mostly fallen this year after rapid gains in 1993. 'This is really bad news for India,' said Mr Tony Singh, a stockbroker at Cresvale, a London-based investment company. 'There were so many other Euroissues from India which were hoping to ride on the back of VSNL's success.' When VSNL, which is 85 per cent government-owned, first considered the international equity offering late last year, it considered raising Dollars 500m, which would still have been the biggest Indian international offering. But the growing appetite of foreign fund managers for Indian stocks persuaded the company and the government to increase the issue size to Dollars 1bn. With the VSNL price rising on the BSE from Rs650 in early November to a peak of Rs1,700 in January and February, the issuers fixed a minimum issue price of Rs1,400. But by the time the price was approved at a cabinet meeting in early April, international markets had soured and were in a difficult state when the company started its roadshow in Hong Kong in mid-April. Fund managers there, and later, said with shares trading in Bombay around Rs1,300, Rs1,400 was too high. There were talks over the weekend on proposals to cut the price to between Rs1,100 and Rs1,200, to raise about Dollars 700m, but this would have required cabinet approval.

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Arts: Today's Television As they say on Radio 2, Friday Night Is Music Night. The programme of that name offers middle-of-the-road popular music from the BBC Concert Orchestra (7.30). There is a huge range of other music on offer elsewhere. Also at 7.30 Radio 3 begins its relay of the opening concert in the 1994 Aldeburgh Festival with Britten's 'Sinfonia da Requiem', Stravinsky's 'The Flood', and Mahler's 'Totenfeier'. If your taste is for more popular classical music the Evening Concert on Classic FM at 8.00 provides Britten's 'Young Person's Guide To The Orchestra', Arensky's 'Variations On A Theme Of Tchaikovsky', and Rachmaninov's 'Rhapsody On A Theme Of Paganini'. At 10.00 John Peel begins three hours of rock music from Tilburg, Holland, on Radio 1. If light entertainment is your requirement from television on a Friday night, there is a repeat of Red Dwarf, (9.00 BBC2) a situation comedy with an unusual situation (deep space); the topical quiz show Have I Got News For You (10.00 BBC2); and Viva Cabaret on C4 which features some pretty appalling acts but also Gayle Tuesday, a funny stand-up comedian (10.30).</p>

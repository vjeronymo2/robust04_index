			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Labour has slight Monklands lead Labour is fractionally ahead of the Scottish National party in the Monklands East by-election, according to an opinion poll published yesterday. The by-election in the constituency near Glasgow, caused by the death in May of John Smith, takes place on Thursday. The poll for the Sunday Mail put support for Mrs Helen Liddell, the Labour candidate, at 45.1 per cent, with that for Mrs Kay Ullrich of the SNP on 43.2 per cent. Support for the Conservatives was 4.3 per cent, and that for the Liberal Democrats on 0.6 per cent. Last week a poll in the Scottish Daily Express put the SNP in the lead with 42 per cent and Labour 38.7 per cent, although the candidates discounted it as its sample size was 400. The Sunday Mail's opinion survey was conducted by telephone among 1,000 people on Thursday and Friday. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary and front runner for the Labour leadership, will visit the constituency today.</p>

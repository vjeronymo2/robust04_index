			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arkadiy Dubnov: "General Gromov Is Not Afraid of </F> the Tajik Opposition: He Is Afraid of a `New Afghanistan' for  Russia"]    [Text] There is no general in the Russian army who knows  better than General Boris Gromov what a war outside of Russia  means. He was the last commander of the Soviet expeditionary  corps which fought in Afghanistan and was the last to leave it,  in the wake of his 40th Army, crossing the border Amu-Darya at  the now-celebrated bridge in Termez. This was five years ago.  Since that time General Gromov has been a convinced opponent of  Russia's involvement in such wars, in which neither victory nor  glory are to be found. But the general has not forgotten against  whom his Afghan vets were fighting. The Mujahidin remain his  enemies today also.    Boris Gromov is now deputy minister of defense of Russia.  For  his subordinates the Afghan Mujahidin have become the enemy once  again. They are being fought by a Russian expeditionary corps  which is now in Tajikistan. They and combatants of the Tajik  opposition. Now, the corps is called not a "limited Soviet  military contingent," it is true, but a part of the coalition  peacekeeping force of the CIS. But this does not alter the  essence of the matter, albeit languid, a war is under way in  Tajikistan, nonetheless, and Russian soldiers are fighting on  one side for the Tajik Government in Dushanbe and against the  Afghan enemy and Tajik combatants.  <H5>  Turadzhonzoda Was Surprised </H5>   It is any wonder that the meeting between General Gromov and  an acknowledged leader of the Tajik opposition, Khodzhi Akbar  Turadzhonzoda, deputy chairman of the Islamic Resistance  Movement of Tajikistan, which took place in Moscow at the end of  last week, was held in a less-than-diplomatic atmosphere, to put  it mildly. No, it was not Gromov who had sought this meeting,  the former spiritual leader of Tajik Muslims had requested that  a head-to-head meeting with the general be arranged.  Turadzhonzoda had come to Moscow at the end of the first round  of inter-Tajik peace negotiations. He and his movement  colleague, Mukhammad-sharif Khemmatzoda, chairman of the Islamic  Revival Party, who are the official leaders of the Tajik  opposition delegation, refused to sit at the negotiating table  until Dushanbe was officially represented thereat by some top  person of the Tajik Government. For the opposition leaders, the  visit to Moscow meant an opportunity familiarize the Russian  leadership with its position in personal contact with it for the  first time. It is hard to say whether this meeting was useful  for the deputy defense minister.... But for his  interlocutors--undoubtedly. To their astonishment, they learned  that they were being taken for some others. The point being that  General Gromov began the conversation with accusations that the  opposition was demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops from  Tajikistan and an end to all relations with Russia, and this was  unacceptable.    "You are mistaken, you have, evidently, been misinformed,"  Turadzhonzoda responded. "We recognize Russia's geopolitical  interests in Tajikistan and are not demanding the withdrawal of  the Russian, more precisely, coalition, peacekeeping force,  provided that the command staff, which does not occupy a neutral  position and which supports the present Tajik Government, is  replaced. As far as relations with Russia are concerned,"  Turadzhonzoda observed, "we do not envisage the future of  Tajikistan without the closest and most friendly ties to it.  This viewpoint should be well known to the Russian leadership,  the Tajik opposition has conveyed it to Moscow in its messages,  and the Russian press has expounded it also," the former chief  qadi of Tajikistan added in surprise. "We would like to know  where you came by this misinformation," he asked Boris Gromov.    "From the opposition," the general replied.    "We represent the opposition, it is important, therefore,  that we know from whom this comes...."    "Do not interrupt me," the deputy defense minister stopped  his guest....    This tone of the exchange did little, evidently, to  contribute to its productiveness. General Gromov asked that it  be conveyed "back there" that the Russian army would, in spite  of everything, defend the Russian-speaking population.  Turadzhonzoda replied that this was not how the issue should be  framed, that no one was intending to attack the Russian  speakers, and that their safety could be secured only by peace  in the republic. And if some people do have a bad attitude  toward the Russians, it is because, possibly, they are treating  Tajik refugees badly in Russia.... Do not treat them badly here,  do not attack them, and no one will touch Russians either....    "You should not try to frighten us," Gromov said, "otherwise  you will be duly repulsed...."    This was how the discussion went. It would be hard to call  it  a peacemaking discussion.  <H5>  One Out of Every Five Tajiks in Exile? </H5>   The meeting between the leaders of the Tajik opposition and  Russian diplomats was at somewhat of a different level. Khodzhi  Akbar Turadzhonzoda termed the conversation with Albert  Chernyshev, deputy minister of foreign affairs, "friendly" even.  The deputy minister inquired, the deputy chairman of the  movement responded.    "Can the opposition be reconciled with the government in  Dushanbe? Should it not join in the process of preparation for  the elections to the new Tajik parliament scheduled for this  year?"    "How is this possible when political parties are banned,  political opponents are jailed or wanted by the police, there is  no free press, and the principal 'authority' in the republic is  the man with the gun? What kind of elections are they if one out  of every fifth Tajik is in exile?" Turadzhonzoda answered the  question with a question. "The present government should be  replaced by a new leadership made up of professionals who were  not involved in the Tajiks' civil war, the opposition is not  laying claim to political power today, and we want the  leadership of the People's Front, which came to this power in  illegitimate fashion, to do the same...."    "But then there would be a power vacuum," the Russian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, "especially since the  government in Dushanbe was elected legally at a session of the  Tajik parliament in December 1992 in Khudzhent."    "Can a government elected by deputies under the threat of  death be legitimate, we should not deceive ourselves.... Could  it otherwise have been possible for the government to have been  made up of 13 representatives from Kulyab Oblast alone, more  precisely, from just one of its rayons--Baldzhuvanskiy. We  cannot recognize such a government," Turadzhonzoda said. "If  Russia wishes to defend its interests in Tajikistan," the former  qadi continued, "it could do so at a far smaller cost in terms  of human and material resources: It has only to put pressure on  Dushanbe for it to agree to our proposals. And as soon as a new  government is formed, we guarantee the disarmament of our armed  formations, if the same is done with 80 percent of the  government formations."    The functions of maintaining order, the opposition believes,  could be assumed by the CIS peacekeeping force, if states  bordering Tajikistan are not members of it. And only then, 18  months to two years hence, when the refugees have returned to  their homeland, Turadzhonzoda maintained, could elections be  held and a new Constitution of Tajikistan adopted.  <H5>  The Hot Breath of the `Irreconcilables' </H5>   "And what would your plans be were you to win the  elections,"  the deputy minister of foreign affairs of Russia asked.    "We understand your concern," his interlocutor replied, "you  are afraid of the scarecrow of Islamic fundamentalism being  shoved onto you.... We propose that Russia and other countries  of the CIS be the guarantors of the preparation of a  constitution which excludes the possibility of the formation of  a theocratic state. We aspire to a secular, democratic regime,  in which religion would be separate from the state," the former  leader of Tajik Muslims emphasized, "and the constitution should  contain a provision prohibiting its revision for 30-50 years."    The Tajik opposition is convinced that the government in  Dushanbe will never relinquish its power as long as Russia  supports it by its military presence, and for this reason the  success of the inter-Tajik negotiations depends, in its opinion,  on Moscow alone. Otherwise, the leaders of the opposition say,  we will be compelled to prove that we are right by force, and  Russia will be drawn increasingly into a "dirty" war, the  outcome of which is determined in advance: Russia would be  forced to withdraw from Tajikistan in disgrace, repeating its  Afghan path. Turadzhonzoda acknowledges that "we are unpracticed  at diplomatic negotiations," and this is why he came to Moscow,  endeavoring to achieve understanding and support. It is possible  that the difficulties of the opposition leaders who came here  amount additionally to the fact that they feel the "hot breath"  of the radical and irreconcilable armed opposition or of the  Islamic circles that are backing it. The position of Khodzhi  Akbar Turadzhonzoda and his closest associates who resolved to  agree to negotiations is still quite influential today, it would  seem. But what will be the case tomorrow?    Dushanbe is content with the results of the Moscow round.  They are speaking there about a "psychological turning point" in  relations with the opposition. If this is even the "desire," it  is hardly "reality." The Kulyab clan, which controls the main  power structures in the government and which has the most  hostile attitude toward the opposition (this is mutual, for that  matter), has no intention of ceding its positions. According to  certain information, the attempts made this February to remove  from the government Yakub Salimov, minister of foreign affairs  (the most odious figure among the leadership and a leader of the  disbanded People's Front, who has, in addition, a criminal  past), was unsuccessful. Salimov declared that he would resign  only together with the top leaders of the republic. His  departure would undoubtedly enhance the image of the official  Tajik leadership, but there are fears there, not without reason,  of the republic splitting in this case into not two but three  hostile camps.  <H5>  The Chief Banker of Tajikistan Rebukes Russia </H5>   It is naive to imagine that Moscow does not see this, and we  should not be deluded as to its readiness to put pressure on  Dushanbe under these conditions. The Tajik regime has no  intention of capitulating to the demands of the opposition.  Especially since it has managed to pull itself into the orbit of  Russia's economic and military-strategic attraction. The  situation appears amusing at times. Kayum Kavmiddinov, chairman  of the National Bank of Tajikistan, recently rebuked the  Ministry of Finance of Russia for delay in the payment of R60  billion promised the republic last year on account of a loan of  R120 billion, thanks to which Tajikistan was permitted to join  the ruble zone.    What demands can be made of Dushanbe here, it will be a case  of apologizing, more likely.... And of printing hundreds of  billions of rubles with Tajik symbols as quickly as possible  until the R70 billion of real rubles which have already been  allocated are finally "washed" out of Tajikistan.    There is, meanwhile, about a month to go before the next  round of inter-Tajik negotiations. It will take place, most  likely, in Tehran, where the official Tajik delegation will head  in the same composition as before. And this means that the  opposition leaders will once again fail to show at the  negotiating table. But whereas in Moscow their absence did not  prevent agreement being reached on the future 27-point agenda,  in the Iranian capital the delegations' authority for adopting  decisions on these points will be manifestly insufficient. After  all, it will be impossible to decide questions of a political  settlement including an end to mutual hostilities on the  Tajik-Afghan border and within the republic, the attitude toward  the various military formations of both the government and the  opposition, and measures of mutual trust in the absence of the  political leaders from both sides.    A situation where these leaders are unofficially present  alongside and determine the tactics of their delegations, as was  the case in Moscow, say, where Rashid Alimov, minister of  foreign affairs of Tajikistan, was present at the time of the  negotiations, is possible. But it is hardly likely that the  decisions adopted in that case could be deemed legitimate for  both parties.  <H5>  A `Second Afghanistan' Still Looms </H5>   ...Making forecasts, even for a month ahead, is a thankless  task. Nonetheless, some things may be anticipated. As a result  of the change of commander of the CIS peacekeeping force in  Tajikistan (General Valeriy Patrikeyev, who was prior to this  commander of the Transcaucasus Military District, has been  appointed in place of General Boris Pyankov, who attempted to  don the garb of peacemaker and simultaneously called one side  "gangsters," whom he contrasted with the "constructive  government forces") a softening of the threatening rhetoric in  respect to the opposition may be expected for a certain length  of time. Especially since the inflaming of military hysteria by  Patrikeyev's predecessor in connection with a powerful  opposition offensive expected in the spring has not been  justified.    There will be a revitalization of the propaganda campaign in  Dushanbe designed to show on the one hand the peaceful  aspirations of the government and, on the other, the perfidy of  an opposition wishing only to return to power. The preparations  for elections, which are to substantiate the legitimacy of the  current regime, will be rapid. And with the introduction, in  May, presumably, of the transitional Tajik-ruble currency in the  republic the government could establish itself as the guarantor  of economic stability. All this put together could force the  Tajik opposition to take a chance on other than peaceful means  of struggle. Unless, of course, it proves to be prepared for a  negotiating process which is long and exhausting and not without  forced compromises.    Moscow also will be thinking that the threat of a "second  Afghanistan" is far from ephemeral.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (5): Clients' awareness grows - Stock Lending International securities lending can be one of the most lucrative aspects of the global custody business. But custodians are beginning to realise that clients are becoming more aware of its profitability. Some clients have discovered that the fees earned on stock lending benefit their custodian more than themselves. Also, some have gathered a sophisticated understanding of the business, and have grasped that in some circumstances custodians may not be able to maximise fee income from the stocks the client is prepared to lend. Recently, these inefficiencies have caught the attention of other commercial providers who seek to either help investors maximise profits on stock lending through their custodian, or to help them to lend directly to those who need stock most. One leading UK institution, CIN Management, the in-house manager of the Pounds 13.5bn British Coal pension schemes, is already doing its own direct stock lending. As a practice, stock lending in the UK received a setback two years ago when the former administrators of pension schemes controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell said that much of the Pounds 440m in assets missing from the schemes had disappeared through stock lending agreements. However, writs against several of the world's largest fund managers allege that the activities carried out by the Maxwell pension schemes bore little or no relation to stock lending as it is commonly understood. Indeed, the government's own advisory panel on pension law reform, headed by commercial law Professor Roy Goode, found that stock lending, properly controlled, is a perfectly reasonable and sensible activity for pension schemes to undertake. That pronouncement is expected to do much to help restore confidence in stock lending among pension fund trustees and should help to widen the pool of potential lenders. Thus, trustees attention is turning away from the question of 'Is stock lending safe?' to 'Is stock lending profitable?'. Mr Mark Weeks, vice-president at London Global Securities, notes that stock lending is also taking on greater significance for the proprietary trading arms of large securities firms. 'There is a growing trend to try to finance long equity positions by trying to lend the underlying securities,' he said. That technique has been the mainstay of the US Treasuries markets for decades where so-called repurchase agreements for billions of dollars of securities are arranged within seconds. Mr Weeks's own business acts as an intermediary to the stock lending process, particularly among securities firms trying to arrange lending agreements outside their own custodian. However, Mr Weeks is quick to point out that his firm is not seeking to by-pass custodians as a rule. 'If the custodian offers a good enough business, we are happy to borrow from them,' he said. The advantage to using an intermediary is that many custodians are themselves attached to securities firms. 'If you go out to borrow securities from another broker-dealer, there is always the danger that the details will leak out,' he said. 'Wouldnt you prefer to go to an independent where the terms of the deal will not leak?'. Meanwhile, technological advances are aiding both custodians and those who would like to manage their own stock lending operations. Tullett and Tokyo, the UK money broker, is setting up a screen to quote prices for securities lending now that new UK rules allow on-lending of stock to third parties. Also, Reuters Instinet system is shortly to launch a screen-based stock loan matching system which will allow counterparties to electronically match their bargains. One of the new businesses which has sprung up in response to the growing interest in profitability is Boston Global Advisers, a US-based sister company to London Global which acts as an intermediary. 'We are a bolt-on securities lending operation,' said Ms Chris Donovan, marketing director. The company offers an agency lending service to pension funds, mutual funds and to custodial banks who have no securities lending operation of their own or which do not engage in the most lucrative aspect of stock lending, cross-border stock loans. 'This is a business proposition made possible by the inefficiencies of the global custodians and because of the size of the portfolios now available for lending,' Ms Donovan said. Not only are some clients unhappy at the fee split - in the UK, the average split ranges from 75 per cent received by the client to 40 per cent - some feel they cannot get the maximum use of their securities if they rely only on the custodian to find business. A client with, say, 500,000 shares of IBM stock may have given his custodian permission to lend all of them. But the custodian may have agreements with 20 other clients all holding similar amounts. When an order to borrow say, 1m IBM shares comes in, the custodian will borrow from each of the clients equally and instead of lending 500,000 IBM shares, the client is able to lend only 50,000. Thus, Ms Donovan said, for the very largest clients, even the most efficient custodians may be unable to get the most profit out of a portfolio. However, custodians say that those clients trying to bypass them in their stock lending activities probably have little to gain in the long run. Mr Terry Pearson, head of client relationships at Royal Bank of Scotland, the largest independent custodian for UK pension funds, says: 'The client may feel that they are in control but they are not really. In fact, he is still reliant on his custodian to deliver the stock and collect the collateral.' Unless clients have adequate systems to handle the collateral - marking it to market, servicing corporate actions and safekeeping - stock lending outside the custodian could prove disastrous.</p>

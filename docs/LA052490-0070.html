			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASPARAGUS BEARS THE FRESH FLAVOR OF SPRING;  </P> <P> LEGUMES: VERSATILE VEGETABLE REMAINS IN SEASON TILL SUMMER AND SUPPLIES ARE  GOOD.  </P> <P> When we think of seasonal spring vegetables several come to mind -- peas, fava  beans, artichokes, the first tender salad greens, emerging shoots of herbs, and  green garlic, the bulbs not yet formed.  </P> <P> But the vegetable I most associate with spring is asparagus. We use garlic at  all times of year, frozen peas taste fine, herbs don't really come on strong  until summer, artichokes are more or less available year-round and fava beans  are a bit esoteric as vegetables go.  </P> <P> Asparagus, though, covers the full extent of the spring season. The precise  month it emerges in our region of the country may vary from the end of winter  to the beginning of summer, but both ends of the market season are usually  extended with imports, giving us a generous supply that begins in February and  continues through June.  </P> <P> Asparagus is the first green vegetable to appear that gives relief from winter  produce, and its fresh green taste is really welcome. This is the time of year  I like to eat it very simply, blanched and served with sweet butter and maybe a  squeeze of lemon juice, so that its own singular taste can be enjoyed without  interference from other strong flavors.  </P> <P> As the season moves on and the price of asparagus begins to drop, I begin to  feel easier about exploring its other possibilities. Asparagus lends itself to  all types of cooking. Though excellent blanched, it can be baked, served cold  as a salad, stewed with other vegetables to make a soup or ragout, grilled over  coals, cooked in risotto, baked in a tart or folded into an omelet.  </P> <P> It is a very versatile vegetable that adapts comfortably to the different  flavors of herbs and oils, such as olive, peanut, sesame and walnut oils. All  are good with asparagus and each one makes a very different tasting kind of  dish.  </P> <P> Quite a lot has been made about the proper way to cook asparagus; there are  special pans designed that allow the tougher stem ends to be submerged in the  boiling water while the tender tips are merely steamed.  </P> <P> I've always found that asparagus cooks quite well in either a large kettle or a  skillet of boiling water, and I don't worry about the tough ends. I do what I  can beforehand -- breaking off the fibrous ends and peeling the thicker stalks.  </P> <P> In a restaurant situation, I find it useful to tie individual servings into  bundles and blanch them. When they are done, I snip the string, leaving the  asparagus lined up with the tips pointing in the same direction. At home, I  don't bother with the string. I think the asparagus cooks better when loose,  and the time it takes to arrange it allows it to cool to a better temperature  for eating.  </P> <P>  Blanched asparagus can either be dressed while warm and served with a covering  of thin shavings of Parmesan cheese or cooked beforehand and later broiled with  butter and cheese. The heat of the asparagus will soften the cheese and bring  out its wonderful flavor.  </P> <P> ASPARAGUS WITH BROWN BUTTER AND PARMESAN CHEESE  </P> <P> 2 pounds thick or thin asparagus  </P> <P> 4 to 5 tablespoons butter  </P> <P> Boiling salted water  </P> <P> Parmesan cheese, preferably Parmigiano Reggiano, thinly shaved  </P> <P> Freshly ground pepper  </P> <P> Snap off tough ends of asparagus and trim stalks neatly. Peel stalks, if thick.  </P> <P> Melt butter in small pan or skillet over low heat. Cook until it begins to  color and take on nutty aroma. Skim off foam and discard.  </P> <P> Add asparagus to several quarts boiling salted water. Cook until bright green,  tender but still firm, about 3 minutes for thin asparagus and about 5 minutes  for thick. Remove asparagus from water and drain quickly on clean towel.  </P> <P> Arrange on platter. Drizzle melted butter over top and scatter with shavings of  Parmesan cheese. Dust lightly with pepper and serve. Makes 4 to 6 servings.  </P> <P> Note: If preparing ahead of time, either keep asparagus slightly underdone or  rinse under cold water to stop cooking. When ready to eat, drizzle butter and  shaved cheese over top. Place dish few inches under broiler and heat until  cheese is melted and lightly colored and asparagus is warm. Sprinkle lightly  with pepper and serve.  </P> <P>  It may seem unusual to grill asparagus, but it's very good this way. If  possible, use thick asparagus. The stalks need to cook very slowly over a  medium-low charcoal fire in order to be thoroughly cooked. The sauce of  hard-cooked eggs mixed with olive oil, vinegar, shallots and capers has a rich  velvety texture but isn't as rich as mayonnaise. This is a delicious dish that  would make a special first course for an outdoor spring meal.  </P> <P> GRILLED ASPARAGUS WITH EGG AND CAPER SAUCE  </P> <P> 2 pounds thick asparagus  </P> <P> Boiling salted water  </P> <P> Light olive oil  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> Few handfuls red mustard leaves, optional  </P> <P> Sauce  </P> <P> Break off tough ends of asparagus and trim ends even with knife. Parboil in  boiling salted water about 1 minute. Rinse to stop cooking and drain. Brush  stalks lightly with olive oil. Season to taste with salt.  </P> <P> Grill over slow fire, turning asparagus to cook evenly on all sides. (To test  for doneness, pierce stalks with sharp point of knife -- they should be firm  but knife should penetrate easily.)  </P> <P> Arrange grilled asparagus on platter or individual plates lined with red  mustard leaves. Ladle Sauce over all and serve. Makes 4 to 6 servings.  </P> <P> Sauce  </P> <P> 2 hard-cooked eggs  </P> <P> 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil  </P> <P> 2 to 3 tablespoons tarragon or Champagne vinegar  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons capers, rinsed  </P> <P> 1 large shallot, finely diced  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> Freshly ground pepper  </P> <P> Finely chopped chervil or parsley  </P> <P> Separate egg whites from yolks and chop finely. Combine eggs, oil, vinegar,  capers and shallot in bowl. Season to taste with salt, pepper and chervil. Toss  gently. Yolks and oil will gradually emulsify to give sauce body.  </P> <P>  Pink-colored onions and fine slivers of orange peel in the green sauce look  and taste like spring. Since the pickled onions take only a minute or two to  prepare, start with them if you haven't any on hand. They will have colored by  the time you're ready for them.  </P> <P>  This salad also makes a beautiful opening to a meal, or combined with some  dressed greens and perhaps some hard-cooked eggs it might be offered as a meal  in itself. The sauce can be made ahead of time, the orange juice and vinegar  added at the very end so that the greens remain bright and snappy. This sauce  is also good over grilled asparagus.  </P> <P> ASPARAGUS SALAD WITH GREEN SAUCE AND PICKLED ONIONS  </P> <P> 2 pounds thick or thin asparagus  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> Green Sauce  </P> <P> Reserved orange slivers from Green Sauce  </P> <P> Pickled Red Onion Rings  </P> <P> Chive blossoms, optional  </P> <P> Trim asparagus by snapping off tough ends. If asparagus is thick, peel stalks.  Bring several quarts water to boil, add salt to taste and asparagus and cook  until bright green, tender, but still little firm, about 3 minutes for thin  asparagus or 5 minutes for thick. Rinse asparagus briefly in cool water, then  place stalks on towel to drain.  </P> <P> Arrange asparagus on platter or individual serving plates. Ladle Green Sauce  over and garnish with reserved slivers of orange zest and Pickled Red Onion  Rings. Scatter few chive blossoms over all. Makes 4 first-course, 2 or 3  main-course servings.  </P> <P> Variation: Make salad with scented sesame or peanut oil, or with mixture of  walnut and olive oils. These flavors all go well with asparagus and harmonize  with orange.  </P> <P> Green Sauce  </P> <P> 1 orange  </P> <P> 1/4 cup chopped parsley, chervil or cilantro  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon capers, rinsed  </P> <P> Several tablespoons drained and finely diced Pickled Red Onion Rings  </P> <P> 4 to 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon mustard  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon fresh orange juice  </P> <P> White wine or champagne vinegar  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> Freshly ground pepper  </P> <P> Peel off zest from orange into long wide band. Cut into fine slivers and blanch  10 seconds. Reserve half for asparagus garnish. Place remaining half orange  slivers in bowl and combine with parsley, capers and Pickled Red Onion Rings.  Stir in oil, mustard, orange juice and vinegar. Season to taste with salt and  pepper.  </P> <P>  These pretty pink onions enliven salads of all kinds, sandwiches, cold pasta,  rice dishes and eggs. They're also great served alongside whatever else is on  the table. They'll keep well, refrigerated, a week or longer.  </P> <P> Pickled Red Onion Rings  </P> <P> 1 pound red onions  </P> <P> About 1 quart boiling water  </P> <P> 1 cup white wine vinegar  </P> <P> 1 cup cold water  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon sugar  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> 2 bay leaves  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon mixed peppercorns, slightly crushed  </P> <P> Few fresh marjoram or thyme sprigs, crushed, or few dashes dried  </P> <P> Slice red onions into thin rounds. Separate into rings and place in colander.  Pour boiling water over. Drain and place in bowl. Add wine vinegar, cold water,  sugar, salt, bay leaves, peppercorns and marjoram. Cover and refrigerate. Color  will begin to infuse in about 15 minutes. Drain few rings and finely dice  several tablespoons for Green Sauce. Reserve remaining for asparagus garnish.  Makes 2 cups.  </P> <P>  The success of such a simple dish depends entirely on the quality of the  ingredients, particularly the oil, which should be one of those peanut oils  that has the heady fragrance of freshly roasted peanuts. They are equivalent in  style to the best olive oils. For variety, try using cilantro instead of  parsley and garnish the asparagus with toasted black sesame seeds.  </P> <P> ASPARAGUS WITH PEA- NUT OIL, SHALLOTS AND PARSLEY  </P> <P> 2 pounds asparagus  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> 2 to 3 teaspoons peanut oil or to taste  </P> <P> 2 small shallots, finely diced  </P> <P> Finely chopped parsley, preferably Italian  </P> <P> Snap off tough ends of asparagus at point where they naturally break and trim  broken parts with knife. If asparagus is very thick, peel lower ends.  </P> <P> Bring large kettle of water to boil, add salt to taste and asparagus. Cook  until asparagus is bright green, tender but slightly firm, about 5 minutes,  depending on thickness of vegetable.  </P> <P> Remove asparagus from water and place on clean towel to drain briefly. In large  bowl combine asparagus with oil, shallots and parsley. Toss until mixed.  Arrange on platter and serve. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P>  This soup makes the most of new spring vegetables and herbs when they are  still a little scarce and not yet old hat. A couple of handfuls of sorrel,  melted with leeks, tastes wonderful with the rest of the vegetables, though it  will give the soup a slightly dingy, army-green color.  </P> <P>  To bring out the flavors of the vegetables, use the trimmings (leek greens,  asparagus stems and pea pods) to make a simple stock. It is cooked only 20  minutes so that the fresh taste of the vegetables is retained. If using frozen  peas, use some in the stock in place of the pea pods.  </P> <P> ASPARAGUS AND PEA SOUP  </P> <P> 1 pound thin asparagus, trimmed  </P> <P> 4 small leeks, white parts only (about 8 ounces when trimmed)  </P> <P> 1 pound fresh sweet pea pods  </P> <P> 1 quart water  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> 5 sprigs parsley  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons butter or margarine  </P> <P> 2 handfuls sorrel leaves, stems removed, leaves sliced, optional  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons flour  </P> <P> 2 cups milk  </P> <P> 1/2 to 1 cup half and half or whipping cream, optional  </P> <P> Garnish: several fresh basil or sorrel leaves, finely sliced; thinly sliced  rounds of chives and blossoms; or chopped chervil  </P> <P> Slice top third of asparagus stalks diagonally, leaving tips whole. (If using  thicker asparagus, cut tips in half, lengthwise.) Set aside. Coarsely chop  remaining two-thirds of stalks for stock. Select 3 or 4 inches of most tender  part of leek greens, rinse well and chop coarsely. Discard remaining.  </P> <P> Bring water to boil and add salt to taste. Blanch asparagus tips and sliced  stems until nearly tender, rinse in cold water and set aside.  </P> <P> Select couple of handfuls of best-looking pea pods, chop and reserve. Shuck  remaining pods and blanch peas in same boiling water (reserve shucked pods).  Rinse in cold water and set aside. (If peas are very small and tender, they  don't have to be blanched. Or use 1 1/2 cups frozen green peas).  </P> <P> Using same vegetable water, add asparagus stems, leek greens, shucked pea pods  and parsley sprigs. (If using frozen peas, add 1/3 cup of them as well.) Reduce  heat and simmer 20 minutes, then strain out vegetables and discard. Set stock  aside.  </P> <P> Thinly slice white part of leeks and rinse well. Melt butter in saucepan. Add  leeks along with any water clinging to them and 1/2 teaspoon salt. If using  sorrel, add now. Cook gently until leeks and sorrel have begun to soften, about  10 minutes, then stir in flour. Mix well, then whisk in strained stock. Bring  to boil, then simmer 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to make sure flour  doesn't stick to bottom. Puree soup in blender until smooth.  </P> <P> Transfer mixture to sauceppan. Add milk and partially cooked asparagus and peas  (or remaining 1 cup frozen peas). Cook just until soup is at serving  temperature. Adjust seasonings to taste. If necessary, thin soup with  additional stock or water, or stir in half and half to enrich. Season to taste  with pepper. Serve with fresh herbs scattered over top. Makes about 6 cups.  </P></p>

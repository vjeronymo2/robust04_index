			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Israel has invested $10 million over the last few  years to develop a nuclear power station, but the plan was  eventually shelved due to pressures exerted by European  environmentalists on the company intended to build the reactor.  This was divulged by Energy and Infrastructure Minister Moshe  Shahal, who added that the reactor slated for Israel was one of  several power stations developed by a Swiss company and the  German Government and $10 billion had already been invested in  the project. The environmentalists claim these power stations  are not safe. According to Shahal Israel will wait for a clean  and safe nuclear technology to be developed before it  establishes a nuclear power station. Mr. Shahal made these  remarks in the International Conference for Nuclear Sciences in  Tel Aviv.</p>

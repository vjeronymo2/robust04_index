			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "fy": "Ammunition `Probably Never Existed'"] </F>   [Text] Hamburg, 20 Feb -- The Federal Government  apparently does not intend to urge the Western Group of Russian  Armed Forces in Germany (WGT) or the Russian Government to  quickly clarify the whereabouts of 81,000 tonnes of ammunition,  which is still stored in the Russian ammunition depots in the  new laender, according to the Russian Armed Forces. Upon an  inquiry, the Foreign Ministry expressed the suspicion that the  ammunition in question "probably" never existed -- at least, it  was "probably not" stored in the depots of the Russian Army in  Germany. Also, it is considered completely "unlikely" that it  was buried on the vast training area. Questions as to whether  the government wants to know exactly what happened with the  ammunition have been answered evasively.    In the Finance Ministry, which is responsible for the  property returned by the Russians, the report gave rise to fears  that the new laender might refuse to assume responsibility for  the property. The laender do not want the risk of taking back  land contaminated by ammunition and, thus, be responsible for  the disposal of toxic waste. The leadership of the Defense  Ministry has issued a decree forbidding the passing on of  information to the public about problems resulting from the  ammunition and about violations of existing agreements that  might be discovered in the future. In addition, the Bundeswehr  is not allowed to approach the Western Group of Russian Armed  Forces -- as in the past -- if deviations from existing  agreements are noticed. This is the exclusive task of the  Foreign Ministry.</p>

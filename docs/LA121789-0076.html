			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FANTASY AND FOLKTALES;  </P> <P> A QUARTET OF 'KEEPERS'  </P> <P> Among this year's crop of children's fantasy books, there are, as usual, a few  that are well worth their price -- what we used to call "keepers." Choosing  books for children is a gamble, of course, for a book finally is a personal  thing; we cannot always explain why we are fond of one and not another. Still,  they can be a compliment to the recipient and as good a message of love as any  I know.  </P> <P> The best method is to pick a book that you know you would have liked when you  were a child. I was delighted by Melisande (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: $13.95;  unpaged), a story written almost a century ago by the durable British  children's author, E. Nesbit, with brand-new illustrations by British artist P.  J. Lynch. From the tale's beginning -- a princess is cursed with baldness at  her christening by the requisite bad fairy -- you know this will be an amusing  story, distinguished by Nesbit's tongue-in-cheek adherence to fairy-tale  conventions. After a bald childhood, Melisande finally is given a leftover wish  of her father's. She asks for hair that will grow an inch a day, and twice as  fast each time it's cut.  </P> <P> Disaster! In no time at all she is going to bed with her hair cut short and  waking up with a mile of it clogging her bedroom. The confusion and problems  all are cleared away by a wise prince, but he isn't so wise that he doesn't  make a few mistakes, for which you only like him better.  </P> <P> Another keeper is Ute Krause's Nora and the Great Bear (Dial Books: $11.95;  unpaged). I didn't think so at first, for the pictures are thin, colored  cartoons difficult to appreciate without the text. The story is quickly told:  Nora, a modern little girl, goes out into the snowy forest with the village  hunters to search for the Great Bear. They all carry weapons, but don't let  that put you off; this is more a pilgrimage than a hunting expedition.  </P> <P> No bear is found, so Nora, frustrated, goes off to look on her own without her  weapons, wandering so deep into the forest that she loses her way. Night falls  and she is beginning to despair when the Great Bear appears, huge and silent in  the moonlight, and leads her back to camp, whereupon he disappears, leaving no  tracks.  </P> <P> The story is special because of what it has to tell about the elusive realities  of nature and because of Krause's subtle style. Once understood, the story  gives her simple pictures a deeper meaning. Though neither beautiful nor  skillful, they convey the lonely cold of the forest and avoid trivializing the  bear, even though he is only a cartoon. Perhaps a more gifted illustrator would  have gone too far and spoiled the magic. At any rate, I found the two halves,  words and pictures, nicely wedded at last.  </P> <P> Another book-with-pictures that is not simply a picture book is Virginia  Hamilton's The Bells of Christmas (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: $16.95; 59 pp.)  illustrated by Lambert Davis. One of our very best children's writers, Hamilton  has managed over the years to write about African Americans with wisdom and  truth, never once shrill or accusatory, letting events and very human  characters make their own statements.  </P> <P> Here, she creates the story of a black family's Christmas out of her mother's  memories of Christmas holidays in Ohio around the turn of the last century.  This is a middle-class Christmas, full of love, security and comfort, and the  statement is clear: The media's heavy hand notwithstanding, this country always  has had a black middle class, prosperous and hard-working, living free of the  big-city ghettoes, with strong family ties and strong family values.  </P> <P> The story, as well as Lambert Davis' pictures, are calm and dignified, rooted  and serene; they take their time. Both reflect careful historical research in  their richness of detail and make a beautiful Christmas book for people of any  age.  </P> <P> Finally, I would like to recommend an odd and very entertaining work of  nonfiction that can help save parents from the wrath of their children when it  is discovered that, after all the hoopla, there isn't any Santa Claus. In Who  Is Santa Claus? The True Story Behind a Living Legend (Canongate Publishing  Limited, Edinburgh, distributed by David &amp; Charles, Inc., North Pomfret,  Vt: $22.95; 104 pp.). Robin Crichton explains how the legend developed and  spread from the historical 2nd-Century Nicholas to the present-day fat man in  red velour. Chrichton is a film maker, and this book came along after he made a  movie called "The Curious Case of Santa Claus," which the book's jacket claims  has been widely successful. I hadn't heard of it, but never mind; the book  itself is engrossing, well told and full of fascinating details covering the  Santa's evolution throughout the Western world.  </P> <P> The numerous pen-and-ink decorations by Margaret Nisbet, including maps, are  poorly reproduced and all too abundant, so the less said about them the better.  The book is not really for children, anyway; rather, parents should read and  absorb it in order to be ready to say, when the time comes, "Yes, Virginia,  there is a Santa Claus if you look at it this way: It all began nearly two  thousand years ago . . . " and I think children will understand that behind the  hokum there is something quite real that has answered and will go on answering  a widespread human need for a very long time.  </P></p>

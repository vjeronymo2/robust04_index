			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Economic Viewpoint: 'Peace, retrenchment and reform' ? It is with extreme reluctance that I write about the UK election campaign. For there is no party which could be identified with the Gladstonian Liberal slogan of 'Peace, Retrenchment and Reform' - of which Cobden was a more consistent exponent than Gladstone himself. Modern Conservatives would be embarrassed to be associated with the first word of the slogan and they are the last group to be associated with more than superficial institutional reform. Even on retrenchment, the very most one can say is that they are less bad than the others. There is not much retrenchment about adding to borrowing in the face of a Pounds 32bn (not Pounds 28bn) budget deficit, before even privatisation or council sales. The problem with today's Liberal Democrats is that they are not Gladstonian Liberals but are very clearly the heirs of the so-called New Liberals of the early 20th century, who saw it as their role to enlarge the functions of the state. Paddy Ashdown has been saddled with too much interventionist baggage. The case for supporting the Liberal Democrats lies not in their economic proposals, but in their constitutional ideas. Unlike many commentators who support proportional representation, I want to ensure inter alia, that nothing like Labour's tax and minimum wage proposals are ever enacted. And my main reservation is that some Scottish Liberal Democrat MPs are muttering about being prepared to support a minority Labour government in return for something less than full PR. That would be to repeat unforgivably the howler made by the Liberals in the 1960s and 1970s when they sustained minority Labour governments with nothing worthwhile in return. As for Labour's shadow Budget: words almost fail me. Lord Hailsham once wrote scathingly about the absurd importance attached to the party manifesto 'as a pronouncement from Sinai, with every jot and tittle, of that unreal and unreasonable document, reverenced as holy writ'. But worse than the manifesto is a so-called Budget drafted in opposition, which is certain to be quite out of date by the time any chancellor has to introduce a real Budget. Yet John Smith would feel honour bound to try to stick to it. The Treasury would not have any real secrets to impart to him other than the bad forecasts with which it has broken so many governments. But it is still possible that someone there, away from the heat of the campaign, has something worthwhile to tell a new chancellor, which has not yet penetrated to Mr Smith through the network of donnish supporters with Whitehall friends. But this ridiculous document would prevent him from paying any attention. The whole document is so tawdry. If you want to make it like a genuine Treasury Red Book, for goodness' sake carry the illusion through, and do not insert 'Abolition of the bribe to opt out of Serps'. As for the content of the proposals: a learned analysis is superfluous. The idea behind it can be very straightforwardly illustrated if the reader will play a little game. Take 10 piles of coins, or other counters, of different height. Then take some coins off the two largest piles and redistribute those taken away on to all the other eight piles. Ignore any effect of shifting the counters around on the aggregate of all the piles. Then he will certainly find that eight out of the 10 piles have gained - in this case usually trifling amounts. If that is what voters want, and they believe that all income belongs to the state to redistribute in this way, then they will deserve all they get. But even accepting these assumptions Labour has made a botch - maybe because the original calculations were done so long ago. The new top band of tax will be 59 per cent with employee national insurance contributions, and 70-80 per cent if properly calculated, to take in employers' contributions and indirect tax. The so-called right wing of the Labour party were so full of self-congratulation at the supposed moderation of this top rate that they did not look too closely at where it would bite. This will happen at what some Labour adviser presumably once thought was the extraordinarily high income of Pounds 40,000 per annum - which is, in fact, only 2 1/2 times average male annual earnings last year. It is indeed a good deal fiercer on middle-upper incomes than the scale that Mr Denis Healey, who boasted of making the pips squeak, left behind in 1978-79, although less steep at the very top. For what is all that to be used? For an untargeted, across-the-board increase for all pensioners and for all beneficiaries of child benefit, irrespective of means. And in addition for so-called public investment, much of which will flow to the public service unions, and for handouts to manufacturing companies for investment. Labour cannot rid itself of its zeal to bribe corporations but penalise the people who make them function. The real gainers will be the tax advisers. What made me turn off the television set, despite promising the editor to view it to the end, in a television debate with Norman Lamont and Alan Beith, was when John Smith erupted and said: 'Anyone would think there is something wicked or immoral in a minimum wage.' But there is something immoral in some government authority interposing its clumsy know-best ukase between a willing seller of labour and a willing buyer. There are all kinds of situations, undreamed of in Social Charter philosophy, when such bargains are in the best interests of the most disadvantaged people for whom the left-wing parties are supposed to stand. And please do not tell me about boys going up chimneys in the industrial revolution. We are talking about agreements between consenting adults, as the real Gladstonian Liberals pointed out at the time of the Factory Acts legislation. I nearly switched off the set earlier when the shadow chancellor was using arguments such as '10 out of 12 European countries do X'. Has he not heard the talmudic saying about not following a majority to commit a folly? Nevertheless, I am not entirely sorry for the mess into which Conservative ministers have got themselves. When asked what he was doing about the recession, Norman Lamont gave a purely unreconstructed Keynesian answer about the amount of his spending increases and tax cuts - despite the fact that his own Budget speech repudiated the idea of giving the economy a kick-start; and it was this blatant contradiction that irked me far more than the policy. The chancellor would have been much better off to have accepted some Treasury advice that no net tax reliefs were advisable this year instead of compromising on a moderate bribe. The lower-rate tax threshold is the epitome of the second rate - superficially attractive, but deeply flawed. Surely somebody warned Mr Lamont that raising tax thresholds was a much more effective way of helping the least well-off taxpayers, and that Labour could easily trump him by offering to do just that? But what irritated me most was the lack of all historical sense. The chancellor did not acknowledge that Denis Healey had previously inserted a lower band in the 1978 Budget at a very late stage, at the behest of the TUC, which Sir Geoffrey Howe had abolished in 1980. Nor did Neil Kinnock remind him of these awkward facts, despite the measure having leaked into one of the popular dailies. The main reason of which I can think for the utter lack of style or distinction with which the election is being fought is the predominance of public relations and advertising executives, who are supposed to be the experts on just such things, but are too tunnel-visioned to see beyond their 'research'. * * * Why have I not stuck to my last and written about policies to cure recession? Because none of the parties has the least contribution to offer. A sizeable reduction in interest rates will have to wait until the Bundesbank decides that inflationary pressures in Germany have subsided sufficiently for it to take the lead. Meanwhile the possibility of higher interest rates under Labour to offset foreign exchange market distrust, the blow to confidence among spenders in the south-east and the human deterrent to inward investment risk delaying recovery. Is the risk worth it?</p>

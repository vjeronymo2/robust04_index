			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Nationwide Anglia cuts mortgage rate by 0.7 points NATIONWIDE Anglia, Britain's second largest building society, surprised the mortgage market yesterday by announcing it will cut its lending rates by 0.7 percentage points. For larger loans, Nationwide's rates will be up to 0.75 points lower than the current bank base rate of 12 per cent. Nationwide's move coincided with a veiled warning against early cuts in interest rates from Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England. Many of Nationwide's rival lenders said this was a reasonable view. None of them followed suit with lower rates. Nationwide and most other UK mortgage lenders last announced reductions in their rates after the most recent half-point cut in base rates, less than a month ago. However, Mr John Hutchinson, Nationwide's retail operations director, said the cuts announced yesterday were not related to the society's view on base rates. He said it was only a 'convention' to wait for base rate cuts before reducing mortgage rates. Nationwide was moving now because political uncertainty had been reduced and the exchange rate appeared to be stable, he added. The cut applies to all mortgages and takes effect on May 11 for new borrowers and on July 1 for existing borrowers. Nationwide did not specify by how much it planned to reduce rates for savers. Mr Hutchinson said: 'Savers' rates will not have a cut until around the time when we change the rates for existing borrowers. We have some flexibility because we are wholly funded by retail savers.' Nationwide's competitors drew attention to the two months existing borrowers will have to wait for a reduction, and the likely cuts in rates for savers. Others suggested that Nationwide was seeking to increase its market share. Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest mortgage lender, said it would 'remain competitive' but was not planning an immediate decision. Woolwich, the third biggest building society, said it would not reduce its mortgage rate until base rates fell again. It described Nationwide's move as a 'marketing ploy'. Abbey National said it had 'no intention' of following Nationwide. It said: 'We think they are gambling on a further Bank of England base rate cut. There's absolutely no indication at the moment that this is likely to happen.' Mr Leigh-Pemberton appeared to support this view. In a speech at the University of Exeter strongly attacking inflation he suggested that next week's fall in the year-on-year increase in the retail prices index to about 6.2 per cent would not be enough to justify a fifth cut in interest rates since mid-February. Nationwide's new rates will be 12.25 per cent for mortgages up to Pounds 60,000, 11.75 per cent up to Pounds 120,000 and 11.25 per cent for larger loans. By comparison, Abbey National charges 12.85 per cent for loans under Pounds 60,000, 12.15 per cent for loans up to Pounds 100,000, and 11.95 per cent for larger loans. Woolwich offers 12.15 per cent (12.9 per cent for loans under Pounds 60,000), with an offer of 11.65 per cent for first-time buyers. Citibank offers 11.45 per cent for all loans from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 150,000, and thus undercuts Nationwide for smaller mortgages. Governor warns, Page 8 US economy, Page 20</p>

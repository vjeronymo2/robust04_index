			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Turnround of Pounds 1.66m at Moran Moran Holdings, the USM-quoted provider of management, financial and tea agency services, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.39m for the year to June 30 against losses of Pounds 274,000. The results reflected the group's reorganisation, said Mr Peter Theobald, chairman. Mr Theobald added that the directors were negotiating an acquisition that would make a 'significant contribution' to the surface forwarding division's prospects. Turnover of continuing operations rose to Pounds 49m (Pounds 45.9m). Earnings per share emerged at 6.74p (16.64p loss) and steps were being taken to eliminate the deficit on the profit and loss account, Mr Theobald said, so that dividend payments could be resumed. The shares closed 8p higher at 62p.</p>

IZVESTIYA quotes the Russian President as saying at a press  conference on the resutls of his visit to Tbilisi that "the  goals of Russian policy are clear and specific: We should have  not only friendly relations with Georgia but also maintain  relations of allies."    The newspaper points out that "the principal event during  the  visit was the signing of a treaty of friendship,  goodneighbourliness and cooperation as well as a number of  documents on economic relations."    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on Boris Yeltsin's visit to  Georgia:    In an article headlined "The Tbilisi Treaty: What It Gives  to  Russia and the Peoples of the Caucasus", the newspaper writes  that due to fellows like an unnamed soldier from among the  Russian peacekeeping force in South Ossetia, whose picture was  taken by the newspaper's correspondent (the photograph is on the  newspaper's front page), "Ossetian and Georgian farmers for the  first time in years of sanguinary confrontation have got an  opportunity to go about their primary business in the land of  their forefathers".    Without the Russian soldier-peacemaker, it is impossible to  undo the knot of Caucasian contradictions, the newspaper added.    TRUD and RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA point to a great importance of  the  Russian-Georgian treaty for the two countries.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA recalls that the Russian-Georgian  agreements signed are subject to ratification by the  parliaments. "There will probably be a lot of opponents of the  accords" in the top legislatures of both Russia and Georgia,"  the newspaper writes, pointing out that although Moscow  recognises Georgia's territorial integrity, it nevertheless  "urges Tbilisi to determine the political status of Abkhazia and  South Ossetia".    PRAVDA takes a rather sceptical view of the results of Boris  Yeltsin's visit to Georgia. It points out that although Georgia  did sign a treaty with Moscow, it is being reported from Sukhumi  that "Georgian armed detachments already penetrate Abkhazia's  Gali district".    Newspapers feature photographs of the crew of the U.S. space  shuttle Discovery, with Russian cosmonaut Sergey Krikalev among  them. The shuttle blasted off into space on Thursday.    IZVESTIYA on an instruction issued by the chief of staff of  the Russian Government that from now on only a representative of  ROSSIISKAYA GAZETA will be allowed to be present at cabinet  meetings:    "The closed doors, behind which the government policy will  be  apparently fashioned from now on, is the most hopeless way to  avoid public scrutiny of the work of the cabinet of ministers".    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA carries a two-page article by academicians  Leonid Abalkin, Nikolay Petrakov and Stanislav Shatalin, who  offer a new, milder "economic reform concept".    Touching upon Russia's economic and social problems, they  write in particular that "the country has found itself before a  dangerous threshold. By crossing it, Russia runs the risk of  losing forever a chance for revival as a great power".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on the academicians' economic  programme.    The newspaper maintains that the programme virtually  resembles the one suggested by Russian Liberal Democratic Party  leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy during his election campaign.    "The difference is that while Zhirinovskiy can simply speak  about the problems and promise that they would be resolved  instantaneously, the government would have to tackle them".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Anatoliy  Dolgolaptev, member of the Federation Council, who comes out in  favour of changing Russia's economic and geopolitical status in  the world, pointing out that this is much more important than  the vociferous political tussle at the top which diverts the  attention of society.</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Arts: Suggestion and dream - The work of Zoran Music and Ricardo Cinalli THERE IS a usually a great deal of contemporary foreign art on show in London, but unless it conforms to current critical orthodoxy, we do not always give it the attention it deserves. Zoran Music is now 81. He was born in Slovenia, studied in Zagreb and then Madrid, returning to Dalmatia at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. In 1944 he was arrested by the Gestapo and sent to Dachau. These many years past he has divided his time between Paris and Venice and was indeed accorded an Omaggio, a special showing at the Venice Biennale of 1984. But occasional shows apart, he remains as shadowy and fugitive in his life as in his art, his reputation more the creature of private enthusiasm than of general acclaim - his work held in the Sainsbury Collection, for example, is currently on show at the University of East Anglia at Norwich. His manner of working is slight and sketchy, the image tentative in its statement, hinted at, teased out of the gentle flurry of a few deceptively rough, loose marks. It is an art not of any precise description, but of suggestion, imaginative association, atmosphere, experience to recognise and share. It may be a landscape, the dark, rich interior of a cathedral, a Venetian alley, a seated figure: always the essential feeling is the same, of the work left off, the sentence unsaid yet understood, the thought left hanging in the air. The works at Gimpel, drawings and paintings, fall into two groups: the recent figures, the self-portraits and studies of the artist's wife, with examples of earlier subjects such as the cathedral interiors; and works from the Dachau series of the early 1970s which, with prescient pessimism, he entitled 'We are not the last'. It had taken Music 25 years to address his experiences at Dachau directly in his art. There is a painting here, of about that time, of a fallen bush or tree, a scrubby drawing in paint on the unprimed canvas, with the branches or tendrils falling out untidily towards the viewer. And across the room we find the same understated, formal composition, and the same untidy sprawl of limbs, in the pile of corpses that is the lasting image and memorial of the concentration camp. Ricardo Cinalli is a young Italian painter with two current shows of distinct groups of work. The series of large pastels on tissue paper, that he calls his 'Premonitions', on which he has been working since 1985, is at the Accademia Italiana; and at Long &amp; Ryle is his recent 'Dreams' series, in tempera on board. He is a figurative artist of remarkable technical ambition, his pastel drawings worked on a truly architectural scale, despite the natural flimsiness of the tissue as support and the delicacy of the medium. In imagery too, ambition is very much the word, for he takes upon himself the unforgiving test of the figure composition tradition, which in many respects he carries off admirably. There is great energy to these works, remarkable technical control in the drawing, and much fun and wit in the particular content. His nude figures writhe and twist and fall about in their unspecific, sub-classical Arcady, into which at any moment a monstrous foot might fall, to squash them all. But the technical command is itself a limitation, for to command so extensive a surface with an essentially graphic technique, Cinalli has had to resort to a particular and consistent mark that all too soon obtrudes as a quality in itself - mannered and insistent, imposing its decorative visual texture across the entire work. As decorative architectural pieces, set at a distance, they serve well enough. With the small tempera 'Dreams', on the other hand, he perversely takes more risks. They are not altogether successful, but they are more interesting, albeit quirky and inconsistent, often awkward and improbable in the drawing, studies for further experiment and development. They too take their start in the Renaissance composition tradition, in this case images and parables of imprisoned saints and sinners, with angels arriving miraculously to set them free - or less miraculously to be tempted in their turn. But they look also to the nearer tradition, to the metaphysical strain in early 20th century Italian painting, to de Chirico, Savinio, Carra and Sironi. There is more going on and, we must hope, even more to come. Zoran Music: Gimpel Fils, 30 Davies Street W1, until March 27. Ricardo Cinalli: Accademia Italiana, 24 Rutland Gate SW7, until March 14 and at Long &amp; Ryle, 4 John Islip Street SW1, until March 19</p>

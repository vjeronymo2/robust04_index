			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Bjarne Nitovuori report: "EU Referendum To Be Held in </F> November?"]    [Excerpt] The referendum on Finland's EU [European Union]  membership could be arranged for 13 November, Father's Day --  the same day that Sweden is arranging its referendum.    This idea surfaced in an interview with Prime Minister Esko  Aho (Center Party) in Center Party newspaper LALLI yesterday.    It was not Aho but the interviewer who brought up the idea,  and Aho replied that this is an alternative that has not been  ruled out.    "I have argued for an earlier date. Here I have been  thinking chiefly about September, but now the delay with the  decisions means that serious consideration is also being given  to a later date."    However, according to Aho, 13 November is the latest  possible  date, otherwise we will be much too close to the Eduskunta  election. This takes place in March next year.    Aho also thinks that a shared referendum day for Finland and  Sweden -- "and why not Norway too" -- would underline the fact  that the Nordic countries are in the same position and their  decisions are interdependent.    According to Aho, this would also have the positive effect  of  ruling out the domino effect -- so that the referendum result in  one country will not influence public opinion in another where  the referendum is held at a later date.    Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto (Center Party) yesterday  told agricultural journalists that he would prefer a referendum  after the Swedish poll -- that is, after a date which, according  to Aho, is the "last possible date."

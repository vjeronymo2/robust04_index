			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Czech brewer plans modernisation PLZENSKE Pivovary, the Czech brewer which makes Pilsner Urquell beer, said yesterday that it would shortly announce a strategy for modernisation and marketing along with financing plans. Mr Mario Junek, chief financial officer, said Plzen had invested heavily to raise production capacity over the past three years to compete with European breweries, but it had been hit by delays in completing its privatisation, and declining export sales. Mr Junek firmly denied reports that the company was facing bankruptcy. 'We have made large investments to improve technology and quality. Now we are waiting for a decision on (completing) privatisation. 'We have many possibilities to finance our modernisation. It would be no problem raising money on the international capital markets,' Mr Junek said. The company was 67 per cent privatised last year in the first wave of voucher privatisation, with the bulk of the shares being taken by investment funds. Prazdroj, the largest of Plzen's four breweries, was not included in the privatisation. Heineken, the Dutch brewer, has said it is interested in co-operation with the Czech brewer.</p>

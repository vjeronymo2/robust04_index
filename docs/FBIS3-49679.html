			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Irena Majce] </F>   [Text] Last night's optimistic and somewhat mysterious  statement by Croatian Economic Minister Nadan Vidosevic, at  Otocec, that problems regarding the nuclear power plant will be  solved in a few days and that Croatia would get electricity in  conformity with the technical possibilities of the power plant,  was finally cleared up by today's statement by the main Croatian  duty official at Krsko, Jakov Sinovcic. Sinovcic said, among  other things, the following:    [Begin Sinovcic recording in Serbo-Croatian] Whatever is  produced at any moment, the Croatian electricity board is going  to take 50 percent of. [end recording]    Therefore, Croatia plans to help itself from the system,  irrespective of the Slovene Government bans. This is  technically possible, but since our duty officers can register  such unauthorized use, it is obvious that this will be in  violation of the agreed exchange.</p>

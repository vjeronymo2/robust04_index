			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Scientific side behind drop at FII Despite an improved second half, FII Group, maker and distributor of footwear and scientific and medical equipment, reported a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.2m to Pounds 2.55m in the year ended May 31. The result was after exceptional items of Pounds 1.32m (Pounds 550,000) relating to product recall costs, losses on cancellation of a development contract and rationalisation costs. Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 83m (Pounds 82m) which Mr Monty Sumray, the chairman, said was despite setbacks in the scientific and technical division where sales fell to Pounds 8.45m (Pounds 11.3m). Rationalisation and investment programmes were continuing in the division which reported losses of Pounds 1.47m (Pounds 89,000). In footwear, sales rose to a record Pounds 74.6m (Pounds 70.6m) although operating profits slipped to Pounds 3.49m (Pounds 4.93m). Earnings per share fell from 22.7p to 10.9p but the dividend is maintained at 14.75p with an unchanged final of 8.75p.</p>

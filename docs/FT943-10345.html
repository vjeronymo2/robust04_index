			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Chinese pirates fail to take Mickey out of Disney With a wave of his magic wand, and the help of his friends, the lawyers, Mickey Mouse won a landmark victory over copyright pirates in China, when a Beijing court ruled that his image could not be used without the US Walt Disney entertainment group's permission. The year-long lawsuit is the first case to be brought against Chinese publishers by a US company, according to the state-run Guangming Daily. Disney said last night: 'We're delighted. It shows that China is responding to the interests of the west in protecting intellectual copyrights.' The ruling, revealed yesterday, was welcomed by other companies which are probing the lucrative Chinese markets. Mr Art Barron, chairman of Time Warner International, a division of the US entertainment group, said: 'This ruling should be good for everyone in the entertainment industry. The problem is who enforces it, but it's a good start.' China has vowed to crack down on piracy as part of its attempts to gain support for its return to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which it left more than 40 years ago. The US has claimed that piracy is costing foreign companies billions of dollars. The recently formed intellectual property chamber of the Beijing People's Intermediate Court ruled on Wednesday that the Beijing Children's Publishing Press, Beijing Publishing Press and New China Book Store Distribution Centre had pirated Disney characters in a range of children's books. The books, which were based on animated feature films, duplicated some of Disney's most famous and valuable cartoon characters, including Mickey Mouse, Cinderella, Peter Pan and Snow White. According to Chinese newspapers, the defendants argued that they had acted legally under a licence which they said was obtained from a company in Hong Kong. Mr Chuck Champlin, communications director for Disney Consumer Products, speaking from the company's headquarters in Burbank, California, said last night that the group had asked the court to be recompensed for lost revenues. Disney has about 70 boutique stalls in China's mushrooming department stores. But it has been deterred from wider distribution of its character goods, including their use on mugs, clothes and videos, by the extent of piracy of Disney images, according to executives.

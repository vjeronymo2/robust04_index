			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ECONOMY INDICATORS FOR MARCH RISE 0.9%;  </P> <P> GROWTH: ECONOMISTS FEAR SLOWDOWN BECAUSE RISE IN INFLATION ISN'T ENOUGH TO  ENCOURAGE FED TO LOWER INTEREST RATES.  </P> <P> The government's chief economic forecasting gauge rose 0.9% in March, its  biggest increase in nearly two years, the government said today.  </P> <P> The gain in the index of leading economic indicators, designed to forecast  economic activity six to nine months in the future, means the gauge nearly  regained the 1% loss it suffered in February.  </P> <P> It was the steepest increase since a 1.6% gain in June, 1988. Before dropping  in February, the index had risen three straight months.  </P> <P> But while the gauge was up in March, some analysts were concerned that rising  inflation, if it does not force the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates,  certainly will not encourage the central bank to lower them.  </P> <P> High rates would slow further the already sluggish construction, auto and  manufacturing sectors of the economy.  </P> <P> "We're looking for a slowdown in activity in the second and third quarters due  primarily to high interest rates," said Paul Getman, an economist with Regional  Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa.  </P> <P> "We'll have an extremely sluggish construction sector and lackluster activity  elsewhere, including business investment, which has been pretty good," he  added.  </P> <P> Indeed, construction, which relies on low-cost loans, slowed even before the  start of the second quarter. The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that  construction spending dropped 1.4% in March, its steepest decline in more than  a year.  </P> <P> Six of the 11 forward-looking statistics contributed to the increase in today's  leading indicators, led by a gain in new plant and equipment orders.  </P> <P> Other positives were an increase in the price of raw materials, an increase in  orders for consumer goods, higher stock prices, slower business delivery times  and a drop in weekly unemployment claims.  </P> <P> Negatives included a decrease in building permits, a decline in the backlog of  manufacturers' unfilled orders and a drop in the money supply.  </P> <P> Two of the components were unchanged: the average workweek and an index  measuring consumer confidence.  </P> <P> Although many analysts see slow growth ahead, there is virtual unanimity that  the economy has avoided a recession.  </P> <P> "The business cycle trough is pretty much behind us," contended Kermit Baker,  director of economics at Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass. "Any risk of  recession pretty much ended with the first-quarter (GNP) report. You're not  going to hear too many recession forecasts cropping up over the next few  months."  </P> <P> The first-quarter gross national product -- the nation's total output of goods  and services -- rose 2.1%, compared to a 3% increase for all of 1989, according  to a Commerce Department report last week.  </P> <P> That was much stronger growth than many economists had predicted as the year  began. At that time, many forecast GNP growth would be little improved from the  fourth quarter's 1.1% rate, the slowest in three years. Some even said the  economy could topple into a recession.  </P> <P> But despite the surprising strength, the report also contained bad news on the  inflation front -- a 6.5% annual rate, the steepest increase since 1981 and up  sharply from the 4.5% in 1989.  </P></p>

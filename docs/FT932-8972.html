			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Eton's oarsmen land in a hole: The latest development in a dispute splitting the community ETON, Britain's most famous school, wants planning consent to quarry 3.5m tons of gravel and fill the resulting hole with water. The college calculates this would take eight years; the result would be something - described variously as a rowing lake, course or trench two kilometres long, half a kilometre wide and covering more than 11 acres. All this would take place on agricultural land at Dorney; although owned by the college, it is inside London's green belt, within which development is supposed to take place only under the strictest controls, if at all. The planning application was turned down but an appeal opened on Wednesday this week. It is being heard by an inspector from the department of the environment. Should it succeed, the effect on the lives of local residents would be serious. For eight years, they would have to endure noise, dust and fumes from the extra traffic. Internal roads would have to be built. In certain instances, paths, bridleways and tracks, used for years by residents and visitors for recreational purposes, would be removed. Eton was aggrieved by the refusal of planning consent. For one thing, it had been at pains to make clear that the new lake would be shared with other, less-privileged schools. For another, it believed Eton boys would be more relaxed and safer rowing up and down this artificial course instead of sharing the river Thames with its busy boating world. What came as the biggest shock, however, was the whisper that Etonians themselves were having second thoughts about the project. Would things be the same, they asked, without the glamour of the river and the traditions built on it? Would the famous Eton Boating Song sound anywhere near the same as schoolboy rowers toiled up and down a monotonous off-Thames course? Even more to the point, the doubters pointed to the school's great liberal traditions, of which pressurisation was never a part. This argument gained ground increasingly as more and more glossy pamphlets favouring the project were produced, along with letters from the headmaster to parents and entries of encouragement in the Old Etonian Association journal. There were designer mock-ups and artists' impressions - even the promise of a nature reserve (referred-to, trendily, as a Nature Conservation Area). Further appeals were made. The college's bursar wrote a letter that started: 'Dear Friends of Rowing.' There was a circular letter from the chairman of the Henley royal regatta addressed to 'Member of the regatta enclosure.' And there was a rallying call to past and present members of the Eton Viking rowing club. Recently, though, I asked a senior boy at Eton what he made of the proposal. 'A waste of money,' he replied, with commendable brevity. With the planning refusal on the table, Eton had two choices: either to accept it with regret and dignity - or to appeal. In the latter case, though, more issues were at stake than a mere 'yes' or 'no.' In particular, there was the delicate issue of Eton College coming into direct and public confrontation with a significant number of 'ordinary' people opposed to the project. Locals put it more bluntly. Which, they asked, came first: a sport at Eton which had already achieved great success using existing facilities on the Thames, or the quality of life for residents in the way of a powerful and prestigious institution? This, then, was the situation the college's provost and fellows faced after the planning refusal. The fellows are an august body of men with wide fields of interest and accomplishment. Among them is old Etonian Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. The decision was made to fight and mount a carefully-prepared counter-attack. Specialists were retained and, on Wednesday, battle was joined. The result is expected to be known in about five weeks. Meanwhile, Eton will be en fete as usual on the fourth of June. Where? On the River Thames, of course.</p>

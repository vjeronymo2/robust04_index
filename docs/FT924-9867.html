			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (10): Spirit of independence  -The post-Soviet risks and opportunities to end its dependence on hard currency-consuming food imports and boost its production of hard currency-earning energy exports. But doing either means fundamental changes to the mentality of people brought up on the theory that nature is a free gift, not merely to be used but to be violently assaulted. Thanks to such thinking the former Soviet Union became the unchallenged world leader at turning precious natural resources into stinking ecological disaster areas. That recent past, and lingering, deep seated suspicion of the intentions and working methods of western oilmen, is the main obstacle to large scale western investment without which both the oil and gas industry is doomed to further decay. Most existing Russian oil regions have been so irrationally and badly developed that the cost of modernising them and cleaning up the environmental damage often exceeds the real market value of the oil recoverable. The main western companies interested in such areas are those like Canadian Fracmaster and others who specialise in delivering spare parts and working repairs, and those suppliers of equipment assured of hard currency payment. However, with more than 27,000 wells idle in the Tyumen oil province of western Siberia alone due to shortage of the most basic spare parts and repair kits, there is enormous potential for business and for rapid productivity gains from relatively small but timely inputs. Any rational Russian oil policy would put energy conservation, war on waste and getting existing facilities up and running at the top of the priority list. It is difficult to educate oil workers and managers in the need for rigorous cost controls and ecological precautions, however, while prices remain well below world levels and their own living and working conditions are so bad. Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian deputy prime minister responsible for energy policy, suggested last month that prices would be allowed to rise by stages to world levels by the end of 1993, under state control. This followed a decree by President Boris Yeltsin which doubled the price of crude oil in mid-September to 20,000 roubles (Dollars 20) a tonne, still a fraction of the world price. The delayed move towards world pricing levels keeps the industry deprived of the resources it needs. At the same time what looked earlier this year like promising moves towards a genuine devolution of power and responsibility to smaller operating companies is now in question again as the recentralisers and their KGB friends retake the initiative. Given the overall deterioration in economic conditions, and the natural attraction of the oil and gas industry to the parasites of the former Soviet system, it will be an uphill struggle for years, to create a modern industry. Most western experts, and the current reformist Russian government, believe that the industry needs to be privatised as soon as possible if it is to acquire the flexibility and operational efficiency required to make good local partners. Mr Alexander Samusev, the deputy fuel and energy minister, recently warned that delay in launching such structural reforms would only increase the industry's decline. Oil output is expected to drop to between 390m-395m tonnes this year, around 8m barrels a day, from 460m tonnes a year in 1991 and 624m tonnes at its peak in 1988. while The gas industry is also hard pressed to maintain output at current levels. Mr Samusev said the government was working on plans to restructure the industry by creating a handful of powerful, vertically integrated companies responsible for refining and marketing their own crude and establishing joint ventures with foreign companies. Western oil companies are used to working in difficult places and are looking hard to diversify sources of supply and improve their reserves in the 21st century. They have no doubts about the vast oil and gas potential of Russia and several of the other republics. What they want is a framework which would secure acceptable terms, which is to say terms similar to those in the rest of the world, for participation above all in greenfield ventures in which they can be involved from the very beginning. A succinct rundown of the basic requirements demanded by western companies and financial institutions before serious business can be done is contained in a report issued by the World Bank in August after a study of the West Siberian oil industry. With a possible Dollars 870m of funding in the balance the Bank made clear that investment would only be forthcoming if: oil prices were raised to world levels within 24 months. taxes on the oil extraction sector were both cut and restructured. specific individuals responsible for reforming the industry were clearly identified. oil industry legislation were drawn up and adopted. machinery for both providing credit and monitoring its use were put in place. Significantly the need to create world-type conditions to attract investors has been accepted most whole-heartedly by those parts of the former Soviet Union which were formerly Russia's subservient colonies, such as Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. Freed from Moscow's heavy hand the leaders of these newly independent republics have taken the decisions needed by western businessmen before agreeing to commit billions of dollars to long term projects. Chevron's Dollars 2.5bn agreement with Kazakhstan to develop the huge potential of the Tengiz oil field, the Pounds 3.1bn British Gas, Agip and Statoil contract to explore and develop the 20 trillion cubic metre Karachaganak gas field, and the Dollars 1.7bn deal with United BMB of Turkey to develop four oil fields and build four gas fired power stations at Aktyubinsk are clear indicators that this policy is paying off. Kazakhstan is set to become a significant 21st century energy supplier. Several other projects are also under discussion while elsewhere in the region the Stan Cornelius Consortium of US investors recently reached agreement to develop the 800m barrel Mingbulak oil deposit in Uzbekistan; and Amoco, together with Unocal and McDermott, has made a joint venture with Azerbaijan's Kaspmorenefetegaz to develop the offshore Azeri field in the Caspian sea. These are just a few of the dozens, possibly hundreds of deals of all shapes and sizes currently under discussion all across this vast area from the Arctic Ocean to Sakhalin Island. It is not easy getting oil and gas out of the ground and safely to market from anywhere in this huge area. But for those involved and those pondering the plunge, the break up of the former Soviet Union has provided some of the most exciting oil and gas prospects in the world.</p>

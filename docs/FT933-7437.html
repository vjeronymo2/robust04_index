			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Abandoning Thorp nuclear plant would cost UK jobs, trade and investment Sir, Contrary to the impression given by your leader of August 5 ('Nuclear decision') and letters in your August 12 edition, there will be no winners if the Thorp nuclear waste processing plant is cancelled but only losers, notably the Treasury, the UK's reputation as an international trading nation and responsible haven for inward investment, and the west Cumbrian economy. Greenpeace attacked Thorp on environmental grounds. Yet after two years of scrutinising the plant and considering voluminous representations, the Pollution Inspectorate and the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food concluded: 'The provisions of the draft authorisations (covering Thorp) would effectively protect human health, the safety of the food chain and the environment generally.' Greenpeace now claims that our customers would like to withdraw from their contracts. This is equally unfounded. Statements of support from Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear and from our European customers have been published in the documents circulated by the Department of the Environment. A full-page advertisement appeared in the FT on June 23 headed 'The Japanese utility companies want Thorp'. If the Japanese utilities had turned against reprocessing, why would they be constructing their own reprocessing plant in Japan? Thorp's cancellation would also gravely damage our position as an international trading nation. Consider the likely impact on our trade and inward investment projects with Japan and Europe if we had to inform the Japanese and European utilities that their Pounds 1.9bn investment in Thorp would be written off. The Friends of the Earth alternative - apparently endorsed by your leader - of turning west Cumbria into an international nuclear spent-fuel store would represent a staggering U-turn in Friends of the Earth and government policy, and is fundamentally flawed. Our customers want their recycled fuel back. Some would almost certainly transfer their business to France if the UK cancelled Thorp. The idea that this U-turn would solve Cumbria's employment problems is naive. Thorp will support more than 3,000 jobs in west Cumbria and about 6,000 in the UK. These are long-term manufacturing-related jobs, many of them highly skilled. By contrast, the jobs involved in knocking down Thorp would be short-term. No more than 100 jobs would be supported by dry storage. Your suggestion that Thorp be dismantled and transported to Japan is even more naive, as any first-year engineering student will know. The economic case for Thorp is very robust. The Treasury would have killed Thorp during the past 12 months if it had not been convinced of our economic case and of the economic folly of those who wish to turn Thorp into Europe's largest white elephant.

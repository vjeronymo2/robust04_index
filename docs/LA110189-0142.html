			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ABORTION FOE PICKED AS SURGEON GENERAL;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON: PRESIDENT BUSH HAS NOMINATED DR. ANTONIA NOVELLO FOR THE POST  VACATED BY THE OUTSPOKEN C. EVERETT KOOP.  </P> <P> President Bush today announced his selection of Dr. Antonia Novello, an  abortion opponent who is deputy director of the government's National Institute  of Child Health, to be surgeon general. She would be the first woman to hold  the post.  </P> <P> If confirmed by the Senate, she would succeed C. Everett Koop, the outspoken  pediatric surgeon who became perhaps the best known figure in American medicine  for his outspoken opposition to smoking and his support for using condoms to  prevent the spread of AIDS.  </P> <P> Koop stepped down in September after seven years as the nation's chief public  health officer.  </P> <P> A native of Puerto Rico, Novello, 45, is a pediatric kidney specialist.  </P> <P> She graduated from the University of Puerto Rico and in 1970 from the  university's medical school in the top 5% of her class.  </P> <P> Novello joined the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in  April, 1986. She is its deputy director as well as coordinator for AIDS  research.  </P> <P> She has headed a national task force investigating the problems of children  with AIDS.  </P> <P> Anti-abortion groups had closely monitored the process of filling the surgeon  general's post.  </P> <P> Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Novello shares Bush's  anti-abortion views -- opposition to abortions except to protect the life of  the mother or in cases of rape or incest and opposition to federal funding of  abortions for poor women except when the mother's life is in danger.  </P> <P> "Anybody who comes into a policy-making position is asked if they can support  our policy," Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> Novello was one of a number of women recommended for the job by President  Bush's personal physician, Burton J. Lee III, who said he withdrew himself from  consideration for the job because of his pro-choice views on abortion.  </P> <P> Others considered for the nation's top health officer were ruled out or ruled  themselves out because of different views on abortion.  </P> <P> Novello worked for Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) in 1982-83, when he was  chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.  </P> <P> She is married to a psychiatrist, Dr. Joe Novello, who hosted a talk show on a  Washington radio station offering advice for troubled adolescents. Her  brother-in-law is Don Novello, the comedian better known as "Father Guido  Sarducci."  </P></p>

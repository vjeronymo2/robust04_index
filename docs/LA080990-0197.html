			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Progress on New Jetliner: McDonnell Douglas has advanced its proposed MD-12X  jetliner in recent weeks by beginning marketing discussions with airlines, the  company said. The program, which has been in development since last year, is  still in its preliminary stages and McDonnell has not been authorized by its  board to formally offer the aircraft for sale to customers. The MD-12X is based  on the MD-11 and DC-10 jetliners, but it would be stretched and fitted with a  new wing, enabling it to carry 80 to 180 more passengers than the 293 now  carried by the MD-11.  </P></p>

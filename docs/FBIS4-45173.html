On the evening of 23 May,  the president of the court disclosed a letter suggesting the  dangers of a presidential dictatorship. Darcy Quinn has this  report:    Quinn: Constitutional Court President Jorge Arango  began his reply to President Gaviria by reminding him of certain  basic provisions contained in the Constitution.    Arango: "The Constitution recognizes the  separation of state branches--namely, the legislative,  executive, and judicial branches--under Article 103."    He also told the president that he has overlooked one very  important point: Common citizens are permitted to do anything  that is not specifically prohibited by law, but public servants  must limit their actions to the duties outlined by laws and  regulations.    Arango: "With due respect for his very important  office, we must point out that the president of the Republic is  not a common citizen and that there are limits on his ability to  exercise power."    He reminded President Gaviria that the duty of the  Constitutional Court is to decide whether rules and regulations  are in keeping with the Constitution.    Arango: "In terms of reviewing laws, for example,  this responsibility obviously cannot be fulfilled by Congress,  which issues them. The chief executive cannot do this either,  because this would imply a dictatorship."    Finally, the Constitutional Court president outlined which  branch of state would serve to pass judgment over members of the  court.    Arango: "If we fail to fulfill our duty, the  Senate of the Republic is there. The Constitution states that  the Senate should act as our judge."</p>

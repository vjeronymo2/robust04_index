			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Man in the News: Solicitor with a pressing case to present - Robert Winstanley If you are driving along London's Westway in the dead of night and something black streaks past too fast for you to read Yamaha XJ900 on its side, the chances are that it is Mr Robert Winstanley, duty solicitor. He will be on his way from his home in west London to help someone locked up in police cells across town. For Mr Winstanley and many other legal aid lawyers like him, this week has been a watershed. On Wednesday more than 2,000 solicitors gathered at Central Hall, Westminster, to protest at the government's plans to introduce standard fees for criminal legal aid work in magistrates' court. They came from all over England and Wales to try to explain to Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, why his proposals had brought many of them to the brink of strike action - a course which would have been unthinkable to many in the profession just six months ago. Coming on the heels of the collapse of the second Guinness trial and as the year-long Blue Arrow trial drew to a close, the angry meeting added to the growing feeling that Britain's criminal justice system was in crisis. As chairman of the Law Society's remuneration and practice development committee, Mr Winstanley was instrumental in organising the protest. At first glance, it appears an unlikely role for the Cambridge-educated 43-year-old. Married with two children, he looks as though he would be more at home in the corporate finance department of a large City law firm than running a legal aid practice from a terraced house at the unfashionable end of the City Road. There is no doubting his commitment to his colleagues, however. He is incensed by Lord Mackay's proposal to introduce fixed fees for criminal legal aid. The Lord Chancellor, anxious to stem the inexorable rise in legal aid expenditure, wants to cap the fees paid to lawyers for criminal legal aid work to encourage them to be more efficient and provide better value for money. Mr Winstanley says: 'The Lord Chancellor says his proposal is not a cost-cutting measure and the profession won't lose out. But some cases you put less work into and get overpaid for. Others, where you have to put in a lot of work, you get underpaid for.' Mr Winstanley and his colleagues accept that there is no bottomless pit of money to pay legal aid solicitors. But they believe there is scope within the present system to cut waste. For example, a simple paper procedure for transferring cases from the magistrates' court to the Crown Court would save thousands of court appearances a year, he claims. Clearly, legal aid solicitors would like to earn more. The government's offer of a 3 per cent increase in overall legal aid pay rates this year is 'totally unacceptable', Mr Winstanley says. But did he approve of the barracking and hissing of Lord Mackay on Wednesday? It could have been worse, he replies. He feels uncomfortable about attacks on the man himself; it is the government they should be aimed at, he says. Mr Winstanley welcomed the appointment of Lord Mackay, but his term in office has been rather disappointing, he says. 'I suppose my real disappointment was the way he caved in over ending the barristers' monopoly on advocacy in the higher courts.' Despite his misgivings about Lord Mackay's proposal to introduce standard fees, Mr Winstanley does not favour strike action by withdrawing from the duty solicitor scheme. But he understands the feelings of those solicitors in Southampton who have taken industrial action, and those in Devon and Cornwall who have threatened to. In defending their actions, he says that although solicitors have a professional duty to existing clients, they do not represent such clients when working under the duty solicitor scheme. Under the scheme, he argues, they perform more of a social service for someone who needs legal advice on a single occasion. These cases may never yield permanent clients. To understand his own reservations about strike action, it is necessary to refer to the period before 1984 when the Police and Criminal Evidence Act which established duty solicitor schemes was introduced. 'If it's your view, as it is mine, that it is desirable that people under arrest at police stations should have legal representation, then, morally, I don't see how you can call for solicitors to withdraw from that service,' he says. Before the act, Mr Winstanley says, and the introduction of tape-recording of interviews with suspects, there were several miscarriages of justice which resulted from suspects being what he calls 'verballed' - having statements wrongly attributed to them by the police. 'But if Lord Mackay persists with his standard fees scheme and his proposed increase in legal aid pay, solicitors won't be able to stay in business,' he maintains. To the public, all this may look like solicitors' self interest and the issues may appear somewhat arcane. 'Well, I'm not going to pretend to you that the issue has captured the imagination of the country at large,' he says. Mr Winstanley argues that it is not the lawyers who are the problem; it is the waste in the system. Look at the costs incurred in the second Guinness trial, he says, and the enormous cost of staging the year-long Blue Arrow trial. There has to be a way of narrowing down the issues in these trials. 'Someone has got to take these cases by the scruff of the neck and reduce the number of charges to bring the case within manageable limits. No fraud case, however complex, should take more than three months at the absolute outside, and I really think they ought to aim at two months. On that basis I would stick with jury trial for complex frauds.' He views it as ironic that part of the reason for the failure of the second Guinness trial was the strain put on the health of Mr Roger Seelig after he decided to represent himself. Mr Seelig's wealth meant he did not qualify for legal aid and yet he felt he could not afford to hire a lawyer, Mr Winstanley adds. The court had the power to grant Mr Seelig legal aid, whether or not he applied for it. Mr Winstanley feels that, with the benefit of hindsight, it might have saved money to have granted him legal aid at the outset. What next in the solicitors' campaign? The first priority will be a meeting, to be held within a fortnight, between Lord Mackay and the president of the Law Society, for whom Mr Winstanley will provide back-up. He says that after watching Lord Mackay's performance at Wednesday's meeting he is worried that the Lord Chancellor still has not grasped solicitors' concerns about criminal justice.</p>

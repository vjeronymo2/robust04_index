			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'DEAL' RETURNS -- AT 3:30 A.M.  </P> <P> "Let's Make a Deal," one of the most popular game shows in television history,  is returning to the airwaves Monday with new episodes.  </P> <P> But aside from insomniacs and people who remember to set their VCRs, few  Southern Californians will be able to see the show.  </P> <P> That's because KNBC Channel 4 has scheduled "Let's Make a Deal" for weekdays at  3:30 a.m.  </P> <P> Most NBC affiliates will air the program at 10 a.m., but KNBC carries "House  Party" at that time.  </P> <P> "We have a financial commitment to 'House Party' through September. When that  commitment expires, KNBC will move 'Let's Make a Deal' to the daytime lineup,"  KNBC spokeswoman Regina Miyamoto said. STEVEN HERBERT  </P></p>

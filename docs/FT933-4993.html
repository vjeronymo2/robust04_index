			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Foreign orders for British arms exceed last year's Pounds 5bn record OVERSEAS orders for British arms so far this year have already surpassed last year's record of Pounds 5.2bn, Sir Alan Thomas, the Ministry of Defence's export chief, said yesterday. Describing the export performance as 'a great and unsung success story', he vigorously rebutted suggestions that the government had been lax in vetting where its arms went. Officials expect the UK's share of the international defence market to exceed the 20 per cent level which it reached for the first time last year. This year's export figures had been boosted by the sale of 48 Tornado bombers to Saudi Arabia, expected to be worth some Pounds 4bn including spares and support. The UK now ranks as the world's number two arms exporter after the US. Sir Alan, who heads the MoD's Defence Export Services Organisation (Deso), was speaking at a preview of the Royal Navy and British Army Equipment Exhibition at Aldershot, Hampshire. He emphasised the MoD's increasing reliance on export customers to help defray the cost of its own weapons. He said: 'Our future capability depends on our export success.' However in spite of rising exports, the exhibition, open to invited guests only, reflects the decline of the UK defence industry. Exhibitions of British land and sea weapons were previously held separately in alternate years. The decision to merge them was made two years ago after a naval show which was judged to have too few exhibitors to be worth repeating. However, this year's combined show, organised by Deso and paid for by industry, is even smaller. Sir Alan, who has not been called to testify to the Scott inquiry into supplies of arms and related equipment to Iraq in the 1980s, said it was 'arrant nonsense' to depict Britain as a major supplier to President Saddam Hussain of Iraq. The UK had come 'a very poor fifth' among the world's five main arms-producing nations in supplying Iraq between 1985 and 1990, he said, adding that it had not sent lethal equipment. 'No other country in the world has a more responsible policy or practice,' he claimed. He added that the UK obeyed international controls and regulations on arms sales 'both in the letter and in spirit'.</p>

He  is Belarusian. His father died at the front in the Great  Patriotic War.    He is a professional lawyer and graduated from the Law  Department at the Belarusian State University, specializing in  jurisprudence. He worked in the republic's law-enforcement  organs and in 1985 became head of the Vitebsk Oblast Soviet  Executive Committee Internal Affairs Administration. He is a  militia lieutenant general in the reserve.    In 1990 he became a people's deputy and member of the  Republic of Belarus Supreme Soviet Presidium and chairman of the  Supreme Soviet's Commission on National Security, Defense, and  Combating Crime. His wife is an accountant. They have two  children: Their son is a doctor, their daughter a student.    On 28 January 1994 he was elected chairman of the Republic  of  Belarus Supreme Soviet.    One hour before the results of the second round of voting  were announced, I approached him in the foyer where deputies  were waiting for the verdict of the tellers' commission. "It is  tempting providence to congratulate you on your victory,  Mechyslaw Ivanovich." "It is hard to say what is better," he  replied, pensively. "My wife has not spoken to me since she  heard what kind of harness I am putting my head into." Indeed,  Mechyslaw Hryb himself immediately refused point-blank to allow  his nomination to be put forward. The members of the presidium  met and spent half a day trying to persuade him.    Now the scene shifts to the office of the chairman of the  republic's Supreme Soviet where our conversation took place and  my first question was this:    [Stepanenko] So, is it a case of congratulations or  commiserations?    [Hryb] Commiserations would be better -- such a burden, and  at such a time.    [Stepanenko] The impression gained from your first  interviews and speeches as chairman are unambiguous: You are  fully aware of how hard it is to extricate the republic from the  crisis into which it has been plunged in the past two years. In  your view, what are the reasons for this crisis and what are its  true dimensions?    [Hryb] When assessing any phenomenon I usually rely on  objective data. On things that can be compared and calculated.  For example, in the past two years national income has fallen by  20 percent. And although the rate of decline is much less than  in other countries of the CIS and the Baltic region which are  former republics of the USSR -- its scale is awesome.    If you consider that back in 1989 the national income growth  rate was 8 percent and was perhaps the highest in the world, it  is not hard to see that the calamity which was building up is  hitting us particularly hard here.    The main cause of the crisis is undoubtedly the breakdown of  the ties which permeated the vital economic organism. The  destruction of production-sharing dealt the republic a heavy  blow. Belarus, as you are aware, was known as the assembly shop  of the Union: machine building, electronics, chemicals, and  other sectors of industry manufactured end products here using  components and raw materials received from many republics. We  received 70-80 percent, in some cases the full 100 percent, of  our oil, gas, and metals, for example, mainly from Russia.  After the disintegration of the USSR the volumes of those  supplies fell sharply and prices rose incredibly. Furthermore,  prices of oil and gas for our enterprises were four times higher  than for Russian enterprises. Added to that there were customs  duties, which raised prices by a third. That is the reason for  the slump in production, the explosion of inflation, and the  further decline in the living standard.    [Stepanenko] All these are external factors, as it were.  But there were internal ones, were there not?    [Hryb] Of course. I have said a number of times that in the  process of perestroyka and reform we lost control of the  republic. The old party-state system was destroyed, but a new  system of management was not created. This aggravated all the  negative processes. The growth of crime, speculation,  corruption; the opportunity for the unearned fast buck, which  demoralizes socially inexperienced youth above all and  undermines society's future; the iniquitous enrichment of some  against the background and at the expense of the impoverishment  of a considerable section of the people; the erosion of the  moral principles and values inherent in our people since time  immemorial -- all these factors jeopardize society's stability.    [Stepanenko] What do you intend to do to rectify such an  explosive situation?    [Hryb] I intend to use all the strength, experience, and  ability that it takes to eliminate the causes of the crisis. As  for the external causes, it is necessary first of all to  immediately rebuild the wrecked economic ties with the former  republics of the USSR. Especially with Russia. As I have  already remarked a number of times, the situation can only be  remedied by an economic union and a singe monetary system --  measures, I stress, which are exceptionally effective and  mutually beneficial. Despite the resistance of the opponents of  such integration, a contractual basis for the single monetary  system has been prepared and, I hope, will be adopted in the  near future.    [Stepanenko] What about the elimination of the internal  causes?    [Hryb] Briefly, it is necessary to restore the government of  the republic. As quickly as possible, furthermore.    [Stepanenko] What is being done to achieve that?    [Hryb] As I promised right after the election, I am trying  to take every measure to unite deputies and the presidium as far  as possible. Unless consolidation is achieved at the top, not  one of the tasks aimed at creating an effective system of  government will be accomplished. And there are a great many  tasks of that kind. Of course, some of them are more important  than the rest, and unless these are resolved we cannot even hope  to find a way out of the crisis. The most important thing  today, in my view, is to define the form in which the state is  to be organized. Belarus and Tajikistan are the only former  USSR republics not to have done that yet.    The other day, as you know, the Supreme Soviet Presidium  issued a statement which set out what are in our view the main  measures involved in building and equipping the state. First it  is necessary to institute the post of the supreme official who  is to be elected by all the people and who is at the same time  the leader of the state and the executive. In our opinion, this  will ensure personal responsibility for the state of affairs in  the republic. In addition, it is necessary to define in law the  appropriate system of state organs to ensure the observance of  citizens' rights, the efficient development of the economy,  effective management, control, legality, and law and order.  During this very session we must work to adopt a new  constitution and hold nationwide elections of state and  executive branch leaders in the first half of the year,  elections to the Supreme Soviet in the second half of the year,  and elections to the local soviets in March next year. We are  convinced that in this way the continuity of power and stability  in society and the participation of the whole population in the  renewal of the state organs will be ensured on the basis of the  laws.    [Stepanenko] Mechyslaw Ivanovich, not everyone supports this  program, as we know. Let us begin with the intention of uniting  the deputies. The views, approaches, and programs of those who  belong to communist deputies' formations, the People's Movement  of Belarus (PMB), for example, and the Belarusian People's Front  (BPF), conflict on the fundamental questions of socioeconomic  organization and policy. The former, for example, support a  union with Russia, the BPF is against. Uniting them, combining  the uncombinable -- do you not think that this is idealism,  romanticism, a utopia, if you like?    [Hryb] I am not so naive as to fail to understand that it is  impossible, of course, to try to consolidate and unite the  forces of the communists and the BPF, for example. But I do  think it realistic to try to unite them to resolve a specific  task. You only have to reason and try to convince them -- they  are living people and, believe me, they do listen when people  speak to them and try to convince them by means of arguments.  We, too, must listen, consider, and accept all of our  opponents' reasonable suggestions. Unity has been achieved on a  number of questions of building and equipping the state, and  both the communists and the representatives of the BPF voted for  many articles in the new constitution which have now been  adopted.    [Stepanenko] Suppose, Mechyslaw Ivanovich, that you do  manage to achieve a certain consolidation of the deputies,  nevertheless a unification within the political hierarchy which  divides people and society from below (and that, after all, is  the only outcome of a course of market reforms aimed at  capitalization) will not lead to stabilization, peace, reliable  manageability, or accord. For example, who is going to agree to  latter-day capitalists becoming rich at other people's expense?  Clearly what is needed first is a concept of a socioeconomic  arrangement which unites people, is it not?    [Hryb] We do not need to build capitalism and we will not  build it, even if only because with our people we will not reach  capitalism, we will not succeed in building it.    [Stepanenko] The supporters of capitalization are touting  this idea of yours around everywhere, Mechyslaw Ivanovich: Hryb  himself has said that you will not build capitalism with our  people: They are the wrong people, bad people.    [Hryb] Why are they "bad"? It is simply that we are by  nature somewhat different, we have a different mentality. The  Belarusians, the Russians -- the Slavs -- and indeed not only  the Slavs but everyone who has lived on the territory of the  former Soviet Union, the majority of these people have a  different inner, spiritual core. It is based on a desire for  justice, the struggle for justice, and a belief in the triumph  of a justice with which the principles of "buy and sell" and  "make as much money as you can" are incompatible. Just like the  principle of dividing and judging people according to capital  and wealth.    [Stepanenko] When addressing the first session of the  presidium after your election as chairman of the Supreme Soviet  Presidium you cited a purely worldly example: Before laying a  road, the smart administrator first looks to see which way  people tend to go and only then starts laying the asphalt.    [Hryb] Yes, that is one of my main principles, people will  not get it wrong, believe me. My greatest faith is in people,  in the fact that they will work things out for themselves and  decide for themselves how they should live. I am convinced that  we have still not made any major or irreversible mistakes and  have taken a balanced approach to the reform of the economy. I  am a convinced supporter of the need to reform the old economic  system. It was too restrictive and to a large extent tended  toward a leveling approach. Everything was dictated from the  top. Neither collectives nor individual workers had scope for  development. People were suppressed, the level of wages was  restricted. Just exceed that restrictive limit a little and  immediately they revise the norms and the rates.    But we need to give the producer and the worker freedom. Of  course, that freedom must not harm others or society.    [Stepanenko] You are a supporter of the presidential form of  rule, but many people, including a section of the deputies, are  opposed to it. I have just had a call from a reader who cited  some lines from a newspaper report: "The institution of the  presidency tore our Union to shreds. Each president, great or  small, took pains to organize his own little nest and promised  the people an abundance of 'golden eggs.' We know what the  result of that was. Moreover, it cannot be ignored that  presidential rule tends more toward an individualist rather than  a collectivist psychology...."    [Hryb] I beg to differ. In the first place, I do not  believe that it was presidential rule which led to the  disintegration of the Union.... In the second place, there was  a president in the USSR even before perestroyka. Only in those  days he was called a general secretary. I am convinced that,  now that governability has been almost completely lost, such an  instrument is needed.    [Stepanenko] What about a parliamentary republic? People's  power in the form of the soviets?    [Hryb] Soviet power as a form of popular representation  after the appropriate improvement, and its supreme organ -- the  Supreme Soviet -- remain and will exercise their functions in  close cooperation with the president.    [Stepanenko] Many are convinced that before adopting the  constitution it is necessary to decide on a sociopolitical and  economic structure. That it is necessary to begin not with the  roof but with the foundations.    [Hryb] I can understand them but I cannot agree with them.  While we are making up our minds there will be nothing left of  the roof but fragments. In a society out of control only one  type of process -- a destructive one -- is possible, and for  that reason the most important thing is to establish a firm  vertical administrative structure, that is my opinion, my  conviction.    [Stepanenko] The draft of the new constitution stresses  the priority of human rights over the rights of the state. The  supporters of that approach assert that this is how things are  in all rule-of-law states in the West.... But is the  absolutization of human rights in our country not one of the  causes of chaos?    [Hryb] We have lived through the stage of "thinking about  the motherland first, yourself afterward." They were good  words, a fine idea, but we remember what resulted from the  disfigured absolutization of this idea. When a person could not  leave the village unless the chief gave him a reference, when he  could not take someone who had offended him to court or to the  executive committee or any other organ of power.    [Stepanenko] But those were distortions.    [Hryb] Yes, but the soil for such distortions existed. I  believe that human rights must be defined as a priority in the  constitution. But in conjunction with obligations. Obligations  to society, the state, and other citizens. When we organically  combine all these factors, there manifests itself an integral  state structure in which no one will be able to shelter behind  the freedoms and rights of the individual to harm another  person, the collective, or society.    [Stepanenko] I would like to thank you for this frank  conversation and congratulate you on behalf of myself and my  PRAVDA comrades on your election to this supreme state post.  And of course to wish you success in your difficult state work.    [Stepanenko] Thank you, and I also wish PRAVDA and its  staffers new successes.</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Regions divided over Moscow battle A MIXED picture emerged yesterday from Russia's regions as several of the country's 88 provinces and republics backed Mr Boris Yelstin while others sought to weigh up the implications of the showdown in Moscow. Mr Yuri Nozhikov, governor of Siberia's Irkutsk region, said Mr Yeltsin's decree was unconstitutional by the letter of the law, but he added: 'Is there any other way out in a situation where parliament does not wish to act construct-ively?' Unexpected condemnation came from St Petersburg, Russia's second city, where the reform-oriented council branded Mr Yeltsin's dissolution of parliament illegal. However, many regional officials directly involved in carrying out the government's market reforms, the most noticeable of which has been its mass privatisation, warmly endorsed the president's decision. 'He should have done this much earlier,' said Mr Pyotr Lanskov, deputy head of the St Petersburg privatisation fund. 'I only hope the president has enough political will to carry out his decree. If he does, Thank God. If he doesn't, and parliament wins out, that will no doubt mean an end to the privatisation programme.' Mr Vyacheslav Silin, deputy chief of the Murmansk administration near Norway in the far north, said the Supreme Soviet had become 'divorced from reality'. 'I think the Russian people are wise enough not to start a civil war just because of a small bunch of people who place their interests above those of the nation,' he said. But Mr Boris Nemtsov, governor of the Nizhny-Novgorod region, which is a pioneer of market reforms, said the present government should take on all presidential responsibilities until new elections. The republic of Udmurtia went as far as seizing new rights for itself in response to the president's decree. It announced that henceforth its laws would be above those of the Russian government. The bigger republics, such as Yakutia, and Bashkortostan, have already appropriated sweeping rights for themselves in the past, while Chechnya has declared its independence. If Mr Yeltsin wins his battle with parliament, one of the most testing challenges will be to respond to the long-festering grievances in the regions, mainly over the sharing of power and resources. Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, yesterday promised to seek extra revenues for provinces, which have considered withholding from Moscow a larger share of local taxes. But the promise appears little in relation to the sweeping reforms needed to transform the so-called Russian Federation into a real federal state.</p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Quotes of the day 'It is not my wish, nor my intention to lead for long a party of opposition. I was elected to lead a party of government.' John Smith 'The opt out prime minister leading a do-nothing government off the European stage . . . We were promised a New Statesman, and what have we got instead? The Spectator.' Smith on John Major 'What started out on Black Wednesday as a tragi-comedy has degenerated into Whitehall farce. John Major and Norman Lamont - the Laurel and Hardy of British politics. Another fine mess they got us into.' Smith on sterling crisis 'We should beware of the paid image-maker. They are mainly middle-class graduates who've learnt their socialism from market research and opinion polls.' Teresa Pearce, Erith and Crayford CLP 'The government's white paper on the privatisation of British Rail is a bit like a Barbara Cartland love story. Strong on feeling, weak on reality, silent on all the specific details.' Richard Rosser NEC member 'One more heave is just one more fantasy.' Owen Tudor, Tottenham CLP</p>

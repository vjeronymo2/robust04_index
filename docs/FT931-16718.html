			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Evode omits profit forecast EVODE, the chemical and plastics group fighting a hostile Pounds 94.3m bid from Wassall, yesterday omitted a profits forecast with its final defence document. Mr Andrew Simon, Evode's chairman, said it was not practical to publish a profits forecast after only three months of trading since its financial year ended on October 3. Evode's document, which contained its balance sheet for 1992, rebutted many of Wassall's earlier comments, accusing the mini-conglomerate of an 'ill-informed and over-simplified attack' on the company. Mr Chris Miller, Wassall chairman, said he was 'amazed' that Evode declined to publish a profits forecast or give details of its current trading performance. 'The absence of any comment on current trading, let alone a profit or dividend forecast, will suggest to Evode shareholders that its board lacks confidence in its ability to deliver satisfactory results in the future.' Evode recently produced a 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 10.2m, for the 53 weeks to October 3. Its shares yesterday firmed 1p to close at 103p, while Wassall's shares were unchanged at 217p. Wassall may raise its 80p-a-share offer today. But Mr Miller warned he was not willing to overpay. 'We have already raised more than Pounds 50m from the first half of our rights issue and, if necessary, we will be in a very good position to look for other acquisitions.' Evode's document seeks to reassure shareholders that it has only been in breach of interest covenants relating to the Dollars 43m (Pounds 28m) unlisted US redeemable shares. Shareholders have waived their rights, from the breach of covenant, to appoint directors to Evode's board. The group said it was only close to breaching another covenant because of the change in accounting rules which forced it to restate reserves. It said it was confident of gaining the support of the two US preference shareholders, US West and GE Capital, to change the covenants. For the first time in two years Mr Simon and his chief executive, Mr David Winterbottom, enjoyed pay increases. Mr Simon's pay rose to Pounds 127,487 (Pounds 124,019) and Mr Winterbottom's to Pounds 141,114 (Pounds 136,304). See Lex</p>

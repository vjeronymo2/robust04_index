			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SNOW REMOVAL  </P> <P> The first real snow of the winter season proved that the California Department  of Transportation's recent changes in its snow removal procedures where  shortsighted at best and a detriment to the public safety at worst.  </P> <P> Caltrans' plan to cut the use of road salt by 30% to protect the health of  trees in the Lake Tahoe area is a first step in aiding the environment.  However, simply cutting the use of salt without any compensation for the  reduction increases ice on the road and the chance of accidents. This was  proven over the Thanksgiving weekend when heavy snowfall caused numerous  accidents, major delays and even hours-long closures on Highway 50 and  Interstate 80.  </P> <P> Citizens for Better Mountain Highways is a coalition of Sierra business owners,  residents and visitors who are concerned about the environment as well as  safety and accessibility of area highways. We urge Caltrans to employ  alternative road de-icers, additional staff and more equipment this winter both  to protect the environment and ensure the safety of those traveling Sierra  Nevada roads.  </P> <P> STAN HANSEN  </P> <P> Co-Chair, Citizens for Better  </P> <P> Mountain Highways  </P> <P> TOM DAVIS  </P> <P> President, South Lake Tahoe  </P> <P> Chamber of Commerce  </P></p>

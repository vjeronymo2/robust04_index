			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sarajevo, April 10 (AFP) -- [passage omitted]  Aid workers said that Serb shelling of Gorazde had ceased after  the [NATO] air strikes, bringing relief after the assault on the  town, while civilians had taken advantage of the lull to take  the wounded to hospital.    In Brussels, NATO diplomats said the strikes occurred some  45  minutes after UNPROFOR forces were attacked from a position  occupied by Bosnian Serbs.    The Serb military command for Herzegovina, carrying out the  offensive on Gorazde, said NATO planes had struck Bosnian Serb  positions in the Preljuca and Goli Vrh region, 12 kilometres  (seven miles) southwest of the town. [passage omitted]    The private Italian television station TG5 said the planes  left from Aviano in northeast Italy and reported that the attack  had left casualties, but gave no sources. [passage omitted]    A UN High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman in Belgrade,  Lyndall Sachs, said: "The town (Gorazde) is calm and there is a  feeling of tremendous relief among the people" after a day of  panicked fleeing before the Serb offensive.    "Now everyone is catching their breath," Eric Stobbaerts,  Belgrade representative for Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF:  Doctors Without Borders) said, "and waiting to see what will  happen tonight."

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Worldwide probe makes slow progress - Andrew Jack and Richard Donkin track global investigations into the collapsed bank THE sentencing yesterday of Mr Syed Ali Akbar, former head of treasury at the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, represents one of the first prosecution victories in a series of criminal and civil court cases related to the bank that are pending around the world. Investigations across the globe have moved grindingly slowly since the closure of the bank in July 1991 and have already led in the US to the acquittal of Mr Robert Altman, a Washington lawyer accused of profiting from loans given by BCCI to enable him to buy shares in First American, the bank of which he was president. The three main spheres of investigation are in the UK, US and Abu Dhabi. The UK has three outstanding cases arising out of investigations by the Serious Fraud Office. All the hearings are scheduled to begin in January. They involve charges of false accounting against Mr Nazmudin Virani, former chairman and chief executive of Control Securities, Mr Mohammed Abdul Baqi, former managing director of Attock Oil, and Mr Imran Mohammed Ahmad Imam, an assistant to Mr Swaleh Naqvi, BCCI's former chief executive. The SFO has issued three arrest warrants in connection with the cases. The warrants cover Mr Ghaith Pharaon, a former BCCI depositor, believed to be in Morocco, Mr Mohammed Moizul Haque, a senior accounting officer at the bank, and Mr Basheer Chowdry, BCCI's UK general manager. Mr Haque and Mr Chowdry are thought to be living in Pakistan. A number of indictments have been lodged in the US against BCCI officials but Mr Robert Morgantheau, the New York district attorney who has been spearheading investigations in the US, has had little success in bringing any of those charged to justice. Indictments were brought in the US in July last year for fraud, bribery, conspiracy, larceny and racketeering related to BCCI against Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, BCCI's ailing founder, Mr Naqvi and Mr Pharaon. However, none of these men is likely to be extradited or to return to the US while the charges remain. A similar difficulty in relation to Mr Abedi faces prosecutors in Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder in BCCI, which brought charges against him last month. He lives in Pakistan, and there is no extradition treaty between the two countries. More progress appears to have been made in Abu Dhabi which, after a two-year investigation, has charged 13 senior BCCI officers, including Mr Naqvi, who faces 36 years in jail if convicted on all counts. Preliminary hearings have been set for October 9. The criminal investigations are running parallel to a series of civil actions launched by BCCI's liquidators on behalf of its creditors. On October 27 the Touche Ross liquidator is hoping to secure final approval for a joint compensation agreement with Abu Dhabi in which the emirate would contribute between Dollars 1.2bn and Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.42bn) in return for the liquidators' sacrificing the right to sue it. In the longer term three other legal actions launched by the liquidators could generate billions of dollars. The first - unlikely to take place for at least five years - was brought in London against accountants Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney (the latter is now part of Ernst &amp; Young) as auditors to BCCI. The second, also brought in London, is against the Bank of England as lead regulator to BCCI. More than 5,000 depositors have assigned their claims to the liquidators, giving a strong mandate to proceed. The Bank has still to serve its defence in the case. The third, also to be heard in the UK, is against the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, its former chief operating officer. Related court orders obtained by the liquidators in connection with recoveries include a worldwide freeze on the assets of Sheikh Khalid and Mr Haroon Rashid Khalon, a retired banker, granted by the High Court in London. Separate legal action remains in the way of the liquidators. Three BCCI depositors have appealed in Luxembourg against court approval of the compensation agreement on the grounds that they believe Abu Dhabi should be sued. A decision is expected at the end of October. Meanwhile First American Bancshares, acquired by BCCI in contravention of US law, in June became the first litigant to sue Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi. The Dollars 1.5bn suit alleges that the leader and his government were to blame for the bank's failure as the dominant and controlling shareholder since 1972. Price Waterhouse faces two other civil suits. It is named as one of 77 defendants in a class action brought in California. The case was at first dismissed and is now under appeal, with written pleadings complete and oral hearings estimated to take place within five to 15 months. It is also named in a case brought in London by two Omani depositors who claimed they relied on the audited BCCI accounts to deposit Dollars 600,000 with the bank. Statements of claim have been issued. BCCI official sentenced, Page 9</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Markets: A strange birth and an awkward death - Serious Money A bit of commonsense seems to be coming back to the main new issues market. Promising issues such as Thorn are resoundingly oversubscribed; chancier ones such as New Look are aborted. This is how the issues market is meant to work - saying 'yes' to the sheep, 'no' to the goats. Vetting them is a suitable job for the pros - sponsors and the investing institutions. And once a company has been accepted on to the market, private investors can have some confidence that it will not fall to pieces quite as quickly as some of this summer's debutantes - Aerostructures Hamble, for example. So all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds - at least for the next week or so. But one corner of the issues market is still lagging behind this brave new world: investment trusts. Consider Abtrust Latin American Investment Trust, which has just raised Pounds 20m through a placing with institutional investors. Abtrust was delighted with the response. Which seems fair enough - until you check out the names of some of the key shareholders. Top of the list is Abtrust itself. Then come Murray Johnstone, Jupiter Tyndall, Fleming. Those four account for nearly half the shares placed. And curiously enough the other three all run several overseas trusts themselves. Nice to know that competition is so civilised in the fund management industry. But does not such enthusiasm for taking in each other's washing look just a teeny weeny bit like backscratching? A decent ending to a company's stockmarket life is as important as a decent birth. When the Stock Exchange said recently that it was getting more trigger happy in suspending company shares, it upset some personal investors. For suspensions tend to penalise the innocent bystander. The classic case revolved around Jim Raper at St Piran. The stock exchange kept shares in all Raper's companies suspended for over two years in a vain attempt to force Raper to play by the rules. Such efforts to protect the public interest all too often end up by penalising those members of the public actually involved in the test case. But how much better is it if the exchange turns a blind eye to irregularities and attempts to persuade a company to mend its ways? A rather sad little bulletin this week announced the impending retirement of one of the exchange's oldest quoted companies, Van Diemen's Land. First granted its Royal charter in 1825, the company, which owns a large chunk of Tasmania, has applied to have its London Stock Exchange listing cancelled with effect from November 14. The background to this statement is an ongoing tussle between the company and the stock exchange over the fact that only 12 1/2 per cent of the shares are in public hands - half the proportion stipulated in the rulebook. So far, so dry. The background to the background is a touch more colourful. During the past six years a controlling shareholding in Van Diemen's has been handed round a chain of ageing whizz-kids: David and Richard Thompson (Hillsdown), David Kirch (property), Graham Ferguson Lacey (ubiquitous entrepreneur and evangelist). A year ago the stake ended up with a New Zealand company called Tasman Agriculture, a company in which Sir Ron Brierley's Brierley Investments is believed to have a large interest. Tasman has already spent a lot of money turning part of Van Diemen's territory into a Brobdingnagian dairy farm. Later this year it will propose both a rights issue and a cash offer to minority shareholders. But the listing will have gone before details of either offer are known. This is not how minority shareholders in a company with a London Stock Exchange listing expect to be treated. Van Diemen's shares, which touched 600p in the mid-1970s were quoted at around 85p-95p yesterday, but have been rising sharply since early 1993 - presumably in the hope that Tasman will think it worth paying over the odds to mop up the minority. Van Diemen's is a rather grubby little tale with an obscure ending. Once again the Stock Exchange has proved incapable of providing any positive help to small shareholders. But at least they have always had the chance to cut and run. The Personal Investment Authority this week suspended a financial adviser for the first time. What happens to the firm's existing clients? The PIA is unlikely to have taken such a step frivolously. So they may be cooling their heels for quite some time. In the interim period, the adviser is not allowed to give them any fresh advice, but he can legitimately report on the progress of their existing investments. The real question for clients is whether to wait around to find out the end of the story. There are three possible outcomes to a suspension. If the adviser appeals, the case is heard either by the chief executive as a matter of urgency or by the disciplinary committee in due course. The bureaucrats can apply to have the adviser's membership terminated. Or they can ask the firm to remedy specific defects and then lift the suspension. Not much fun for the clients. But at least the door is always open.</p>

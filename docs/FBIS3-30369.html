			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and Ministers Karel Dyba  and Vladimir Dlouhy returned today from the session of the World  Economic Forum in Davos. Shortly after his return, Klaus said:    [Begin Klaus recording] First, the Davos meeting presented,  just as it has every year--and this is the fifth time we have  been there--an exceptionally suitable opportunity to represent  the Czech Republic in the world, which, I think, was carried out  successfully during the whole series of meetings, talks, and  speeches the three of us had there.    Second, the forum was an opportunity to say something about  the world and European problems. We tried to do that, too, and I  think the voice of the Czech Republic was audible and strong.    Third, Davos provided an opportunity for a large number of  bilateral talks and meetings, which we had not only with a  number of world politicians but also with bankers and  businessmen, and we can name the individual countries with whom  we had talks. We had a meeting with Chancellor Kohl. We had a  meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Bhutto. There were talks  with the Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian prime ministers.  There were talks with partners from African and Latin American  countries, and so on. [end recording]</p>

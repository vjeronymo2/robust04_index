			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Brasilia -- President Itamar Franco on 28 April  signed a new version of the provisional measure that creates the  Real Value Unit [URV] and the real. He introduced it with two  modifications that had been negotiated with Congress: First,  the guarantee of covering, beginning 1 July, any possible loss  in purchasing power of salaries converted into URV's. This will  be done if there is really any loss compared to the previous  salary policy. Second, to ensure that the rules for issuance of  the real comply with all legal demands and that the real will be  implemented through a presidential decree. Provisional Measure  No. 482, which was published in the official gazette today, does  not establish a date for the new currency's implementation.  Congress will have one month to vote on this provisional measure.    Although the economic team defended the idea of reissuing  Provisional Measure No. 457 without modifying it, the opinion of  the government's political area prevailed. In the afternoon of  28 April, Finance Ministry executive secretary Clovis Carvalho  stated: "Everyone believed the original text should be  preserved." He pointed out, however, that it was up to Finance  Minister Rubens Ricupero and the president of the Republic to  make the final decision on the issue. Ricupero's chief of staff,  Sergio Amaral, said the finance minister offered President  Itamar Franco the two alternatives. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Venezuelan offer given go-ahead VENEZUELA has approved a finance ministry request to issue public-debt bonds worth DM150m, Reuter reports from Caracas. The approval was given by a senate committee and the funds will be used to refinance borrowings held by two state-owned groups. The two companies are Cadafe, a state utility, and the Caracas subway. The refinancing will centre on borrowings that fell due last year or will fall due this year. The bulk of the issue, some DM126.26m, will be handled by BHF Bank of Germany.</p>

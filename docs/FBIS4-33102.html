Ruben Pineda, director of the Salvadoran Coffee Council, has  reported that El Salvador has decided to release 130,000  quintals of coffee it has been stockpiling since October 1993,  when the Association of Coffee Producing Countries decided to  begin withholding coffee to raise international prices.

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: ASW maintains interim despite fall to Pounds 700,000 ASW Holdings, the Cardiff-based steel products and construction systems group, is maintaining its interim dividend of 3p a share in spite of a sharp fall in first-half pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 700,000. The decision is based on the expectation that trading conditions will continue to improve following a much better second quarter in the company's main steel business. The company is also expecting the benefits from its investment and cost-cutting programmes to come through. Total turnover edged up from Pounds 230.5m to Pounds 237m, but profits from continuing operations, excluding restructuring costs, fell from Pounds 5.2m to Pounds 3.4m. The steel side suffered a slide in profits from Pounds 7m to Pounds 4.1m. A loss of Pounds 100,000 in the first quarter reflected the continuation of the poor trading conditions experienced at the end of last year, but the second quarter brought a significant recovery in selling prices and margins. Prices continued firm and demand remained satisfactory, ASW said yesterday. An Pounds 11m-Pounds 12m upgrade of the Cardiff bar and section mill has been carried out, which ASW said would achieve substantial cost reductions when it came into full operation next year. Meanwhile, as a result of this and other restructuring to be undertaken in the second half, there would be exceptional restructuring costs estimated at Pounds 3.5m this year, due mainly to redundancies. Some Pounds 600,000 of this was incurred in the first half. The construction systems business showed some improvement, helped by the restructuring carried out at the end of last year, reducing its first-half loss from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 700,000. The company reiterated that the business would be profitable in the second half. The group's net borrowings stood at Pounds 43.4m on June 30, only slightly up from Pounds 42.8m a year earlier despite a rise in capital spending from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 10.2m. Net profit rose from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 1.6m following the release of an earlier provision related to the tax treatment of the takeover of Manchester Steel in 1985. A favourable agreement with the Inland Revenue was reached early this year. After payment of preference and ordinary dividends, the retained loss for the period was reduced from Pounds 2m a year earlier to Pounds 1.1m. Basic earnings per share were 1.3p (0.0p).</p>

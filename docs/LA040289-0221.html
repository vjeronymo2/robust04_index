			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IDENTITY OF BIRDS IN PHOTOS HARD TO SWALLOW  </P> <P> Thank you for your pictures of the birds (March 22) we see around Newport. I do  have to say that the one pictured is not a tern but an American avocet.  </P> <P> I was so enthralled by the wild birds I could see on the Back Bay where I live  that I took two classes through Coastline College to be able to identify them.  </P> <P> Terns dive for their food -- you never see them wading. They are the ones who  fly overhead like the pelicans and then suddenly dive straight down into the  water.  </P> <P> Avocets are a wading bird. They have long legs and a long bill turned up at the  end, so you can tell from the silhouette what it is. They sweep their bill from  side to side to get their food.  </P> <P> I see so many birds wintering here and get an immense amount of enjoyment out  of being able to identify the species.  </P> <P> Enjoyed the pelicans and sea gulls today!  </P> <P> RUTH WALLEY  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

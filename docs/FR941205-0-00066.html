			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Postal Service, which believes that special bulk third-class rates are properly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chargeable for third-class matter and not other classes of mail, does not have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unilateral authority to establish new postage rates or classes of mail. Classes of mail are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule (DMCS). Special bulk third-class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates are available only to qualified organizations when their mailings consist of at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 200 pieces or 50 pounds of mail properly presorted. The minimum of 200 pieces or 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pounds was established because it is cost-effective for the Postal Service to verify, accept,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and process such mailings. The minimum-volume requirement is established in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 300.021 of the DMCS, and the Postal Service may not change the requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DMCS or change postage rates except by undertaking the procedures set forth in 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 3621&hyph;3625.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to its consistency with the language of 39 U.S.C. 3629, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination that the special rates be restricted to bulk third-class matter is also in line  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with subsequent legislative events. During 1993, the U.S. Senate introduced an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendment to the Treasury and the United States Postal Service Appropriations bill to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorize voting registration officials to mail at ``a rate which is one-half the applicable rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for First-Class Mail'' instead of mailing at the special bulk third-class rate as provided by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NVRA, 139 Cong. Rec., S10186, August 3, 1993. The conferees deleted the Senate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendment, stating: ``The conferees are aware, however, of the concerns of some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> election officials who believe that the bulk third-class mail rate will not be sufficient to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include all of the mailing requirements of the Act.'' H.R. Rep. 102&hyph;256, 103d Cong., 1st  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sess., September 24, 1993, at 43.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Suggestions that the Postal Service permit voting materials to be mailed free or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopt a new rate for such mail, such as a percentage of the First-Class rate, are beyond  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the scope of the Act and outside the authority of the Postal Service. Free or reduced rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mailing privileges may not be adopted unilaterally by the Postal Service; they are effected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only by congressional statute. Other than 39 U.S.C. 3406 and 3629, Congress has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enacted such privileges for election-related mailings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment noted that the Postal Service misinterpreted the law regarding applicability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the National Voter Registration Act by stating that the law applies only to states or local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> voting registration officials in those states and the District of Columbia that require a voter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to register to vote before the date of voting in a general election for public office. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter stated: ``Section 4 of the NVRA exempts states which had enacted a law on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or before March 11, 1993, which allows all voters to `register to vote at the polling place  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the time of voting in a general election for Federal office.' Any state that enacts an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> election-day registration law after March 11, 1993, will be subject to the provisions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NVRA and, therefore, should be entitled to the preferential postal rates.'' The comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refers to information in the supplementary information section of the proposed rule, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reads as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The law (NVRA) applies only to state or local voting registration officials in those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> states and the District of Columbia that require a voter to register to vote before the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date of voting in a general election for public office. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three commenters expressed strong concerns about the procedures for obtaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorizations to mail at the special rates. These commenters:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Opposed the requirement that the local voting registration official submit PS Form  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3624 at each post office where the official will mail materials at the special bulk third-class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Suggested that PS Form 3624 be changed to indicate that the state or local voting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration official is the applicant, to be consistent with the Act;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

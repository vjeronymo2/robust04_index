			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New York, Jan 21 KYODO -- Japan supports an  indefinite, unconditional extension of the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) beyond its 1995 expiration since  it will promote peaceful use of nuclear power, its ambassador in  charge of disarmament said Friday [21 January].    Yoshitomo Tanaka made the remarks in a speech at the UN  headquaters at a meeting of the preliminary committee preparing  for a 1995 international conference to discuss extension of the  pact.    As reasons for Japan's support, Tanaka noted the treaty  calls  for nuclear powers to reduce nuclear arms and promotes the  prevention of nuclear proliferation, a major concern in the  post-Cold War era.    The NPT, which came into force in 1970, requires nuclear  powers to sincerely promote disarmament talks and bans  nonnuclear states from producing or possessing nuclear arms.    Japan became party to the NPT in 1975.    The preliminary committee was set up to promote  working-level  consultations before an international conference in 1995.    So far, 60 countries have expressed support for unlimited  extension of the treaty.    But nonaligned nations, mostly Asian and African developing  countries, have demanded that revisions be made in the treaty's  clauses and that extension be set for a limited period, saying  the treaty is discriminatory between nuclear powers and  nonnuclear countries.    A majority of support with 162 signatories is needed to  extend the treaty.</p>

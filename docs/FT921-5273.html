			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Citroen near pact on Chinese factory CITROEN, a division of Peugeot, the French car maker, expects to reach final agreement shortly with the Chinese government to set up a car assembly plant in central China. Mr Jacques Calvet, Peugeot chief executive, said yesterday that the deal, the most ambitious car project undertaken by the Peugeot group outside Europe, should be completed by the end of April. Citroen is to take a 30 per cent stake in a joint venture with the Second Automobile Works in Wuhan in central China to set up the plant to produce the Citroen ZX small family car. Mr Calvet said the plant would have capacity to produce nearly 40,000 cars a year in the first phase, but the expected agreement calls for this to be raised in three more stages to an eventual capacity of 150,000 cars a year. Mr Xavier Karcher, head of the Citroen division, said the joint venture would also set up engine and gearbox assembly operations at Wuhan. Total investment for the 150,000-car-a-year project is estimated at some FFr5bn. (Pounds 510m). Mr Karcher said that part of the financing would come from French government grants together with French state-guaranteed loans and commercial bank loans. In the initial stage of the project, Citroen will begin to supply later this year simple kits from Europe, including already painted bodies for final assembly in Wuhan. The eventual aim is to develop integrated car assembly facilities from panel stamping to final assembly. To increase the level of local content, some 26 European, mainly French, automotive components suppliers are also planning to set up joint ventures in China to supply the Citroen joint venture and the existing Peugeot small volume assembly plant in Canton, Mr Karcher said. The Citroen project is one of the most ambitious automotive ventures to be established in China. It will be second only to the two vehicle assembly operations already under development by the Volkswagen group of Germany.</p>

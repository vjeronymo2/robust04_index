			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / A date with the voters: David Butler puts his money on May 7 and a hung parliament Polling day will provide the only cure for election fever. But when will it be? An election can in law take place on any weekday. But since 1935, general elections have always been on a Thursday. The dissolution of parliament has to be proclaimed 23 days in advance but, except in February 1974, a week or two more of notice has been given. Since parliament has to be dissolved within five years of its first meeting, the last legal Thursday for the 1992 election falls on July 9. Of the 29 Thursdays between now and then, many are highly inconvenient. An election before February 15 would be on the old register and would disfranchise many people. But because of local delays in making the computer tapes of the new register available to the parties for canvass lists and for addressing envelopes, an election before early March might be chaotic. The government probably wants to get a Budget through parliament in early March, as well as completing the council tax legislation; that would leave April 2 or, more likely, April 9 as the earliest convenient date. The Conservatives might be deterred by the fact that there has not been an April election since 1880 (when Disraeli, deceived by two good by-elections, dissolved early - and lost). But precedent is no bar. After April 9 there is Easter (April 19), which blanks out two weeks, and then the local elections (May 7) cast their shadow. Since in 1992 the Conservatives are bound to lose many council seats won in the bumper year of 1988, May 7 becomes the only likely date between April 9 and early June: the general election would mask any local adversities. In 1979 local and general elections coincided without administrative or political disaster. If the May 7 date is missed, June 4 and June 11 are left as the only likely Thursdays before the holiday season and the final buffer of July 9. Since more Conservatives than Labour supporters go away on holiday it is hard to imagine Central Office letting Mr Major continue to the bitter end, quite apart from the mockery such procrastination would provoke. Ladbrokes, the leading bookies, currently offers 6 to 4 against a May election and 7 to 4 against April. The IG Futures Index, financial bookmakers, suggests the City finds the probabilities equal that the election will occur before the end of April or after. Both sets of odds seem to underestimate the likelihood of the prime minister taking the May 7 option. What will happen? Over the past four months the opinion polls have been recording Conservative and Labour as neck and neck, at about 40 per cent, with the Liberal Democrats at about 15 per cent (see table right: 'FT poll of polls'). The latest Mori poll suggests a move - or a blip - in Labour's favour. But what is certain is that the ratings will wobble again and again until the end of the campaign. The volatile electorate may quite well end by giving either Conservative or Labour the magic 4 per cent lead needed for a clear majority - 326 seats. Ladbrokes is offering even odds on a hung parliament; it is also quoting virtually even odds on the Conservatives or Labour emerging as the larger party. The more sophisticated IG Futures Index gives these break-even points  -Conservative 307, Labour 298 and Liberal Democrats 28. (Over the past three years the IG Index has shown Conservative expectations moving between 295 and 342, Labour between 265 and 307, and Liberal Democrates between 15 and 28.) The election is plainly wide open. Labour optimists point to the banana skins ahead for the government - health service misfortunes, poll tax demands and, above all, the elusive economic recovery. Conservative optimists point to low inflation, to the Maastricht settlement, to the doubts over Labour's competence, and (whistling in the dark) to the escape from recession. The Liberal Democrats can only trust to revulsion at the yah-boo politics between the basically consensual big parties and to the ever-greater skills of the electorate in tactical voting (in 1987, 228 out of the 376 Tory victors had a Liberal Democrat runner-up). No one knows how the voters will turn, especially during the hectic days of the campaign. Party strategists and pundits inevitably look to the past. Conservatives are prone to rely on Anthony King's evidence that, before every one of Britain's five post-war changes of government, the party in power has been consistently behind in the polls. In the past few months that has not been true for the Conservatives. Labour points to Peter Kellner's evidence that in every election since 1959 the governing party has lost ground in the course of the campaign: therefore, if Labour goes in on level terms next April or May that would offer good hope of it ending up 4 per cent ahead and in full power. The evidence of recent elections can be seen in the table bottom left ('Governing party's lead'). Except in 1979 the party that was ahead six months earlier won. Except in February 1974 the party that was ahead one month before the election won. The only contest was in 1970 when there was a really big shift between the main parties in the final month (but in February 1974 and again in June 1983 the Liberal Alliance vote jumped by 10 per cent during the campaign). One should always be sceptical of such statistical arguments. Bear in mind the sophisticated version of Murphy's Law devised by Charles Goodhart, of the London School of Economics: any government (or opposition) trying to exploit even the best-established of statistical relationships to control an economic (or political) variable will come unstuck. Yet the future can be predicted only if we assume that it will in some measure resemble the past. Logically any percentage division of the vote could produce almost any outcome in terms of seats. But, as casino-owners know, there are regularities about the behaviour of large numbers. Variations in swing are likely to cancel out, affecting all parties almost equally. Therefore, the last election may still be a good guide to what will happen this time. The Liberal Democrats seem likely, for local reasons, to hold on to almost all their current 22 seats. It is highly probable that, whether they secure 15 per cent or 25 per cent of the nationwide vote they will not fall below 15 MPs or exceed 30. Working from the 1987 results, it is easy to set out the likely outcome for any given division of the vote between Conservative and Labour (see table bottom right: 'Division of vote'). On these figures Labour only secures a clear majority if it is 4 per cent ahead of the Conservatives. That would require an 8 per cent swing from 1987, which (except for 1945) would be the largest swing in British history. Of course, such figures can never be an exact guide. The 'Other' total may be changed by Scottish National party gains. The Liberal Democrats may fare better or worse for local or national reasons. Any tactical voting may change the Conservative-Labour relationship. (In the 1970s the rule that had held good from 1931 to 1970 - a 1 per cent swing means a loss of 18 seats - went sour. As the table shows, in the 1980s a 1 per cent swing only means the loss of 10 or so seats). Labour needs an 8 per cent swing to win - and except in 1945 there has never been such a swing (the 5.2 per cent swing in 1979 was the largest since the war). But the Conservatives must keep the swing below 4 per cent to stay in power. Ladbrokes' even odds on a hung parliament cannot be too bad a bet.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- DIVISION OF THE VOTE BETWEEN CONSERVATIVE AND LABOUR  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Swing       Con lead               Seats from        on Lab        -----------------------     Clear '87         in vote       Con   Lab   Lib   Other     majority  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 0%          12%           376   229   22    23        Con 102 4%           4%           326   272   29    23        Con 2 5%           2%           314   285   28    23        None 6%           0%           303   299   25    23        None 7%          -2%           293   309   25    23        None 8%          -4%           273   326   28    23        Lab 2 9%          -6%           258   338   30    23        Lab 26  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- GOVERNING PARTY'S LEAD  ----------------------------------------------------------------------               Gallup      Gallup      Majority     Majority               6 months    1 month     votes in     seats after Party         before      before      election     election  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1959 Con         0          +7          +4.2         +100 1964 Con       -12          -3          -1.9           -4 1966 Lab        +6          +8          +7.3          +96 1970 Lab       -11          +7          -2.4          -30 1974* Con       -7          +2          +0.6         (-21) 1974** Lab     +16          +3          +3.5           +3 1979 Lab        +5          -5          -7.1          -33 1983 Con        +7         +18         +15.2         +144 1987 Con        +8         +10         +11.8         +102  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * February; ** October  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT POLL OF POLLS (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------            Con       Labour     Lib Dem  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Sept       40.5      39.2       15.9 Oct        40.3      42.1       13.2 Nov        38.8      42.2       14.3 Dec        39.5      39.4       16.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

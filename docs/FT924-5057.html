			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / International Company News: Nomura will repay Y23bn to investors NOMURA Securities, Japan's largest stockbroker, is to reimburse investors who lost money on step-up coupon property-backed securities and will halve commissions on investment trusts to stimulate demand. Nomura said it will repay Y23bn (Dollars 185.5m) to clients, who have lost more than 40 per cent of their investments on the bonds. The move follows an admission that Nomura failed to warn investors of potential risks of its foreign property backed securities, Mr Yasuhiro Mizuuchi, Nomura's vice-president, admitted breaching industry regulations, which require brokers to warn investors of risks involved in investment products, due to a 'sales accident'. Investor confidence was shattered by revelations of brokers' loss compensation on stock losses for favoured clients. Nomura said it would compensate 14,300 investors the face value of the property backed securities, and pay 6 per cent interest. The broker sold Dollars 336m worth of bonds in 1989 and 1990, marketing the products as high-return investments. The announcement could encourage other retail investors who feel they were misled by brokers in making securities investments to seek compensation from other Japanese brokers. Nomura claims the losses due to the reimbursement will not affect annual profits, as it will try to sell real estate assets to raise the funds. But the Japanese real estate market remains stagnant, and Nomura may face difficul-ties in liquidating its land holdings. In a further attempt to appease retail investors, Nomura will also halve the commission on its new 10-year securities investment trust funds starting next week. The move comes as the ministry of finance is liberalising commissions for investment trust funds, in an attempt to encourage investors back into the market.</p>

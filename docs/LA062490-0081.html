			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NAVRATILOVA GETS WARMED UP, 6-0, 6-2  </P> <P> Martina Navratilova is hoping that nine is her lucky number.  </P> <P> Navratilova needed only 45 minutes to win the Eastbourne grass-court title for  the ninth time Saturday, and now she will set her sights on an unprecedented  ninth Wimbledon title.  </P> <P> Navratilova trounced Gretchen Magers, 6-0, 6-2, allowing her opponent only 24  points in blustery conditions at Eastbourne, England.  </P> <P> "She shouldn't feel humiliated," Navratilova said. "She didn't play badly --  everything just went my way. She didn't lose it, I won it."  </P> <P> Navratilova showed no signs of the knee problem that required treatment during  Friday's semifinal win over Jana Novotna.  </P> <P> "I felt really nimble and light on my feet," she said. "The knee felt better  today than for months. Today my knees felt like they were 15. Yesterday they  felt 50."  </P> <P> Pete Sampras beat Gilad Bloom of Israel, 7-6, 7-6, to win his first grass-court  title at Manchester, England.  </P> <P> The 18-year-old Californian, the youngest player to win an ATP event this year,  took the tiebreakers by scores of 11-9 and 7-3.  </P> <P> Sampras wasted four set points before finally winning the first tiebreaker.  </P> <P> Games again went with serve in the second set until Sampras trailed, 5-4, and,  0-40, on his serve. He won the next five points and tied it again, 6-6, then  won the tiebreaker and the match.  </P> <P> Guy Forget won the all-French final of a grass-court tournament at Wentworth,  England, by getting past Henri Leconte, 7-5, 3-6, 6-3.  </P> <P> "The court was a bit soft, but if I can play well on that it's a good omen for  Wimbledon, where the courts are perfect," Forget said.  </P> <P> "Things are going just right for me at the moment. I'm at my highest world  ranking of 20 and have been seeded at Wimbledon for the first time."  </P> <P> Forget, seeded 11th at Wimbledon, beat John McEnroe and Jonas Svensson on his  way to the championship match.  </P> <P> The match ended spectacularly, with Forget serving three consecutive aces to  reach match point.  </P> <P> Forget double-faulted on triple set point before blistering another serve that  Leconte could only return into the net.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Maltese Foreign Minister Guido de </F> Marco by Reinhold Brender in La Valletta on 20 June: "`Malta  Wants To Be Bridge Across the Mediterranean'"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Malta -- the biggest island  gave the state its name -- sees itself today as part of Europe  and, by its geography and culture, feels qualified to be a  "bridge" across the sea to the Mediterranean's southern shores.  As Foreign Minister De Marco said in an interview with  FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, Malta can strengthen the European Union  [EU]. De Marco is hoping that negotiations on his country's  accession to the European Union will start at the end of this  year or in early 1995. [passage omitted]    After the conservatives took power from the Labor Party  seven  years ago (the electoral law had meanwhile been changed, so that  the party that received the most votes also got a majority in  parliament), they submitted a membership application in July  1990. In June 1993, Brussels noted that Malta fulfilled the  conditions for EU membership, but posed certain conditions: The  economy, which was oriented along socialist models under the  preceding Labor rule, had to be modified through comprehensive  reform.    De Marco, who is also deputy government head, believes that  important conditions have been fulfilled now and that the  question is no longer whether Malta will join, but when it will  do so. To prove this, the foreign minister refers to efforts  for economic opening: Important business branches have been  liberalized, manufacturing industries restructured, services  promoted. According to official figures, 4.5 percent of the  population who are fit to work are without jobs, and a  considerable economic growth was achieved last year. At the  beginning of next year, Malta will unilaterally lift duties  toward the EU, compensating for the loss in revenues by a  value-added tax, which has not existed on Malta so far. Under  these conditions, negotiations should "not be very complicated,"  De Marco said. Even today, three-fourths of the country's  foreign trade is with the EU.    It is widely assumed that EU membership would seal Malta's  departure from the officially nonaligned and neutral, yet in  fact sometimes fickle and anti-Western, course that was pursued  during the 16 years of Labor government. Under Prime Minister  Dom Mintoff, Malta concluded cooperation agreements with Moscow,  Beijing, and even Tripoli, with which it used to cooperate  temporarily in the military arena. [passage omitted]    Even though, according to government calculations, economic  advantages will outweigh the disadvantages (fishery and some  industrial branches are regarded as problem areas), Malta is  trying to take this step mainly for political reasons. De Marco  says the concept of nonalignment was "outdated" after the end of  the East-West antagonism. [passage omitted] To be firmly  anchored in the EU will offer Malta security, while neutrality  without any affiliation can be dangerous. A few days ago, when  he was the first representative of his country to have the honor  to address the Western European Union in Brussels, the foreign  minister said about the defense organization of the Europeans:  "We accept this responsibility not only as another element of  the common set of laws, to which all Europeans have to be  committed, but also as part of the political finality that we  share with our European partners."    Even though a small country, Malta is of strategic  importance, Marco said in the interview. Cooperation between  the North and South, and thus the "question of the  Mediterranean," are shifting into the center of international  politics. Malta has been one of the first countries to point  out that European security is inseparably linked with the  Mediterranean. Malta is taking part in the dialogue between the  countries on the southern and northern shores of the  Mediterranean, it is pursuing the objective of a Conference for  Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean (CSCM), to be  modeled after the CSCE, as well as a Mediterranean Council,  modeled after the Council of Europe. "The Mediterranean will  determine Malta's future as it has determined its history."    The foreign minister is convinced that Malta's voice will be  heard in the EU. [passage omitted] De Marco said he understood  that the EU must first "digest" Austria's accession and -- after  positive referendums in those countries -- those of Finland,  Sweden, and Norway before it will be Malta's turn. Finally, the  minister emphasized that "positive signals" from Brussels could  strengthen his government's dynamism aimed at EU accession.  Contrary to the government party, the Labor Party is against  Malta's EU membership and has called for close ties. In the  view of the Labor Party, such ties should permit the country to  benefit from cooperation with Europe while it would not have to  fear the disadvantages of EU membership.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Mainayev] </F>   [Text] Bishkek 14 June TASS -- "It's no ethnic Chernobyl  (nuclear disaster) yet, but `peak hour'", thus President of  Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] Asker Akayev graphically assessed the  state of current migration process from the republic. Akayev  intends to find a way out of the prevailing situation during his  meeting today with representatives of the Slav diaspora in  Kirghizia.    At present the republic's over four million population  consists of 56.5 per cent native Kirghizs, but the people of  Russian, Ukrainian and Belarussian nationalities account for  21.1 per cent.    Four years ago there were 905.4 thousand Russian-speaking  people living in Kirghizia. Now this diaspora has shrunk to  almost 170 thousand. The process of migration is gathering  momentum everyday.    According to the president, this process can be stopped only  by giving official status to the Russian language, and  introducing duel citizenship. But both alternatives run  contrary to the Constitution of Kirghizia. The republic's  present parliament has more than once demonstrated that it does  not intend to amend or change the fundamental law. How to find  a compromise, stop migration, without arousing a wave of  nationalism, this is what is causing the present "headache" to  President Akayev.</p>

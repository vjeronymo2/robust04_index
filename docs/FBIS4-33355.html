When the country of origin cannot be determined through  the provisions specified in paragraph No. 1 [fraccion], the  country of origin of a good will be the country or countries of  origin of the material or materials that give basic shape  [caracter esencial] to that good. The provisions of this  paragraph will not be applicable to a good specifically  described as a set or a whole [conjunto] in keeping with the  nomenclature of the Tariff of the Law on General Import Tax or  to a good whose tariff classification is that of a set, or a  whole, or a compound good, in keeping with general rule No. 3,  contained in article No. 2 of the aforementioned law.    3.

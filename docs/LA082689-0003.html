			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: DOWN IN THE VALLEY  </P> <P> It is never calm in the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> At any given moment, kamikaze activists are raising hell over a pot full of  issues that include, but are not limited to, crime, sex, billboards, barking  dogs and whether or not God favors a new church in Chatsworth.  </P> <P> I have attended neighborhood meetings more volatile than campus riots, in which  all forms of human decency are suspended while otherwise amiable folks roll on  the floor with their hands locked on each other's throats.  </P> <P> Ladies whose normal mode of protest is limited to turning off the "Phil Donahue  Show" in a fit of mannered pique end up swearing like stevedores over plans to  close a mini-mall.  </P> <P> It really doesn't matter who or what the enemy is, so long as it is chewable;  sometimes they even eat each other when they are caught up in a feeding frenzy  with no other adversary in sight.  </P> <P> That, however, is not currently the case on the western end of the Valley. If  you look closely at the chubby guy splashing cheerfully amid a school of  circling tiger sharks, you will notice it is Hal Bernson.  </P> <P> You remember Hal. He's the former Northridge T-shirt salesman who prides  himself on being God's best friend on the L.A. City Council.  </P> <P> Hal is the guy who tried to rid the Valley of moral filth by declaring war on  topless bars (the topless bars won) and then suggested the way to clean up  crime in a Northridge housing project was to move all the Mexicans out.  </P> <P> It wasn't worded exactly that way, but we all knew what he meant. Get rid of  the Latinos and it's good-bye crime, hello happiness.  </P> <P> At any rate, Bernson is not having a good summer. In July he was accused of  violating campaign-funding laws, and in August he is the object of a recall  move for allegedly conspiring with land developers to concrete the Valley.  </P> <P> The accusation by Common Cause that the councilman spent campaign money where  he shouldn't has passed with hardly a gasp of surprise.  </P> <P> However, the charge that he sleeps with land developers could get him tossed  out of office. Better he should have slept with his secretary than to cozy up  to builders at a time when they are viewed with less warmth than a Jew in  Jordan.  </P> <P> As a result, Hapless Hal is the target of an organization called CURB (Citizens  United to Recall Bernson), led by a lanky, slow-talking guy who is madder than  hell and not going to take it anymore.  </P> <P> His name is Walter Prince and he owns a custodial business in the Valley,  though at the moment his full-time job is trying to get rid of the man he  believes is politically beholden to people who build things.  </P> <P> It is Bernson, says Prince, who is responsible for wall-to-wall apartments in  an area of Northridge once zoned for people with chickens and happy little  children playing in large yards.  </P> <P> It is Bernson, says Prince, who wants to tear down a Chatsworth hill where old  people stroll to build a shopping center six times the size of the Northridge  Mall.  </P> <P> And it is Bernson, says Prince, who wants to condemn 100 acres of land that  include his custodial business and turn it over to land speculators.  </P> <P> "That last thing did it," Prince drawled the other day in an upstairs office  over a small garment factory where rows of ladies hunch over sewing machines.  "I always knew he was being paid by land developers to do what they want, but  this is too much."  </P> <P> Prince, 53, says the recall idea came to him not in a dream but at a meeting.  Bernson was being ripped apart in absentia when a man yelled, "Recall the  s.o.b.!" Well, actually, he didn't use initials.  </P> <P> "I went home," Prince says, "and said to myself, 'Why not?' "  </P> <P> Now a small army of volunteers is gathering 18,000 signatures on petitions that  urge bouncing Bernson into the twilight zone.  </P> <P> I wanted to talk to the councilman about this but his press secretary,  suggesting I am not a sweet person, said her boss would discuss urban growth  but not the recall.  </P> <P> "Traffic," Bernson Himself Said Wisely when he came on the phone.  </P> <P> Traffic?  </P> <P> "People aren't objecting to land development, they're objecting to the fact  they can't get to work in the morning."  </P> <P> Ah-ha.  </P> <P> "Traffic," he said again, as wisely as the first time.  </P> <P> Then he hinted darkly that there are forces afoot that exploit growth problems  for political advancement. "Not everyone," he said, "is honest and legitimate."  </P> <P> Prince wants Bernson out for that very reason and has summoned other sharks to  join the feast. Whether or not they will join remains to be seen, but the  circle around the guy bobbing in the water does seem to be getting tighter by  the minute.  </P></p>

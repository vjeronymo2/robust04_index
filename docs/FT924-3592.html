			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Arts: Bosses reduce their mutual entertainment - Sponsorship This is the time of year when arts sponsorship makes news. Last week the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts released its annual survey of the size of the sponsorship honey pot; next Friday ABSA entertains its Patron, the Prince of Wales, and hundreds of corporate chairmen, arts directors, and general hangers on at the annual awards ceremony for imaginative (or enduring) sponsorships. Sponsorship has so far survived the recession remarkably well. ABSA has come up with a total spend of Pounds 64.4m in 1991-92, a rise of 14 per cent on the year. However, as ever, the statistics hide the real story. Direct sponsorship has performed brilliantly, growing by 28 per cent to Pounds 57.5m while money invested in corporate membership schemes has fallen by 37 per cent to Pounds 7.8m. It is obvious what has happened. Companies are concentrating their money on sponsorships which might give commercial benefits, and cutting back on some of their corporate memberships, which are mainly used for entertaining - sometimes directors just enjoying each other's company. As ever festivals and opera remain the favoured areas. But while virtually all the Pounds 14.2m that festivals received was in sponsorship, opera attracted Pounds 12m this way and another Pounds 4.3m through membership schemes. ABSA's director general, Colin Tweedy, expects slower growth in 1992-93. The 30 short listed companies from over 500 nominations for Friday's prize day contain the biggest ever northern presence - six companies - reflecting the successful opening of ABSA North, based at Halifax. Among the lesser known names at the National Theatre for the awards will be Sherlock Hairshop from Hexham, which competes with Champagne Piper-Heidsieck and the Harwood Company for First Time Sponsor. Other names are more familiar. Marks &amp; Spencer and Sainsbury's battle it out with Turner Kenneth Brown for the Long Term Commitment prize while Cable &amp; Wireless, Lloyds Bank, Brazil and Thorn EMI are the big names up for British Art Overseas. The other key 'Oscar', for the best Corporate Programme, will go to either Mobil, Northern Electric or VAG. Sponsorship is growing thanks to small and medium sized companies. The minnows seeking recognition and the Sponsorship by a Small Business prize, are Carroll, Dempsey &amp; Thirkell, a London based design group; Edwin Shirley Trucking, also from the capital; and Renwicks Garages of Newton Abbott. The manufacturers of fast moving consumer goods have been conspicuously absent as arts sponsors. This could be changing. Unilever is getting more involved through its subsidiaries like Lever Bros and Van den Bergh's. The collective pot was Pounds 50,000 to support Hamlet and The Tempest at the RSC. This allows the RSC to apply for top-up money from the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme, which is designed to encourage new sponsors. The programmes and front of house material will feature three brands, Persil, Comfort and Flora, rather than the Unilever corporate identity. Another part of the group, Walls Ice Cream, has put Pounds 10,000 towards this year's Bristol Old Vic's panto, Aladdin. The money has been doubled through the BSIS. The 1992 Mobil Playwriting Competition for the Royal Exchange Theatre has been won by Simon Burke for his play The Lodger. He receives Pounds 15,000 and five other writers will share Pounds 25,000. The Royal Exchange will certainly produce one of the short listed plays, ideally The Lodger. The Mobil biennial is still supreme in the under-sponsored area of drama competitions. It has a good track record, with Amongst Barbarians and Your Home in the West among the previous winners. Organising the whole enterprise  -there were 1,250 entries - costs Mobil Pounds 175,000, but it is sticking with the venture. Unlike some other oil companies Mobil is happy with its investment in the arts. It also contributes Pounds 175,000 to a lavish touring production of a a good old pot boiler which it can use for entertaining: this year, Charlie's Aunt; next year, Crucifer of Blood. The death of arts sponsorship has been much exaggerated. With good marketing of an attractive product companies are prepared to invest funds tocreate new arts events. In May 1993 the BOC Covent Garden Festival will take place, building on a rather faltering debut in 1990. BOC is using the Festival to make a Pounds 500,000, three year, commitment to the arts. The original backer, Guardian Royal Exchange, is maintaining the link, committing Pounds 300,000 over three years, and American Express has come up with Pounds 50,000. With top-ups from the BSIS and one off contributions, the joint chairmen of the Festival, restauranteurs Laurence Isaacson and Neville Abraham, expect to have Pounds 1m in the bank by the New Year, enough to underwrite three successive festivals. The Festival has attracted backers because it is targetted - on youth, and on opera and music theatre. Ironically, neither the Royal Opera House nor the ENO is participating directly but Isaacson has gained access to a 2,000 seat auditorium in the heart of the district which will provide a spectacular venue for National Youth Opera: the Freemason's Hall. This will be the first time it will be open to non-Masons. The Donmar Warehouse, St Paul's Church (for Monteverdi's Vespers), as well as the Piazza, are other venues already booked. Sponsorship in kind, and mutually beneficial deals, are a feature of the new hard-nosed attitude to sponsorship. The current Patrick Caulfield show at Hyde Park's Serpentine Gallery has a splendid catalogue, thanks to the Academy Group, publishers of Art &amp; Design magazine. Academy has paid for the all colour catalogue and given the Serpentine 600 copies, which should bring it over Pounds 5,000 in income. The catalogues are also incorporated in the latest issue of Art &amp; Design, increasing its appeal. Add in a Royal College of Art dinner for the artist and the investment tops Pounds 20,000.</p>

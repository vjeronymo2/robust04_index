			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Ford Europe trims loss to Dollars 960m Ford's European automotive operations, including Jaguar, posted a slightly reduced net loss of Dollars 960m in 1993 - its third successive heavy annual loss. However, excluding Jaguar, Ford's UK luxury car subsidiary, the European operations 'could be profitable' in 1994, the US carmaker forecast yesterday. A return to profit would depend on the continuation of the economic recovery in the UK and on an increase in west European new vehicle demand. Ford has suffered one of the weakest financial performances of the big six volume carmakers in Europe in the last three years with total net losses of Dollars 3.3bn in the period including a loss of Dollars 1.29bn in 1992 and Dollars 1.08bn in 1991. Ford said its European operations had been hit heavily last year by the 16 per cent decline in new vehicle demand in west Europe and by currency fluctuations. Its results were burdened by a pre-tax operating exchange loss of Dollars 485m for the full year due chiefly to the weakness of the lira, the pound and the French franc. Excluding Jaguar, Ford's European automotive operations sufferred a loss of Dollars 407m last year following a loss of Dollars 647m in 1992 (including a one-time Dollars 334m restructuring charge) and Dollars 478m in 1991. The US carmaker has been forced to undertake a drastic rationalisation of its European operations and has cut its workforce, excluding Jaguar, by 15.4 per cent to 83,000 people by the end of 1993 from 98,100 in November 1992. The company said yesterday that the restructuring programme had been completed following a cut of 4,600 jobs or 23 per cent of the salaried workforce and of 10,500 jobs or 14 per cent of the hourly workforce. Costs had been reduced 'substantially'. Ford, which is in fourth place in the west European car market behind the Volkswagen group of Germany, General Motors of the US and the PSA Peugeot Citroen group of France, increased its market share marginally last year to 11.4 per cent (excluding Jaguar) from 11.2 per cent a year earlier. The higher share was due largely to the success of its Mondeo large family car, while the Fiesta, Escort and Granada/Scorpio all lost ground. Vehicle sales from its plants in Germany and Belgium fell by 10 per cent to 831,216, from its UK plants by 11 per cent to 421,939 and from its Spanish plants by 32 per cent to 211,413. Jaguar, the UK luxury carmaker which Ford acquired in 1989 for Pounds 1.6bn (Dollars 2.4bn), cut its operating loss last year to Dollars 371m (including one-time restructuring costs of Dollars 174m) from a loss of Dollars 412m in 1992 and a loss of Dollars 354m in 1991. Excluding the restructuring actions the results improved by Dollars 215m reflecting a 22 per cent increase in retail sales to 27,000 - including a 47 per cent jump in sales in the US to 13,000 - and savings from cost reduction programmes. Jaguar is being more closely integrated with Ford's European operations. Later this year production of the stamped body panels for Jaguar cars will be transferred from Venture Pressings, a joint venture with GKN, the UK automotive components group, to the Ford plant at Halewood, Merseyside, which has free capacity.</p>

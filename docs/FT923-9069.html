			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank loses its immunity to recession - Questions posed by poor results joy at others' misfortunes - crept into analysts' reactions to Deutsche Bank's poor figures this week. Germany's biggest bank, the most powerful and profitable in the country, suddenly appeared to have run out of steam. 'It looks as though the great ship of state Deutsche Bank has at last ground to a halt,' quipped one analyst, commenting on the 3.2 per cent decline in total profits to DM3.06bn (Dollars 2.08bn) for the first six months of the year. Deutsche's relatively weak performance was accentuated by comparison with the figures put out by its smaller competitors in recent days. Commerzbank, Germany's third-largest bank, increased its total profits by 17.5 per cent and Dresdner Bank, the second-biggest, by 15 per cent. Other large banks also showed themselves immune to recession. Yesterday, Bayerische Vereinsbank said that partial operating profits - excluding trading gains - rose by 28 per cent, and in recent days Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechselbank reported a 22.8 per cent increase, and DePfa, a Wiesbaden-based mortgage bank, improved profits by over 30 per cent. Where Deutsche Bank goes other German banks tend to follow: the question troubling analysts and investors is if the Deutsche Bank slowdown is a leading indicator for the German banking sector. On the face of it, the results show that Germany's banks are still capable of generating robust, double-digit growth in profits. The sector's prosperity is linked to developments in eastern Germany. Germany's banks have prospered as a result of strong credit demand from west German companies wanting to invest in eastern Germany. It is this credit demand - calculated to be an annualised 11 per cent in March to June and at more than 12 per cent in the first quarter of the year  -which has helped stimulate the growth in money supply which in turn prompted the Bundesbank to increase interest rates to ever higher levels, most recently the 0.75 per increase in the discount rate last month. Despite the interest rate rises - which in theory should discourage further borrowing - the demand for loans has remained strong. Much to the annoyance of the Bundesbank, lending to finance projects in the east is 'interest rate insensitive'. A multitude of government and other incentives make it attractive to borrow money to finance new projects, even though interest rates are at historically high levels. Coupled to strong loan demand, banks' first-half profits climbed because of the recovery in German stock and bond markets in the first part of the year, which boosted fee-income and the result from own-account trading. The banks' profits also benefited from the relative weakness of Japanese, US and British competitors, which because of domestic problems were not able to pursue and win high-quality international business as effectively as the German banks. Deutsche Bank's woes should not be overestimated: the drop in profits was from record levels and its interest rate margin, though down, is higher than other banks. Deutsche's operating profits are about as the results from the next three biggest banks combined. It attributed the drop in profits to the general deterioration of the German economy and the rest of the world. Specifically, it blamed higher costs of financing customer deposits and a growing role in lower margin interbank lending. More generally, it seems likely the bank's size ensures it is the first to feel the effects of a slowdown - and equally likely that other German banks will in turn follow suit. Over the past year, bank shares' have under-performed the DAX 30 index of top German companies by more than 7 per cent, despite the profits increase. This under-performance reflects investors' worries about the impact of interest rates on the banking business which have, in the event, proved unfounded.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- GERMAN BANKS' FIRST-HALF GROUP RESULTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Operating     Change     Net int.

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The return of heavy selling in global bond markets brought another slide in stock index futures, following the release of US economic data, writes Joel Kibazo. Dealers reported a dull morning after the March contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,320. Light selling saw it drift gently lower before steadying over the lunchtime period. It was the early afternoon release of the US Purchasing Managers' price index that started the sell off in bond markets and prompted the sharp retreat in the futures. The fall in March pulled the underlying cash market lower, though the contract remained at a large discount to cash for most of the afternoon. Traders said there were few opportunities for arbitrage trading. March closed at 3,251, down 69 on its previous close and at a 13 point discount to its estimated fair value premium to cash of minus 8. Volume was 22,102 lots. Turnover in the FT-SE Mid-250 futures contract on Liffe was 628 lots as it finished at 3,264. The same contract on the OMLX traded 117 contracts, with open interest recorded at around 2,867. In traded options, volume was 32,799. Turnover in the FT-SE 100 was 13,936 lots and 3,637 in Abbey National, the most active stock option.</p>

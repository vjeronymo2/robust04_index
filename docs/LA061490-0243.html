			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: WOODY ALLEN'S CONTROL IS SLIPPING IN THE 'MALL'  </P> <P> WOODY ALLEN has sometimes been called "a control freak," but he had to  surrender a bit of the old Woody autonomy when he agreed to co-star in a Walt  Disney movie with Bette Midler, under the direction of Paul Mazursky.  </P> <P> Months and months ago, I had the scoop that this film, tentatively titled  "Scenes From a Mall," would happen and that Woody would depart from his total  auteur pattern. And now the project is in rehearsal in New York.  </P> <P> And guess who isn't very happy? That's right. Woody. Mazursky knows how to get  along with Bette Midler, one of Disney's 2,000-pound gorillas, as a result of  her hits for Touchstone. Mazursky directed Bette in "Down and Out in Beverly  Hills." The outsider is Woody, who has seen happier days; he isn't used to  actresses throwing their weight around on his movies.  </P> <P> This will all be denied, of course. But I'm not going to retract it.  </P> <P> TAYLOR JOHN, age 8, will tour in a bus and truck company of "Les Miserables"  during his school vacation. He is the son of former Yankee pitcher and, some  say, eventual Hall of Famer Tommy John. . . . The fabled movie writer-director  of "Kramer vs. Kramer," Robert Benton, is going to be at the helm of the movie  version of E. L. Doctorow's period novel "Billy Bathgate." Tom Stoppard has  written the screenplay, and filming begins late this summer. The star is none  other than Dustin Hoffman and his co-star will be the hot young actress Nicole  Kidman. (You can also catch Nicole any minute in the much-ballyhooed "Days of  Thunder," opposite Tom Cruise.). . . . While the Cruise-Bruckheimer-Simpson  movie will make a big summer splash for Paramount, the talk of the cognoscenti  is about that same studio's flick "Ghost," which insiders believe will be a  sleeper hit. Actor Tony Goldwyn, son of Sam Jr. and grandson of the famous  one-and-only king of the malaprop, is going to be noticed in this one. He'll  also be acting at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts in the  play "Carthaginians" by Frank McGuinness, co-starring with Kate Burton and  Maria Tucci.  </P> <P> RECENTLY, on the "Sally Jessy Raphael Show," talent agent Marty Ingels blasted  the supermarket tabloids for their distortions and inaccuracies. He declared  that the veteran actor Rory Calhoun had died after being tormented by these  weeklies. When questioned by Janet Charlton of The Star, Ingels said, "I know  -- I went to his funeral."  </P> <P> But Rory's agent, Dale Garrick, says the actor is alive and well, living in the  San Fernando Valley. Hmmm, even the tabloids have never been THAT far out in  left field!  </P></p>

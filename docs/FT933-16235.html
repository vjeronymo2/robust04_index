			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Letter: Help computer sector by scrapping tariffs Sir, Decisions are about to be taken behind closed doors in various foreign capitals which will have a serious effect on thousands of jobs in the computer industry of Britain and other EC member states. I refer to the decisions on whether or not to remove the high level of tariff and duties which apply to most semiconductors (14 per cent) and computer parts (4-6 per cent) imported from outside the EC. I would like to draw your attention to the following points: Digital alone employs about 7,000 people in the UK (and about 30,000 in the EC as a whole). Seventy per cent of its integrated computer systems plant in Scotland is exported to the rest of the EC. Digital is not alone. Hundreds of thousands of other jobs depend on the European production and sales of companies such as IBM, Unisys, Compaq, Apple, Intel and many more. The computer industry is vital to Britain and Europe's future, yet it is competing with one hand tied behind its back. Our competitors in Japan, the US and Canada have abolished duties on computer parts and semiconductors and can therefore source these items duty free from anywhere in the world. We cannot. Digital wishes to expand its UK operations to serve the EC and global market from the UK. We have made enormous investments in manufacturing capacity to this end. Our ability to manufacture is substantially impaired by tariffs which distort our sourcing and limit our ability to compete. The duties are protectionist serving only to protect the narrow vested interests of certain component makers and 'board staffers' in France, Germany and Holland. Protectionism is not the answer. It only plays into the hands of our competitors. Eliminating the duties will strengthen the computer industry in the UK and the EC, creating jobs, encouraging investment and creating export opportunities. The EC is looking to trade off a reduction in duties on computer parts and semiconductors for American 'concessions' in other areas (such as textiles)  -concessions which may, or many not, be forthcoming. The competitiveness of our sunrise industries is too important to be played with in this way. It is in the UK and the EC's own interest to abolish the duties now - a point recognised years ago by our competitors in the US, Japan and Canada. Time is running out. A deal may be done on the fringes of the Group of Seven discussions in Tokyo as early as tomorrow. I call upon the European Commission, the British government and its partners in the EC to look to the real interests of the European computer industry as a whole. Eliminate computer parts tariffs now: don't gamble with the future of this vital sunrise industry and the manufacturing jobs within it.

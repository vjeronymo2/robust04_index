			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By A.R. Wilkie] </F>   [Text] Dissidents who are on the run from the Chinese  police say their outlawed labour organisation is getting  stronger, even though two of its leaders are in jail and a third  has fled the country.    Liu Mianchun, who was detained briefly during the visit by  the U.S. Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, has so far  escaped arrest while travelling in east China, gathering support  for his Alliance for the Protection of Labourers Rights -- or  the Labour Alliance.    The Labour Alliance, which models itself on the Polish union  Solidarity, claims to have a core membership in several  provinces.    "Give us until the end of the year, and we will have a  national framework," Liu said.    "We need six months to set up an organisation in every  provincial capital and in the big cities," said Zhang Lin,  another labour organiser who is also travelling around the  country.    "We are looking for people who have been in prison, who have  stood up well under pressure, people with that sort of  experience. We can't have weak-willed people who are going to  betray their comrades and their friends," he said.    The Labour Alliance says it carefully examines the  qualifications of potential members and is setting up several  levels of membership. The front line will campaign openly, but  behind it will be second and third tiers operating covertly and  waiting to take the place of the front line should its members  be arrested.    Faced with such an organisational structure, the Communist  Party cannot fail to be aware of the parallels with its own  early revolutionary years.    It is impossible to gauge the support for such organisations  as the Labour Alliance. Activists claim a membership of 300 but  an effective police sweep of key figures -- who may total no  more than a few dozen people around the country -- could  probably cripple the fledgling organisation.    Two organisers, Yuan Hongbing and Zhou Guoqiang, are already  in jail, as is Xiao Biguang, a friend of Yuan. Another  organiser, Wang Jiaqi, a close colleague of the exiled labour  leader Han Dongfang, was also arrested but later escaped and  fled the country.    Predictions that the Labour Alliance could mount a genuine  challenge to the Communist Party are premature.    But the Communist Party is clearly worried because it is  aware that dissatisfaction among the peasantry and workers is  ripe for exploitation by competing political forces. While the  Labour Alliance is concentrating on the peasantry and state  workers, other activists are trying to establish independent  trade unions in joint ventures in China's southern boom towns,  where working conditions are sometimes comparable to sweatshops.    According to the activists, some smaller, pro-democracy  organisations have joined the Labour Alliance. To do this, the  organisations agree to give up advocacy of violence and abide by  the rules of the Labour Alliance.    "Some organisations don't want to give up their advocacy of  violence," Zhang said.    "Other people think we're too dangerous because this is  organised. It is completely different from the individual  dissent of the past."    Support for the Labour Alliance is also coming from hitherto  more conservative groups, according to labour activists. They  claim that Christians are increasingly seeing political struggle  as the only way ahead. Younger members of the  officially-sanctioned democratic parties are increasingly  frustrated by these parties' lack of substance, and are also  turning to overtly pro-democracy, if illegal, organisations.    It is not clear whether this is a widespread trend or just a  few isolated cases of interest in the Labour Alliance. It does  seem, however, that the Communist Party is eager to crack down  on the unofficial church -- aware that it could become a focus  for political dissatisfaction, as it did in Eastern Europe.    Further evidence that the leadership is nervous as the fifth  anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre approaches came from  Beijing University last week. Last Monday cadres at the  university, which was at the heart of the 1989 anti-government  demonstrations, held a meeting at which they were told to  heighten vigilance in the run-up to June 4. Although students  are not known to have formed a pro-democracy organisation at the  university, activists are at work, a source said.    "Leaflets commemorating those who were killed on June 4,  1989, are appearing in dormitories, slipped under doors in the  middle of the night," a former student, with links on the  campus, said.    However, pro-democracy campaigners say that much as they  would like to hold protest activities around that time, security  may be too tight.    All state work units have been ordered to have three people  -- the leader, a secretary and a driver -- on duty 24 hours a  day from now until after the danger period is over. They are  expected to react immediately if there are protests in the  vicinity, and to keep a close eye on their own workers.</p>

We have given thee a manifest victory, that God  may forgive thee thy former and thy latter sins, and complete  His blessings upon thee, and guide thee on a straight path, and  that God might help thee with a mighty victory. It is He who  sent down tranquility into the hearts of the believers, that  they may add faith to their faith, for to God belongs the forces  of the heavens and the earth, and God is full of knowledge and  wisdom. [Koranic verse] God tells the truth. O sons of our  great Palestinian people, O you activists, steadfast and  mujahidin people for Palestine, O you the people of the valiant  Intifadah, O you the heroes of the confrontation and resistance  in exile and in the diaspora, O you the brave heroes who are  patient and resilient in jails and detention centers, O you  valiant eagles and courageous hunted men in every camp, village.  and city; in every town, valley, and mountain in the land of  beloved Palestine. Oh you the sons of our glorious Arab nation,  in this glorious day, the anniversary of the outbreak of Fatah,  the anniversary of the outbreak of the Palestinian revolution,  in this day which marks the 29th anniversary of that glorious  day, those rare historic moments when young people who have  believed in their God and people have decided to open up the  road to the beginning of a new stage for our people in the track  of its struggle since the beginning of this century, on this  day, on this glorious day, we mark this Palestinian national  revolutionary anniversary in a new climate, in a new situation,  and in the face of new prospects.    Today, after decades of bitter struggle, today, after 29  years of a burning revolution, today after six years of the  glowing Intifadah, today after long and bitter years of  steadfastness, confrontation, and resistance in which we have  given the price for Palestine in the form of the pains of our  injured people, the freedom of our prisoners and the sorrow of  our women, sisters, and daughthers, and the patience of our  elderly people and men, and with the blood of our heroes, the  cohorts of loyal martyrs, the brave sons of our people, today we  miss them badly, those horsemen who have left their mounts  early, the brave martyrs who have fallen on the road to freedom,  liberation, and independence.    [Passage omitted] Our celebration today, oh my brothers, is  different and set apart from any day in the past. On this day  we stand with our relatives in the beloved homeland separated by  only a few days from our appointment with history, from the  appointed date for the beginning of the Israeli withdrawal from  part of our land, from the appointed date for beginning of the  return of thousands of our cadres and leaders to the homeland,  from the appointed date for the establishment of the first  Palestinian national authority for our people on the territory  of their homeland in accordance with the resolution of our  Palestinian National Council in 1974, from the date appointed  for the new resurrection of the homeland of Palestine and the  establishment of our Palestinian people on the political and  geographical map of the region now that the attempt to wipe our  mighty people from this map has ended forever. The people of  Palestine are mighty, the people of Palestine are mighty.  [passage omitted]    We have upheld the pledge and the oath. [passage omitted]    O sons of our great people, O sons of our glorious nation,  by  signing the Declaration of Principles agreement between the PLO  and the Israeli Government, the cause of our people has entered  a new historical and decisive phase.    This agreement included the beginning of the Israeli  withdrawal from the Gaza strip and the Jericho region in  connection with the redeployment of the Israeli forces in the  rest of the occupied territories and the establishment of a  Palestinian authority led by the PLO, the sole and legitimate  representative of the Palestinian people; and the beginning of a  transitional period followed in no more than three years by the  negotiations of the final stage. The most important issues to  be debated will be Holy Jerusalem, the old refugees, the  settlements, the final borders, and the implementation of UN  resolutions 242 and 338.    This agreement and the sweeping international support it  produced, and the new realities it brought about, meant one  single and basic fact, namely that the Palestinian people have  firmly established their feet on the soil of their homeland by  the effect of decades of the blessed Jihad and by the results of  the bitter confrontations and the legendary steadfastness in the  face of the expeditions of extermination and evil and by the  effect of the legend of building and consolidating the national  identity -- yes, by the effect of the legend of building,  consolidating, and safeguarding the national identity in the  diaspora and under the bayonets of occupation and in the heart  of the detention camps and prisons, by the effect of the masses  of our brave people, the architect of the epics of the unique  struggle in the refugee camps in Lebanon and the architect of  the epics of the heroic Fida'is operations and the tough  resistance at al-Karamah [battle in Jordan where Palestinian  resisted an Usraeli attack] and in the homeland's soil and the  architect of the legendary epic in standing fast in the siege of  Beirut and the architect of the independent Palestinian  decisionmaking, the architect of the blessed and brave  intifadah; Yes, the architect of the blessed and brave Intifadah  in our occupied homeland, which dealt a finishing and final blow  to the expansionist Zionist scheme.    By the effect of all this, events have built up day after  day. The walls, one after another, and obstacles, one after  another, have collapsed until Israeli recognition came to  announce a new era of our people's history and of our genuine  and loyal Jihad. [passage omitted]    Sons of our struggling people; brave and valiant women, men,  children and youth in all positions inside and outside the  homeland; our valiant wounded and our hero detainees; our  glorious Arab nation: We are entering the new era full of hope  without being deluded by chimeras. Yes, without being deluded  by chimeras. We do so armed with faith and confidence. [passage  omitted] The path is still long, but we have much food; the  tasks are still many and difficult, but our positions are  stronger and more advanced and more impregnable. [passage  omitted] We say this so that we can realize our reality well  and so that we can firm our footholds. The historic achievement  that was realized does not mean in any way that our national  tasks have been completed, as we still have before us the task  of completing the comprehensive Israeli withdrawal from all the  occupied territories, at the forefront of which is Holy  Jerusalem, the capital city of our independent state in  implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy,  so that our people can exercise their right to  self-determination and establishing their independent state.  Before us there still remains the main holy task of  guaranteeing the rights of the Palestinian refugees in  accordance with the principles and resolutions of international  legitimacy, in addition to the issue of the settlements and the  final frontiers. Out of our realization of all that, our  central council made its decision that the PLO should be the  point of reference as far as the national authority is concerned  -- the national authority that will be established in the  territories from which Israel will withdraw so that we can  preserve the entity and role of the PLO in all that means of the  unity of the people and the cause.    The political battle of negotiations that we have been  waging, O sons of our great people, since 13 September to secure  the precise and faithful implementation of the Declaration of  Principles agreement is only a small sample of the obstacles  that we are to face in the future. We are aware however of the  fact that a historical step such as the one that has been  achieved will have so many obstacles in its path due to the fact  that it has taken place following decades of tenacious  confrontation, war, aggression, and occupations.    We stress that we look at the Declaration of Principles as a  first step on the path toward achieving a comprehensive peace  that would not acquire its full meaning before the  implementation of all the UN resolutions, the Israeli  withdrawal, and the recovery of Arab rights on all fronts.  Approaching is our great concern for Arab coordination, which  we consider as a necessary condition for the consolidation of  the stand of the Arab negotiator [as heard] especially after the  Declaration of Principles brought about a change that bridged  the gap between the Palestinian track and the rest of the Arab  tracks in terms of time as dictated by the requirements of the  peace process in Madrid. [passage omitted]    We would have wished greater size and quicker pace for the  programs of support. [passage omitted]    We, while crossing the threshold of the new era in our  history, fully realize how this moment is so special and unique;  we realize its difficulties. Allow me to say to you that the  anxiety we all are feeling, where hopes mix with fears, progress  with hesitation, and emotions with wisdom and consideration, is  natural. Yes, my brothers, this is a natural matter. In fact,  it is evidence that everything is alright and healthy as far as  our entity and society are concerned. [passage omitted] It is  the moment of the beginning of the process of the realization of  our national aims; it is the moment of the beginning of the  revival of a new Palestine.    It is the moment of the meeting of our masses inside with  their revolution and people in the diaspora. It is the moment  of the beginning of the construction of the Palestinian national  entity on the land of Palestine. We have to realize full well  the requirements of this moment so that our steps will be  precise and correct and so that we can advance toward the  completion of our aims. [passage omitted] We want the Palestine  that is being revived anew to be a homeland that realizes for  the people of Palestine their dreams, hopes, and aspirations --  a homeland that will realize the aims for which we have  struggled; a homeland that will compensate our masses for  continuous decades of injustice and oppression, which were the  result of the historic crime and injustice carried out against  us. We want it to be a free homeland for a free people and for  strugglers; a modern and advanced entity; democratic, and a  model that makes available the opportunity for the continuation  of the civilized role and religious and cultural heritage that  Palestine had throughout history; an oasis in which our people  will enjoy freedom, democracy, political pluralism, security and  safety, the independence of the judiciary, the preservation of  public freedoms, stability, prosperity, human rights and  equality between men and women.    A homeland for the Palestinians wherever they may be,  getting  ready for the time when our objectives are achieved with the  [military] evacuation of our holy Jerusalem and the whole of  this homeland, the land of holiness and prophets and the place  of the ascension of our prophet Muhammad and the birthplace of  Jesus, is completed [sentence as heard].    My brothers, beloved, comrades of the path and the march,  and  brothers of struggle and Jihad, the enormity of the sacrifices  we are facing is relative to the size of our dreams and hopes,  our determination and persistence, the strength of our belief  and will. We are starting from the reality of destruction that  years of occupation have inflicted on the infrastructure of our  economy and society. [passage omitted]    On this occasion and on this historic day I address an  appeal  to all the sons of our Palestinian people -- in all its sectors  and groupings everywhere; in all its detachments, forces,  parties, trends, personalities, and activities -- saying to them  all that the hour of the major jihad has struck -- the hour of  building the national entity to consolidate our capability to  complete the wresting of all our national rights -- this hour is  for unity and not for disunity, and this hour is for harmony  that concentrates on the common denominators and not an hour for  division that looks for contradictions and differences. Come;  come, let us together and hand in hand and side by side wage our  holy battle by building the national Palestinian entity. Come,  let us agree on what we agree upon. Let some of us pardon  others on what we differ upon. Come, let us agree and disagree  under the umbrella of what unites us -- under the umbrella of  the sublime national interest of our people and homeland and  nation. [passage omitted]    O sons of our great people, this new year is that of the  renaissance. Here is Palestine being reborn again as a national  entity on its way to becoming an independent state. [passage  omitted]    In this year, it is our duty to consolidate our rank and  mobilize our energies to be at the level of the challenges  facing us. This is the year of great tasks, and the year of  achievements that we are undertaking from new stands, with new  spirit. It is the year of the free people who are making a free  homeland and a new torch of light, hope, and faith in the  region. [passage omitted]    It is a revolution until victory, until victory, until  victory. Your brother, Abu 'Ammar.</p>

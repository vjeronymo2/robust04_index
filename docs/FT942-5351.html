			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (14): Nice convertible, pity about the gearing - Gillian O'Connor test-drives Trustspeak Annuity share: Useful jargon term for one variety of income share in split-capital trusts. They get a very high income until the trust is wound up, but then have only a token claim on the capital. They are a good way of turning capital into income. But note that the income is taxable unless shielded in a Pep. The problem for the outsider is that share price pages and research material do not distinguish them from other income shares with worthwhile claims on the capital. The give-away is normally the very high running yield. Estimated redemption yields, though fallible, are probably a fairer yardstick. Convertible: Convertible loan stocks are one common form of prior charge capital and work like any other convertible - ie, stockholders have the option to convert the stock into shares on fixed terms at fixed times (the conversion terms). They provide a higher income than the underlying shares but will produce lower capital growth. Discount: Conventional way of expressing the difference between the stock market price of an investment trust share and its net asset value (qv), when the share is below its asset value. For example, if the asset value is 100p and the share price 90p, the discount is 10 per cent. When the price is above asset value, it is said to be at a premium. Gearing: A capital structure in which certain classes of security have prior but fixed or limited claims on either or both the income and the capital of the trust. The presence of these securities normally exaggerates the effect of changes in income or asset value on securities with secondary but unlimited claims. Thus, if the trust's income is increasing, the existence of a fixed-interest loan stock will mean that the income attributable to shareholders rises faster than the underling income. Similarly, if the trust's assets are increasing in value, the existence of a stock with fixed capital claims will mean that the assets attributable to shareholders rises disproportionately. But in bad times gearing means that both income and assets attributable to shareholders can shrink faster than the decline in underlying income and assets. Think of negative equity in houses. Nowadays gearing in many trusts, particularly split-capital ones, is exceedingly complex, with several layers of gearing. When a security is said to be 'highly geared', it means it will react very sharply to minor changes in the underlying portfolio. The high risk/reward ratio makes highly geared shares unsuitable for novices, widow, orphans, or the bulk of anyone's portfolio. Gross redemption yield: The average annual yield on a gilt-edged stock, including both the annual dividend payments and the capital gain/loss implied by the gap between the current price and the price at which the stock will eventually be repaid. Stockbrokers' analysts have attempted to apply a similar system to certain types of investment trust share. This is plausible with securities such as zero-dividend preference shares (qv) which have a fixed redemption price, provided there is a realistic prospect of assets sufficing to cover that redemption price when the trust is wound up. More contentious are attempts to apply the concept to securities with an uncertain redemption value, by making various assumptions about portfolio growth. Hurdle rate (also known as fulcrum): Warning: meaning varies slightly with the context. The minimum annual rate at which assets must grow before certain returns can be achieved. For example, a hurdle rate of 2 means that assets must grow at 2 per cent a year before assets will cover the current share price of a particular class of shares, or alternatively - when relevant - the set future redemption value of a particular class of shares. A hurdle rate of minus-2 means that assets can decline by 2 per cent a year before capital backing will not suffice to cover the current share price of a highly geared ordinary share. But in a different context, it would mean that assets can decline by 2 per cent a year before assets will not suffice to cover the future redemption price of a zero-dividend preference share (qv). Note, then, that a hurdle rate is specific to a particular class of shares, not to the investment trust as a whole. Net asset value (NAV): What each ordinary share in a conventional trust would theoretically be entitled to if the trust were wound up today and the assets distributed to shareholders; normally expressed in pence per share. NAV total return is a way of measuring the performance of the trust, assuming income is reinvested. Ordinary income share: Anything but. Shares with two different characteristics. They are usually entitled to all the income from the trust, but have no claim on the capital until at least one other class of capital, usually ZDPs (qv) has been fully satisfied. As they get near to winding-up date, they should behave more like a very highly geared capital share. Portfolio yield: Average annual income that the managers are getting from the shares in the investment portfolio. Very broadly, the higher the portfolio yield, the lower the prospects of capital growth in the portfolio, and vice versa. Split-capital trusts: Trusts with several different types of security with differing rights, and aimed to satisfy different investment needs. Some commentators refer to split-capital trusts which combine zero-dividend preference shares (qv) with ordinary income shares (qv) as hybrids. Subscription price: (Sometimes called exercise price): Price at which a warrant entitles the holder to buy a certain type of share in a trust. Redemption price: Price at which the holder of a security has the right to be repaid at the stated redemption date, provided the trust has sufficient assets. The security will often have a tapered redemption price in case some unexpected event, such as a bid, occurs. Warrant: Traded security, usually issued free to buyers of the ordinary shares at the original issue, often in the ratio of 1:5. It entitles the holder to subscribe to a certain type of share in the trust at a fixed price at fixed dates or over a fixed period. Winding-up date: Many trusts, and all split-capital trusts, have a limited life, and shareholders are due to be repaid at a specific date. Occasionally trusts have extended their life, but this is expensive; the cost is borne by shareholders, and the extension may not be equally in the interest of all classes of shareholder. Zero-dividend preference share (ZDPs): Share in a split-capital trust issued at substantial discount to its eventual redemption value, but not entitled to any income in the intervening period. Assets of the trust will normally suffice to cover the ZDPs when the trust is launched. But if the market falls thereafter, the value of the ZDPs is endangered. The extent to which assets cover the promised redemption value is a key statistic.</p>

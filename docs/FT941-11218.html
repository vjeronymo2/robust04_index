			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Sales of new homes continue to recover The recovery in sales of new houses which began last year is being sustained, confidential figures from housebuilders indicate. Sales of new houses increased during January, according to figures compiled from 27 housebuilders. The statistics, collected by the House Builders Federation, show net reservations - agreed sales on which a 10 per cent deposit has been paid, less cancellations - rose by 4 1/2 per cent compared with the first four weeks of 1993. The increase in the number of visitors to housing development sites was even more encouraging - more than 9 per cent over up on the same period last year. The rises indicate that the recovery in sales of new houses has been sustained in spite of concern about the impact of forthcoming tax increases on buyers' confidence. Mr Dennis Webb, managing director of Beazer Homes, Britain's fourth-largest housebuilder, said: 'We have had a very good start to the yearin terms of agreed sales and visitors. More importantly, the recovery is being maintained.' Mr Webb said that since October Beazer's net reservations had risen by 30 per cent compared with the same period a year earlier. 'Even if you discount the fact that we are selling from more sites, the underlying increase is about 20 per cent,' he added. The 27 companies, mostly large national and regional organisations, build about 40 per cent of new homes, which account for about a tenth of all house transactions. Sales of new houses are estimated by builders to have risen by 15 per cent to 20 per cent last year compared with an increase of about 5 per cent for all homes. The figures come against a background of mixed signals from other sources about the future of the housing market. Gross and net mortgage lending rose slightly in December compared with November, according to figures released yesterday by the Bank of England. The figures cover banks, building societies and centralised lenders. The seasonally adjusted results suggested that societies had regained some marketshare from the banks after months of tough competition. During the fourth quarter of last year, societies had net lending of Pounds 2.8bn, while banks' net lending amounted to Pounds 2.6bn. In the third quarter, banks had lent more than societies, with figures of Pounds 3bn and Pounds 2.3bn respectively. Overall, net lending stood at Pounds 1.8bn in December, against Pounds 1.7bn the previous month, while gross lending increased to Pounds 4.8bn. But mortgage loan approvals - a forward-looking indicator of the state of the market - fell in number and volume on both raw figures and seasonally adjusted data. A further note of caution came from research carried out for Roof Briefing, the housing magazine. This suggested that prospects of a national housing market recovery would falter because markets in areas such as London and the south-east would remain 'in the doldrums' for thenext 18 months. First Europe, a consultancy firm specialising in the property sector, drew on six sets of market factors in reaching its conclusion thatonly parts of the Yorkshire region, the north-east and Wales were likely to pick up significantly.</p>

			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> SOME CLASS FOR THE CLASS;  </P> <P> THE FASHION INSTITUTE'S SALE OF DESIGNER GOODS AT BARGAIN-BASEMENT PRICES IS A  MERCHANDISING LAB.  </P> <P> Designer Bob Mackie donated a beaded black sweater that would carry a lofty  price tag of $600 at Neiman Marcus. Fancy-dress maker Holly Harp provided a  flounced frock that still had the Bergdorf Goodman label in it and might have  sold for $1,200.  </P> <P> Such a deal at $100 each.  </P> <P> That will be the asking price for each of those designer pieces when Dollars  for Scholars, a temporary "store" operated by students of the Fashion Institute  of Design and Merchandising, opens Thursday at the school on Seventh Street in  downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The nonprofit store, stocked with clothing, jewelry, toys and household items  donated by 300 retailers and manufacturers, is a "merchandise laboratory class"  designed to give the students hands-on experience in retailing, according to  Myrna Glenny, a faculty adviser.  </P> <P> This is the fifth year for the retail venture, which raises funds for  scholarships. Last year's take was more than $67,000, and students this year  hope to hit $100,000. About 400 students pursuing careers in the fashion  industry will participate in the 10-day exercise.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Major Retailers Donate  </P> <P> So far, they have spent six weeks preparing the 3,000-square-foot space. Late  last week, they were scrambling to take inventory, build dressing rooms and tag  and hang merchandise.  </P> <P> By the time that the sale officially begins, students will have collected  40,000 pieces of clothing and 30,000 yards of fabric that they expect to sell  at 50% to 70% below retail cost. Items will include brands from such clothing  makers and designers as Gilda Marx, Sandra Garratt, Koret, Christian de  Castelnau, Lanz, Patti Cappalli and Jessica McClintock. For men and children,  brands include Hanes, Quiksilver and Kennington.  </P> <P> Robinson's, the Broadway, Lady Foot Locker and Contempo Casuals were among  retailers that donated items. Frederick's of Hollywood supplied the mannequins  (sans sexy lingerie).  </P> <P> Not all the garments will be one-of-a-kind treasures like the Mackie sweater.  In some cases, damaged, irregular or sample items will be priced at as little  as $2. But even first-quality merchandise will go for bargain-basement prices,  relatively speaking, with the average cost ranging up to $50 for moderate  sportswear and $60 to $70 for designer garments.  </P> <P> "We like to think of our store as Pic 'N' Save with Nordstrom service," Glenny  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Good Training  </P> <P> To get the word out, students are mailing reminders to previous customers and  are handing out flyers to pedestrians.  </P> <P> Student Cheryl Cedrone, 18, said she viewed the exercise as good preparation  for a career as a manufacturer's representative.  </P> <P> "When this started off, this was just an empty room," she said proudly as she  surveyed the jam-packed space.  </P> <P> Fund-raiser or no, students realized that they had to take a realistic attitude  toward thievery, one of the retail industry's biggest headaches. The project's  budget allows for a bit of "shrinkage," Glenny noted, and signs posted at the  door note sternly: "Shoplifters Will Be Prosecuted."  </P></p>

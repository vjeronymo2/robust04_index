			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Pensions after Maxwell ONE OF the least attractive features of the way in which financial services are regulated in Britain is that no loophole or abuse is ever addressed until a scandal of such magnitude breaks that it becomes impossible for the government of the day not to act. Thanks to the monstrous theft perpetrated by the late Robert Maxwell against pension scheme members in his business empire, the time for action has belatedly arrived. The striking feature of Maxwell's crooked dealings, which have been revealed in all their convoluted detail in a series of articles in the Financial Times this week, is that they were constrained by scarcely any checks and balances worthy of the name. What lessons can we draw from this extraordinary saga for future pensions provision and regulation? It is tempting, especially for those directly involved in the pensions business, to regard Maxwell as a one-off phenomenon; and certainly the scale of the theft was unprecedented. Yet it could also be argued that Maxwell is simply an extreme case of a more widespread problem, which is that directors often have considerable discretion over the deployment of pension scheme assets in circumstances that involve severe potential conflicts of interest vis-a-vis the beneficiaries. One narrow manifestation of that problem has emerged over the past 10 days in the shape of news about several perfectly legal, but incestuous, deals between companies and their pension funds. These include transactions at groups as various as Burlington International, cooker manufacturer Belling and LEP Group. The common feature is that the companies entered into these transactions while financially stretched - Burlington and Belling are now in receivership - and there are now questions about the implications for pension benefits. Compensation scheme A government committee under Professor Roy Goode will shortly examine a range of issues to do with the legal framework, the ownership of pension scheme surpluses and the case for a compensation scheme, all of which have a bearing on transactions of this kind. While it is a tribute to the integrity of British employers that conflicts of interest have been so infrequently abused in the past, it is also clear that with corporate failures running at a high level, pension scheme assets are at risk as never before. The government must recognise that legislation cannot wait. A ban is needed on all dealings between companies and their pension funds. This would not stop another Maxwell, but it would be a deterrent for those employers who would stop at a breach of the law. It would also spare the government a bigger spate of demands for compensation following its decision to provide modest support for Maxwell pensioners. The wider manifestation of the inherent conflict of interest in occupational pensions can be seen in the argument over the ownership of pension fund surpluses. Employers argue that they are entitled to surpluses because they guarantee the solvency of the scheme. Yet the guarantee depends entirely on the goodwill of the employer, since employers usually control the board of trustees; and most trust deeds permit the trustees to change the rules at whim, including those relating to the solvency guarantee. Contribution holidays One consequence of all this is that companies are often taking contribution holidays when present and deferred pensioners are still suffering from a fall in the value of their pension in real terms. There are also numerous inequitable cross-subsidies in the system such as those whereby long stayers benefit at the expense of the redundant, whose pension rights are devalued either by inflation or penal actuarial valuations on transfer to other funds. And since the cost of pensions funding increases as employees grow older, employers have a powerful incentive to lay off ageing employees. None of this seems compatible with any meaningful notion of trust. It also points to a fundamental flaw in the legal framework, which is that trust law was simply not designed for an arrangement where the settlor of the trust retains a continuing interest in the finances of the scheme. The natural priority for Professor Goode's committee will thus be to weigh the case for reform of trust law as opposed to new pensions legislation; to consider ways of making trustees genuinely independent and of ensuring that assets are safely out of reach of company management; and to recommend some form of bonding or compensation scheme to provide for the victims of abuse. Yet it could be argued that the whole system of occupational pensions is so fundamentally flawed that a more radical approach is called for. It is simply impossible to escape the ill-effects of the conflicts of interest inherent in paternalistic final salary schemes. If pensions in the Maxwell empire had been organised on a personal basis, the scope for theft, cross-subsidy and arguments about surpluses would have been much reduced. Professor Goode should not hesitate to express a view on the more radical options.</p>

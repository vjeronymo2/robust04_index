			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Survey of Australia (10): Confusion over identity - Constitution WHEN the state of Victoria's newly-elected MPs gathered for the first time in Melbourne's historic parliament last month they swore to be 'faithful and bear due allegiance to her majesty Queen Elizabeth II, the lawful sovereign of the United Kingdom. . .' If the oath angered any of the MPs present they failed to show it; perhaps familiarity has robbed the wording of its shock value, or perhaps they were mollified by the addition of the words '. . .and this state of Victoria.' Nevertheless, the spectacle of a group of MPs explicitly swearing allegiance to a foreign monarch epitomises the confusion which surrounds Australia's attempts to develop a coherent and distinctive post-colonial identity. Ironically, the Melbourne swearing-in ceremony was held only a few days after the federal and state governments agreed to end the award of British imperial honours such as knighthoods. In practice, the decision merely formalised the position which has existed since 1988 when Queensland became the last state to stop awarding imperial honours following the defeat of Sir Jo Bjelke-Petersen's National Party government. However, the two episodes taken together neatly illustrate the way in which the gradual development of an Australian consciousness co-exists with a continuing attachment to the symbols of colonialism. Part of the confusion is caused by the federal constitution, signed in 1901, which allowed the six constituent states to retain their colonial constitutions, including independent links with the UK. In addition, some of the constitutional reforms which have taken place seem pointless, even in symbolic terms. For example, Mr Gough Whitlam's Labor government of 1972-75 made Australians subjects of the newly-created throne of Australia. But the sovereign of Australia remains whoever happens to be the king or queen of the UK. This reluctance to take decisive action has marked Australia's constitutional relationship with the UK since federation. For example, it took the federal government 11 years to adopt the 1931 Statute of Westminster, which conferred formal self-government on the then British dominions. And it was not until 1986 that the federal parliament passed the Australia Act, finally removing the residual power of the UK parliament to legislate for Australia and the states. Pressure for reform has gathered pace in the past year, as Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, has given official support to both the republican movement and those who want to remove the British Union flag from the top left quarter of the Australian flag. The government is officially committed to creating a republic by 2001, the centenary of federation, and Mr Keating has given his personal word that he will oversee the introduction of a new flag. However, having temporarily diverted attention from the flagging economy, the Prime Minister has now dropped both issues in the face of determined opposition, suggesting once again that radical constitutional reform is too difficult for Australian governments. Meanwhile, the national schizophrenia on constitutional issues is perfectly captured in the second verse of Advance Australia Fair, the national anthem adopted less than 20 years ago to replace God Save the Queen: When gallant Cook from Albion sailed To trace wide oceans o'er, True British courage bore him on, Till he landed on our shore. Then here he raised Old England's flag, The standard of the brave, 'With all her faults we love her still, Britannia rules the wave'. In joyful strains then let us sing, 'Advance Australia fair.' Not surprisingly, the second verse is rarely sung.</p>

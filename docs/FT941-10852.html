			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Keidanren chief The Keidanren, Japan's leading business federation, yesterday confirmed that its next chairman would be Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the car group Toyota, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo. Mr Toyoda, 68, who has spent nearly all his life in the family car company, is a vigorous opponent of US demands for numerically-measured increases in market shares of imported goods. The car industry is one of the most sensitive parts of the present US-Japan trade talks. He will succeed the current chairman, Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, 79, at the Keidanren's annual general meeting in late May.</p>

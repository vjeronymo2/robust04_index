			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 36. We continue to believe that the factors articulated in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> WGN <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  provide the best guidance for determining whether material in the VBI is program-related and, therefore, must be carried by the cable system. Accordingly, material that is intended to be seen by the viewers of the main program, during the same time interval as the main program, and which is an integral part of the main program will be entitled to carriage along with the main signal of the must-carry station. However, on reconsideration, we clarify that the factors set forth in WGN do not necessarily form the exclusive basis for determining program-relatedness. We believe there will be instances where material which does not fit squarely within the factors listed in WGN will be program-related under the statute. For example, on reconsideration, although SID codes may not precisely meet each factor in WGN, we find that they are program-related under the statute because they constitute information intrinsically related to the particular program received by the viewer. Further, SID codes provide important information that is useful to both broadcasters and cable operators. We note that the 1992 Cable Act recognized the importance of the national ratings period and prohibited cable operators from repositioning or deleting stations during that time. This interpretation is consistent with previous Commission decisions in which SID codes were found to be program-related in other contexts. Finally, we reiterate that, in order to be program-related, it is not necessary that the copyright holder in the main program and in the material in the VBI be the same. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2. Channel Positioning. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 37. The 1992 Cable Act provides both commercial and NCE television stations which elect must-carry status the additional right to select the channel position on which they will be carried by the cable system, within certain specified options. Section 614(b)(6) provides that the signals of a local commercial television station carried pursuant to the must-carry rules must be carried on either (1) the same channel on which the station is broadcast over-the-air, (2) the cable channel on which it was carried on July 19, 1985, or (3) the cable channel on which it was carried on January 1, 1992. The election, in the absence of conflicts, is left up to the station involved. See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  47 U.S.C. 534(b)(6). Similarly, Section 615(g)(5) requires that NCE signals carried pursuant to must-carry requirements must appear on the cable system channel number on which the qualified local NCE station is broadcast over-the-air, or on the channel on which it was carried on July 19, 1985, at the election of the station. In either case, another channel number that is mutually agreed upon by the station and the cable operator may be selected. Alternatively, the broadcast station and cable operator may agree on a mutually acceptable alternative channel position. We note that, with respect to channel position, a qualified LPTV station enjoys the channel positioning rights of a commercial television station. Section 76.57 is being revised accordingly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 38. Based on comments received in response to the Notice, we declined in the Report and Order to adopt a formal priority structure for resolving conflicting channel positioning claims. We stated that we expected compliance with the channel positioning requests of broadcasters ``absent a compelling technical reason for not being able to accommodate such requests,'' and that ``inconvenience, marketing problems, the need to reconfigure the basic tier or the need to employ additional traps or make technical changes'' would not be sufficient reasons to deny a channel positioning request. In addition, we determined that ``only where placement of a signal on a chosen channel results in interference or degraded signal quality to the must-carry station or an adjacent channel, or causes a substantial technical or signal security problem, will we permit cable operators to carry a broadcast signal on a channel not chosen by the station.'' We noted that most systems would be able to configure their service to meet this statutory requirement and that a cable system claiming that it cannot meet a channel positioning request for technical reasons will have to provide evidence that clearly demonstrates that inability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 39. In the Order adopted July 15, 1993, we addressed certain issues relating to continued carriage of retransmission consent stations and the channel position for ``default'' must-carry stations. In that Order, we stated that cable systems which are required to carry the signal of a default station ``shall place that signal on one of the statutorily defined positions, at the system's discretion.'' Although the footnote to that sentence correctly stated that the station licensee makes the election, the text incorrectly stated ``at the system's discretion.'' We clarify that, as required by the 1992 Cable Act, the choice of statutorily defined channel position is made by the station, not the cable system. The Order also determined that, in the event of a conflict, the station making an affirmative election has priority over the default station. Finally, we stated that, where the station making an affirmative election has selected the only statutory channel position available to the default station, the cable system may place the default station on a channel of the cable system's choice, so long as that channel is included on the basic tier. Section 76.57 of our rules was amended to reflect the channel positioning options discussed and adopted in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Order. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

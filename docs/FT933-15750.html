			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / International Company News: KHD seeks cost cuts through suppliers KLOCKNER-Humboldt-Deutz, the Cologne-based engineering group, is to adopt the Volkswagen group's cost-cutting techniques in an attempt to restore growth. The company said yesterday it expected to break even this year for the second year in succession despite a slow first half. But capacity and costs had to be reduced further. All expenditure would have to be cut, including spending on materials, fixed and personnel costs and interest payments. However, most effort would be focused on significantly lowering procurement costs. Outside suppliers were expected to accept the necessary changes and use the opportunities for greater co-operation with KHD, the company said. The group's plans, including the loss of 2,000 jobs, will be spelt out at the end of next month. They appear to match closely the projects under way at VW, where protesting suppliers have been asked for price cuts of up to 30 per cent. Mr Werner Kirchgasser, chairman, warned of impending action last month when he said sales for the first five months of the year were down 21 per cent and incoming orders were 25 per cent lower than a year earlier. The company said no improvement in its main markets could be expected in the near future, adding that current difficulties were likely to persist into 1994. As well as feeling the industrial recession, KHD has been badly affected by changes in common agricultural policy, which have hit sales of tractors and other agricultural equipment.</p>

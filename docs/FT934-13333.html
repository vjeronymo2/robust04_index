			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Trusts begin to issue Lloyd's prospectuses PATHFINDER prospectuses, documents used to market shares, were issued yesterday for two investment trusts at Lloyd's of London. Merchant banks, securities houses and Lloyd's agents responded quickly to the decision by Names on Wednesday to allow corporate investors to participate in the market. Sixteen investment trusts, seeking to raise Pounds 1.25bn, have been announced although there are doubts whether all can reach their capital targets. Yesterday's pathfinders were for trusts sponsored by the merchant banks, Samuel Montagu and SG Warburg. Montagu has teamed up with James Capel and is aiming to raise Pounds 280m to support 98 syndicates, while Warburg aims to raise Pounds 150m to support about 20. Four other investment trusts issued pathfinders before Wednesday's vote, while a further 10 have announced their intentions to raise funds, many of them by publishing detailed information memorandums. With a number of other schemes in the pipeline, the markets could eventually be asked to find more than Pounds 1.5bn. Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank which expects to announce a Dollars 300m (Pounds 201.7m) investment scheme next week, is tapping US investors. But most of the schemes will be tapping the UK equity market over the next two months. However, according to financiers seeking to market some of the largest investment trust schemes, UK investors are unlikely to provide between Pounds 750m and Pounds 1bn in capital for the schemes, suggesting a possible shortfall of some Pounds 500m. That indicates that many funds could reduce the amount of capital they are targeting. 'Downsizing is the name of the game,' said one analyst. Alternatively, some schemes will fail altogether. 'The reality is that not all these vehicles will succeed,' said Mr Chris Hitchings, analyst with UBS Global Research. Mr John Lee, of Lee Schwartz Associates, a research consultancy, said institutions have been gripped by a 'euphoria of a new market opening' but also predicted some smaller funds could fail.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- MAIN LLOYD'S INVESTMENT TRUST/COMPANY SCHEMES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- NAME                         SUPPORTERS                  CAPITAL SOUGHT Pathfinder prospectuses issued                                 (Pounds)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- HCG Corporate Advisers       JO Hambro, Conning, Grimston          100m Hiscox Select Insurance      Charterhouse Tilney, Fund                         Roberts &amp; Hiscox                     28.9m Johnson Fry Crp              Allied Provincial Securities       15m-50m Insr Recvy Tst New London Capital           Warburg, Chartwell Re,                              Mercury Asset Management              150m London Insurance Mkt Invt Tst                     James Capel/Samuel Montagu       280m-300m CLM Insurance Fund           Sedgwick, BZW                         200m  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Announced  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Finsbury Underwriting Inv Tst                      Rea Brothers, UBS, Wren                30m Nelson Lloyd's Trust         Lazards, Octavian  60m None as yet                  Murray Johnstone, Willis Faber 50m Premium Trust                Wellington, Noble, Grieg Middleton     30m Masthead Insur Underwriting  Murray Lawrence, Hambros Bk,                              Hoare Govett                           50m Fenchurch Investment Trust   Fenchurch, Guinness Mahon              35m Syndicate Capital Trust      Rafael Zorn, Hemsley, IAL         30m plus Angerstein Underwriting Tst  Stace Barr, NatWest Markets                              Corporate Finance                      75m Corporate Membership         Peel Hunt                           8m-20m Delian Lloyd's Invt Tst      Hill Samuel, RF Kershaw,                              Panmure Gordon                         50m  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Other possible schemes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- None as yet                  Phoenix Secs, Donaldson,                              Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, Anton                 - None as yet                  JP Morgan, Marsh, McLennan               - None as yet                  Saloman Brothers,                              Johnson &amp; Higgins             Dollars 300m None as yet                  Kleinwort Benson, Sturge Holdings        - None as yet                  London Wall                              -  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

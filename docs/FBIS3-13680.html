Rabin's remark means Israel no longer needs to ask for such  aid, because this aid has become a routine practice. Successive  U.S. Administrations have never failed to extend aid to Israel.  They are so generous that their aid to Israel exceeds that  extended to any other U.S. ally. This aid has turned Israel  into the largest military arsenal, with the most sophisticated  weapon systems, including nuclear arms and weapons of mass  destruction.    The question asks itself: If Rabin did not go to Washington  to ask for military and financial aid, what did he really want?  It is not difficult for anyone following events to find the  answer in the political situation created by the Ibrahimi  Mosque's massacre in Hebron. This situation halted the  Washington peace talks segment of the peace process and stopped  the continued talks between the Rabin government's delegates and  representatives of the Palestinian side that signed the  Gaza-Jericho agreement.    The massacre in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque covered the peace  process in a flagrant terrorist curtain of blood and fire. It  offered one more proof of the Israeli rulers' policy to foil the  peace process and prevent it from advancing one step forward  after the Madrid conference more than two years ago.    Justifications and hollow words meant to calm emotions could  not save the Rabin government from being held responsible for  this abominable massacre. Thus, Rabin went to Washington facing  a real impasse as a result of his policy to defend the illegal  settlements. These settlements expressed adherence to policies  of regional expansion and altering the geographic and  demographic nature of the Israeli-occupied territories. Israel  wants to impose the illegal presence of these settlements on the  whole world as an accomplished fact.    The Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre has clearly and irrevocably  revealed the true positions of the Rabin government. It has  also revealed that this government is just an alleged dove of  peace, and that it is essentially hostile to peace, just like  all previous Israeli governments.    However, the Rabin government, which deceitfully raised the  slogan of peace with one hand while committing daily crimes and  massacres with the other hand, has reaped evil results and  fallen into the traps it set for the peace process. The  bargaining chips of peace, which this government has used since  it assumed power, have lost their value. Hence, Rabin's visit  to Washington under these circumstances is proof of the deep and  complicated crisis facing his government. It is also proof of  the special relationship between the U.S. Administration and  Israel, and of the extent of this administration's ability to  convince the Israeli rulers of whatever it wishes.    The new political situation -- represented by both the Rabin  government's state of affairs and the power to convince the  Israeli rulers that the U.S. Administration enjoys -- makes the  United States assume an additional great responsibility. This  is because the United States is the superpower that assumes  special responsibility toward both global peace and  international legitimacy, in its capacity as the country that  unleashed the Middle East peace process.    From this premise, the current circumstances seem very  appropriate for the U.S. Administration to play its role in  having Rabin comply with the U.S. peace initiative and announce  his acceptance of the bases of this initiative in order to  achieve a just and comprehensive peace based on the resolutions  of international legitimacy in the region.    No one can deny that the Arabs, led by Syria, contributed to  unleashing and preserving this peace opportunity. Without the  Syrian position in particular, doors would not have been opened  for the peace process, and the peace talks would not have begun  in Madrid and resumed in Washington. This is because Israel  officially rejected the U.S. initiative in writing. Moreover,  Israel has thus far rejected the bases of the peace process.    Syria -- which showed cooperation to render the peace  process  a success and which really wants to achieve a just and  comprehensive peace that will return territories and rights to  their owners and preserve the dignity of all parties -- does not  have any problem with the U.S. Administration. Likewise, the  Arab side, as a whole, does not have any problem with the U.S.  Administration. Syria and other Arab parties hope the U.S.  Administration will manage to revive the peace process before  the latter is finished off by the Israeli Government's policy  and positions that obstruct this process.    The only way to make the U.S. initiative a success and break  the deadlock in the peace talks is the acceptance by the Israeli  rulers of the bases of this process, their respect for  international legitimacy, and their relinquishment of the policy  of regional expansion, racist fanaticism, war crimes, and  annihilation. The U.S. Administration is primarily responsible  for achieving this objective. It is a problem between the U.S.  Administration and Israel, and not between this administration  and the Arabs. The key to resolving this problem is in  Washington's hand.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Arts: Devolution grinds to a halt - The latest developments in the arts world IT LOOKS as if the proposed great shake up for the UK arts world, the drive towards devolution, much loved by the last Arts Minister but one, Mr Richard Luce, is being laid gently to rest. The current Minister, Mr Tim Renton, obviously has doubts as to whether control of the subsidy purse strings should be taken away from the Arts Council in London and handled by new Regional Arts Boards. He is not proving the soft touch the arts Establishment anticipated, and is currently wagging his finger furiously at everyone in sight. This week he asked Mr Anthony Everitt, the secretary general of the Council, to save another Pounds 1m on devolution and pretty sharply too  - by May 17. The Arts Council is cutting its staff by 50, down to 130, but, although two Regional Arts Associations are to disappear under restructuring, staffing of the new RAB's is set to rise by 15, to 370. Now the hard pressed chief executives of the RABs, torn that way and this by Ministerial changes, will find the supposedly weakened London Central forcing them to shed staff. And, despite the intentions of Luce, the RAB's do not seem to be getting their administrative hands on the bigger companies. Last December the Arts Council forwarded to Renton a list with the names of over 90 companies ear-marked, often against their will, for devolution, and including such heavies as the four London orchestras, the Royal Court, the ICA, the CBSO, and the Royal Exchange Manchester. It was expected that he would rubber stamp it. Instead he quickly ordered the Council to rethink. The first group of 28 companies devolved this week covers pretty minor bodies, with the exception of Aldeburgh. With no second list now expected until October 1992, when a very different Arts Minister might be settling in, it looks as if the devolution bandwaggon hardly rolled beyond the suburbs of London. One bandwaggon which has definitely halted is Upstart, the theatrical production company, which has gone into liquidation. It was started three years ago with a substantial Pounds 150,000 contribution from the Arts Council. Business interests were expected to match this sum. The decision dismayed established touring groups, like Compass, which relied on Council money for their survival, and purists who thought the Arts Council should not get involved with playing the theatrical angel. Upstart's ventures, however well intentioned, never struck gold. It always seemed to be trying to square commercial acumen with a social conscience and it discovered there just was not an audience in the provinces for black musicals like Mass Carib or childrens plays like Pied Piper. It came to grief over another mix of religion and Mammon, Children of Eden, a musical based on the Book of Genesis, which closed prematurely on April 6th, not bringing drama to an overlooked provincial town, but, ironically given the company's remit, in the West End. Like an Upstart musical, the Arts Council is looking on the bright side and counting the sixty weeks of regional touring it got for its money. Mr Jeremy Isaacs, boss at Covent Garden, has finally pleased his critics. He is starting to pension off the Royal Opera chorus, which, with an average age approaching 50 and at least a dozen stalwarts over 65, has long been in the critical firing line. They could just about get on stage without zimmer frames, but anything at all mobile was left to the legs of specially recruited supernumeraries. Apart from their static posturing the main problem was the voices and the fact that the Covent Garden repertoire has recently been boosted with Russian works, like Prince Igor and Boris Godunov, which stretched their verbal learning powers beyond the limit. There were reports that they were behind the beat in Prince Igor because they were reading their lines off monitors. Now chorus numbers are being reduced from 72 to 60, with freelances summoned up for the mammoth productions. Mr Isaacs has been slow to act through human kindness. The ROH pension scheme was rudimentary in the extreme and only now can these faithful servants be retired to some comfort. Mr Guy Wilson, Keeper of the Royal Armouries, expects to know within the next month whether his plan to lead his unrivalled collection of arms and armour out of its 900 year home at the Tower of London and into a purpose built museum in a regional city will come true. The Royal Armouries has felt increasingly inhibited in the Tower even though it inhabits some of the finest remains, including the White Tower. It wants its own identity and space to show more of its collection. It will not denude the Tower: it can afford to leave many treasures behind, including a set of Henry VIII's armour (it owns four), but it is considering offers from progressive cities who, in the wake of the success of Glasgow and Birmingham, see the economic opportunities in the devolution of major arts organisations from London. Leeds, stung by the success of neighbouring Bradford in developing a heritage reputation, is currently the favourite home for the new Pounds 30m museum. The problem, of course, is money. If the Government comes up with a useful gratuity Wilson hopes that the local authority, and an appeal to business friends, will do the rest.</p>

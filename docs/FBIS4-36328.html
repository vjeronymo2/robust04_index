			<p>BFN     [Text] Mr. Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah, the chairman of the  Arab Parliamentary Union and the speaker of the Transitional  National Assembly [TNA], has called on the brothers in Yemen to  respect the cease-fire resolution to stop the bloodshed and to  save the resources of the sons of Yemen. Mr. Khalifah expressed  hope that the Yemenis will embark on an objective dialogue to  arrive at a lasting solution to the crisis and an agreement  acceptable to all the brothers in order to consolidate stability  in their country and work toward reconstruction and development.    Khalifah pointed out that the Arab homeland, which has been  observing the strife in Yemen, aspired to see the role of a  strong and united Yemen in supporting the march of the Arab and  Islamic nations, in light of the stability which would be  achieved by its sons.    The chairman of the Arab Parliamentary Union called on the  Arab parliamentarians to direct all their efforts towards  containing the crisis, overcoming its negative effects, and  supporting the peace and reconstruction efforts. He appealed to  the brothers in Yemen on the need to heed the voice of reason  and wisdom, for which they had been renowned, and to deny the  opportunity to anyone intending to ambush the Arab and Islamic  nation, endeavoring to squander its resources and destroy its  unity.</p>

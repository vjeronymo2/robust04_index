			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Significantly different conclusions were reached between the proponents of retaining the current 10-cent target differential, the proponents for a 30-cent differential, and the proponents for a 50-cent differential on the basis of the changing value of milk components. The 10-cent proponents argue that the increasing value of skim to butterfat effectively has raised the costs of Class II products. The 30-cent proponents argue that the changing cost structure provides, in part, the rationale for maintaining what the recent past's average differential has been. The proponents for a 50-cent differential argue that because the utilization of butterfat to manufacture Class II products is relatively high, processors enjoy a price decrease. The arguments presented on the changing cost structure of milk components is not an issue for the purposes of establishing the Class II price. Rather, it is a butterfat differential issue that has already been decided upon in other rulemaking decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated in the brief submitted by SFG/AE, Federal order statistics reveal that there is an abundant supply of milk for all class uses of producer milk. As indicated in this brief, and in the brief filed on behalf of Friendship, Kraft, Sorrento Cheese Company, and Galloway Company, a price increase must be predicated upon supply and demand considerations. Establishing the Class II differential for any given month at thirty cents above the second preceding month's basic formula price is not intended to effectuate a price increase or a price decrease for Class II milk. Rather it is a recognition of the effective differential that has been functioning for a long period of time. The record provides no evidence on any difficulty in procuring milk for Class II use under the current pricing structure. However, the record does indicate that the pricing structure creates problems regarding the timing and certainty of prices, in part, because of its reliance on the basic Class II pricing formula used to update the M&hyph;W.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An analysis of the record evidence and officially noticed materials does point to the fact that the Class II price has averaged nearly thirty cents above the basic formula price for the second preceding month since 1987. Additionally, an analysis of the effective differential (the difference between the current month's Class III price and Class II price since adoption of the add-back provision) for the four-year period of 1990 through 1993 indicates that the Class II differential has averaged thirty cents above the Class III price. It is because of these market realities that there exists so strong an agreement between producers and processors that the true differential level of thirty cents for Class II milk is warranted. Some describe this differential level as the appropriate level, some the minimum justifiable differential, and by some, a differential level that represents the maximum that can be called for on the basis of supply and demand considerations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Add-Back Provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Only two proponents, CMPC who supported a 30-cent differential, and NFO, who advocated a 50-cent differential, called for retention of the add-back provision. The add-back provision of current Class II milk pricing was established in December 1989 as part of a decision to have true advanced pricing for Class II milk. Prior to that time, the Class II milk price that was announced was a tentative price which could be retroactively updated when the Class III price for the month was greater than the tentative Class II price. In this way, the Class II price was ``floored'' by the Class III price. The intent of the add-back provision was to maintain in principle this relationship between Class II and Class III prices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The decision on the 43-day National Hearing of 1990 recognized that, at the time of the hearing, the effective Class II differential had averaged about 4 cents higher than the intended differential of ten cents per hundredweight. This decision also affirmed the intent of the add-back was to ensure that producers not receive less than the Class III value for Class II milk in the blend price when the basic formula price exceeded the announced Class II price so that returns to producers would not be reduced. In this way, the Class II price was coordinated with the current month's Class III price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Now that there exists much more pricing data under the current Class II pricing method, it is clear that the effect of the add-back provision resulted in a Class II price that can never achieve the intended target differential. While the goal of the add-back was to provide a degree of coordination with the Class III price, it did not attempt price coordination with the Class III price in months when the effective Class II differential was well above the targeted differential. Retention of the add-back feature for any proposal presented at this hearing would have similar results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The add-back provision similarly does not balance prices paid by handlers in months when producers receive more (and at times much more) than the intended target differential. In this view, the add-back feature only works to the price advantage of the producer who, because of the unintended effect of a pricing provision, enjoys all protection from market price changes that handlers do not. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

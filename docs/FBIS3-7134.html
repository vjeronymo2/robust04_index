That's the view of the Australian trade minister, Bob  McMullan. He is the first government member to visit Malaysia  since Prime Minister Paul Keating's reference to Dr. Mahathir as  recalcitrant threatened trade and diplomatic links. Indeed,  despite Prime Minister Mahathir's apparent sensitivity to  outside criticism, Senator McMullan said he would strongly  encourage Australian business to invest in Malaysia. Trevor  Watson reports from the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur:    [Begin recording] [Watson] Malaysia's Trade Minister Rafidah  Aziz met with Senator McMullan in the room she used for  discussions with the minister's predecessor, Peter Cook, at the  height of last year's row. While those earlier talks were  charged with Malaysian threats and, I understand, Australian  counterthreats of trade sanctions, Senator McMullan simply  described his meeting as very useful. The new trade minister  was reluctant to dwell on the crisis of last December,  preferring to point out that bilateral trade grew by 30 percent  in 1993, and is now worth $2 billion [currency not specified] a  year.    [McMullan] There are the jobs of thousands of people in each  country dependent upon the success of our trade, and so we are  both working to maintain and build on that success.    [Watson] How would you characterize the relationship now,  sir?    [McMullan] Oh, I think it is a successful working bilateral  relationship which is very successful at a trade level and is  healthy at all those other things that are part of relationship  between neighbors -- to do with tourism, cultural exchange --  but the strength of the relationship is the commercial, the  trade, the investment relationship, and that is very strong and  rapidly growing, 1993 was a year of outstanding growth in trade  between our two countries.    [Watson] While Malaysia could have suffered serious trade,  investment, and employment losses, Kaula Lumpur was prepared  last December to threaten links with Australia over Paul  Keating's remarks. In the end, the prime minister said he  regretted the remarks and relations rapidly returned to normal.  Now it's Britain that's bearing the brunt of Dr. Mahathir's  wrath. Last month, Kuala Lumpur announced that in future  British firms would be barred from government contracts in  retaliation for London media allegations of high-level  corruption in Malaysia. The move could cost British industry  billions of dollars. Given that so much can hinge on a loose  word from a foreign leader or a newspaper article, would Senator  McMullan encourage Australian business to invest in Malaysia?    [McMullan] Yes, we are encouraging Australian business to  invest throughout the region, we've consciously, as a matter....  [pauses] The government has consciously done research and  released a report showing that more investment in this region  will lead to more trade and create more jobs. So we encourage  people to do it. It's a question for any individual company  where their corporate strategy and their view of whether they  might make a profit is where they should invest and if that  happens to be Malaysia well then we will recommend that they do  it.    [Watson] Dr. Mahathir now says he may consider lifting the  ban on British firms when the British press stops telling lies  about Malaysia. [end recording]</p>

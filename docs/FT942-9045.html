			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Harare sows seeds for an investment harvest / Review of the progress and potential of an ambitious structural adjustment programme Political transition in South Africa and economic reform in Zimbabwe are transforming the regional business climate, suggesting that Zimbabwe's investment promotion conference, starting in London tomorrow, will prove far more successful than its predecessor five years ago. Then, Zimbabwe had not embraced structural adjustment, and South Africa appeared headed for long-running, bloody confrontation. After a slow start in 1991, economic reform in Zimbabwe has accelerated over the past 18 months with two substantial tranches of exchange control and foreign payments liberalisation. This was complemented by price deregulation, labour laws and investment regulations, the commercialisation  -though not yet privatisation - of some state enterprises, the freeing of interest rates and a partial exchange rate float. In January, the Zimbabwe dollar was devalued by 17 per cent and quantitative import controls were abolished. A two-tier exchange rate system was created with exporters allowed to retain 60 per cent of their foreign earnings, selling the balance to the Reserve (central) Bank of Zimbabwe at the official exchange rate. Initially, the free market rate traded at a discount of some 5 per cent below the official rate of ZDollars 8 to the dollar, but the gap has since narrowed to less than 1 per cent, and the market is to be unified later this year when exporters will retain all their earnings and all current account transactions will have been liberalised. This cannot come too soon for some of the multinationals attending this week's meeting. In an effort to attract new investment, Zimbabwe has - mistakenly - favoured the relatively few newcomers (Tony O Reilly's Heinz and Algy Cluff's gold mines being the two most notable) over the long-standing players such as Unilever, Dunlop, Carnaud Metal Box, Barclays and Standard Chartered Banks . For the past decade, pre-independence investors were not allowed to remit more than 25 per cent of after-tax profits, while new arrivals were allowed 50 per cent. These regulations have since been loosened allowing post-1993 investors 100 per cent repatriation, while existing companies are allowed to remit 50 per cent of profits. Zimbabwe is committed to levelling the field, almost certainly this year which, with the eventual release of blocked funds, will stimulate increased investment activity by existing companies. Portfolio investment was liberalised last year when foreign investors were allowed to trade on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange. In the nine months since this reform took effect, foreigners have injected some Dollars 80m into the market contributing to the 300 per cent surge in share prices over the past year. All this is very different from the 1980s when foreign direct investment averaged a mere Dollars 20m a year. Inflows have since accelerated markedly averaging Dollars 60m a year since 1990. Two big new projects are in the pipeline; the Dollars 225m BHP-Utah platinum mine at Chegutu and a proposed Hong Kong-financed airport hotel and casino close to Harare. The Zimbabwe Investment Centre (ZIC), set up to facilitate and promote investment, approved 843 projects worth some ZDollars 5.6bn (Dollars 1.4bn) between 1989 and 1993. Of these, 100 were foreign and a further 159 were joint-ventures, valued at Dollars 470m, though not all of this represented foreign inflows. In the first quarter of 1994, a further 67 projects were approved, representing new investment of almost Dollars 200m, of which Dollars 63m was foreign or joint-venture. Zimbabwe needs much more; the most disturbing aspect of the ZIC numbers is the number of jobs created. Investment of some Dollars 800m in the last two and a half years has generated less than 35,000 new jobs. With an annual net addition of about 200,000 school-leavers to the labour market, the implication is that the country needs to invest nearly Dollars 5bn annually, or 25 per cent more than its GDP, merely to peg unemployment at its present level of around 30 per cent. Clearly, that is not going to happen, implying a combination of higher levels of unemployment and enhanced reliance on the informal sector. Higher investment levels are also needed to kick-start the sluggish economy. Since independence in 1980, real GDP growth has fallen behind the 3.1 per cent rate of population increase, expanding at 2.8 per cent annually. As a result real income per head is lower than at independence and 16 per cent below its peak of the mid-1970s. Assuming the economy can grow at a steady 5 per cent a year, it will take a decade to regain 1975 living standards. Policy reform is a significant part of the solution, but weak commodity prices, adverse weather conditions, and regional political instability have left their mark on the economy. With commodity prices seemingly on the upturn and the regional political environment better than any time for over 30 years, investment prospects have brightened considerably. Regional investment should improve with the political climate, but there are fears that investors, motivated as the International Finance Corporation notes, by market size more than anything else, will plump for South Africa's Dollars 112bn market rather than Zimbabwe's Dollars 4bn. For Pretoria's neighbours, it is a swings and roundabouts situation. Market size, infrastructure and logistics dictate that a stable South Africa, accounting for more than 80 per cent of southern African GDP, will attract the lion's share of new investment. But Zimbabwe with its relatively efficient infrastructure, its plentiful cheap labour and close proximity to the South African hub of Pretoria Witwatersrand-Vereeniging, should be able to exploit new and different market opportunities. For this to happen Zimbabwean business will have to rethink its strategy, seeking niche markets and going for joint-venture opportunities in alliances with South African business rather than risking head-on competition. None of this will happen without continuing, and urgent, policy reform and a stronger commitment to an economy, that welcomes foreign capital and skills and facilitates cross-border commerce and investment.</p>

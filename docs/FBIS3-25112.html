The PAC's strange bedfellows, which it hopes will agree to  stand under its banner, include the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]  the National People's Party, Gazankulu's Ximoko [Whip of the  Nation] Progressive Party, QwaQwa's Dikwankwetla [Strong],  kwaNdebele's Intando YeSizwe [Will of the Nation], kaNgwane's  Inyandza [Cluster] National Movement and Ciskei's African  Democratic Movement. "As we learn from the Bible," said PAC  national organiser Maxwell Nemadzivhanani, "Jesus Christ did not  become a sinner by mixing with sinners, but instead upheld and  moved them to repent. Revolutionaries shouldn't divorce  themselves from the masses under the guise of maintaining their  purity."    The PAC had previously given the impression that it did not  want to work with the "regime's puppets", although it was  revealed last year that a number of Ciskei cabinet ministers  held dual membership in both the ADM and PAC.    Wounds have hardly healed since Brigadier Oupa Gqozo's  Ciskei  Defence Force killed 28 people in 1992 as they tried to march on  Bisho, yet the PAC hopes to take his ADM along on a PAC ticket.  The Ciskei government's failure to register in time for  inclusion in the TEC [Transitional Executive Committee] after it  severed ties with the Freedom Alliance, might just be a bonus to  the PAC.    Ciskei Council a State spokesman Cedric Harrop said the ADM  would contest the elections either under its own name or as part  of an alliance. He said no formal meetings had taken place with  the PAC, but "sentiments expressed by Gqozo in the past  indicated that he would be prepared to enter into such  negotiations with the PAC. The only stumbling block could be  violence."    It was not enough for the PAC to place a moratorium on the  armed struggle, he said; guarantees were also needed. "We are  convinced the PAC wants an end to violence, but its problem has  been to commit APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army]," he said.    The PAC's surprising policy shift follows last week's  meeting  between IFP president Mangosuthu Buthelezi and the PAC's  Clarence Makwetu, allegedly brokered by former PAC stalwart and  now IFP central committee member, Ziba Jiyane.    Nemadzivhanani revealed this week that violence and the  double ballot were not the only issues discussed by the two  leaders. He said other issues regarding a "necessary common  strategy" to persuade other influential personalities and  organisations to work with the PAC were also discussed.    Sources in Natal said this week the PAC's regional  man-and-a-fax office had closed. Joe Mkhwanazi is now said to  be organising in the rural areas where land is a drawcard, and  is said to have the blessing of the IFP.    Amichand Rajbansi, of the National People's Party, was the  first party leader to enthuse over meeting the PAC "at the  earliest possible time", said Nemadzivhanani. Rajbansi said  that after elections were proclaimed, he would give the PAC six  days to decide whether it wanted to enter an alliance with his  party.    Nemadzivhanani maintained none of the political parties  would  win the elections on the basis of their membership -- over nine  million South Africans did not belong to a political party. "A  vote is a vote in an election; there is no reactionary or  revolutionary vote. The vote of Rajbansi is identical to that of  Makwetu. Anyone's vote must be used to put a principled  organisation like the PAC into power," he said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Cal-Almond also objected to the new Credit-Back program's imposition of a 50 percent Credit-Back limit for promotional activities in foreign markets. Cal-Almond stated that this is not an expansion of the previous rule, but is instead a restriction because the former rule allowed 100% credit for qualified promotional activities in foreign markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The former creditable advertising and promotion program allowed for variable levels of credit for different activities, between 50 percent and 150 percent depending on the activity. The new Credit-Back program is designed to be more equitable because the credit allowed for all activities is the same. The amount of credit granted for foreign advertising expenditures is identical to the amount given for domestic advertising.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes that having the same credit amount for each activity provides equity for all handlers' advertising and promotional activities. No preference is given in the new Credit-Back program for one type of advertising and promotional activity over another.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The range of Credit-Back activities has been expanded so that handlers will be able to receive credit for 13 additional categories of promotion and advertising. This expansion could offset any increased outlays which handlers must make for brand promotion and advertising projects due to the reduced rate of credit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new Credit-Back program is designed to provide handlers with more flexibility in conducting their advertising and promotional activities. The commenters seem to be suggesting that it would be more desirable for the new program to have an increased credit amount than what is currently allowed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 16, 1994, the Board met and discussed possible revisions that could be made to the new Credit-Back program. It was expressed at this meeting that the 50 percent Credit-Back amount may impose a greater financial burden on handlers than was anticipated. The Board unanimously recommended that the Credit-Back amount be modified from 50 percent to 662/3 percent ($1.00 for every $1.50 spent). It was determined that this amount would provide incentive for handlers to maintain their individual advertising and promotional efforts and still allow adequate funds for the generic portion of the new advertising and promotion program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes that the new Credit-Back program's expanded activities along with an increased credit amount will provide handlers with more incentive to maintain and more flexibility to conduct their individual advertising and promotional efforts. Therefore, we are modifying the new Credit-Back program in this final rule by increasing the amount of credit allowed for approved promotional activities from 50 percent to 662/3 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

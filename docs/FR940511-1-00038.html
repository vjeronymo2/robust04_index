			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In addition to these sources, the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Data Collection System (``AAPCC'') includes cases reported by participating poison control centers. The AAPCC received 10,193 reports of ingestions of ethanol-containing mouthwash by children under 6 years of age during the 5-year period from 1987 through 1991. The AAPCC reported 1,847 ingestions of mouthwash with ethanol by children under 5 years old in 1991. Of these ingestions, 181 resulted in minor or moderate outcomes (symptoms were not life-threatening) and 1 resulted in a major, or life-threatening, outcome. Most cases reported to poison control centers are managed in a non-health-care facility, usually the patient's home.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> C. Proposed Regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The mouthwash petition requested that the Commission require CR packaging for mouthwash that contains more than 5 percent ethanol. The Commission decided to propose that mouthwash products with 3 grams (g) or more of absolute ethanol per package or retail-sale unit should be subject to the regulation. This level is obtained by dividing the lethal dose of ethanol (3 g/kg of body weight) for a 10-kg child (30 g) by a safety factor of 10. This safety factor is needed because less than the ``lethal'' dose can produce serious toxic effects, or even death from hypoglycemia or other secondary effects. Three grams of absolute ethanol are present in approximately 2.6 ounces of mouthwash with 5 percent ethanol.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulating at the level requested by the petitioners (more than 5 percent ethanol) may not sufficiently protect children. This is because relatively small amounts of mouthwash at a level of 5 percent or somewhat below would exceed the 3 g limit that the Commission has preliminarily determined is needed to protect children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> D. Statutory Considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> 1. Hazard to Children  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> As noted above, the toxicity data concerning children's ingestion of ethanol-containing mouthwash demonstrate that the amount of ethanol in available mouthwash preparations is sufficient to cause serious illness and injury to children. These mouthwash preparations are readily available to children. Even if the manufacturers of these mouthwashes that are members of the NDMA and CFTA will voluntarily use CR packaging for their products, the Commission concludes that a regulation is needed to ensure that products subject to the regulation will be placed in CR packaging by all mouthwash packagers. In addition, the regulation will enable the Commission to enforce the CR packaging requirement and ensure that effective CR packaging is used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to section 3(a) of the PPPA, 15 U.S.C. 1472(a), the Commission finds preliminarily that the degree and nature of the hazard to children from ingesting ethanol-containing mouthwashes is such that special packaging is required to protect children from serious illness. The Commission bases this preliminary finding on the toxic nature of such mouthwashes, described above, and the accessibility of such preparations to children in the home.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> 2. Technical Feasibility, Practicability, and Appropriateness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In issuing a standard for special packaging under the PPPA, the Commission is required by section 3(a)(2) of the PPPA, 15 U.S.C. 1472(a)(2), to find that the special packaging is ``technically feasible, practicable, and appropriate.'' Technical feasibility exists when technology exists or readily can be developed and implemented by the effective date to produce packaging that conforms to the standards. Practicability means that special packaging complying with the standards can utilize modern mass production and assembly line techniques. Appropriateness exists when packaging complying with the standards will adequately protect the integrity of the substance and not interfere with the intended storage or use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CR packages are mass produced for products that contain ethanol and have similar properties to mouthwashes. Two industry groups have indicated that their members can have CR packages for one size of their mouthwashes by August 31, 1994, with their entire lines converted by May 1, 1995. In addition, one major manufacturer of mouthwash has introduced a popular size of its product in packaging that is not only child resistant, but is easier for adult consumers (and especially older adults) to open. Therefore, the Commission preliminarily concludes that CR packaging for mouthwashes is technically feasible, practicable, and appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> 3. Other Considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In establishing a special packaging standard, section 3(b) of the PPPA, 15 U.S.C. 1472(b), requires the Commission to consider the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The reasonableness of the standard;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Available scientific, medical, and engineering data concerning special packaging and concerning childhood accidental ingestions, illness, and injury caused by household substances;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. The manufacturing practices of industries affected by the PPPA; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

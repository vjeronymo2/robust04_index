			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Christiania Bank recovery grows A sharp reduction in loan losses underpinned the continuing recovery of Christiania Bank, Norway's second biggest bank, in the first half, enabling it to notch up net profits of NKr780m (Dollars 110m) in spite of bond market turbulence. The result is more than double last year's NKr324m profit and reflects a healthier Norwegian economy and the bank's loan loss recovery drive. For the first time in many years, amounts written back on previous loan losses exceeded new loan losses during the second quarter. This brought first-half loan loss provisions down to NKr61m compared with NKr913m in the same period in 1993. The bank benefited from higher lending volumes and maintained net interest income. But it has not escaped the international interest rate upheaval, taking NKr220m in losses on its bond portfolio in the first half compared with NKr265m in profits a year ago. A drive to reduce interest rate exposure is bearing fruit. Christiania was a casualty of Norway's banking sector crisis, suffering four years of losses between 1989 and 1992 and a collapse into state ownership. Following a NKr2bn international share issue last autumn, the state holds 69 per cent of the bank. Christiania has been able to write back amounts on previous loan losses due to gains from repossessed property sales, higher collateral values, and the rise in shares acquired through debt-to-equity conversions. It still has some loan book problems.</p>

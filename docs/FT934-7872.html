			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Accountancy Column: Putting finance directors in a larger frame - Why a traditional accountancy background may no longer be enough for a complex job NEW PRESSURES are transforming the finance directors of British companies from aloof and authoritarian figures into executives with different abilities and approaches - and, in the process, raising questions about the traditional dominance of the job by accountants. One set of pressures is the shifting balance from finance director as controller to businessman, from score-keeper to commercial operator. Where once there was a specialist fiefdom, there are signs that barriers between finance and other parts of the business are breaking down. The finance director is becoming a team player, more a general manager than a technical expert. On the other hand, recent changes in accounting standards and in corporate governance - partly linked to the Cadbury Report - are re-emphasising the finance director's status as watchdog and corporate policeman. Non-executive directors, newly conscious of their monitoring duties and more visible to the outside world, look to the finance director for technical guidance. At the same time, some of the activities for which he or she is responsible, such as treasury and foreign exchange, have become much more complicated. The finance director has to have a firm grasp of the sophisticated techniques of risk management. Another source of pressure, especially for large companies, is the growing emphasis on external communications. While the importance of investor relations is not new, large institutions are probing more deeply into the companies in which they hold substantial stakes. The finance director is closely involved in maintaining these relationships. The increasingly demanding nature of the job is one of the themes which emerges from a survey of finance directors carried out by Professor Peter Abell, Mike Cranna and myself at the London School of Economics, and sponsored by the Financial Executives Group of the Board for Chartered Accountants in Business*. There is no disagreement about the weight of the job in corporate decision-making. In most companies, the finance director has a closer relationship with the chief executive than any other board member. For investors in a company, the appointment of a new finance director is an important event. For the chief executive, it is vital that the qualifications of the new incumbent should fit the job that needs to be done. The requirements of the job vary according to the nature of the business. The finance director generally has a larger influence in diversified groups, where he or she provides a counter-weight to the heads of the operating companies, than in single-industry businesses where technical and marketing factors are central. There is a difference between the skills needed in a company in the throes of restructuring and those in a more stable environment. Nevertheless, the survey highlights a move away from a dominant concern with financial reporting and control towards broader business responsibilities. As one respondent put it, the finance director 'has to understand the company's strengths and weaknesses and shift from reporting history to driving the need for change throughout the organisation'. There is stress on the effectiveness of operations in all aspects, with non-financial measures being given greater weight. The director of a German-owned company said German finance directors tend to have a deep understanding of the product and the customer, in contrast to the more detached stance of their traditional British counterparts. The need for an open, participative style was stressed. The finance director has to 'de-mystify the numbers'. With the wider accessibility of management information and the greater numeracy of departmental managers, the finance director 'is no longer the sole keeper of knowledge' and 'will need the skills of an orchestra conductor or theatre director more than those of a regimental commander'. The five most important skills mentioned for the future were: knowledge of information technology, personnel management, strategic planning, marketing and general management. Experience outside finance was considered important, perhaps essential. 'Finance directors are sometimes too remote from the sharp end; a spell in line management has a humbling effect and creates a common bond with colleagues'. A majority agreed that finance directors would become more entrepreneurial. While there were some warning voices, the consensus was that the finance director should not be a technical specialist standing apart from operations, but 'a highly motivated team member dedicated to growing the company'. Given those changes, is accountancy training still the best starting point? Most finance directors of large British companies are chartered accountants by background, but there is concern about the inroads being made by masters of business administration (MBAs) and by other accountancy qualifications. A majority of the chartered accountant-trained finance directors thought their training was appropriate (though critical of parts of it), but a sizeable minority took a different view. This latter group emphasised the irrelevance of much of their training for the world of business and industry. 'Unless the training changes,' one respondent said, 'chief executives will decide that the key aspects of the job are more closely matched by other qualifications; finance directors will have accountants working for them in the same way as tax or treasury specialists, but the high ground will have been lost to MBAs.' Not surprisingly, some of the MBAs in our survey felt that an accountancy background was irrelevant for a finance director as long as there was a good core of accounting expertise in the finance function. 'Accounting skills in the traditional sense represent an increasingly small proportion of the finance director's duties'. On the other side of the fence were the hard-line accountants who saw no merit in MBAs: 'The MBA doesn't provide enough training in monitoring and control'. If there was a common strand, it was the need to combine the best of both worlds. 'The accountant's ability to spot inconsistencies in numbers is a vital counterpoint to the MBA's strategic management thinking'; 'The best route is accountancy plus an MBA, with broad management experience'. Many finance directors who had trained as accountants insisted that their time in the profession had given them a feel for figures, a professional discipline and an objectivity which were immensely valuable. The sense of many responses was captured by the comment that the 'finance director will play a bigger role in managing change, especially by being involved in the restructuring of businesses to make them more flexible and more responsive to customers'. To make this contribution, the finance director needed to have an entrepreneurial approach, but without losing the financial control skills which remain at the heart of the job. The accountancy profession can no longer take it for granted that this watchdog/entrepreneur role is best performed by accountants. If the profession is to maintain its dominance among senior finance directors, it has to take note of the changing nature of the job and, like the finance department itself, open itself out to different skills and disciplines. * Sir Geoffrey Owen, former editor of the FT, is a programme director at the Centre for Economic Performance, London School of Economics.

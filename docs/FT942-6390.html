			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / College faces cuts after union deal The Department for Education is expected to cut funding for a Manchester further education college which has offered lecturers new contracts limiting teaching time. Any such move by ministers would be a further escalation of the dispute between the Natfhe lecturers' union and college principals. The dispute started in April last year when colleges were removed from local authority control. On Saturday the union used its annual conference to announce an agreement with the Manchester College of Art and Technology. This places a limit of 756 hours on each lecturer's teaching time a year and gives contractual safeguards on the length of the working week. In February Mr Tim Boswell, the further-education minister, said that up to Pounds 50m would be withheld from colleges' budgets unless they removed 'restrictive practices'. The money would be released only 'when there had been satisfactory progress within colleges towards more flexible contracts of employment'. However, lecturers plan to strike in 120 colleges next month, aiming for contracts similar to Manchester's. The union yesterday inducted a new president, Ms Doreen Cameron, while Mr John Akker, the union's next general secretary, pledged that the union's tactics would not change. Mr Roger Ward, chief executive of the Colleges' Employers' Forum, which negotiates on behalf of most principals, said the Manchester contract was 'largely irrelevant' because 332 colleges were already implementing new contracts in line with the government guidelines.</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Eagle Trust action opens Eagle Trust, the film equipment conglomerate, yesterday began its High Court action to recover Pounds 13.5m from Swiss Bank Corporation Investment Banking. Eagle Trust is suing Savory Milln, a stockbroking subsidiary of SBCI, over its handling of the underwriting of the company's 1987 rights issue to fund its takeover of Samuelson, a film equipment company. It claims the brokers were reckless in accepting the Pounds 13.5m from Mr John Ferriday, Eagle Trust's former chief executive, to meet his personal sub-underwriting commitments to them. Eagle Trust claims the money was misappropriated from the company by Mr Ferriday to meet these sub-underwriting obligations and that Savory Milln should have known this was the case. The case is expected to last three weeks. Mr Ferriday was jailed for six years in April last year after being convicted of six counts of theft from Eagle Trust to cover personal losses sustained in the October 1987 stock market crash.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Kuwaiti public offering draws strong demand The first public offering of shares listed in Kuwait for over a decade was heavily oversubscribed yesterday. It provided a strong lift to the local capital market and the government's privatisation programme. Investors from Kuwait and other Gulf Co-operation Council countries put in bids estimated to total Pounds 150m to buy 30m shares in Commercial Facilities Company, a consumer finance company which specialises in car loans. Commercial Facilities shares were priced at KD0.70, an 11.4 per cent discount on their last closing price of KD0.79 on August 28 when the stock was suspended from trading on the Kuwait Stock Exchange in preparation for the sale. Kuwait Investment Authority - a division of the ministry of finance - will reduce its stake to less than 37 per cent from 54 per cent, as a result of the deal which was managed by the National Bank of Kuwait. After the Gulf war in 1991 Kuwait announced a programme to sell some of its stakes in about 60 domestic firms. Sales of state electricity, water and communications sectors have been mooted. Commercial Facilities has assets of more than Dollars 420m, supported by shareholders' equity of Dollars 115m.</p>

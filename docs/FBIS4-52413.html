			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The Japanese Reactionaries Who </F> Actively Participate in a U.S. Plot for War Provocation"]    [Text] The Japanese reactionaries have recently  participated in the U.S. plot to regard the Republic as an enemy  and to crush [apsal] it. As has already been reported,  Japanese-U.S. military officials concerned recently discussed  the so-called Japanese-U.S. cooperative system in Tokyo to cope  with the situation when conflicts break out on the Korean  peninsula [choson pandoesoui punjaeng palsaenge taeunghan].    Japan's KYODO News Agency reported that Japan and the United  States considered plans to sign a Japanese-U.S. agreement for  the supply of military materials in order for the U.S. Forces  stationed in Japan and the Japanese Self-Defense Army to support  each other, in areas of munition and fuel, in case of an  emergency situation on the Korean peninsula. This clearly shows  that the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have openly pursued  their ambition to invade our country in collusion with each  other.    In particular, what we cannot overlook is that the Japanese  reactionaries have disclosed their attempt to invade Korea by  talking about the nuclear development or missile threat by  someone at the same time when the United States' plot of  crushing the Republic has been unprecedentedly strengthened.  They have publicly said that in the event of an emergency  situation on the Korean peninsula, Japan's dispatch of arms to  the Korean frontlines and its joint military action with the  U.S. Forces would be constitutional.    According to the Japanese reactionaries' plan to reinvade  Korea, the basic strike forces of the Japanese Self-Defense Army  have been mobilized and deployed into the western areas of Japan  and, thus, are on alert status.    The Japanese Self-Defense Army is frequently conducting the  military exercise geared towards a simulated Korean war [choson  chonjaengul kasanghan] and the large-scale Japanese-U.S. joint  military exercise. Furthermore, the Japanese Foreign Ministry  officials concerned have greatly maintained that in case the  United States carries out a sea blockade against the DPRK, Japan  should reorganize the supply service system to participate in it.    As disclosed, the Japanese reactionaries have removed  articles from its constitution that prohibit the exercise of  collective self-defense rights under the pretext of so-called  international cooperation, thus availing themselves of an  opportunity in which tensions on the Korean peninsula are  aggravated. As a result, they have attempted to achieve their  hidden ambition for overseas expansion, by more actively  participating in a U.S. war plot against the Republic.    In a 6 April meeting to revise the defense plan, the members  of the Council of Defense Affairs, an advisory organization to  the Japanese prime minister, talked about the concrete study of  joint action which Japan would take with the U.S. Forces  stationed in Japan under the pretext of our nuclear issue. Even  the Defense Office has supported it.    Regarding this, Japan's YOMIURI SHIMBUM reported on 6 April:  Japan should take advantage of U.S. war plots to immediately  formulate a crisis management system [wigikwanri chegye]. Also,  the paper reported that the Japanese Self-Defense laws and other  laws concerned should be revised in order to support the U.S.  Forces in case they carry out the sea blockade against our  country.    Japan's KYODO News Agency reported on 6 April: A Japanese  Foreign Ministry high-level official said that in case a war  breaks out on the Korean peninsula, not only the Japanese  Self-Defense Army's transport planes but also warships [hamson]  should be mobilized to evacuate the Japanese people from foreign  countries, including South Korea, and that, for this end, the  law on Japan's Self Defense Army should be revised as soon as  possible. Thus, he referred to the emergency situation on the  Korean peninsula.    All these facts show that if the United States were to  provoke a new war on the Korean peninsula, Japan intends to  carry out supply service support [hubang chiwon] for the U.S.  Forces, and that it intends to directly participate in a war  against our country.    The Japanese reactionaries should be hold totally  responsible  for the consequences arising from their act of positively  participating in the U.S. plot for war provocation. Also, they  should clearly look at the trends of the times and act with  discretion.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jacques Delors, who was the guest of Arte  Television's Transit program this evening, said he entirely  agrees with the NATO ultimatum given to the Serbs. The  president of the European Commission in Brussels thinks that an  international peace conference should be held as soon as  possible:    [Begin Delors recording] As things stand now, that is what  has to be done. Then if the Serbs have finally understood, an  international peace conference should be organized in order to  find a solution, which will unfortunately be based on the  partition of the territory, which is now inevitable.    This is the second time I have felt ashamed in my life. The  first time was when I ran away, walking a 500-km distance,  running away from the German troops in 1940 during the invasion  of my country, when there were no French troops to defend us.  This is the second time I have felt ashamed of myself. The  first time I was 12 or 13 years old. The construction of Europe  gave me hope that this would all change. I am nearing the end  of my career and I fear that I will bear this shame until the  end of life. Yes I am ashamed! [end Delors recording]</p>

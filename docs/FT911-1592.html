			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Survey of Franchising (5): Banks warm to those lower risk options - Raising Finance / There are special packages on offer for the right team WOULD-BE franchisees who have teamed up with an established franchisor can expect a favourable deal from their bank manager when they approach him for start-up finance. Many of the UK banks offer special franchise packages which reflect what they see as the lower risks attached to a franchised business. Nevertheless, two years of very high interest rates have reduced the influx of new entrants to the franchise sector. The broad middle range of franchisees who have to take out a bank loan secured on their home to fund a franchise in the Pounds 50,000-Pounds 120,000 range have been hard hit. The high cost of borrowing; the reduced value of their home to be used as security; and the difficulty of selling their home to relocate to a district where a franchise is available have combined to cut the numbers of potential franchisees. The wealthy investors and businessmen buying into highly priced hotel and fast food franchises - often taking up several outlets at a time - have not been so adversely affected. Nor have the individuals paying out up to Pounds 20,000 for a van and a set of tools to carry out car repairs or domestic cleaning. Applicants for what are sometimes called job franchises can often finance entry from redundancy pay or savings. For franchisees who do need to turn to a bank for finance the big four clearing banks and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) have specialist franchising departments. Lloyds Bank has had a franchise department for the past five years and has a head office team of three specialists. National Westminster Bank claims to have been the first into the market with the appointment of a franchise manager in 1981 and it has a team of 12 people in the UK. The bank has lent more than Pounds 200m to franchisees over the past 10 years, virtually without loss, according to Mr Peter Stern, senior franchise manager. Mr Stern contrasts the enthusiasm of the UK banks for franchising with what he sees as the relative neglect of the sector by the banks in the US. Sometimes franchising and licencing activities - both of which can involve issues such as brand name and trade mark protection - are combined. NatWest's franchise department also handles retail licencing - where a company allows others to use its retail formula without going as far as fully-fledged franchising - while the RBS's franchise team also deal with technology licencing. Somewhat unorthodox competition for the established banks emerged just over a year ago when AIB Bank (formerly Allied Irish Bank) teamed up with Commercial Union Assurance and the Centre for Franchise Marketing, a consultancy, to offer franchise finance. This arrangement, known as the Franchise Alliance, was intended to help the two financial partners prise an opening into a market dominated by the four large clearing banks. With the promise of a decision on finance within 48 hours and the offer to visit would-be borrowers at their home or premises instead of requiring them to come into a bank, the alliance has financed just over 350 franchisees, according to Mr David Taube of the Centre for Franchise Marketing. Funds have been provided to franchisees of established organisations such as the Body Shop as well as to newly-formed franchises, he says. The banks are convinced enough of the additional security provided by the franchise formula to increase the ratio of finance they will provide compared with the sums available to other businesses. NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland, for example, will provide twice the sum invested in the franchise by the franchisee compared with its normal lending ratio of 1:1. Propositions must be proven franchises which can pass the banks' vetting criteria. Even franchised businesses have their financial limits. 'Invariably, if a local branch manager has been persuaded by a franchisee to provide him with 100 per cent finance, the franchisee struggles,' says Mr Stern. As well as vetting the franchisee, the bank looks closely at the franchisor. It assesses the success of the franchisor's pilot operation, if the franchise is a new one, his management experience and his finances. This ensures the company is strong enough to develop a franchising chain. Of the two-thirds finance which NatWest provides, it would normally expect security for 50 to 60 per cent though if less security was available it might still go ahead by lending under the government's Loan Guarantee Scheme. The balance of the lending would be unsecured. The bank takes no security from the franchisor though it does expect the franchisee to allow it to talk to the franchisor if the franchisee does not perform satisfactorily. With an estimated 5 to 6 per cent of franchisees failing each year the 2:1 lending ratio and the security taken on the amount loaned combine to reduce the bank's risk to just 1.5 to 2 per cent each year, Mr Stern calculates. Although the banks frequently establish close links with franchisors they emphasise that providing finance for a particular franchise does not imply the bank's formal endorsement. The franchisee is still expected to carry out his own checks on the soundness of the business he is taking on.</p>

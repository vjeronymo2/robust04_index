			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Technology: Squeaky wheel gets the grease - R&amp;D / How the funding for EC research projects is distributed and how to get it THE next race for European Community research funding has begun. On Tuesday, the EC's 17 commissioners agreed an overall Community budget for the next five years which will be worth Ecu 86bn (Pounds 61bn) annually by the time it comes up for renewal in 1997. A chunk of this cash - some Ecu6.9bn - will be available for 'internal policies', including research and development. Exactly how it will be spent has yet to be decided - the Community is only just getting round to handing out the Ecu 5.7bn earmarked for the 1990-94 programmes. But according to Martin Collins, a former EC project manager and author of a new book* on applying for EC research funds, companies should act now if they want to influence the European Commission's research policy. 'Now is the perfect time,' says Collins, who works in Brussels for Doornheim Devries, a technology consultancy. 'The officials are just sitting down to think about it and they'll be calling together all sorts of technical groups to discuss the programmes in the next few months.' EC research and technology funding is available principally through the 'framework programmes', aimed in theory at cross-border consortia carrying out pre-competitive research - projects with long lead times. The money, which is channeled through five different departments of the European Commission**, normally covers up to 50 per cent of project costs. The framework programme which officials are now working on is the fourth, which will be divided into perhaps six strategic areas; they in turn will be split into specific programmes aimed at, for example, information technology (the programme known as Esprit) or advanced materials (Brite/Euram). The fourth framework programme is likely to overlap with its predecessor, which finishes in 1994. It could prove to be the most controversial programme of Community-funded research yet. This is because research funding provides excellent terrain for the battle between advocates of an interventionist EC industrial policy and the free-marketeers. There is already a forum for the funding of market-oriented projects - the Eureka pan-European research programme Its aims are broadly the same as the EC framework programme - to encourage the competitiveness of European industry through cross-border co-operation - but Eureka's 20-nation membership goes beyond the 12 EC states. It acts as a central agency, bringing together partners who then apply for funding to national governments or to the EC. The most fundamental difference, however, and the one that makes Community funds a more attractive prospect for many companies is that whereas Eureka projects are spontaneous and conform to no set strategic plan, the scale and direction of EC research funding can be assessed in advance. There is a standard procedure candidates for EC research programmes must go through. It usually lasts - from planning to a final decision - up to 18 months: Experts decide a 'workplan' for a particular programme. The Commission might ask for expressions of interest in the programme through an announcement in its daily Official Journal. A formal 'call for proposals' appears in the Journal giving details of the programme. Further information may be distributed at special proposers' days held in member states. After the deadline, evaluation panels assess the technical merit of a proposal, the reputation of those involved and the ability of the consortium to achieve its aims. A management committee examines the balance of the consortium and the way in which the funds are likely to be distributed between member states. The Commission negotiates with the consortium about its composition and its budget and eventually passes the dossier on to the director-general of the relevant Commission department for final approval. It is important not to leave an application until the last moment. A company which makes no move until the call for proposals appears may find itself facing a deadline for applications as short as six weeks. On the other hand, according to Collins's guide, a little foresight can give a company a valuable inside track. Such a company might be able to influence the direction of EC policy at the planning stage. It would certainly get to know the kind of proposal which Commission officials were looking for and the people to lobby during the technical evaluation of the project and budget negotiations. No company should underestimate the need to get inside the Commission structure, either directly - by seeking representation on any of the planning or assessment panels - or indirectly, by buttering up national representatives and Commission officials, says Collins. Successful lobbying, however, will be useless if it is not matched by a judicious choice of consortium partners and an effectively drafted application. Choosing consortium members is still a mixture of cunning and common sense. For example, it will obviously be an advantage to have partners with prior experience of and perhaps influence in the applications process, and to ensure that the consortium will not break apart because of simple problems such as inability to communicate. In a more cynical vein, Collins also advises candidates to pick at least one partner from Portugal, Spain or Greece - to salve Brussels' conscience about the neglect of poorer EC members - and to steer clear of Japanese partners, who might arouse the underlying prejudice of some Commission officials. For the application itself, the advice is straightforward: allow plenty of time, perhaps three months, isolate the programme's objectives and selection criteria and make sure you answer all of them. The logistics of applying for EC research funds seem daunting. Once the application has been lodged, candidates have to attend numerous meetings and negotiations before a decision is made. And even assuming a consortium is successful, about a third of its budget might have to be set aside to cover the cost of attending regular meetings with partners and the Commission, and the preparation and submission of progress reports to Brussels. Given that sort of administrative commitment, it is unsurprising that many companies have little energy left for the EC's vision of building a 'European Technology Community' and prefer to take the money and run. Even if the goal is purely financial, is it really worth joining the race for funding? Collins has mixed feelings. On the one hand he knows a number of small start-up companies which have established themselves by tapping into the Commission network and drawing down research funding. But he adds: 'If you already have a viable business, don't get side-tracked by EC grants, because they can be so time-consuming and obviously the obligations you take on can be so great they might distract you from the core business.' * A Complete Guide to the EC's Research Funds by Martin Collins, 35, Kogan Page, 120 Pentonville Road, London, N1 9JN. ** European Commission, Rue de la Loi 200, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium.

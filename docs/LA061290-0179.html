			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TOP ROYAL OPERA TICKETS ABOVE $170  </P> <P> Top ticket prices at the Royal Opera House will exceed $170 for the first time  next season, the financially struggling company says.  </P> <P> Beginning in September, opera tickets at the theater in Covent Garden will jump  on average by 17% while ballet seats will rise 25%.  </P> <P> The decision to raise prices comes as the theater struggles with an accumulated  deficit of about $8.5 million. The company projects a deficit of $3.4 million  this season.  </P> <P> "Even in a perfect world our ticket prices would have to rise to keep pace with  inflation," said Jeremy Isaacs, general director of the Royal Opera House. "We  have taken these steps with reluctance in order to sustain rather than reduce  our service to our audiences."  </P> <P> Prices for 12 of the 126 upcoming opera performances will range from $5 for  seats in the upper balcony, to $172 for the house's best seats. The most  expensive ticket last season was $153.  </P></p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Kohl cracks whip over CDU: Chancellor's warning to his party congress Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, who was easily re-elected as party leader yesterday, threw down the gauntlet to his governing Christian Democrats by warning them to liberalise the economy and open up the party to the younger (and female) generation. If not, Mr Kohl warned, the coalition government, fresh from winning a fourth term in office but with a majority of just 10 seats in the lower house, would not be ready to face the electorate in four years' time. In a speech to the CDU's first party congress since it narrowly won last month's federal election, Mr Kohl highlighted the splits within the party, particularly on how far it should go in co-operating with the opposition, as well as modernising its recruitment and promotion structures. CDU officials yesterday openly admitted that the combined opposition of Social Democrats, Greens/Bundnis 90 and the reformed east German communist Party of Democratic Socialism could no longer be ignored by the government. The opposition holds 331 seats in the Bundestag, ten less than the governing coalition of the CDU, the Bavarian-based Christian Social Union, and the Free Democrats. The FDP's seat tally was reduced by 32 to 47. As a measure of the potential threat posed by the opposition, both Mr Kohl and Mr Wolfgang Schauble, parliamentary leader of the CDU/CSU, yesterday refrained from criticising it, thus endorsing a strategy the latter hopes will keep the opposition divided. Last week, Mr Schauble said the Greens/Bundnis 90 could join the parliamentary committees which sit in secret on security issues from which they have traditionally been excluded. Earlier, the CDU voted for Mr Antje Vollmer, a Green deputy, as one of the four deputy speakers of parliament. The need to prevent any opposition alliance from emerging, and to break the growing influence of the PDS in east Germany is now seen as one of the main strategies of the CDU, senior officials said yesterday. On Sunday, the CDU party in the eastern state of Thuringia, which set up a grand coalition with the SPD at the weekend, said the Christian Democrats should open the party up to former east German communist party members. But there is no stomach in the party to endorse this call officially. Mr Peter Hintze, general secretary and a staunch critic of the PDS, yesterday said he opposed completely any co-operation with 'the radicals', signalling dissent about how the CDU can increase support in the eastern states without compromising its pre-election rhetoric which labelled the PDS as a black party painted red. The CDU is even divided over how it should be modernised. The more conservative rank-and-file would prefer, for example, no special quota for women, a system introduced by the Social Democrats and the Greens more than a decade ago. However, as more younger women in their twenties drift to the Greens, Mr Kohl said it was time to open the doors. The CDU parliamentary group has only 13.9 per cent women, the lowest percentage of any party. The overall average of the new Bundestag is 26.3 per cent.</p>

			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (26): Growth has faded - The electronics sector THIS YEAR marks the 10th anniversary of one of the most significant events in Indian television and electronics manufacturing. It was in 1982 that the administration of Mrs Indira Gandhi abandoned its traditional hostility to televisions, until then thought an unnecessary luxury, and encouraged their use for people to watch the Asian Games. TV manufacturing was given further impetus in the run-up to the general election two years later. The change of policy led to television becoming one of the biggest growth industries of the mid-1980s, with annual expansion of more than 30 per cent the norm. This in turn fuelled strong growth throughout the electronics sector. Few manufacturers are in a mood to celebrate the anniversary. Of the more than 100 companies that entered the market, many have since quit or are in trouble. Three manufacturers - Videocon, Onida and BPL - now dominate the field with a combined market share of more than two-thirds. They and the other remaining manufacturers are competing in a market that has shrunk from 1.3m colour sets and 4.4m black and white in 1988 to 800,000 colour sets and 3.2m monochrome sets in 1991. The electronics components sector, whose fortunes are closely linked to consumer electronics and especially the television industry, is feeling the pressure. Although its production continues to rise, capacity utilisation is low and the returns on its substantial investment are poor. Indigenisation of inputs into the electronics sector has improved significantly in the last 10 years. Whereas manufacture of colour televisions started with 90 per cent of components imported, that is down to 10 per cent. However, the components industry's long-term plans for further advancement are suffering because current volumes are insufficient to justify large-scale investment in facilities to produce components including integrated circuits. That, in turn, will keep up the cost of televisions - Indian prices are among the highest in the world, although televisions are beginning to compete in the export market - and prevent further growth in the market. Tariffs on imported raw materials and components remain high. Television manufacturers are united in what to blame for their woes. Sales taxes, excise duties and other government imposts have risen to a level where they are 50 per cent of the total price of a colour television set. 'Due to this, an industry which is supposed to be a sunrise industry has become a sunset industry in the last four years,' says the Consumer Electronics and TV Manufacturers' Association. The industry believes that in spite of high poverty levels in India, the market is - high taxes aside - capable of enormous growth. 'There is a view that those who can afford to buy televisions have already done so,' says Mr N. Vittal, secretary at the government's department of electronics. 'I do not agree. If China with a comparable population can produce 7m colour sets a year, why should we be satisfied with 800,000?' Industry sources say that household penetration is less than 5 per cent. With the market depressed, manufacturers are concentrating on increasing exports and on diversifying into consumer electronics and related products such as audio equipment, video recorders and household products including washing machines and vacuum cleaners. Internal forecasts by one consumer electronics group predict that Indian sales of video-cassette recorders and players can almost double from Rs5.5bn in 1990-1 to Rs10bn in 1994-5 and those of audio equipment will rise by a similar proportion to Rs13.71bn. Among groups poised to take advantage is Peico Electronics and Electricals, in which Philips has a 40 per cent stake. Peico has had a chequered history in its 60 years. Its fortunes reached a low ebb in the 1980s when labour troubles, a loss of direction and a government-enforced late entry into television manufacturing led to it missing out on the TV boom. However it claims 30 per cent of Indian audio sales and is mounting a more determined attack on the television market. It held No 1 position in the black and white 14-inch market last year, against No 8 position previously Further advances will be helped by the recent government liberalisation which will enable Philips to take a 51 per cent stake in the company which will also market goods under the Philips brand name. The leading indigenous companies are also benefiting from the liberalisation which allows them to market products under the brand name of the foreign, mainly Japanese companies, with which they have collaborations. Onida has tie-ups with JVC, Videocon with Toshiba and BPL with Sanyo. Closer ties would inevitably boost quality and, with it, export potential. According to Cetma, last year's exports of 200,000 colour TV sets is likely to rise to 500,000 this year. But exports alone will not solve the industry's problems. Mr T. P. G. Nambiar, managing director of BPL, which exports more than 10 per cent of its output, says competition from international competitors means that the price of 14-inch televisions in the UK market has fallen from Pounds 81 to Pounds 73. 'We can always sell abroad but the price is never very profitable.' The incentive is that volumes are boosted and the foreign exchange earned can now be spent on importing goods to improve production. Like other manufacturers, Mr Nambiar would prefer to see the main growth in domestic markets. For television manufacturing, if not for consumer electronics as a whole, that could be some way off.</p>

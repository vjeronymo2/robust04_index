			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Business tries to shift blame in latest bribes inquiry: Who is corrupting whom is a crucial issue in the case involving the country's financial police Throughout Italy's corruption scandals businessmen have consistently painted themselves as victims of the system. They were not the corruptors, but the corrupted. The corruptors were venal civil servants and politicians. This defence is being raised again now as Milan magistrates investigate businessmen in northern Italy for paying bribes to members of the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, to carry out 'friendly' tax assessments and inspections. The question of who is doing the corrupting is especially important in this case since it involves a central pillar of the state - the 61,000-strong corps charged with monitoring all financial crime. In the past three weeks, almost 40 businessmen and accountants, and a similar number of the financial police, have been arrested as part of the Milan investigation. Over the weekend, magistrates in Genoa opened a new front, arresting 19 people, including three members of the Guardia di Finanza. First it was the case of Mr Alberto Falck, the prominent private steel producer, who admitted paying L500m (Pounds 205,000) to the Guardia di Finanza. 'There was a system which had to be honoured,' Mr Falck's lawyer was quoted as saying. Then, last week, it was the turn of Mr Paolo Berlusconi, younger brother of prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. He admitted paying out L330m over the inspections of three different companies in the Fininvest group. According to his lawyer, the payments were made under duress. Talking to several businessmen, it emerges that payments to members of the Guardia di Finanza to carry out low key inspections or overlook irregularities in company balance sheets are not uncommon. The practice appears more widespread in northern Italy, and Milan magistrates have uncovered a well-structured system of payments, with bribes being cut on a percentage basis by rank. However, the same businessmen also admit that the process is by no means all one-sided. The payments are often volunteered in what is a mutually beneficial arrangement to both entrepreneur and policeman. 'I don't think we even thought it was a bribe: it was like a glorified form of tipping,' observered one Rome businessman. 'These sort of practices are the natural result of a tax system based on rigid laws and inflexible tax demands, which only become flexible through evasion.' Gen Constantino Berlenghi, the head of the Guardia di Finanza, last week ridiculed the idea of big business being coerced into paying bribes to his men. 'How is it that a big businessman who has access to tax lawyers, professors and other luminaries can make one believe he is being intimidated by a little marshal of the force? It's inconceivable]' Whoever is to blame, it cannot hide the fact that members of the Guardia di Finanza were willing to pocket sums of money, which, by the standards of their pay packets, were very large. A case came to light in Genoa earlier this year of 11 Guardia members taking L300m from a large construction company. The average pay, excluding fringe benefits, of the top four grades of officer in the force is L115m a year. A marshal receives L52m a year. More alarming was the arrest over the weekend of a colonel who had been working closely with Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the leading anti-corruption magistrate in Milan, throughout the past two and half years of corruption investigations. He was accused of having received L150m from Mr Antonio Ligresti, brother of the construction magnate Mr Salvatore Ligresti, known as the 'king of Milan concrete', for inspection of a hotel company's books in 1990. At the same time another person arrested last week in the investigations into Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest empire was Mr Gian Marco Rizzi, a former member of the Guardia di Finanza who was recruited in the early 1980s to become a consultant to the prime minister's media group. Given the spate of Guardia di Finanza arrests, the Italian press has begun to wonder whether there are more than just a few 'rotten apples' in the corps, popularly known as the Yellow Flame because of its insignia. Gen Luigi Ramponi, a former commander of the Guardia di Finanza, was asked by Il Mondo weekly magazine just how many were corrupt. 'After the scandal, everyone thinks dishonesty is widespread; but I am sure the majority are honest. . . . the present cases are isolated. Numerous but isolated. Similar incidents have always happened because the temptations exist. . . .' He went on to point out that the present Milan investigation was the product of an internal inquiry which was handed over to the magistrates. The high degree of honour within the force, some officers claim, has led to three people implicated committing suicide in the past month. With the spotlight on the Yellow Flame, opposition politicians have begun to press for a demilitarisation of the Guardia. Mr Giulio Tremonti, the finance minister, who is directly responsible for these police, has ruled this out. Within the force itself, any move towards demilitarisation is likely to be resisted.</p>

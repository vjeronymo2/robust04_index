			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["is"-signed report: "First Round of Coupon Privatization </F> Could Start on 2 January 1995"]    [Text] Bratislava -- Between 1 July 1992 and 15 March 1994  [term of office of Vladimir Meciar's cabinet], only 232  privatization projects went through the process of approval, all  of which proposed standard privatization methods, states the  Report on Securing Supply of Property for the Second Wave of  Coupon Privatization (hereafter referred to as "report"),  drafted by the Ministry of Privatization.    This, which testifies to the slowing down of the pace of  privatization, has also prompted the present government to  incorporate into its Policy Statement the preparation of the  second wave of coupon privatization. For the sake of  comparison, the offer for the first wave of coupon privatization  consisted of more than 500 shareholding companies.    The Ministry of Privatization report proposes that the  registration of citizens and investment privatization funds take  place from 1 September to 31 October 1994, the processing and  assessment of registrations from 1 to 7 November 1994, the  preliminary round -- the subscribing of points to investment  privatization funds -- from 3 October to 16 December 1994, and  the presentation of the list of shareholders and investment  privatization funds from 19 December to 30 December 1994.    Preliminary dates of individual rounds for placing orders:    First Round: 2-25 January 1995    Second Round: 6-17 February 1995    Third Round: 6-17 March 1995    Fourth Round: 3-14 April 1995    Fifth Round: 2-12 May 1995    As the report states, the Ministry of Privatization has  drawn  up a preliminary list of property offered for the second wave of  coupon privatization. Included in the list are 104 industrial  enterprises with an aggregate book value of 152.9 billion Slovak  korunas [Sk], of which Sk72.5 billion (47 percent) is earmarked  for privatization by means of coupons; 43 agricultural  enterprises with an aggregate book value of Sk10.6 billion, of  which Sk4.8 billion (47 percent) is earmarked for coupon  privatization; and 36 enterprises from the branches of  transportation, tourism, retailing, and services with an  aggregate value of Sk19.4 billion, of which Sk7.6 billion (39  percent) is earmarked for coupon privatization. In addition,  some of the "unsold" shares from the first wave of coupon  privatization, which are currently in the portfolio of the  National Property Fund of the Slovak Republic, as well as shares  which the National Property Fund acquired within the framework  of increases in shareholding companies' capital stock for reason  of reassessment of real estate value, should also be offered to  coupon holders within the second wave of coupon privatization.  "All together, it is thus possible to offer Sk100 to Sk105  billion worth of property within the second wave of coupon  privatization," the report states. The Ministry of  Privatization has recently intensified the preparatory work for  the second wave of coupon privatization. A part of the  ministry's staff is working at an outlying workplace out of  Bratislava lest the increased work intensity be disrupted by the  routine agenda and by dealing with inquiries.</p>

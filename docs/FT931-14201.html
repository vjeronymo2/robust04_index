			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Three EC states cut interest rates THERE were new signs yesterday of an easing in European monetary policy after three central banks announced cuts in their main money market interest rates. In a concerted move, both the Belgian and Dutch central banks lowered their main dealing rates by 10 basis points. The Netherlands cut its special advances rate to 8.4 per cent, while the Belgian National Bank reduced its central rate to the same level. The Dutch authorities said they were able to cut their dealing rates because of the continuing strength of the guilder inside the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM). Denmark's central bank also lowered by one percentage point - to 12 per cent  -the rate at which it lends money to commercial banks for two weeks. The move had little impact on the Danish krone, which has been under pressure inside the ERM in recent weeks. In the immediate aftermath of the rate move, the krone rose fractionally against the D-Mark from DKr3.8530 to DKr3.8500. The decision to mark down interest rates was seen as another indication that tensions inside the exchange rate mechanism are easing following the intense currency speculation of recent weeks. However, the cuts in interest rates failed to have much impact on money market rates in other European countries. The rate for 3-month French francs moved higher yesterday from around 11 1/4 per cent to around 11 1/2 per cent, as the franc weakened slightly against the D-Mark. The Bundesbank yesterday raised speculation that it could shave short-term money market rates again by announcing that it would revert to its usual practice of tendering for variable rate securities repurchase funds in today's weekly intervention in the German money market. The move means commercial banks can bid below the level of 8.6 per cent set by the Bundesbank last week as the cost of borrowing short-term funds. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice-president, also helped sentiment by saying that the German central bank would use all its scope to cut interest rates where this was justified. The Bundesbank meets tomorrow for its fortnightly council meeting.</p>

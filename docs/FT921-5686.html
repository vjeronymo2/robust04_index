			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lilleshall declines to 'creditable' Pounds 2.4m LILLESHALL, the building products, plastics, engineering and industrial consumables group, announced pre-tax profits down from a restated Pounds 2.77m to Pounds 2.4m in the 1991 year. Turnover increased to Pounds 36.4m (Pounds 33.9m) as a number of acquisitions made during the year contributed for the first time. Mr John Leek, the former merchant banker who has built up the company since taking over as chairman in 1988, described the results as 'a creditable performance in a difficult trading period'. The building products division, which mainly sells to local authorities and housing associations, improved operating profits to Pounds 2.51m (Pounds 1.76m), helped by a seven-month contribution from Malysse, the French subsidiary acquired in May. Industrial consumables slipped into an operating loss of Pounds 619,000, against a Pounds 756,000 profit last time. This was mainly due to lower prices for the company's steel fasteners. But Mr Leek said overheads had been cut and the division was now breaking even. Earnings per share fell to 7.5p (12.9p). A recommended final dividend of 2.5p makes a total of 4p (3.9p) for the year. Since the year-end Lilleshall has acquired two companies, Crystalware Products and Bradgrange Packaging, to expand its plastics business. Mr Leek said further acquisitions would be looked at, especially if they allowed the company to increase exports and exposure to Europe.</p>

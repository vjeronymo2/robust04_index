			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, June 27 (TANJUG) -- The Yugoslav  Government takes the position that Yugoslavia's exclusion from  the Cairo nonaligned ministerial conference earlier this month  was unprecedented in the history of the movement and cast a  shadow on its democratic character, the Yugoslav premier said on  Monday.    "We have requested that the Cairo document include our  reservations in the section dealing with the former Yugoslav  republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which we shall distribute via  the Yugoslav mission in New York to the movement member-states  and demand that it have the force of a U.N. document," Prime  Minister Radoje Kontic told a press conference.    Egypt, which hosted the June conference, barred Yugoslavia  (Serbia/Montenegro) from participation, in a decision  unprecedented in the movement's annals.    The Yugoslav diplomacy saw this as a manipulation of the  rules of procedure because of a fear that Yugoslavia's presence  might substantially alter the climate at the conference,  especially as regards the Bosnian crisis, which would not have  suited the book of Egypt and many another Islamic state. In  order to avoid this, they have, regrettably, aligned the  movement behind one of the Bosnian warring sides, viz. the  Moslems.    The government took the position that Yugoslavia should  retain its membership in the movement, regardless of its virtual  suspension as a result of the manipulations and violation of  rules of procedure which resulted in its not being invited to  the Cairo conference, said Kontic.    Yugoslavia's membership has virtually been suspended not as  a  result of a true consensus of opinion among the member-nations  or of any concrete decision, but as a result of manipulations  and outside pressure by individual militant Islamic countries,  he said.    The government has instructed the Foreign Ministry to draft  the country's long-term platform on the movement which would  serve Yugoslavia's interests, upgrade its international position  and help lift the sanctions which the international community  clamped on Yugoslavia in 1992 for its alleged involvement in the  Bosnian war, and in addition help the movement adjust to the new  conditions of a non-bloc world.</p>

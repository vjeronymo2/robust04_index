			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In the Central African Republic, President  Ange-Felix Patasse has spoken for the first time since the  devaluation of the CFA franc, a few days ago, that is to say,  last Tuesday evening [11 January]. He said that he had accepted  and signed the devaluation measure for the sake of maintaining a  consensus with the other CFA heads of state. In a televised  address yesterday evening, the President of the Central African  Republic announced follow-up measures to the devaluation and, as  you will hear, also issued a stern warning to would-be  speculators:    [Begin Patasse recording] This adjustment cannot be regarded  as a catastrophe if we can manage our economy properly.  However, it is obvious that I will not tolerate destabilizing  actions by speculators. Likewise, I hereby give warning to  anyone who may be tempted to raise the prices of their  merchandise, for their trading permits will be immediately  withdrawn. I also give warning to the troublemakers, to those  who take advantage of the slightest occurrence to sow disorder  without concern for the future of our country. [end recording]</p>

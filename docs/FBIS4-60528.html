			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 25 May (MENA) -- New facts have surfaced  regarding the death of Egyptian lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani on  25 April and his role in the outlawed terrorist organization,  the Islamic Group, in Isna, Qina Governorate. This led to his  arrest. He then suffered an asthma attack, and after 24 hours  at the al-Manyal Hospital the doctors failed to save his life.    AL-AHRAM Chief Editor Ibrahim Nafi' has published a full  report on the true circumstances surrounding the death of the  lawyer, who was in charge of financing the terrorist  organization. The report also includes what occurred at the  Lawyers Association with members of the Muslim Brotherhood,  which controls that association. Nafi' notes that the story  began when security men captured terrorist elements after  several successive and highly planned operations to strike at  the dens of terrorism. Some important organizational documents  were seized along with these terrorists, who gave detailed  confessions. Several facts, obtained from full confessions,  surfaced in connection with these cases, particularly State  Security Case 235/94, which is related to the so-called military  wing of the Islamic Group and to the terrorist acts committed by  members of this group. Nafi' added that the confessions  revealed the following:    1. 'Abd-al-Harith Madani acted as the direct link to Tal'at  Muhammad Yasin Hammam, the organization's leader who died on 25  April in a shoot out with security men sent to capture him.    2. Upon instructions from the organization's leader, Madani  acted as a liaison officer, conveying the orders of the  organization's leaders outside prison to leaders inside prison.    3. Madani was in charge of financing the organization by  distributing money received from abroad for Tal'at Hammam, the  leader of the organization. According to the defendants'  confessions, Madani received seven payments from Hammam  amounting to 45,000 Egyptian pounds as well as $3,000, which he  spent on the organization's activities on the instructions of  its leader.    Nafi' adds: Those were the actual facts that emerged from  the confessions made by the recently captured terrorist  elements. Had some of the leaders of instigation been fair,  they would have reflected on these facts as they really are  without any bias. What is certain from the investigations is  that Madani was a terrorist affiliated with the Islamic Group in  Isna, Qina Governorate. He had been previously charged in  several cases, including Case 7 in the year 1990, when he, along  with other members of the organization, prevented people from  visiting graveyards, claiming it was sinful to do so. He was  also charged in another case in Isna for distributing leaflets.    Nafi' adds: Here we have a prominent member of a terrorist  organization that kills and assassinates innocent citizens, in  violation of law and public order. Here is a member of an  organization that permits the killing of people and the  plundering of their property, in violation of the provisions and  ethics of religion. What is more serious is that he used his  job as an attorney defending law, freedom, and stability as a  cover to undermine the law and shake the stability.    Observers point out that the events that took place at the  Lawyers Association last week, which had been instigated by the  banned Muslim Brotherhood, reveal extremely serious matters,  including:    1. Some of the people who have led the acts of instigation  and agitation belong to a dissolved political group that seeks  to use the death of the aforementioned lawyer and its leadership  of the association as an opportunity to promote its political  goals, which run counter to the regime and to legitimacy, and to  gain popularity among lawyers so that they may back its  candidates in future elections.    2. The deceased lawyer was a member of a terrorist  organization, the Islamic Group, who had been charged before in  several cases. The attempt to take advantage of his death  reveals the relationship between the dissolved group and other  terrorist groups.    3. These outlawed terrorist groups are trying to use the  professional associations as an arena for their unlawful  partisan activity.    4. Other extremist and irresponsible elements have attempted  to incite lawyers to carry arms against the legitimacy and its  representatives.    5. The special relation between members of the terrorist  groups and the outlawed and dissolved Muslim Brotherhood group  has been confirmed by a statement issued by one of the groups  that falsely calls itself Islamic, in which it incited strikes,  demonstrations, and sabotage.    Nafi' says that this trend is serious and dangerous. It  tries to exploit and undermine democracy and to cause a relapse  in the splendid democratic development process which is  relentlessly and wisely led by President Mubarak.    Nafi' maintains that the security commands in Egypt are  committed to safeguarding legitimacy, law, and the basis of  democracy which have been established by the president. These  commands have accomplished tremendous achievements by all  standards. They penetrated the secrecy of these organizations  through scientific planning and through proficiency and the  ability to move quickly.    He adds that security commands managed to descend on some  terrorist leaders and seize a map detailing the locations,  duties, and responsibilities of various terrorist elements as  well as their codes and planning for future operations. It was  a huge blow to the organization which made the terrorists and  their sympathizers go out of their minds.    Nafi' says that 'Abd-al-Harith Madani and others were among  the many elements who were captured through justice. They  thought for a while that they could exploit one of the most  honorable and ancient professions -- the practice of law -- as  their slogan behind which they hide under false pretenses.    Some elements of the dissolved group are trying to play with  fire, destabilize the situation, and go against legitimacy in an  attempt to deprive the country of the atmosphere of development,  stability, and democratic process.    In his capacity as the doyen of the Egyptian Journalists  Association, Ibrahim Nafi' underlined the role of associations  in defending the rights of its members as follows:    Any association is entitled, or rather duty bound, to defend  the legitimate rights of its members. The association must  support the member who is confronted with ordeals and crises.  It is also a legitimate right to defend every member who is not  under suspicion. This stance is part of the association law and  is the member's rights and duties. It is also a right dictated  by law and tradition, let alone if the case is linked to the  application of the Bar Association and if the members are men of  law and the protectors of the law.    On the other hand, there is an important fact that should  not  be ignored, namely that association members must not use their  membership as a screen to hide illegal actions that violate the  provisions of law and undermine the country's law and national  security. Nobody can claim that membership can be used as  immunity to violate the law or defend the violating member.    Nafi' says: I can understand that it is the right of the  association to ascertain the authenticity of charges against the  accused member, especially if the defendant is a member of an  organization that is overtly practicing terrorism, killing  innocent people, and carrying out assassinations and declaring  this in its statements. I also can understand that it is the  right of the association, particularly the Bar Association, to  use all legal methods to defend the rights of its members and  their families.    Ibrahim Nafi' adds: But what I can not understand and even  reject is the adoption of illegal and illegitimate moves on the  pretext of defending the right of an association member. This,  I believe, would turn the association into a jungle and make the  association membership a tool to support violation of law and  infringement on legitimacy. This action is carried out by some  elements which belong to illegitimate groups seeking to impose  their hegemony and objectives by force and to foment trouble  within and outside the association.    Nafi' voices his regret that some people have exploited the  death of a terrorist organization member, who belonged to a  vocational association, to instigate and incite trouble by  issuing inflammatory statements against the law and the  legitimate rule.    Nafi' concludes his article by saying that all aim to  exploit  the democratic climate, political tolerance, and the broad  freedoms of expression. President Mubarak is committed to this  democratic atmosphere regardless of the excessive and  provocative acts by those who are trying to exploit legitimacy  and the tolerance of the political leadership to sow discord and  to drive a wedge.</p>

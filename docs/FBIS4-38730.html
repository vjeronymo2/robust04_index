			<p>BFN     [Text] For the second day running, miners at the  Vostsibugol joint stock company -- which operates on the  territory of three rayons of Irkutsk, Chita Oblasts, and the  Republic of Buryatiya -- have not been dispatching fuel for  consumers. According to a statement by Vladimir Solomin,  chairman of the company's strike committee, an exception has  only been made with regard to the petrochemical workers of  Angarsk, who have fully settled their accounts for the output  received. The remaining consumers situated in the region are  considered to be debtors, as are those in neighboring Khabarovsk  and Maritime Krays.    According to a statement by General Director Ivan Shchadov,  Vostsibugol is the largest mining company in Russia today, which  is capable of producing 32 million tonnes of fuel annually, but  on one condition, that it receives its wages on time. At the  moment the debts to the miners amount to 170 billion rubles, and  they are prepared to make their actions open-ended. The  administration of Irkutsk Oblast, where the main enterprises of  the joint stock company are situated, considers the action of  the miners to be illegal and has demanded the dispatch of coal  to consumers.</p>

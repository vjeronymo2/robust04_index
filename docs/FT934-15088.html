			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sri Lanka poised to regain tea export lead after 1992 setback SRI LANKA is poised to regain its position as the world's largest exporter of tea this year because of a strong recovery in output following a disastrous drought in 1992. According to the Sri Lankan Tea Commission, output in the first eight months of 1993 was 149,300 tonnes, up 33 per cent on the same period of 1992. Better weather and improved agricultural practices arising out of quasi-privatisation of the country's 500 state-owned estates means that output for the whole year is likely to reach about 225,000 tonnes, up 26 per cent on last year. In 1992, the most severe drought in decades drove output down to 178,000 tonnes, the lowest since 1956. 'Output will not be as high as the record 241,000 tonnes we produced in 1991 but it will be back to average levels of the last decade,' said Mr LG Munasinghe, the country's Tea Commissioner. He was optimistic that changes in field practices by the new estate managements could push production up further next year, possibly to as much as 250,000 tones. Because Sri Lanka exports 90 per cent of its production, this year's sharp increase in output has fed through to overseas sales. According to Mr T. Sambasivam, deputy director-general of the Tea Board, Sri Lanka is certain to replace India as the world's top exporter this year. It is expected to ship about 205,000 tonnes for the whole year, up 15 per cent on 1992. The Tea Board says exports in the first seven months of 1993 were 117,000 tonnes, up 17 per cent on the same period of 1992. Higher tea prices mean the increase in value has been sharper. Exports in the first seven months brought in Dollars 215m, up 20 per cent on the Dollars 179m earned in the same period of 1992.</p>

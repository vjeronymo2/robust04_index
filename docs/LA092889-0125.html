			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAN THE SOAPS STAY AFLOAT?;  </P> <P> LARRY HAGMAN STILL RELISHES BEING TV'S OILIEST VILLAIN  </P> <P> After 11 1/2 years of playing the same role, Larry Hagman says he's still  thoroughly enjoying himself as the villainous J.R. Ewing on "Dallas." And why  not? He works three days a week, is paid millions and maintains good  relationships with his co-stars.  </P> <P> "It's a real close family on the show," Hagman said. "My thing is to keep an  ensemble group working like in a summer stock theater -- except that you don't  change shows (every few weeks) and we don't do Shakespeare, Shaw or Ibsen. . .  . But believe me, I'm not sure 'Dallas' will be remembered as long as  Shakespeare, Shaw or Ibsen, but it will sure make a hell of a lot more money  than they did."  </P> <P> Dressed in a brown pinstripe suit and jogging shoes, Hagman was in the best of  moods recently when he slipped away from the "Dallas" set at Lorimar Studios  long enough for lunch. Alternately jocular, optimistic and witty, he had plenty  of reasons for good humor, even though his Caesar salad was too laden with  garlic.  </P> <P> After completing 12 episodes for this season, Hagman and his wife, Maj, were  off to Europe the next day for a four-week vacation.  </P> <P> And just the night before at Chasen's, the couple had celebrated a new contract  that will make him both producer and star of an upcoming TV miniseries based on  the life of Texas billionaire H. L. Hunt.  </P> <P> Further brightening Hagman's demeanor as he departed for Scotland, Germany,  Greece and Turkey was knowing that his "Dallas" character -- oilman J.R. Ewing  -- is back to his thoroughly devious ways.  </P> <P> J.R. -- one of television's most famous villains -- has undergone several  personality changes over the years, some of which have not pleased Hagman. But  this season, the "sex, greed and avarice" are back with a vengeance, he said.  </P> <P> The show, the longest running drama currently in prime time, began its 13th  season last Friday on CBS. Although a host of actors and actresses have come  and gone, Hagman is one of only two (the other is Ken Kercheval's Cliff Barnes)  who have remained a fixture on the series since it debuted in April, 1978.  </P> <P> In fact, Hagman seemed surprised when it was pointed out that he is one of the  show's few constants.  </P> <P> "By God, you're right, I had not thought of that. It never occurred to me," he  said.  </P> <P> The success of "Dallas" is surely due to the public's fascination with J.R., as  much as the constant conflict that swirls around him. The character has the  power to strike back at enemies with impunity, the wealth to launch the wildest  schemes and the wherewithal to force his will on the timid or unsuspecting.  Part of the appeal, according to Hagman, is that the character is not  invincible and does, on occasion, lose.  </P> <P> "This guy always comes swinging back, though," he said. "What else can you do  in life?"  </P> <P> J.R.'s standing is helped by the fact that the character is the focus of much  of the show even when Hagman is not on camera.  </P> <P> "The nice thing about this part is (that the other characters) talk about you  all the time, always building up your entrance. They say, 'God, what is J.R.  gonna think about this?' I don't have to do a thing. . . . Hell, that's better  than being on the screen. It's more of a threat. Then when you come on they  say, 'Oh my God, he's going to kill us.' And then you appear on camera smiling  and having a good time . . . and still kill 'em," he said with the hearty laugh  that is one of television's most familiar and sinister.  </P> <P> Unlike J.R. Ewing, though, Hagman was mostly gracious about the competition his  show has faced from other networks. Notable among these was NBC's "Miami Vice,"  which was moved, amid heavy publicity, from 10 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday nights  in an attempt to knock "Dallas" off the air in the fall of 1986. The final  episode of "Miami Vice" ran last spring.  </P> <P> "It was just one of those things. 'Miami Vice' was a hell of a show and if we  are ever knocked off the air then I hope it is by a quality show. If we had  been knocked off by 'Miami Vice' then that would have been OK," he said.  </P> <P> But then Hagman added, with a devilish grin, that the reason "Miami Vice" did  not do better against "Dallas" was because he had put a "hex" on it.  </P> <P> That sort of playfulness extends to the "Dallas" set. Earlier in the day, in  fact, he and co-star Patrick Duffy taped a bawdy video message to be broadcast  at the bar mitzvah of Omri Katz, who plays Hagman's son, John Ross, on the  show. He also enjoys good-naturedly needling Charlene Tilton between breaks.  The petite actress is quick to return the fire, but without the rancor that  pervades their characters' relationship. Both Duffy and Tilton had left  "Dallas," but were persuaded to return to the show, in part by Hagman.  </P> <P> Another such departure is not likely to be remedied, except by occasional guest  appearances. Linda Gray, who played Sue Ellen Ewing, J.R.'s wife and frequent  foil, left as a regular "Dallas" cast member at season's end.  </P> <P> "Linda Gray was my favorite female co-star," he said. "She was the greatest  leading lady I've ever worked with. She was here for 12 years. There was a lot  of electricity and a lot of subtle work between us. We would always find pieces  of the story that weren't written into the script. She was the best (female  co-star) so far in my life, but hopefully there'll be others."  </P> <P> As has frequently been the case with the series, three major characters have  been added to the cast for this season. Kimberly Foster turned up last Friday  as April Stevens' sister, the show's new femme fatale; Michael Wilding debuted  as an art dealer who will develop a romantic interest in J.R.'s wife, and Sasha  Mitchell will soon be introduced as a man who claims to be J.R.'s 21-year-old  illegitimate son.  </P> <P> Hagman, who since last season has been co-executive producer of "Dallas" with  Leonard Katzman, is upbeat about this season's story and glad to be rid of some  of his character's vulnerabilities that surfaced last year.  </P> <P> Apparently gone are scenes such as one last season when J.R., while traveling  in Vienna, atypically rebuffed the advances of a glamorous European aristocrat  who had been his former lover. The oilman's philandering had been tempered by  his marriage to a much younger woman, played by Cathy Podewell.  </P> <P> "I thought that was kind of dumb, to tell you the truth," he said.  </P> <P> "Everybody says, 'What is the purpose of 'Dallas?' The purpose is to entertain.  It's for entertainment and we don't do it for any morality plays or anything  like that. We're here to entertain people," he said.  </P> <P> As for surviving so long on "Dallas"?  </P> <P> "I guess that makes me feel rich -- and don't forget modest and smart," he said  in his distinctive laugh. "Yeah, rich, smart and modest."  </P> <P> J.R. Ewing couldn't have said it better.  </P></p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Markets: A Clinton chiller for the bond markets - Wall Street 'PRESIDENT Clinton?' said the headline on the newsstands earlier this week. Although the latest polls suggest the question is increasingly assuming a rhetorical status, the thought of a fiscally-assertive Democrat in the White House is sending chills through the US bond market, if not the rest of Wall Street. So heavily have Treasury investors been selling government securities lately that, since the start of the month, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond has risen more than 30 basis points to above 7.6 per cent, reversing a steady, if unspectacular, seven-month decline in market interest rates. The sell-off in bonds reflects the fears of fixed-income investors that, if Bill Clinton is elected president, his fiscal stimulus programme could send interest rates, and possibly inflation, sharply higher. There is nothing surprising in this, except perhaps that the bond market has taken so long to wake up to the likelihood that the country will have a new president. What is surprising, however, is the equanimity with which equity investors have greeted the turmoil in the Treasury market. The stock market has displayed a remarkable resilience over the past few weeks in the face of three potentially unsettling factors: rising bond yields (which are usually bad for stocks because higher interest rates stifle economic activity and make bonds look more attractive); the continued likelihood of not just a Democratic victory, but quite possibly a Democratic landslide; and a third quarter corporate reporting season that has brought more than its fair share of surprises, some good, but many bad. In spite of distractions, stocks have more than held their own, and have even posted some modest gains. The market's record, in fact, has been better than it looks, primarily because the headline-grabbing Dow Jones industrial average has been distorted by heavy losses in several influential stocks. IBM, Merck, Westinghouse and United Technologies, four of the Dow's biggest constituents, have all suffered over the past days by unexpectedly poor or disappointing earnings. IBM's figures were particularly distressing, sending the stock this week to its lowest level in more than a decade. Other measures of stock price performance, meanwhile, such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks, and the Dow Jones Transportation Average, have all put in a strong showing. The transportation average, widely seen as a useful leading indicator of economic conditions, recorded its highest close since early August on Thursday after an impressive one-day gain, a sign to analysts that the wider market may also be rising soon. The S&amp;P 500 has been on a roll since early October, heading towards its year high and gaining the equivalent of about 100 points on the Dow, while the Nasdaq composite has been in equally fine form. There have been other, technical, signs of strength in the market. The fact that trading volume has been unusually high - more than 200m shares have been traded each session for the past six days - suggests that investor interest in the market may be reviving. In recent days volume has been especially heavy on 'upticks' (moments when stocks are rising), a traditionally bullish sign to those hawk-like analysts who watch the ticker every day. The derivatives markets in Chicago also has something to say about the outlook for equities. Stronger demand for stock-index put options than for stock-index call options might, at first glance, seem negative for the market. After all, anyone who buys put options is betting on share prices to fall. But to contrary-minded investors, the level of bearishness indicated by a high put-call ratio is a happy portent. It implies pessimism about the market may be close to peaking, which for the brave is always a good moment to buy stocks. While few are suggesting that the market is poised for a major advance, if stocks can survive what remains of the corporate earnings season, and the final week and a half of the election campaign, relatively unscathed, then the foundations for an upbeat ending to the year may be in place. There is even the possibility that investors might actually celebrate a Clinton victory after November 3. The bond market may not like his plans for big increases in government spending and middle-class tax cuts, but to equity investors frustrated by President Bush's willingness to do anything positive to end the economic malaise, the thought of a substantial fiscal boost for the economy is more than welcome.  -------------------------------------- Monday      3188.45  +   14.04 Tuesday     3186.02  -    2.43 Wednesday   3187.10  +    1.08 Thursday    3200.88  +   13.78 Friday      3207.64  +    6.76  --------------------------------------</p>

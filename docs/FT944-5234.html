			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / This Week: 'Golf's next god' - Sport Golfing statistics tell us that the vast majority of enthusiastic amateurs never shoot better than 90 in their playing careers. So eat your hearts out as I tell you of a boy who scored 84 in his first-ever round of golf. 'I was seven years old and shorter than every club except the putter,' recalls Ernie Els, now a formidably broad 25-year-old and 6ft 3ins tall. This year has been Els' annus mirablis. His victory in the US Open came after an opening European Tour win at the Desert Classic in Dubai. It was nailed down in October by a scintillating performance to secure the World Matchplay championship at Wentworth. No one inside golf doubts that Els will be taking the silverware home for many years to come. The predictions are shivery in their intensity and unanimity. 'I think I just played with the next god,' commented Curtis Strange (renowned as a sourpuss) after partnering Els in the US Open. 'The last young guy I saw who could touch Ernie was Seve Ballesteros 15 years ago,' says Open champion Nick Price. 'He's young enough, strong enough and long enough to win any tournament he tees up in,' was Greg Norman's verdict, after Els shot 61 and took three shots off the course record on the opening day at Dubai. Now Ernie is back home in his native South Africa. This weekend he played before huge galleries of adoring fans at the Million Dollar Challenge in Sun City. It is quite something for an amiable but somewhat reserved young man to become a virtual national monument in a sports-mad country that can't quite forgive Gary Player for growing old. Early last week I caught up with Els, doing his sponsor a favour by participating in a low-key pro-am event on the aptly named Wild Coast, 120 miles south of Durban. His two amateur partners, marketing executives from a photocopier company, were near helpless with nerves, after being drawn to play with the icon. The gallery around the tee was decidely intimidating as Mike Brown duffed his first shot and saw it trickle 20 yards down the fairway. Els smiled and whispered something that had the blushing salesman actually laughing as he marched towards the green. There is no doubt that South Africans are on the verge of a great love affair. On the eve of the US Open's final day a good luck fax message hand-written by vice-president FW de Klerk was delivered to Els' hotel room. From the recipient's perspective, such a wall of adoration and expectation can begin to look less than attractive. 'On the tour it's been no problem. It is when you get home that the hassle starts,' he reflected over a few Castle lagers and a spin of the roulette wheel at the Wild Coast casino. 'Suddenly everyone wants to shake my hand and ask why I didn't play well last week in Japan. Sorry mate, it's been a long year,' said Els, in bitter-sweet mood. 'I don't like going into a bar or restaurant and being recognised. People just come up to you when you're in the middle of eating. The best place for me to go out right now is London. Nobody there gives a damn who you are,' he added. Irritation and exasperation at this new development in his life are detectable just below the sunny exterior. Ernie's face is his misfortune. A permanent grin beneath a thatch of blonde hair makes him as approachable as Nick Faldo is forbidding. Chatting to Els in the public area of a hotel is like trying to talk to your boss while running the till at Sainsbury's. Every few minutes a new well-wisher stops by. Many are fellow players, journeyman pros from the Sunshine Tour, friends from the old days - only 1993, in fact, but it might as well be in the history books in terms of where Els is going. 'If Ernie stayed here, he'd probably win every event, every year,' says a peer. It's obvious why he won't. And the demands of 15 events on the US tour next year, half-a-dozen exemptions for European tournaments, plus a few big-buck events in Japan, mean that the fans back home are most likely to watch Els on television. It won't be popular in a country with a natural tendency to see the rest of the world from a laager. Els himself is smart enough to nurse a slight foreboding. 'They put you up on this pedestal and its so easy for them to pull you down again if you don't do exactly what they want. The knife starts going in,' he reflected. 'It happened to Naas Botha here and to Greg Norman in Australia.' He makes the point that in 1993, when he won an extraordinary six consecutive tournaments in South Africa, there was very little fuss made of him. A year later he enjoys a few big wins overseas and the cry goes up 'Where's Ernie?' It would be easier to bear if he were a natural, rootless cosmopolitan, slipping effortlessly from Europe, to the US, to Japan. But he's not. Ernie comes from an intensely family-orientated background in the affluent Johannesburg suburb of Germiston. There's a putting green in the back-garden, laid and tended a decade ago by father Neels, for young Ernie to practise on. Another casualty. Fed up with intense celebrity of life in the Golden City, Els is building a seaside home for himself and fiancee Liesl in the small town of George, two hours' drive from Cape Town, but a thousand miles from home. The Germiston putting green won't be getting much use. Mr Els snr. has put his plans to re-plant the grass on hold.</p>

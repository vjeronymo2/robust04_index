			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 24/5/1994 -- Romanian Defense  Minister Gheorghe Tinca states in an interview granted to the  Bucharest daily CRONICA ROMANA that an East-West alternative, or  a Russians-NATO alternative, "is a totally artificial problem if  we take into consideration Romania's interests under the current  historical circumstances".    "It would be much better for us to give up arguing on this  artificial problem and to concentrate on our national  interests," the Romanian minister adds.    Showing that taking what is best from one side or another  "does not mean however that we have deceived one side or the  other or that we were hostile to one side or thrown into the  arms of another," Gheorghe Tinca states in the mentioned  interview: "I am militating exclusively for our national  interests and we must find out how we can better serve these  interests. Two are the fundamental criteria: performance and  cost. That is why I think that we should foster ties with the  entire world, benefiting on all planes, but especially as  regards technical progress".    As for the budget allotted to defense, the Romanian minister  views it as enough as regards preservation of the country's  defense capacities. "I am glad that special attention was given  to social aspects, such as housing the militaries, where we are  facing major problems. As for Army equipment with top military  technique, even if we had three-times the budget of the country,  it wouldn't have been enough for gaining that sophisticated  weaponry that we are all dreaming of, for which many years are  to pass and even huge expenses to be made".    "The issues confronting the Romanian Army, the real ones  regarding reform, modernization, qualitative changes are only  beginning and are implying a long and thorough process,"  Gheorghe Tinca concluded.</p>

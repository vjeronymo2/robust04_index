			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: McDonnell posts Dollars 132m loss McDonnell Douglas, the US defence and aerospace group, yesterday reported a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 132m after taking a special Dollars 450m pre-tax charge for its controversial C-17 aircraft programme. Exclusive of the charge, its earnings rose by some 66 per cent. The figures represent a further stage in the financial recovery of the company. Two years ago, it appeared in serious difficulties with a heavy debt burden, a contracting defence market and softening airliner sales. However, it fought back with a programme to cut costs, improve efficiency and sell peripheral assets. It reported yesterday that its aerospace debt reached a six-year low of Dollars 1.62bn at the end of 1993, after a drop of Dollars 349m in the final quarter and Dollars 1.14bn in the year as a whole. It reported fourth-quarter earnings before charges of Dollars 143m, or Dollars 3.63 a share, up from Dollars 86m, or Dollars 2.20, in the same period of 1992 on sales which shrunk to Dollars 3.63bn from Dollars 4.62bn. For the full year, earnings totalled Dollars 396m, or Dollars 10.10 a share, compared with Dollars 79m, or Dollars 2.03, in 1992, excluding unusual items. Mr Herb Lanese, finance director, said 1993 had been a pivotal year in which McDonnell had demonstrated its 'survivability'. It now had to demonstrate to the outside world that 1993 was not a fluke and that it was a 'much stronger, revitalised corporation'. He said analysts' estimates of 1994 earnings per share between Dollars 11.50 and Dollars 13.25 were 'not unreasonable'. At the end of this month the board would be reviewing the company's dividend pay-out ratio, which he acknowledged was 'low compared with our peers'.</p>

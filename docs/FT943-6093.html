			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Anglo aims to be big player in mineral sands market Here on this remote coast in the least populated region of South Africa Anglo American Corporation is putting the final touches to a project that will enable this country's biggest company to elbow its way into the global mineral sands market, which is dominated by RTZ of the UK. The Namakwa Sands project, based on one of the world's biggest mineral sands deposits, will, by Anglo's calculations, by 2000, give it nearly 6 per cent of the USDollars 1bn titanium dioxide business, supplying a material essential in the production of many paints, papers and plastics. Anglo also aims for more than 13 per cent of the Dollars 160m market for zircon, used to impart whiteness to ceramics such as tiles, sanitary ware and china. Namakwa will also produce pig iron, used in many foundry applications but particularly for automotive castings. This market should be worth about Dollars 850m by the turn of the century and Anglo is looking for a modest 2 per cent. Mr George Brown, general manager of the Namakwa Sands company, stresses that Anglo is not taking a particularly aggressive approach. With demand for titanium dioxide growing annually at between 2.5 and 3 per cent there should be room for a newcomer in an industry with only a handful of competitors. Namakwa has only one real rival, he says, Richards Bay Minerals, which is mining on South Africa's east coast and has more than half the market. Its major shareholder is RTZ. All mineral sands are radioactive but the level is low in the Richards Bay and Namakwa material, he says. This gives them a marketing advantage, particularly with countries such as Germany and Japan where customers are edgy about this factor. RTZ also owns QIT which mines mineral sands in Canada. Australia is another big producer via Renison Goldfields in which Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate has a 40 per cent interest. Anglo owns 80 per cent of Namakwa, which is mining a deposit near the sea about 80km north-west of Vredendal on the west coast of the Cape Province. The deposit, containing enough mineral sands for 35 years' production, was nearly overlooked when the company explored the area because its radioactivity was so much less than sands further north. It is on land bought in the 1930s for its diamond potential by De Beers, Anglo's sister company, which has 20 per cent of the project. Sensitive to the environmental issues that loomed large when Richards Bay recently wanted to mine beach sands, Namakwa has hired Mr Johan Grobler, a botanist with 26 years' experience at the Kirstenbosch Gardens in Cape Town, as environmental officer. As it would not be possible to rehabilitate the beach here properly, the company will not mine 20m tonnes of sand with a theoretical value of Dollars 90m. Elsewhere it is spending Dollars 330 a hectare to rehabilitate an area where farm land costs only Dollars 33 a hectare. The mineral sands are mined and put through concentration plants at the mine site before being trucked along a new road to a mineral separation plant 60km away at Koekenaap. This plant was built away from the mine because of the fog that frequently envelops the area. Namakwa hopes to turn this phenomenon to its advantage and is experimenting to see if it can collect fresh water from the fog. In Chile a similar scheme resulted in three litres of water a day being collected from every square metre of special screening material, enough to provide for a small community that previously had to truck in its water at great expense. Material from the separation plant will be sent by rail to a new smelter nearly 200km away near the Saldanha Bay export terminal. Most will be stored before shipping but the ilmenite will be upgraded to titanium dioxide slag, worth more than three times as much. The smelter is the first in the industry to use direct current or plasma arc technology which has been employed successfully by South Africa's ferrochrome producers. Anglo worked with Mintek, a South African government sponsored technology group, to develop the technology. The smelter should be ready early next year and by 2000 Namakwa should be in full production, employing more than 800 people and producing annually 196,000 tonnes of titanium dioxide, 119,000 tonnes of pig iron, 123,000 tonnes of zircon and 36,000 tonnes of rutile. About 95 per cent of the revenue is expected to come from overseas customers in Europe and North America. Anglo estimates that annual export earnings at full production will be equivalent to Dollars 80m in 1994. This export potential, coupled with the upgrading of the ilmenite, helped get the project off the ground financially. Namakwa qualified for a special tax scheme for big exporters that was worth Dollars 45m when the project was given the go-ahead in November 1992. Namakwa is also benefitting from a loan of Dollars 60m with deferred interest of Dollars 6.6m from the Industrial Development Corporation, another South African government backed organisation. Anglo and De Beers have put up the equity of R576m (Dollars 127m).</p>

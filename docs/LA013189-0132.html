			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: THREE MORE FOOTBALL PLAYERS SAY THEY WILL PLAY FOR  SDSU  </P> <P> San Diego State has received oral commitments from three more football players  who say they will attend the school next season.  </P> <P> The players are Marlon Andrews, a 5-foot 11-inch, 185-pound cornerback from  Pasadena City College; Curt Pieson, a 6-4, 210-pound defensive end from  Rubidoux High School in Riverside, and Romando Stallings, a 6-7, 260-pound,  offensive/defensive lineman from Ansonia (Conn.) High School.  </P> <P> Andrews, who played at Muir High School in Pasadena, also visited Iowa State,  Purdue and Tennessee. Pieson visited Arizona and Arizona State, and Stallings  visited Clemson.  </P> <P> The first day high school seniors can sign letters of intent is Feb. 8.  </P> <P> Darrell Lewis, a defensive back on the San Diego Section 3-A champion Morse  High School football team last season, has made an oral commitment to attend  Ohio State in the fall.  </P> <P> Lewis, a 6-2, 190-pound defensive back, also visited San Diego State,  Washington and California before picking Ohio State.  </P> <P> "I really enjoyed Ohio State," Lewis said. "They have one of the best  facilities I've ever seen, and their business program is excellent. I enjoyed  the coaching staff and the players at Ohio State, and that's the place I felt I  should go."  </P> <P> Fullback Todd Jackson and safety Bryan Day were chosen top offensive and  defensive players for the 1988 University of San Diego football season at the  team's awards banquet Sunday at USD's University Center.  </P> <P> Wide receiver/return specialist Ken Zampese won the special teams' honor, and  defensive tackle David Gilmore won the strength coach's award. Offensive  lineman Mike Cassady and nose guard Dave Dunn were chosen team captains.  </P> <P> Day and defensive tackle John Gomez were presented with Academic All-American  awards. Day was a first-team selection the past 2 seasons; Gomez was chosen to  the second team.  </P> <P> MEN'S BASKETBALL  </P> <P> What will U.S. International University and Loyola Marymount do for an encore?  </P> <P> For one thing, USIU Coach Gary Zarecky doesn't think the teams will equal the  numbers of their first meeting when they play tonight at 7:30 in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "I would be very surprised if the game is as high-scoring affair as the first  time," Zarecky said. "After watching the video four and five times, I know that  we can play better offensively, but I think LMU can play better defensively."  </P> <P> The teams combined to set three NCAA records in Loyola's 162-144 victory in San  Diego Jan. 7. Loyola set a record for most points in a half (93), and USIU set  a record for most points by a losing team. The combined 306 points is a record  for a regulation game.  </P> <P> Loyola (11-7) is the highest-scoring team in the nation and is coming off a  99-86 victory over Pepperdine Sunday. USIU (8-13) has not played since Jan 18,  when it defeated Division III UC San Diego, 106-89.  </P></p>

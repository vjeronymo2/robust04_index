			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Yelistratov] </F>   [Text] Cairo May 28 TASS -- Russian special envoy Viktor  Posuvalyuk met with Jordanian Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam  al-Majali on Saturday to discuss the situation in the region and  prospects for resuming Arab-Israeli talks.    The sides focused on Russia's role in the Middle East peace  process and agreed that it must step up its peace activity in  the region. They also discussed bilateral relations between  Russia and Jordan.    Speaking at a news conference after his talks with the prime  minister, Posuvalyuk called for working on a parity basis in  order to ensure the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Golan  Heights and restore peace between Israel and Syria.    He stressed that this is vital for reaching an overall  settlement in the Middle East.    The envoy emphasised the importance of the willingness of  the  sides involved to achieve progress in the peace process on the  basis of the principle "full return of occupied territories in  exchange for peace." He believes that the lack of progress or  failure of peace talks will play into the hands of forces  opposing restoration of stability and security in the region.    Posuvalyuk is in Amman on a working visit as part of his  Middle East tour aimed at invigorating the peace process in the  Middle East. He has already visited Damascus and is expected to  go to Israel on Sunday. He will hold talks with Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin and visit the city of Jericho for talks with  Palestinian officials.</p>

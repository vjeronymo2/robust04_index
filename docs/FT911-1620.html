			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / The Property Market: Recession shows eerie similarities to 1970s AS the severity of this property collapse becomes increasingly apparent, comparisons are being made with the 1970s crash, writes Vanessa Houlder. 'The similarities between 1972-74 and 1988-91 are immense,' says Savills, the surveying firm. 'Setting the last five years against the boom and slump of the 1970s, the profile of returns since 1985 has been uncannily similar; a three-year upswing to peak at 30 per cent, followed by a precipitous drop,' says the Investment Property Databank, a research body. Some parallels are striking. In both cases, a credit boom fuelled some heady years of growth, which led to a sharp hike in interest rates and a recession exacerbated by international pressures. In some respects, the crash of the 1970s was far worse than that of the 1990s (so far). 'In the first year of the 1970s slump, rising yields knocked a third off real capital values; and a further 10 per cent in the following year,' according to IPD. 'Bad as we think it is, the yield shift of 1989-90 is not this sharp'. The knock-on effect on the banks has been less severe. Whereas the 1970s crash triggered a secondary banking crisis, this time banks appear more resilient and property lending accounts for a smaller proportion of their loan books. Furthermore, the large property companies, some of which went close to the brink in 1974, now have far stronger balance sheets. So far, receiverships have been far fewer than the first half of 1974. In addition, the economy was in worse shape in the 1970s putting more pressure on rents than is expected this time. 'Our current assessment is that rent growth in the early 1990s will be more favourable than that from 1975 to 1978, especially in real terms, because the recession is expected to be briefer and shallower,' says IPD. That said, many in the property industry are experiencing harder times than in the 1970s. 'Never can I think of a time when conditions have been so adverse for property investment and development,' says Sir Nigel Mobbs, one of the industry's most experienced figures. The scale of overborrowing and overbuilding in the industry at present dwarfs anything seen before. The more manageable inflation problem of the 1990s is perhaps a mixed blessing. Although it signified a far greater malaise in the economy in the 1970s, it also helped to get the developers off the hook thanks to its effect on real interest rates and the replacement costs on building. It may take some time before building costs equal those incurred in the heat of the construction boom. Perhaps the most worrying feature of the industry's current predicament is that there are few obvious buyers of the property overhanging the market. In the 1970s, it took four years for the surplus property to be absorbed. There is every chance it will take even longer this time.</p>

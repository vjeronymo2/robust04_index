			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / US reaches trade pact with China THE US and China over the weekend signed a pact designed to open China's markets to foreign goods, thus averting billions of dollars in trade sanctions threatened by both sides. The agreement is a major triumph for Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative. Since bringing a US Section 301 case against China a year ago, Mrs Hills has applied steady pressure on Beijing, ultimately using as a threat a potential retaliation list totalling Dollars 3.9bn (Pounds 2.2bn) in Chinese exports to the US. At the same time, she dangled as bait US support for China's long-sought membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). She resisted congressional pressure to take the lead in pushing for Taiwanese membership in the Gatt ahead of China's. In the pact with China, Beijing agreed to phase out 75 per cent of its import licences, quotas and non-tariff barriers within two years. It also agreed to publish its secret trade rules, quotas, and technical standards, all of which have been used to discourage imports. China's trade surplus with the US this year could rise to Dollars 17bn, but US officials say the new pact prepares the ground for increased US exports of computers, machinery, chemicals, telecommunications equipment, motor parts and farm products. China's Foreign Ministry has summoned Mr Stapleton Roy, the US Ambassador to China, to protest against Washington's support for Hong Kong autonomy after the British colony reverts to Chinese rule in 1997, an official report said yesterday, according to AP in Beijing. Vice-foreign minister Liu Huaqiu summoned Mr Roy to lodge a protest against the Hong Kong policy act, signed recently by President Bush.</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Speculation on possible successors to  European Union (EU) Commission President Jacques Delors has  begun to appear in the French press.    Philippe Lemaitre, LE MONDE correspondent in Brussels,  writes  in the 30 April edition of that Paris daily that attention is  focused on Sir Leon Brittan, the European Commission vice  president in charge of foreign economic relations, Ruud Lubbers,  the Netherlands prime minister, and Jean-Luc Dehaene, his  Belgian counterpart. Brittan, while "brilliant and  efficient...has little support in France," Lemaitre contends.  Brittan succeeded during the GATT negotiations in not  antagonizing the French. However, the suspicion of partiality  that resulted from some of his positions--notably his refusal to  allow the French Aerospatiale firm to purchase the Canadian De  Havilland company--still lingers. Brittan's concept of Europe  does not dovetail with France's, Lemaitre continues, citing an  observer as saying that "for Brittan, the Union is merely a  free-trade zone with a single currency." This approach may prove  untenable, as the next president's most important task may well  be the 1996 intergovernmental conference aimed at the political  integration of Europe.    As for Ruud Lubbers, Lemaitre notes, he was long considered  the "obvious" candidate, benefiting from the support of  "socialist heavyweights" Delors and Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish  prime minister. A federalist, Lubbers might achieve the needed  balance in a Union threatened by division. However, Germany did  not appreciate his "reticence" at the time of German  unification, and both President Francois Mitterrand and  Chancellor Helmut Kohl were reportedly "irked" by Lubbers'  "tolerance" of British Prime Minister John Major's demands  during the Maastricht negotiations. If repeated, this stance  could "paralyze" the 1996 political-institutional debate,  Lemaitre contends. However, Lubbers' chances are good,  especially if the British, convinced that a Brittan candidacy  could not succeed, grant him their support.    Both France and Germany, Lemaitre continues, would prefer  Jean-Luc Dehaene, whose behavior is unanimously praised. A  "well-mannered Christian Democrat," Dehaene is appreciated in  Paris for his knowledge of the issues and the directness with  which he would conduct--"more fluently in French than in  English"--the efforts necessary to achieve progress in European  construction. According to Lemaitre, the impression is that  Dehaene would defend political union "without dogmatism but with  determination." Dehaene, Lemaitre contends, represents a  "familiar and reassuring Europe" at a time of impending  enlargement. He would not meet with total British opposition,  even if Paris and Bonn "are banking on his resoluteness to  counter, if necessary, London's penchant for a European space  without political consistency."    If the constraints of Belgian domestic politics were to  block  Dehaene's candidacy, an "outsider" like Etienne Davignon,  president of the Societe Generale de Belgique and a former  commissioner of proven efficiency, might be considered a  "perfectably acceptable Belgian alternative," Lemaitre writes.  Another candidate may be Peter Sutherland, the Irishman  recently appointed secretary general of the GATT. France's  desire to preserve intact its place in the next Commission might  not be easy, given Delors' long presidency.    The French tradition mandating the appointment of one  commissioner from the ranks of the governing majority and  another from the opposition will probably be maintained,  Lemaitre predicts. A possible French "ticket" composed of former  Prime Minister Edith Cresson--who would enjoy Mitterrand's  support--and Rally for the Republic (RPR) deputy Jean-Bernard  Raymond would illustrate the government's wish to send to  Brussels political figures rather than "distrusted technocrats."  On the Left, other candidates might be former European Affairs  Minister Elisabeth Guigou and former Agriculture Minister Henri  Nallet. On the Right, Balladur's adviser on European affairs,  Yves-Thibault de Silguy, whose talent is generally acknowledged,  is sometimes mentioned despite his lack of political experience.  Another possible candidate mentioned is Eurodeputy Jean-Louis  Bourlanges, "one of the few French Europarliamentarians to have  succeeded in escaping anonymity," Lemaitre concludes.    Marie-Martine Buckens also discusses the succession in the  30  April Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN. While her report essentially  agrees with Lemaitre's, she adds that the fact Sir Leon Brittan  is British presents a "double disadvantage." First, he belongs  to a "big" country, and tradition mandates that the next  president ought to come from a "small" country. Second, Brittan  must convince his partners of his "loyalty" on social policy and  monetary union, two priority issues from which Great Britain has  distanced itself. As for Jean-Luc Dehaene, Buckens comments  that he is reportedly the favorite of the "Franco-German axis,"  a factor of "decisive" importance. Fulfilling the "small"  country condition, Dehaene, endowed with "a gift of compromise,  pragmatism, and directness," deserved his partners' unanimous  praise for the way the 1993 Belgian EU presidency was conducted.</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / EC mounts ERM rescue bid: Fluctuation of 15% for currencies as ministers seek to resolve crisis EUROPEAN Community finance ministers reached an historic agreement early today to revamp radically the operating rules of the embattled exchange rate mechanism in a bid to salvage it. After more than 11 hours of emergency talks in Brussels, the finance ministers and central bank governors from the 12 member states agreed to widen the fluctuation bands for the eight currencies in the ERM to 15 per cent. This represents a last-ditch bid to make the ERM more flexible and allow broader leeway for movement of currencies to make the system less susceptible to speculative attack. The new 15 per cent bands will come into place from the start of trading in Europe today. They replace the 2.25 per cent margins now applying for all currencies in the system apart from the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo, which up until this morning had 6 per cent fluctuation bands. But this makes the ERM a 'minimalist' system which may be seen as ineffective in keeping currencies tied together. French economy minister Edmond Alphandery said that franc stability, both domestically and on foreign exchange markets, would remain the overriding priority of French monetary policy. 'Let there be no mistake. The direction of monetary policy remains unchanged,' he said. Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said that widening the fluctuation bands - and so reducing the need for German and Dutch intervention - was just a temporary measure to relieve tensions inside the ERM. The aim was to return to narrow bands by January 1 next year, when the second stage of European economic and monetary union is due to begin under the Maastricht treaty. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, expressed satisfaction with the widening of the bands, saying it would increase risks for speculators and would hopefully mean a relaxation in tensions. He made clear that the Bundesbank had not made an explicit commitment to lower interest rates as part of this morning's agreement. Mr Schlesinger said that Germany had fulfilled more than its duties in supporting the weaker currencies. But the Bundesbank had recently spent more than DM60bn (Pounds 23bn) buying weaker currencies in voluntary and obligatory intervention. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, said after the meeting the solution was 'flexible and realistic'. He reaffirmed that Britain would be unlikely for some time to want to return to the ERM. In a communique, the finance ministers said all member states reaffirmed their determinatiom to put the Maastricht treaty on European monetary union into operation as soon as possible. The weekend talks came after hectic selling of weak currencies in the ERM at the end of last week. Especially badly hit by the selling were the Belgian and French francs and the Danish krone, leaving only the D-Mark, the Irish punt and the Dutch guilder unscathed. The currency crisis was triggered by the Bundesbank's refusal to lower its key discount rate on Thursday. The new 15 per cent bands will be based around the existing central rates of currencies in the ERM against each other and against the anchor currency, the D-Mark. Crucially, the Netherlands and Germany will retain their existing relationship allowing for only a 2.25 per cent fluctuation margin between the D-Mark and the Dutch guilder. This reinforces the impression of a multi-tier currency grid, according to officials. Mr Waigel said that one country - known to be Spain - had called for suspension of the operating rules of the ERM but this suggestion had met with strong opposition from the European Commission, on the grounds that it could be misunderstood by financial markets. Mr Henning Christophersen, vice-president of the European Commission, said the deal was a temporary response 'to exceptional circumstances created by market speculation'. He stressed the need for close co-operation between governments and central banks to avoid unnecessary fluctuations. Under the deal intervention rules will apply as under the normal system except that they will occur only at the top and lower end of the fluctuation rate of 15 per cent. Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, said: 'The deal was the best that could be achieved.' But he added that it was not wholly satisfactory, apparently referring to suggestions that wider fluctuation bands would reduce the effectiveness of the ERM in keeping currencies together. Mr Clarke said the changes in the ERM rules would leave member states free to pursue their own policies. The changes 'keep the system intact but make it a much more flexible arrangement'. Although sterling fell with the new wide bands there was no question of an early sterling re-entry to the ERM. Britain pulled sterling from the mechanism last autumn, saying it would not rejoin until ''fault lines'' in the system had been fixed. In their communique, the EC ministers and central bankers reaffirmed their support for procedures laid down in the Maastricht treaty for achieving economic convergence in the Community. They said the new wider bands of the EC's currency grid were a temporary response to exceptional speculative movements. 'The ministers and governors therefore reaffirm support for the current parities and are confident that the market rates will soon approach these parities once again.' Mr Wim Kok, Dutch finance minister, said Spain was the only country strongly in favour of a general float of the currencies in the ERM. 'Spain alone argued vigorously for a general float,' he said after the meeting. He said that no country asked for a general realignment. Asked what he thought of the decision to widen fluctuation bands to 15 per cent. Mr Kok said: 'This was the worst but one option.' He believed a smaller widening of the bands with variations between different countries, or the D-Mark and guilder temporarily leaving the system would have been preferable. 'This is an almost floating system with the exception of Germany and the Netherlands,' Mr Kok said. 'A collapse would have been a disaster. This is not a disaster but it is a black day.' Mr Norman Lamont, Britain's former chancellor, said the decision to loosen ties between currencies in the ERM had killed all plans for a single EC currency. 'It's clear monetary union is now dead and the monetary part of the Maastricht treaty has been made redundant,' he said. The French franc's crisis was the same as the pound's last year. 'Like the UK, France does not have high inflation and no amount of political commitment was sufficient to cope with German monetary conditions when they became wholly inappropriate for the rest of Europe,' Mr Lamont said, referring to interest rates. In Paris, a spokesman for Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, said he would be making no statement on the talks until today. Officials had said earlier that he could make a statement after the talks in Brussels ended.

			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> JUSTICES REJECT SUNLAND CLERGY SUIT  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court refused to revive a "clergy malpractice" lawsuit  stemming from the 1979 suicide of a young man counseled by pastors of his  church in Sunland.  </P> <P> The justices, without comment today, left intact a California Supreme Court  decision that threw out the suit against the Grace Community Church of the  Valley.  </P> <P> Kenneth Nally, 24, of Tujunga committed suicide April 1, 1979, by shooting  himself. His parents, Walter and Maria Nally, subsequently sued Grace Community  Church, the largest Protestant church in Los Angeles County, and four church  pastors. The wrongful-death suit alleged that the pastors had been negligent  and had acted outrageously in failing to prevent the suicide.  </P> <P> A state trial judge dismissed the suit, but a state appeals court reinstated it  in a ruling that sent shock waves through the legal profession and the  religious community. But the California Supreme Court killed the suit last Nov.  23.  </P></p>

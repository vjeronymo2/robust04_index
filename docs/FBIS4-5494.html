			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Two Diet members of the  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) are urging reform-minded members  in the main opposition party to quit and form a new party, the  ASAHI SHIMBUN reported Tuesday. The mass-circulation daily  named the two as Michihiko Kano and Masayasu Kitagawa, both of  whom have pushed for political and electoral reforms.    Kano, Kitagawa and their supporters are expected to leave  the  LDP in a day or two, at the earliest, the ASAHI said in its  evening edition.    Kano has served as director general of the Management and  Coordination Agency, while Kitagawa was once parliamentary vice  minister of education. The two men are lobbying some 40 LDP  legislators to join a new party they want to set up, and hope to  get at least 20 members for it, the newspaper said without  attribution.    Kitagawa is known for his close ties with new party Sakigake  leader Masayoshi Takemura, who is the chief cabinet secretary.  The pair plan to keep their distance from both the LDP and the  ruling coalition, it said.</p>

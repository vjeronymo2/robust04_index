			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Profits setback for Hafslund Nycomed Hafslund Nycomed, the Norwegian group best known for its radiology products, saw nine-month pre-tax profits slip to NKr1.01bn (Dollars 155.3m) from NKr1.18bn. The decline was due to reversals in the securities portfolio and higher interest expenses. Group sales, including royalties, rose to NKr5.3bn from NKr4.7bn while operating profit was unchanged at NKr1.5bn. Net financial items during the period were a charge of NKr132m, against income of NKr35m last year. Interest expenses shot up to NKr105m from NKr63m but foreign currency losses were cut to NKr34m from NKr50m. The group suffered losses on securities of NKr8m, compared with gains of NKr153m last year. Nycomed Imaging's sales slipped to NKr1.89bn from NKr1.92bn with operating profit declining to NKr1.15bn from NKr1.2bn due to increased competition and pressure on prices. Nycomed Pharma improved sales to NKr2.5bn from NKr2.3bn. Its operating profit rose to NKr467m from NKr369m on the back of positive developments in the Nordic and Benelux markets.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Christian Wulff, Christian Democratic </F> Union's leading candidate in Lower Saxony elections, by  unidentified announcer -- live]    [Excerpts] [Announcer] Herr Wulff has just come into the  studio. Are you the biggest loser of the day?    [Wulff] I do indeed believe that the Christian Democratic  Union [CDU] is the loser. We have lost 5, 6 percent. However,  I do want to say at this point that I take responsibility for  this defeat -- that goes without saying. I am the top  candidate. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] This really is the worst result -- we have to  have a close look at the figures -- in almost 30 years. This is  indeed a huge defeat for you personally. I remember you saying  before the elections that you tried to represent the young, the  new, the renewed CDU. Was not this what the voter wanted?    [Wulff] I think the process of renewal has to continue. We  were popular in certain groups of the population and put on  great election campaign events. We now have to continue to  fight, to work, and I want to do this in the state parliament in  particular, also as leader of the opposition in order to have a  different basis from which to start out next time and to win.  We are of course convinced that our policies are the right ones  and that this federal state needed a new start. We did not get  the votes required for this, so we will go into opposition and  be a good opposition.    [Announcer] How much blame for this defeat goes to Bonn?    [Wulff] In the last elections in Baden-Wuerttemberg,  Hamburg,  and Brandenburg we lost 10 percent of the vote and we have lost  around 5 percent here. That is quite a change. We managed to  keep the Republikaner out of parliament which is a great  success. In Hamburg almost 8 percent of votes were for the  right-wing extremists. We kept the Statt [Instead] Party quite  small because we have renewed ourselves as an established party.  Thus, we have some positive signs from this election result.  But the climate necessary to bring about this turnaround was  lacking. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] But you will be going to Bonn sometime, of  course. It is said you once put your foot down there. Will you  do that again?    [Wulff] We think we can see some improvements in Bonn, also  over the last eight weeks. This was not expressed in the  election result, but when I see how things have gone with the  nomination of Roman Herzog, nursing care insurance, and changes  in bad weather payments yesterday and the day before, then I  have to say that Bonn supported us greatly in the end, so thanks  also to Helmut Kohl, Peter Hintze, and others in Bonn, who  fought like Frau Merkel, Herr Wissmann here, a great thing. So  we also have support in Bonn, to whom we owe our thanks.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A national posts and telecommunications personnel  meeting was held in Hainan on 21 June. Before the meeting,  Governor Ruan Chongwu, secretary of the provincial party, and  Vice Governor Wang Xiaofeng, deputy secretary of the provincial  party committee, met with Wu Jichuan, minister of posts and  telecommunications, and (Zhang Changhua), director of the Youth  Cadres Bureau of the Central Organization Department, and their  party, who were attending the meeting, and extended their  congratulations on the opening of the meeting in Hainan. Cai  Changsong, member of the standing committee of the provincial  party committee and director of its organization department,  attended the meeting by invitation.    The current meeting's main topic of discussion was to study  -- based on the state's macroclimate and the market economy --  the issues of accelerating the process of making cadres younger  in average age, with the goal of establishing leading bodies  that will carry forward our cause beyond this century, and with  a sense of responsibility for building a contingent of key  professional technicians who have the training of highly  qualified personnel and who can cross into the next century.  The meeting also discussed and probed such issues as the  strategy for posts and telecommunications personnel work.    Posts and Telecommunications Minister Wu Jichuan spoke at  the  meeting. One hundred and twenty two persons -- including  directors of posts and telecommunications bureaus in provinces,  autonomous regions, and municipalities, and principal persons in  charge of departments directly under the jurisdiction of the  ministry -- attended the meeting.</p>

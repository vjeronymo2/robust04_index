			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by correspondent A. Peslyak; from the "Vesti" </F> newscast--recorded]    [Text] [G. Kaurov, head of a department of the Russian  Ministry of Atomic Energy, identified by caption] Korea is,  perhaps, capable of developing nuclear weapons now, but we have  serious doubts that Korea is actually developing nuclear weapons.    [Peslyak] So Russian nuclear specialists believe that  Pyongyang does not have the bomb, while the West and South Korea  stress in every possible way the reality of the nuclear threat  in the peninsula. The problem, perhaps, lies elsewhere or not  only in the dilemma of what course of action to take: Sanctions  or conferences, pressure or a negotiated compromise? To count  on inspectors being given access to Pyongyang's nuclear  installations but in exchange for what? For direct talks with  the United States? To give appropriate guarantees to North and  South Koreas, to keep the peninsula nuclear-free? But what  should be regarded as the cause of the current situation?    In the West's view, it is Pyongyang's blackmail and bluff  plus indirect support from Beijing which has just carried out an  underground nuclear explosion. But maybe, partially the reason  is a search for a new image of an enemy after the old one  represented by Moscow does not exist any longer for the United  States and NATO? After all, an opportunity has appeared to  justify nonreduction of military budgets and carry out some  preparations, referring to somebody's intransigence.    One thing is clear: The Treaty on Nuclear Nonproliferation  expires next year. If, in the international class, one pupil  suddenly shows an indomitable temper in learning nonnuclear  peace, will nuclear veterans have enough political tact and  sensibility to use persuasion instead of arm-twisting? Other  pupils will then see this as an equality-promoting experience.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mutsuki Kato, minister of agriculture, </F> forestry, and fisheries, by NHK announcer Yoshiaki Kawabata --  live relay from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and  Fisheries in Tokyo; from the "NHK News 7" program]    [Text] [Kawabata] Mr. Kato, thank you for waiting. This  is your second time to become minister of agriculture, forestry,  and fisheries. During your first term under the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] administration, I suppose you took the  position that Japan would never import a single grain of rice.  This time, after Japan accepted minimum market access under the  Uruguay Round, the situation has changed drastically. How do  you look at such a change in the situation?    [Kato] Under the situation where three Diet resolutions  [opposing the liberalization of the rice market] existed, the  Hosokawa administration decided to accept minimum access to the  rice market. I look back with profound thoughts at events in  the past.    [Kawabata] Let me ask you questions on specific issues.  First, concerning the important issue of reviewing the food  control system, different opinions have been expressed on this,  and this is supposed to be discussed at the Agricultural  Administration Council. The immediate question is whether the  system should be revamped radically, including the possibility  of abolishing the system altogether, or whether partial revision  would be enough. What do you think, Mr. Kato?    [Kato] I think there is an emerging national consensus that  the food control system should be revamped. As to what to do  with the substance of the revisions, as you just said, this is  being handled by the Agricultural Administration Council, and  the council is in the process of listening to the views of the  various sectors. I do not think it is proper for me to say  things in advance. The important thing is to think of Japan's  future, and take into consideration our bitter experience in the  past, while pondering how to strike a balance between the need  to secure stable supplies of rice and other grains, and the need  to maintain the incentive for farmers. That is how I think of  the food control system.    [Kawabata] However, what you are saying is very difficult to  do.    [Kato] Yes. It is extremely difficult, and we do not expect  to achieve that easily.    [Kawabata] Mr. Kato, among the consumers, many hold the  opinion that they should be allowed to choose different  varieties of rice freely. How will you deal with the  liberalization of the distribution system?    [Kato] When you look back at the "Heisei rice upheaval  [Heisei kome sodo]" last February and March, there were people  who clamored for the freedom of choice when foreign rice was  being blended with domestic rice, and there were those who  favored selling foreign and Japanese rice separately in a set.  Furthermore, the people have come to know very well the taste,  cooking methods, and prices of foreign rice. I think we will  have to take all this into consideration when handling this  problem.    [Kawabata] Mr. Kato, are you basically in favor of promoting  the liberalization of the distribution system?    [Kato] Deregulation will benefit the people greatly. I  would like to consider how to implement this in a manner  suitable under the existing conditions, and in a direction that  will make rice more readily available to consumers and enhance  more freedom of choice.    [Kawabata] Immediately after you took office, you said that  correcting the price gap between foreign and Japanese rice --  the fact that compared to foreign rice, Japanese rice is  extremely expensive -- is an important issue. What concrete  steps will you take in this regard?    [Kato] In the case of the recent emergency rice imports,  there was nothing we could do. The measures taken last year to  deal with the economic recession also cost a lot of money. As I  said earlier, there is the problem of Japanese rice costing  300,000 yen a ton, while imported rice ranges from 40,000 to  60,000 yen a ton.    Therefore, the job of the Hata administration is not only to  correct the price gap between foreign and Japanese rice, but  also work on the price gap for all daily necessities of the  people. In this context, vigorous steps should be taken to  narrow the price gap between Japan and foreign countries for  agricultural, forestry, and fisheries products. I would like to  manage agricultural administration in such a manner.    [Kawabata] I am sure that is what you think. Do you have  anything specific in mind to narrow this price gap?    [Kato] Regardless of my own personal intentions, the people  have come to realize keenly the price gap through the recent  commotion about rice. There are various issues on which we are  seeking the views of the Agricultural Administration Council in  the near future that it would not be proper for me to say things  in advance now. However, we should keep this problem very much  in mind when dealing with agricultural administration from now  on. Otherwise, a distrust of the agricultural administration may  spread among the people, and this will be terrible. I would  like to keep the price gap in mind as the central issue and take  various measures in this regard.    [Kawabata] Mr. Kato, under a minority government, I would  think it will be very difficult to resolve various issues. What  do you think?    [Kato] That is why we will hold up high the banner of  reform. The government belongs to the people, and it should  serve the people. I believe precisely because we are a minority  administration, if we appeal to the people directly in good  faith, overcoming the boundary line between ruling and  opposition parties, we will be able to open up prospects for the  future. If we deal with the price gap issue and all other  issues by listening to the voice of the people as the voice of  heaven, I think things will turn out right.    [Kawabata] Let me go back to the rice issue, along with the  acceptance of minimum access in the Uruguay Round, you are  supposed to compile emergency measures on agriculture and the  rural areas by July. Can this work be completed by July?    [Kato] Yes, I believe we will have to accomplish that. By  that time, there will also be the problem of the producers' rice  price. If we failed to compile the emergency measures, we will  not be able to win the rice producers' and the people's  understanding. I would certainly like to complete this task.    [Kawabata] Thank you.</p>

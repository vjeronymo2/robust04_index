			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kunlachada Chaiphiphat: "Refusal to list arms </F> puts Thailand in terror camp"]    [Text] Thailand is the only one of Asean's six  member-nations that has failed to submit arms data to the UN  Register of Conventional Arms in New York.    Like it or not, the country will remain on the list of  `terrorist nations' included in the UN Secretary General's  report to the 49th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA)  later this year unless the Thai Ministry of Defence, responsible  for national arms procurement, adopts a new attitude towards  military transparency.    Indonesia, possessor of Asean's largest military arsenal,  has  submitted its military data to the UN registry. Last year  Thailand and Indonesia were listed along with Syria, Saudi  Arabia and Jordan as arm buyers failing to respond to UNGA  resolution 46/36 L, which calls for all members to give new arms  data to the UN.    The resulting situation is especially absurd in light of the  fact that Thailand is supposedly at the forefront of regional  and international efforts to implement the UN's Agenda for  Peace, which calls for the building of trust and confidence  across the region in order to prevent or minimize conflict.    The military is adhering to the old myth that the details of  arms procurement is a national secret. It continues to bury its  head in the sand, ensuring the worsening of an already blemished  international image, particularly damaged by the army's alleged  support of the Khmer Rouge.    The UN Register of Conventional Arms is a simple but  effective step towards building trust among the nations of the  world, calling upon member countries to voluntarily provide data  on the importing and exporting of seven types of offensive  weapons, as well as general background information on national  procurement and holdings policy.    In 1991, Thailand was one of 150 UN member nations to vote  in  support of UNGA resolution 46/36 L on transparency in armaments,  which resulted in further resolutions to set up the register  over the next two years. The resolutions were approved by 150  members with no objections. Iraq and Cuba abstained.    Last year 80 countries, including Asean members Singapore,  Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei, submitted their arms data  for UN registration.    But there is little point in having the Asean Regional Forum  discuss the noble goal of trust-building in accordance with the  UN agenda for peace when a host country like Thailand fails to  contribute to even this very basic and essentially harmless  attempt at boosting trust.    Military spending in Southeast Asia is generally considered  extraordinarily large for peace time, which makes the exchange  of arms purchase information especially important to the nations  of this region.    As acting regional leader, the country must show its  sincerity in this respect instead of playing for time with the  excuse that neighbours Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Burma have  not done so.    These countries will be attending the Asean meeting in  Bangkok in July. Despite being the host country, Thailand will  have absolutely no authority to initiate discussions of military  transparency, which will be a crucial topic at the meeting.    Thailand is no longer justified in claiming regional  instability as an excuse for delaying arms data. With  Indonesia's disclosure, all other Asean nations have fulfilled  their commitment to the UN. In the age of proliferation,  countries the world over face an equal threat.    At any rate, despite the army's confidence, the size of  Thailand's military arsenal, or that of any Asean nation, is no  secret. International arms dealers have been more than willing  to publish sales figures as it promotes their products.    In the UN's 1992 report on arms procurement, circulated at  the General Assembly's 48th session last year, it was revealed  that Thailand had bought arms from Australia, China and United  States without registering this with the international  organization.    The UNGA resolution, unlike Security Council resolutions, is  nonbinding, and is aimed in part at testing the cooperativeness  of UN members.    While the resolution's April 30 deadline has passed, the  UN's  annual report on arms procurement does not come out until  August, and there is a provision for late filers in the report's  appendix.    Better for Thailand to be a latecomer than the black sheep  of  the world community.</p>

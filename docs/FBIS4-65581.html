			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by N. Khasapopoulos: "Unified Defense Gains Ground"] </F>   [Text] Immediately after the Easter holiday the formulation  of the Unified Defense Area of Greece and Cyprus will enter its  final stage with the (second within two months) visit of K.  Iliadis, the Cyprus minister of defense, even though the  strategic obligations of the two countries have yet to be  defined fully. Although the timetable for the implementation of  the joint Greek-Cypriot decisions is being followed faithfully  (this was achieved following specific instructions by Prime  Minister A. Papandreou to Minister of Defense Yer. Arsenis)  several issues remain undecided on both sides and need to be  settled as soon as possible.    Arsenis appears optimistic on the implementation of the  second defense doctrine in Greek history (the first is that of  advanced border outposts) not so much because of the faithful  implementation of the timetable as because of the fact that the  objections of our allies, especially the British, have been  toned down. According to a statement of the minister of defense  to "TO VIMA," in his recent discussions with foreign military  attaches, the unified defense doctrine of Greece and Cyprus has  been relegated by the allies to a secondary issue. Even within  NATO -- as he said -- the interest of the allies, including the  Turks, to learn more about the content of this unique defense  system has stopped.    A certain embarrassment felt especially by the Greek  military  after the TV presentation of certain aspects of the doctrine by  Cypriot officials has now been overcome since both sides agreed  on the necessity to keep the strategic plans secret. New  Democracy Chairman Milt. Evert told at some point Cyprus  President Gl. Kliridis (who in Salonica had made certain  statements regarding the defense doctrine) that "the Turks would  be willing to pay even $10 million to find out about details we  make public on television." As a result, the official statements  are now curtailed and the initiative is in the hands of the  military staff officers (Greek and Cypriots) who feverishly work  on the strategic plans.    A second problem relates to the best possible coordination  between the Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs in  handling this issue. The military side found out that in the  view of the diplomats the new defense doctrine had one  objective, namely to serve as a strong bargaining card in the  hands of the Greek Cypriots and that the withdrawal of the  doctrine will coincide with the announcement that Cyprus is  demilitarized. The coordination of the diplomats with the  military was achieved after a recent meeting between [Foreign  Minister] K. Papoulias and [Defense Minister] Ger. Arsenis.    Both the diplomats and the military agree on one important  point: the implementation of the new defense doctrine is now a  one-way street for Greece, in the sense that Greece has no more  room for vacillation since the political, diplomatic and  possibly military cost will be several times heavier than the  potential benefits. Nicosia which welcomed enthusiastically the  enunciation of the new military doctrine, is now concerned with  mainly two issues: The first relates to the very philosophy of  the doctrine itself since it implies the unified dealing with  any threats on the entire national area. The appearance of a  threat, however, will mean automatically a joint defense,  something which the Cypriot leadership views with skepticism at  this delicate phase of the Cypriot issue. The second concern of  the Cypriots is related to the economy since the implementation  of the doctrine automatically will involve added expenditures  for the heavily burdened Cypriot economy, especially with the  construction of defense infrastructure projects such as a naval  yard, an airport and air defense equipment, as well as  fortification projects, etc. This was the reason why certain  Cypriot political parties had expressed some objections to the  full implementation of the doctrine three months after its  enunciation.    With the work done on the military plans all these problems  appeared to be resolved since all now understand that (at this  final stage of the issue) the doctrine is the way for a  comprehensive reorganization of Cyprus' defense infrastructure,  the quantitative and qualitative upgrading of the Cypriot  National Guard, the reestablishment of secure communication  channels, the development of training programs for the National  Defense officers and for joint military exercises which are so  useful for a coordinated defense.    All these, of course, take place on paper at this moment and  no one knows --as reported by the military -- how they will be  implemented in action and most importantly how it will be  possible to rapidly deploy Greek forces on the island (in the  event of a crisis) without at the same time weakening the Greek  defense.    The Greek military staff officers believe that a serious  crisis with Turkey in the future will not be limited to Cyprus.</p>

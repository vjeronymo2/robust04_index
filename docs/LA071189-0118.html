			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK: KIEFER IS HOPING FOR BETTER BREAKS  </P> <P> Steve Kiefer sits in his Columbus, Ohio, home, his left leg in a cast from his  ankle to his knee, and faithfully listens to the Columbus Clippers'  International League baseball games on the radio.  </P> <P> It's hardly the way Kiefer wants to spend the summer, but he hasn't had much of  a choice thanks to the cast.  </P> <P> And he just can't stand to see the Clippers play in person. At least not until  he can play third base for the New York Yankees' triple-A franchise again.  </P> <P> "I don't like going there," said Kiefer, who played at Garden Grove High School  and Fullerton College. "It makes me mad to see everyone playing. So I just sit  at home and listen to the games."  </P> <P> One can't blame Kiefer, 28, for being bitter. He was hitting .294 with five  triples and five home runs, and had hopes of moving up to the Yankees.  </P> <P> "I'm hoping to get the cast off sometime in the next week," Kiefer said. "It's  ready to come off. I'm not in any pain."  </P> <P> Kiefer didn't deal with much pain for six of his seven years in pro baseball.  He battled only minor injuries -- sore muscles and ankles -- after signing with  Oakland in 1981. He never sat out more than a week when he split time between  the major and minor leagues with Oakland and later with Milwaukee.  </P> <P> But nothing has prepared Kiefer for the rash of injuries and setbacks he has  suffered in the last 16 months.  </P> <P> In March 1988, he missed a week of spring training with the Brewers after he  was struck in the head with a beer bottle in a Mesa, Ariz., bar. He had cuts on  his neck and face that required several stitches.  </P> <P> Kiefer, 6-foot-1 and 185 pounds, said the scuffle "was a case of mistaken  identity."  </P> <P> "Some guy was in a fight with someone who looked like me," he said. "He just  came up behind me and hit me with the bottle."  </P> <P> He had other problems away from the field. His wife, Karyn, had a miscarriage  that summer.  </P> <P> "This all hit me at the wrong time," he said. "I had a great year in 1987 with  30 homers and 90 RBIs (in the minors) and then this happened."  </P> <P> Kiefer's problems continued after he left Milwaukee and signed with the Yankees  as a free agent in November. In his first week of spring training, he popped a  tendon in his right bicep while batting in a practice game.  </P> <P> Once again, bad timing. Kiefer said he was challenging for a spot with the  Yankees.  </P> <P> "I was having a good spring training until that happened," he said. "But the  shoulder kept me out three weeks."  </P> <P> But his most crushing blow, the one he's still bitter about, came on June 1. He  tripled in the sixth inning of a game against Oklahoma City, and, after  rounding third base, caught his ankle on the edge of the artificial turf.  </P> <P> "I didn't feel anything snap," he said. "It was a little sore and I thought I  had a slight sprain. I got it taped and finished the game."  </P> <P> Doctors X-rayed his ankle the next day and found no break.  </P> <P> Kiefer kept playing, but his batting average dipped from .310 to .294.  </P> <P> Ten days after he first injured the ankle, doctors X-rayed it again, this time  applying pressure to the area. That's when they discovered the stress fracture.  </P> <P> "I was looking to be called up (to the Yankees)," Kiefer said. "It seemed like  everything hit when I got to the major leagues to stay. I never had anything  that kept me out more than a week."  </P> <P> Kiefer tries to think positively. He hobbles to his stationary bike, which he  rides every day. He lifts weights and plays catch. But he wishes he could do  more.  </P> <P> "This hasn't been much fun," he said. "I (haven't) been able to do anything."  </P> <P> Although the cast limits his movement, Kiefer has found plenty to keep him busy  during his unplanned summer vacation. He goes fishing and plays with daughters  Jackie, 7, and Ashley, 4.  </P> <P> He also stays in constant contact with his brother, Mark, who's pitching with  Milwaukee's Class-A franchise in Beloit, Wis.  </P> <P> Kiefer often jokes with friends and family about his injury. He says his cast  was uncomfortable at first, but he has grown used to it.  </P> <P> "There's only one bad thing about it," he said. "It smells bad."  </P> <P> Wayne Helm of the Bend (Ore.) Bucks pitched his first professional no-hitter in  a 10-0 victory against Everett (Wash.) July 2. Helm, a right-hander from Laguna  Hills, struck out 14 and walked none to raise his record to 2-0 in his first  season with the Angels' Class-A franchise.  </P> <P> Helm, who played at Pepperdine, also leads the Northwest League with 42  strikeouts.  </P> <P> The Iowa Cubs have placed former Cal State Fullerton pitcher Mike Harkey on the  disabled list for the second time this season.  </P> <P> Harkey, a 6-foot-5 right-hander, has missed his last two starts with the  Chicago Cubs' triple-A franchise because of a cyst on his left knee. He twisted  his knee in the second inning against Syracuse on June 25.  </P></p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: Laurentian Group profits up Laurentian Group, the Canadian financial services conglomerate, posted first quarter profit of CDollars 10.1m, or 18 cents a share, up 20 per cent from a year earlier, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. But the latest figure included a special gain of CDollars 2.5m, or 5 cents a share, on the sale of its interest in Laurwood, a British investment management firm. Excluding the special item, consolidated profit dipped 3 cents a share, due mainly to a weak quarter in the UK life insurance business.</p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> EEC MINISTERS OK STIFF DUTIES  </P> <P> European foreign ministers today agreed to impose stiff duties on some U.S.  imports but delayed implementing the sanctions to give both sides time to  resolve a transatlantic trade dispute.  </P> <P> The 12-nation European Economic Community will levy the tariffs if there is no  move to ease the conflict by mid-February, Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco  Fernandez Ordonez warned. "We hope the new North American administration will  adopt a more intelligent attitude."  </P> <P> The U.S. Mission to the EEC said in a statement: "We want to make every effort  to first contain and then resolve this dispute, and this decision . . . is  clearly a positive step in that direction."  </P> <P> But the U.S. officials also said they are "very concerned" about the ministers'  decision to approve a list of products that "could eventually be the target of  . . . counter-retaliation."  </P> <P> The dispute was touched off by the EEC decision to impose a Jan. 1 ban on U.S.  meat from cattle treated with growth hormones. The United States retaliated  with higher tariffs on a variety of products from the trading bloc.  </P></p>

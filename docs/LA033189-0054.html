			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CARSON BASEBALL TEAM FLASHES PLATE POWER AND SURPRISES SAN PEDRO, 9-7  </P> <P> Greeting home-run hitters as they trot by his third-base coaching box is a new  experience for Carson High Coach Marty Blankenship.  </P> <P> He enjoyed the pleasure twice in the Colts' 9-7 victory over visiting San Pedro  High on Thursday.  </P> <P> "I'm surprised when we hit a home run," said Blankenship. "We turned the tables  around today. Usually it is San Pedro who is hitting them out."  </P> <P> The victory was Carson's second straight over its Pacific League rival.  </P> <P> They have 3-3 league marks, trailing only Banning. Clearing the fence twice to  cap Carson's sweep was third baseman Steve Rubio.  </P> <P> The first time was a two-run blast to left-center in the third that gave Carson  a 3-2 lead. Rubio's second four-bagger came during a Colt uprising in the  fifth.  </P> <P> Sheldon James opened the inning off San Pedro pitcher Gerardo Castaneda with a  triple.  </P> <P> Pitcher Alfredo Rodriguez followed with a ground single to left through the  drawn-in infield.  </P> <P> Next came Rubio's towering drive near the same 416-foot sign he had cleared  earlier.  </P> <P> Carson tallied three more runs in the fifth off an obviously shaken Castaneda  to take a 9-2 lead.  </P> <P> The Pirates came back in the sixth to score five runs, all unearned, following  a Rubio error. Two-out singles by Joe Boncich and Matt Rasband cut the Colt led  to two before Rodriguez got Dale Johnson to ground out.  </P> <P> Johnson, a .432 hitter, was hitless in four tries.  </P> <P> San Pedro put the tying runs on in the seventh with one out, but Rodriguez  closed out the game with a flair by striking out Brian Schiazzano.  </P></p>

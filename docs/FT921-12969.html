			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: IBJ to merge affiliates with brokerage INDUSTRIAL Bank of Japan (IBJ), a leading Japanese bank, and Wako Securities, a second-tier Japanese broker, agreed yesterday to merge their asset management affiliates by the end of March this year. The move comes as Japanese investment management companies are faced with declining profits due to the sluggish stock market and faltering investor confidence. It also comes ahead of the deregulation of the Japanese financial industry, where barriers between banks and securities houses are expected to be abolished next year. IBJ Capital Management and Wako International Capital Management will merge to form IBJW Asset Management. The IBJ group will own a 67 per cent stake, while Wako Securities will hold 33 per cent. The company will be capitalised at Y300m. IBJ specialises in fund management for institutional investors, while Wako depends largely on funds from individuals. As of September last year, IBJ had Y823.1bn in customer assets under management, placing it sixth in the industry, while Wako, ranking 55th, had Y128.5bn in managed assets.</p>

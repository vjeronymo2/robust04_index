			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For policy as well as legal reasons, this resolution makes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sense, and it avoids extreme results. On the one hand, it would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unhelpful for EPA to design the FIP to meet the old law  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements that have since been repealed. And for EPA to impose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 1995 a regulatory regime that became extinct in 1990 would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surely not serve Congressional intent or constitute sound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory policy. On the other hand, it would equally disserve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congressional intent to compel these FIPs, which are not based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state failures to meet any requirements of the new Act, to meet all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those requirements and to cure failures that were not part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligation that the Court orders preserved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Coalition  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> case, the Ninth Circuit Court itself seemed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to imply that EPA's FIP need not address new requirements when it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noted that the state could ``propose these new measures as revisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the FIP under the timetables provided in the 1990 Amendments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> just as the state would be required to do if a FIP had been in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect when those Amendments were adopted''.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Coalition for Clean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Air,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 971 F.2d at 226.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indeed, if the FIP were to try to meet all the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the new Act, it would have to anticipate and cure new failures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before they had arisen under the new Act, and before the State has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> had an opportunity to develop and submit plans to comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new Act. This would violate the express congressional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination that ``air pollution prevention'' and ``air pollution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control at its source is the primary responsibility of States and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local governments.'' Section 101(a)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, EPA has concluded that the FIPs must cure the original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure to demonstrate attainment. But in these FIPs the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need not assume additional obligations to meet new requirements as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to which no state delinquency has yet been established under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new Act, or as to which EPA's FIP obligation has not yet matured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. The FIPs Must Demonstrate Attainment_(1) What Attainment Deadline Governs?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Background.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Ninth Circuit last addressed the issue of what attainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deadline applied to a pre-Amendment FIP obligation in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Delaney  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 898 F.2d 687 (9th Cir. 1990). But at that time the attainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deadline in the then extant Clean Air Act_December 31, 1987_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> had passed, and Congress had not yet extended it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a March 1990 opinion, prior to the passage of the Clean Air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act Amendments, the Ninth Circuit vacated EPA's approval of two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Arizona carbon monoxide SIPs, and ordered EPA to promulgate FIPs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with that court's opinion. Interpreting EPA's statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement to develop a FIP in light of the elapsed statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment date of December 31, 1987, the Court concluded that ``the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national ambient air quality standards must be attained as soon as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible with every available control measure *&blank;*&blank;*.'' 898 F.2d at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 691. The Court relied upon EPA guidance, subsequently revoked, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the part of its formulation requiring ``all possible measures'' or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``every available measure.'' 55 FR 36505 (September 5, 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Court, in formulating this attainment test, made plain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, while it understood that a Congressional re-determination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the attainment deadlines was in the works, the Court was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constrained until Congress acted. Thus, at the time the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Delaney <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Court and EPA last struggled to define an appropriate FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment deadline, they confronted not only a lapsed attainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deadline, but Congressional silence as to an appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Quoting from its opinion in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Abramowitz  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 832 F.2d 1071,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1079 (9th Cir. 1987), the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Delaney <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Court stated: ``We are informed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by counsel for both sides of their expectation that Congress will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extend the deadline once again in the near  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future, but we must apply the law as it now stands, not as it may become. *&blank;*&blank;* Until the Clean Air Act is further considered *&blank;*&blank;* the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency must `give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Congress.' We, and the EPA, are bound by the statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheme until Congress alters that scheme.'' 898 F.2d at 691.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Current law.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Now, however, Congress has indeed ``alter[ed] that scheme'', the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new law applies, and EPA, in formulating its FIPs, has the benefit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Congressional determination of appropriate attainment dates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments, Congress has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made specific attainment deadline determinations with respect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each type of area. As with other aspects of the new law, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that the attainment dates of the new law apply. Indeed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> even if it were not clear that the new attainment dates apply, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is now impossible to design FIPs to meet the 1987 attainment date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that governed the original state plans, and there is a clear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expression of Congressional intent as to substitute attainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deadlines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, under the new Act, the ozone attainment date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be ``as expeditiously as practicable but not later than''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 15, 1999 for Sacramento; November 15, 2005 for Ventura;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and November 15, 2010 for the South Coast. Section 181(a). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carbon monoxide attainment date for the South Coast must be ``as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expeditiously as practicable but not later than'' December 31, 2000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) These FIPs need not address new requirements other than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement to demonstrate attainment. As shown above, EPA's obligation to design a FIP arose from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state failures to demonstrate attainment under the old Clean Air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act. The Amendments imposed for the first time additional,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different requirements that were not in effect when EPA disapproved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the state plans giving rise to its FIP obligation, and which took  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect after EPA's FIP obligation matured. Thus California was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given no opportunity to meet these requirements in its previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIPs, and any failure to meet these requirements would be a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delinquency that was not the subject of EPA's original FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligation. EPA therefore has concluded that the FIPs need not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address these requirements unless and until California has failed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to satisfy them and the time for EPA to promulgate a replacement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIP under the new Act has elapsed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] East London April 25 SAPA -- The African National  Congress believes the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] has  "really messed things up" in the Eastern Cape, spokesman Mcebisi  Bata said on Monday. He said the ANC was upset by the "late"  list of polling stations in the region. "We think they (the  IEC) are not as organised as people would expect them to be,"  said Mr Bata.    IEC East London spokesman Mike Chandler said he did not  anticipate people having difficulty in finding polling stations:  "There are 1,797 polling stations in Transkei alone. Divide  that among the population; they are all very close to polling  stations."    In 90 per cent of villages in the region the polls would be  the "major event of the century", said Mr Chandler. "You'll be  able to see polling stations 10km off."    The official list of polling stations was first published on  April 21, as a 24-page supplement to the East London-based daily  DISPATCH newspaper.    A revised list was published as a supplement to the paper's  Transkei edition on Monday (today).    On Monday afternoon, Mr Chandler was compiling a third list  which he hoped to make available for publication that evening.    He said he had no idea where the list published that morning  had originated, nor if it was up-to-date. Mr Bata said the ANC  was doing all it could to publicise the location of polling  stations. It had asked regional radio stations to make the  locations known and the response had been good.    Mr Chandler defended the publication of the final list of  polling stations only a day before the elections, saying if it  had been published a month before voters would have forgotten  where the stations were. "I don't really understand what the  difficulty is. The area is going to be saturated with polling  stations."    Mr Bata criticised the imbalance in special voting stations,  saying there were only three at Mdantsane but 38 in East London.  Mr Chandler said this was due not to the IEC but the legacy of  apartheid.    Special voting stations were for the benefit of hospital and  clinic patients, old-age home residents and prison inmates.  That there were so few special stations in Mdantsane indicated  the relative lack of these institutions in black areas.</p>

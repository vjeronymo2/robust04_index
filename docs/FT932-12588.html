			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Anger as Mexican poll postponed MEXICO's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has provoked a national storm by postponing elections for governor in the state of Yucatan from November this year to May 1995. The local Yucatan Congress, which is controlled by the PRI and satellite parties, changed the state constitution on Friday, enabling the vote to be postponed. The Congress will now select an interim governor to rule from February 1994 to July 1995. Mexico's centre-right National Action Party (PAN) was seen as having a good chance of winning November's election. The state is one of the PAN's strongholds, and the mayor of Merida, the state capital, is from the party. The new election will be held after the September 1994 presidential election, thus forestalling a potentially embarrassing loss for the PRI, or opposition protests, at a sensitive time. On Sunday the PAN organised a referendum and protest march in Merida against the change, with an estimated 40,000 supporters. The PAN is also seeking legal action against deputies who approved what it considers an illegal modification to the constitution. It may walk out of negotiations over party financing reform in protest. The local PRI has defended the move, arguing that it was not in Yucatan's interests to hold its gubernatorial election so soon before the presidential election.</p>

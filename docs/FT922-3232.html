			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions provide impetus for 33% improvement at Blick BLICK continued to buck recessionary trends in the six months to March 31, lifting pre-tax profits by 33 per cent from Pounds 2.76m to Pounds 3.67m on turnover ahead 37 per cent to Pounds 14.7m. Mr Ian Scott-Gall, managing director of this clocking-in equipment and radio pager supply company, said that most of the profits advance was acquisition-led. In May 1991 Blick added communal television and radio distribution and controlled entry security systems to its businesses with the Pounds 8.26m acquisition of Telefusion from Granada. And on April 29, it bought a portfolio of rental contracts from GPT, which is jointly owned by GEC and Siemens, for Pounds 3.8m cash. Improved gross margins and tight cost controls had helped profits, said Mr Alan Elliot, chairman, though lower interest rates reduced interest receivable to Pounds 242,000 (Pounds 336,000). Mr Scott-Gall said that the group was able to weather the economic downturn because even though little new business had been won or few equipment sales made, the maintainance and service side of the business had kicked in. Telefusion had helped customer base income grow by 72 per cent and at the period-end gross rentals receivable under contract had risen 30 per cent to Pounds 67.5m (Pounds 51.9m). Cash balances at March 31 - after the January/February invoicing period - were up at Pounds 9.9m (Pounds 7.4m), boosted by the Pounds 3.7m share placing in March. Mr Scott-Gall described Blick's cash as part war chest - 'We're putting our buying boots on again' - part cushion, part reinvestment capital and part working capital. The interim dividend is lifted 15 per cent to 3p, payable from earnings of 11.52p (9.49p) per share.</p>

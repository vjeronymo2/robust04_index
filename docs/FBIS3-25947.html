Sun Weiben successively travelled to some war industrial  enterprises with difficulties of varying degrees in their  current production and operation, including the Songjiang  Electric Machinery Plant, Dongguang Machinery Plant, and  Jiancheng Machinery Plant to understand, in details, their  production and their workers' living, jointly explored measures  to help them extricate from predicaments along with cadres and  workers, and helped them solve some practical problems.    Sun Weiben said: War industrial enterprises have excellent  factory buildings and equipment and fairly high quality workers  and cadres. Many experts and talents are concentrated there.  The war industrial enterprises are worthy of esteem because  they can maintain unity at the higher and the lower level, work  hard, advance despite difficulties and make big strides to  guarantee the transfer of servicemen to civilian jobs under an  extremely difficult situation. This spirit is the first light  leading the war industrial enterprises towards extrication from  their predicament.    Whenever he travelled to an enterprise, he stressed that  cadres at all levels should change work styles, go deeply to the  grass roots, support and help the poor, and ensure that the  broad masses of workers have a peaceful Spring Festival. At  Dongguang Machinery Plant, Sun Weiben went to a dormitory for  single workers, and asked about the lives of workers. [passage  omitted]    At the workshop of a war industrial enterprise, Sun Weiben  conscientiously examined the production lines of military and  civilian products, and asked detailed questions about the  development orientation of civilian products, the product  property, and technological content. Sun Weiben said: The  fundamental way out for war industrial enterprises is to switch  to production of civilian products, and the crucial issue that  remains is the selection of products for production. At  present, the astronautics industrial enterprises have changed  their production line and achieved fairly good results. Owing  to various historical and practical reasons, the arms industry's  enterprises face fairly great difficulties. However, as long as  they persist in serving the market, give play to advantages, and  adjust product orientation, they will see the first light of  dawn. After affirming these enterprises' plans of developing  civilian products, Sun Weiben said: It is necessary to give play  to the advantage war industrial enterprises possess of having  equipment, technology and trained personnel, and develop  technology and value-added products that can have a big market,  and enable them to reach a fair scale. In carrying out new  construction and transformation projects, we should break with  common practice, start construction quickly, and put them into  production rapidly. We may let relevant provincial departments  take the lead, organize specialists of scientific research  institutes with achievements to visit some war industrial  enterprises, and introduce some new items to war industrial  enterprises in an effort to help them switch production to  civilian products. We will serve as "match-makers" in this  regard.    During his investigtion and studies, Sun Weiben repeatedly  stressed: If war industrial enterprises fail to thoroughly  emancipate the minds, it will be very difficult for them to  change their production to civilian products, to start the  second pioneering program, and to extricate themselves from  their predicament. He said: War industrial enterprises have  long been shackled by the planned economic structure, and some  still do not dare to move one step in the minefield or jump out  from a definite circle. If they "stick to this rule," when will  they be able to switch production to civilian products? Sun  Weiben said: The "three criteria" is a major principle and  proceeding from reality is a major policy. So long as things  are conducive for war industrial enterprises to extricate  themselves from the predicament, we may try whatever methods we  have. We will be good examples so long as we can solve our  problems. [passage omitted]    On hearing that Songjiang Electrical Machinery Plant has  prepared to introduce foreign capital to raise the production  capacity and quality of beer, Sun Weiben said: War industrial  enterprises should dare to break through the forbidden zone.  They may produce civilian products under the name of other  brands, introduce foreign capital for grafting and  transformation, or may even sell part of their idle assets and  land.    Sun Weiben fully affirmed the measures of these war  industrial enterprises that set up small accounting units for  independent operation. He said: Setting up small accounting  units and allowing workshops and sub-plants to operate  independently is good for mobilizing the enthusiasm of the grass  roots and urging them to follow the path of supporting  themselves through their own labor and assuming sole  responsibility for their profits and losses. One plant may  adopt two or even three systems, and should strive to vitalize  each and every workshop if possible. [passage omitted]    Sun Weiben expressed that the provincial authorities will do  everything possible to create conditions for war industrial  enterprises to overcome difficulties. As for those problems  which cannot be solved, the provincial authorities will report  them to the state with the coordination of competent departments  of war industrial enterprises.    Governor Yang Zhihai, and responsible comrades of the  General  Office of the provincial party committee, the Policy Research  Office of the provincial party committee, the General Office of  the provincial government, and the provincial National Defense  Work Office also participated in the investigation and studies.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PIG OWNER'S QUICK ACTION SAVES BACON  </P> <P> A 900-pound pet pig has been found safe in an abandoned drive-in movie theater  -- four days after the owner reported a kidnaping.  </P> <P> Tiffany Marie's owner, Bob Urbanski, said he received an anonymous phone call  late Thursday from someone threatening to harm the pig unless it was retrieved  on the theater grounds.  </P> <P> "He said if we were not there in an hour, Tiffany Marie would be cut up,"  Urbanski said.  </P> <P> The 2-year-old spotted sow, who likes corn chips and strawberry whipped cream  pie, apparently was taken Sunday from a yard behind Urbanksi's family-run pet  store in this suburb south of Chicago.  </P></p>

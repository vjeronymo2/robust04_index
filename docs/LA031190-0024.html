			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A  CLASSIC).  </P> <P> * 1/2  </P> <P> PROFESSOR GRIFF &amp; THE LAST ASIATIC DISCIPLES  </P> <P> "Pawns in the Game" Skyywalker Records  </P> <P> The center of the Public Enemy anti-Semitism storm finally gets his chance to  prove whether he has something to say -- or whether he just talks a lot. The  verdict: Griff's mouth runneth over.  </P> <P> Even at his most eloquent -- and often on his debut album he and his posse  present their black-pride messages with forceful eloquence -- he does little  more than parrot wisdoms and observations received from African-American  leaders (Malcolm X on down) without regard for consistency or logic.  </P> <P> Every call for cross-cultural unity is shot through with scatter-gun separatist  rhetoric, every plea for peace countered with militaristic bravado and every  line encouraging blacks to take responsibility for themselves undermined by  blaming everyone but blacks for the world's problems. And "The Interview," is  not the excerpt from his notorious Washington Times interview that he said  would make clear that he was misunderstood, but just a jumble of speech and  sounds that clears up nothing at all.  </P> <P> To Griff's credit, he and the L.A.D. have fashioned some noteworthy settings  for the rantings, though little approaching the innovative power of Public  Enemy. Among the best is the two-part "Real African People," harking to the  jazzy beat style of rap precursors the Last Poets and Gil Scott-Heron, whom --  to his further credit -- he acknowledges (among many others) in the  album-closing litany "Blax Thanx." But then, he also acknowledges Moammar  Kadafi, another master of inflammatory speech and self-serving rationales.  STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

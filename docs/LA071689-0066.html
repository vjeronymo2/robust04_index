			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALIBU COLONY REBUFFED IN EFFORT TO LIMIT SHOPPING CENTER'S HOURS  </P> <P> The California Coastal Commission has rebuffed residents of the Malibu Colony  in their efforts to shorten the business hours of Malibu's largest shopping  center, located just across the street from the wealthy seaside enclave.  Representatives of a homeowners group, whose members include actors Larry  Hagman, Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith, argued before the commission Thursday  that the center's builder, Reco Development Corp., is violating a 1987  agreement limiting hours. Tenants of the center, Malibu Colony Plaza, include a  24-hour Hughes supermarket and a soon-to-open restaurant to be operated by  celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck.  </P> <P> Despite the residents' complaints about noise, parking and security, the  commission voted to accept changes sought by Reco in the 1987 agreement. That  agreement, reached after lengthy negotiations with the residents, included  concessions by Reco aimed at preserving the neighborhood's character by  providing landscaping and shielding the Colony from public access, in addition  to limiting the center's operating hours. The homeowners group, which includes  about 35 owners of million-dollar properties along Malibu Road, sought midnight  closing times for Puck's restaurant and for the supermarket.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Appeal Expected  </P> <P> The commission's vote means that the supermarket will be allowed to stay open  around the clock and the restaurant until 2 a.m. A spokesman for the homeowners  group, the Old Road Committee, said it would appeal.  </P> <P> Actor Meredith and several other residents attended the session Thursday to  help plead their case.  </P> <P> "I'm shocked, and I also feel very badly because it's my home, where I live,"  said Meredith, 79, when it became clear that the vote would go against them.  </P> <P> Puck also attended the hearing, accompanied by his wife, Barbara Lazaroff, and  both insisted that their restaurant would not cause any trouble.  </P> <P> "We don't run a bar; we run a restaurant," Lazaroff said.  </P> <P> "I want to be friends with the neighbors," Puck added, "because they are all  rich (and) they will be our customers."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Negotiations Disputed  </P> <P> Roy Crummer, the owner of Reco until he sold the company last month, said he  had negotiated Hughes' hours before the 1987 agreement with the homeowners  group. The homeowners disagreed.  </P> <P> In voting 7 to 2 to accept the changes sought by Reco in its building permit,  the commission appeared to accept the conclusion of its staff that restricting  the center's hours was not within its jurisdiction -- even though several  members of the commission acknowledged that they thought Reco was reneging on  earlier promises.  </P> <P> But homeowners' attorney Joel Klevens said the commission acted improperly.  </P> <P> "I am very disappointed that the commission did not see fit to enforce its own  conditions and that it instead sought to undermine the process of negotiation  and compromise it had endorsed less than two years ago," Klevens said.  </P> <P> Most of the $12-million, 100,000-square-foot shopping center was completed this  spring. Adorned with a mission-tile roof, carved stone columns imported from  Mexico, semicircular brick arches and two fountains, landscaped with palm trees  and bird-of-paradise plants, the center has drawn general praise even from its  opponents.  </P></p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Letter: Some fresh and practical tools for managers Sir, In his rush to dismiss Christopher Lorenz's article on Peter Senge (Management, February 17), Tony Gill misses the point (Letters, February 21). What matters is not whether 'organisational learning' is the latest fashion, but whether as an idea it makes a difference. Peter Senge is not only a purveyor of systems thinking (an old idea). He also offers some fresh and practical tools for managers. Not least is the exploration of their own taken-for-granted mental models - a revolutionary process if done well. Another is the linkage between systems thinking and organisational learning. Operations researchers would have had us believe that systems are self-correcting, but organisations are only self-correcting if managers intervene and make sure the learning takes place. Organisational learning is about accessibility of knowledge. Any readers of Senge's rather heavy book will have found Christopher Lorenz's plain English guide a welcome contribution.

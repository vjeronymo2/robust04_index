A  Foreign Affairs Department statement released today said  Indonesia hopes that this positive development will reduce the  tension on the Korean Peninsula, which has recently been quite  worrying. The statement also said that the comprehensive  settlement of this issue will prevent a prolonged political  crisis in East Asia and disturbances to the region's security.    Indonesia, as the chairman of the Nonaligned Movement, has  noted the positive response from the international community,  especially from countries in the East Asia region, and the  remarks from other nations that this new development will open  the door for negotiations between the United States and North  Korea over the nuclear issue.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREENING THE VALLEY  </P> <P> The city of Los Angeles and Inyo County can put an early end to more than two  decades of legal struggles by agreeing on a long-term plan governing the city's  water exports from the Owens Valley. It is in the best interest of both to do  so.  </P> <P> An equitable conclusion to the affair will not make Los Angeles officials  entirely happy, for they will not be able to pump as much ground water from the  eastern Sierra valley as they would like, when they would like. But then  nothing the city can ever do will make up for the clandestine manner in which  it took the valley's water three-quarters of a century ago, and began to  dominate Owens Valley affairs. Thad Taylor, a member of the Inyo County Water  Commission, was right on both counts when he said recently: "One, we cannot  turn back the clock. And two, Los Angeles is not going to go away."  </P> <P> The latest legal skirmishes began in the early 1970s after the Los Angeles  Department of Water and Power completed its second aqueduct to carry water from  the Owens Valley and Mono County to Los Angeles. The city increased its pumping  of ground water in the valley and the effect was immediately seen in dead  vegetation and dry springs and artesian wells. Inyo County sued under the  California Environmental Quality Act to require Los Angeles to justify its  increased pumping in an environmental-impact report. It also adopted a  ground-water management ordinance in an attempt to gain control over pumping.  </P> <P> Each side scored victories of sorts. The courts rejected two city environmental  reports as inadequate and imposed limits on pumping. Inyo's water ordinance was  declared unconstitutional. In 1982 both sides agreed to attempt a negotiated  settlement, leading in 1983 to a five-year interim agreement during which an  attempt was to be made to mitigate environmental damage in the valley and to  negotiate a conclusive agreement. The lawsuits were put on hold.  </P> <P> Now the armistice is ending. They must reach agreement by April 1 if they are  to meet a court deadline to develop a joint environmental-impact report by June  30, 1990. If the court approves their agreement, further legal action would be  abandoned. Without an agreement, the city will be required to write a new  impact report to justify additional pumping, or restrict its pumping to about  one-fourth of capacity. Inyo would pursue its ground-water ordinance suit.  </P> <P> In general, Owens Valley interests want Los Angeles to forgo any pumping that  degrades the valley environment. This is not an unreasonable request and the  city of Los Angeles would be hard-put to argue otherwise.  </P> <P> The city also should consider a proposal to let water flow 50 miles along the  now-dry Owens River bed before it is diverted back into the aqueduct at the  southern end of the valley. This would require construction of a pumping plant,  probably costing several million dollars. But using the river bed rather than  the aqueduct for that stretch of the water's journey would allow restoration of  riparian vegetation, waterfowl habitat and fisheries -- all items that would  enhance valley tourism.  </P> <P> The department makes millions of dollars in profit annually from its Owens  Valley water and hydroelectric power operations, and economic development of  the valley is severely limited because the city owns virtually all the  developable property. What is most critical to Los Angeles is the water. The  more amenable the city is to projects like the lower Owens River bed, the more  willing Owens Valley residents are likely to be to share their water.  </P></p>

[National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini, on  the day after convincing the party to "bless" the National  Alliance, won the first electoral victory, and he did nothing to  hide all his enthusiasm: "From Catania has come the first  victory of the new right, the confirmation which rewards our  desire to present ourselves as a governing force." But not only  the National Alliance leader has reason to be delighted. The  CCD [Democratic Christian Center] secessionists [from the  People's Party] see in the Catania result the confirmation of  their turn to the right. "This result demonstrates that the  forces of the left can be beaten," a convinced Clemente Mastella  explained, "and to tell the truth we are not overly surprised."    Cautious, but also clearly satisfied was [Pact for Italy  leader] Mario Segni, who has received further proof that the  left, without the members of the Pact, risks a heavy debacle.  "The citizens who voted for the Pact's candidate have  appreciated a campaign organized around problems and not  ideologies," Mariotto [Segni] claimed, stating that he was  determined to continue this strategy. The Catania results also  represented a panacea for [Italian Radical Party--PRI Secretary]  Giorgio La Malfa, who did not lose the opportunity to emphasize  the correctness of his decision not to mix with the left.  "Without Segni," the PRI secretary maintained, "the progressive  line-up did not even get to the final ballot round." This  confirms the National Council's decision not to accept the  alliance with Rete and the Communist Renewal. The Italian  Popular Party's [PPI] Giuseppe Gargani interpreted the results  as a resurrection of the Christian Democratic Party [DC]: "The  DC united in a serious pact with Segni's friends and with  non-Catholics have permitted the center grouping to reach the  final ballot."    A cry of alarm, on the other hand, comes from the Catholic  associations: "If the contradictions and misunderstandings in  the agreement between Segni and [PPI Secretary] Martinazzoli are  not resolved," ACLI [Christian Association of Catholic Workers]  Vice Chairman Michele Giacomantonio warned: "There is a danger  of handing over Italy to the right and the extremists."    The Catania results are also increasing the League's  interest  in the National Alliance. "We are looking at it closely," the  League's Senate floor leader Francesco Speroni maintained,  opening up possibilities, "but we are waiting for them to make  some concessions on the question of federalism."    On the left, in the meantime, they are reciting their "mea  culpa." First of all mayor of Catania, Enzo Bianco, himself  apologized. "The progressive grouping had the victory in its  hands and yet managed to lose. The responsibility lies with  those who allowed sectarianism and squabbling to prevail."  Achille Occhetto added: "It is an alarm bell," the PDS  secretary maintained, "because the battle will be long and we  should not become disheartened but work hard and patiently."  "The progressives lost because they were divided themselves,"  local PDS party manager Giulio Quercini stated. "This is a  battle we have lost, but which can serve as a lesson to win the  war on 27 March." In the socialist camp, despite the defeat of  candidate Maurizio Pellegrino, there is an air of waiting to  take revenge. "When vetoes and divisions prevail, it is the  right which wins," PSI [Italian Socialist Party] Secretariat  coordinator Enrico Boselli maintained, pleased to be finally in  a position to give a lesson to everyone who did not want the  Socialists to sit at the progressive front's negotiating table.</p>

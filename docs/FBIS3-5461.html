			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpts] The PRC's ship freight volume is expected to  grow to 1.5 billion tons in 10 years. Because China's economic  development is impossible without additional seaports, China has  long envied those on the Korean peninsula. Therefore, it is now  becoming more interested in the Tumen River Development Program.  The land routes of North Korea, barriers to freight  transportation in northeastern Asia, will be opened by Chinese  pressure. As a consequence, the unification of Korea may occur.  Korea should construct many more seaports and meet neighboring  countries' wishes. Korea without numerous seaports is a useless  country.    When one looks at a map of Asia or the world, one can find  something that one may overlook when viewing a map with only the  separated Korean peninsula. This is the geopolitical and  geoeconomic importance of the Korean peninsula. The Yellow Sea  is a huge gulf and a harbor situated in east-northeastern Asia.  The Koreans live on a continental bridge, linking the continent  with the ocean.    The Korean peninsula is what one calls a gateway to the  continent and a base for managing the ocean. It is such an  important region geopolitically that communist and capitalist  powers came into conflict with each other to produce the tragic  38th parallel. [passage omitted]    China relies on coastal transportation to move freight which  exceeds the capacity of its roads and railroads. The total 1992  Chinese freight transportation volume was 650 million tons.  Some 280 million tons, including 4000 tons of transit freight,  were import-export freight and 350 million tons were domestic  coast-to-coast transportation freight.    If Chinese ship freight volume grows at this pace, it will  exceed more than 1.5 billion tons in 10 years. The problem is  that Chinese harbors do not have the capacity to receive that  much freight volume. This is why the Korean peninsula is  regarded as being of great value. Because the waters of the  Chinese harbors are mostly shallow due to the earth and sand  flowing out from the Yellow River, big ships cannot enter and  leave the ports. Therefore, despite 21 open ports, all harbors  except for Dalian, Qinhuangdao, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou  are of little use. [passage omitted]    Of the 1.5 billion tons of ship freight in 10 years, even if  1 billion tons are barely managed at its own harbors, for the  rest of the half billion tons China must get neighboring  countries' harbors (of South Korea, North Korea, Russia, and  Japan). If neighboring countries do not lend harbors (though  this is unlikely), China's economic development can be stopped.  Therefore, China now desperately seeks harbors. As a part of  such efforts, China, after winning over the UNDP, planned the  Tumen River Development Program. [passage omitted]    If this region becomes a free export zone, China will get a  long awaited ice-free port in the Japan Sea. North Korea,  wanting to take this opportunity to acquire foreign currency,  made it clear they would like to take part in the Tumen River  Development Program at the Pyongyang Conference in the springs  of 1992 and 1993. [passage omitted]    On 19 December 1992, China, negotiating directly with  Russia,  leased Zarubino harbor for fifty years. And China agreed to lay  a railroad between Khraskino and Hunchun for Russia and also get  operating rights for seventy years. These events embarrassed  North Korea very much.    Wanting to yield to none, North Korea agreed to lease to  China the eastern Chongjin harbor as well as Rajin and also to  immediately begin improving the railroads and roads between  Hunchun of China and Rajin. Judging from this, the construction  of Fangchuan harbor that China first announced, was nothing but  a rumor. Its real aim might have been a strategy to get the  right to use Chongjin, Rajin, and Zarubino harbors. The reason  China first negotiated with Russia and not North Korea on the  lease of Zarubino harbor was because the stubborn North Korea  dragged the negotiation out for too long and requested the  utility rate of Chongjin harbor at three times more than the  current international price.    As China reached an agreement first with Russia, North  Korea,  in its confusion, made repeated concessions to China's demands,  even sharply cutting the utility rate of the eastern Chongjin  harbor. As of result, North Korea played into China's hands.    Among the three northeastern provinces of China, Liaoning is  the only province with its own harbor. In China every province  is a separate unit and autonomously controls its own economic  activities. Therefore, Heilongjang and Jilin Provinces, which  have no harbors of its own, lease of Dalian or Tianjin harbors  and are often times deprived of priority use of these harbors by  Liaoning Province. For that reason, these two provinces are  enthusiastic about getting the right to use new harbors in the  Japan Sea.    China has to develop and use the Sonbong and Chongjin  harbors  of North Korea as well as Zarubino and Rajin harbors. If China  expands these four harbors, it will be able to transfer 30-50  million tons of freight per year.    The Japanese Government only furnishes funds and then  maneuvers behind the scenes. It lent $50 million to the Maruichi  Company, a private enterprise, and let this company take part in  the development of Zarubino harbor. The Japanese Government  trading with China is creating an opportunity to stimulate the  backward economy of its coastal regions in the Japan Sea.    Giving long-term credit to China matters little to Japan.  The  problem of the northern four islands still remains unsolved  between Japan and Russia. The Japanese Government is not in a  position to take an active part in the development. So it has  let Niigata Province independently participate in the  development program. Only if Japan lets its local government  act independently in the development program, will it bear fewer  funds to support the UNDP. After the development of these  harbors in the Japan Sea is completed, Japan, second to China,  will make a profit on the harbors. It is because most of the  freight in these harbors are transferred to Japan.    Of course, China will be the country receiving the most  benefit. Because of poor ground transportation, China has to pay  a great deal of money and time to transport its freight from  Jinlin and Heilongjang provinces to Guangdong Province in the  south. Because China can save much money and time transporting  its domestic freight through Zarubino harbor, it is likely to  make much use of this harbor in the future. As Seoul is  geographically situated behind Inchun, and Beijing at the rear  of Tianjin, so Hunchun is situated behind Zarubino, Rajin, and  Sonbong. Because Hunchun is likely to grow tremendously in the  future, the foreign enterprises that have applied for investment  in Hunchun already numbers about 260. Of these, about 160  enterprises are South Korean and the rest are Japanese or Hong  Kong among others, they say. Such a trend is expected to  continue to increase hereafter. For a while, the land price of  Hunchun rose as fast as that of Kangnam District, Seoul.  Mongolia, which has no harbor, of course, received the program  with open arms. [passage omitted]    China involved the UNDP and let the Tumen River Development  Program attract international attention. China made the  countries concerned -- China, Russia, North Korea, South Korea,  Mongolia -- agree to jointly manage the golden triangular zone.  Also, China obtained a lease of harbors under a bilateral  agreement to with Russia and began construction work there, and  even obtained harbors in North Korea. We cannot help but praise  China's foresighted scheme and its paving the way for the future.    Hunchun is one of the regions where many Korean people live.  For this reason, South Korean enterprises should make inroads  there. It is obvious that by South Korean enterprises making  inroads into Hunchun would politically be a help to the  unification of Korea, as Hunchun is situated behind North Korea.    Negotiations between North Korea and China which have  carried  on for three years did not yield good results. If China comes to  an agreement through the UNDP, it will readily be able to  acquire development funds from the World Bank and enjoy the  advantage of joint management of the harbors. Therefore, China  will continue to carry on the negotiations through the UNDP.  South Korea could also reduce, through the UNDP, North Korea's  excessive response to its strategy toward the North.    Even if this region is open under a bilateral agreement as  well as an agreement involving the UNDP, South Korea should help  the development program to succeed.    South Korea's strategy should not be one favorable only to  its own land, but one favorable to all of northeastern Asia.  Only if South Korea does so will it win recognition and be held  in high esteem by neighboring countries.    Like many of South Korea's enterprises which make inroads  into Hunchun of China, it should participate in the construction  of Zarubino harbor as a long-term strategy. That will of itself  pave the way for South Korea to take part in the program to  develop North Korea.    Let us return to the main subject. If China's development of  harbors does not make progress as fast as the freight volume  increases, it will utilize Zarubino, Chongjin, Rajin, and  Sonbong harbors for its exports. But it will utilize the South  Korean harbors as the temporary storing places of imported  freight and its dependence on South Korea's harbors will  increase day by day. Accordingly South Korea should invest in  the construction of harbors for not only its own freight but of  all of northeastern Asia. Without its harbors, South Korea will  become a useless country. If South Korea does not construct  many harbors, it will eventually lose its huge interests because  the main marine transportation companies of the world will  utilize Japanese harbors even if they are a little distant.    Because Pusan and Inchun harbors are so saturated, South  Korea is constructing a harbor at Kwangyang Bay. Aside from  these two, some suitable places for harbors are found in the  neighborhood of the South coast including the Kohung Peninsula.  The Kunsan harbor, when newly developed, is expected to possess  great value. The invested capital in the construction of harbors  will be returned in 10-20 years.    In steadily carrying out such public works requiring huge  capital, a provisional organization such as the present social  overhead utility planning team in the Blue House is  insufficient, and instead a special organization such as a  maritime ministry should be set up.    Even if South Korea serves as an intermediate base where we  store some of China's imported freight and transfer it to small  ships, there is also another problem. First of all, the cost of  labor in South Korea is expensive. Although China has 17 harbors  where small ships of less than 10,000 tons can enter, there will  often be times when freight to be shipped off to China piles up  for a long time at our harbors due to China's increasing  domestic ship freight. Loading, unloading, and storing expenses  in such circumstances will become a primary factor in raising  the costs. Therefore China will make efforts to take its freight  as soon as possible in order to save expenses.    There is an only way to settle this problem. North Korea  must  clear the way. China has no choice but to request North Korea  clear the way so that the railroads can be connected from South  Korea's harbors to China.    If freight being imported to the northeastern three  provinces  of China is transported overland via North Korea from South  Korea, much more expenses could be saved. In this case, China  will come to realize North Korea is an obstacle to its economic  development and will command North Korea clear the way.    Since Russia democraticized, North Korea has no ally to turn  to but China. How could North Korea not clear the way? Even for  China's part, it has no choice but to take any measure because  the ups and downs of China's economy depend upon this issue.  Eventually North Korea will come to clear the way as China  demands. Accordingly the interchange between North and South  Koreas will be a mode that freight, truck drivers and train  operators will begin. Once a road is opened up, it will become  wider and more people will pass through day by day.    Before such things happen, North Korea will realize that it  has been driven into a corner, unless it changes. The major  premise of such exchanges is that South Korea must construct  more harbors.    Increasing ship freight, limited harbor capacity, shallow  coastal water and disadvantageous natural surroundings of China  are the primary factors in raising South Korea's land value. If  South Korea constructs more harbors, it will not only increase  its national interests, but will let China demand that North  Korea clear the way, and eventually the roads between the North  and South will be open on their own.

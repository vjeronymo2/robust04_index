			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Observer: Busting out all over Time was when western tourists were apt to return from the Soviet Union feeling literately inferior. Even the most ordinary citizens on public transport and so on could be seen earnestly reading great classical works. While this behaviour was often ascribed to some innate seriousness in the national character, the reason was probably just a lack of what the public really wanted. For, today, Pushkin et al have been given the push in favour of thrillers, especially the erotic kind. Whereas the Soviet culture used to be puritanical, and even faintly naughty films and books were banned, sex is now busting out all over. For instance, perhaps feeling upstaged by a 'Miss Big Bust' competition held in Estonia's capital Tallinn, Moscow's sex-maniacs are showing their mettle with an 'erotic dance competition' to be held this weekend at the Ismailovo Sports Centre. Nevertheless, the organisers, a body called 'Culture and Health', insist that the prizes on offer will be awarded for artistic merit, not simply 'vulgar display'. Moreover, they're taking pains to keep libidos from boiling over. Their plan is to break up the erotic dancing with interludes featuring well known pop-stars - which, however strongly it testifies to the organisers' social responsibility, does not say much for Russian pop.</p>

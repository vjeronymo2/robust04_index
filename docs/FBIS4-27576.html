			<p>BFN     [Text] Chinhae, South Korea, May 28 (YONHAP) -- South  Korea's two escort destroyers left Chinhae Port Saturday morning  to participate in multinational maritime maneuvers held in the  mid-western Pacific Ocean.    The "Chongju-ham" and "Pusan-ham" are scheduled to hold  anti-submarine and logistics exercises jointly with U.S. Naval  elements in the East Sea until May 30, then head for the sea  near Hawaii to conduct various maneuvers with units from other  Pacific Rim countries until July 16.    "Rimpac 94" (Rim Pacific Exercise), drawing the  participation  of South Korea, the United States, Australia, Canada and Japan,  is designed to secure major maritime transportation routes in  the Pacific Ocean and promote the combined operational  capabilities and cooperation of Pacific rim countries.    The exercises will cover mobile offensive-defensive battle,  command-control-communication, and anti-aircraft, anti-submarine  and electronic warfares, and ship-to-ship and ship-to-air  firing, and torpedo and missile firing.    About 60 military vessels including two aircraft carriers,  over 200 aircraft and a 25,000-strong naval force are expected  to participate in the biennial exercise, which was inaugurated  in 1971. It is the third time for South Korea to participate in  the maneuvers since 1990, when it first took part.    By joining in the exercise, the South Korean Navy is  expected  to promote military exchanges with the navies of Pacific rim  countries as well as learn advanced naval strategy and tactics.</p>

At the press conference, Miletic accused the Macedonian  authorities of lying to the Serbs and Montenegrins in Macedonia,  for the past three years, that they will be "returned" in the  Constitution. The party's vice president Stojan Trajkovic  announced that the Serbs will boycott the forthcoming census in  Macedonia, unless two census lists and the participation of  representatives of the Serbian people, in the census  commissions, is provided.</p>

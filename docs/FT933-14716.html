			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / No takers for the available tickets: The government has so far failed to attract private finance for public sector projects The involvement of private capital in public sector projects could harness government and business together to build a new prosperity across Britain, Mr John Major told a Confederation of British Industry conference in May. The prime minister was referring to the private finance initiative launched in last year's Autumn Statement, to encourage the use of private investment for public projects. Mr Norman Lamont, the then chancellor, said the initiative would mobilise the private sector 'to meet needs which have traditionally been met only by the public sector'. Yet eight months after the Autumn Statement, the government has yet to announce a significant new public sector project which involves private finance. There is disenchantment among industrialists and financiers, who fear the initiative will run out of steam unless there is some early progress. The Autumn Statement promised several measures to encourage greater use of private finance for public projects: Joint ventures between the private and public sector were to be encouraged, with the government offering concessionary loans, equity participation and transfer of assets. The Treasury would relax its accounting rules for leasing to allow greater use of long-term leases. The private sector could then lease expensive equipment to the health service, for example. Financially free-standing projects that could cover costs by charging users would be allowed, even though they could in theory be financed more cheaply in the public sector. (In most cases, such projects would, in practice, be unlikely to go ahead because of Treasury restrictions on public borrowing.) There have been attempts to present projects such as the Heathrow Express rail link as evidence of a new partnership between public and private sector. However, this joint venture between the British Airports Authority and British Rail was first mooted in 1988, long before last year's Autumn Statement. The environment department's contribution to the private finance initiative has been to publish a list of urban development schemes seeking private sector partners. These are similar to dozens of other inner-city regeneration schemes in which public sector funds are used to prime the pump for private sector development. Building business parks and housing estates is hardly meeting 'needs which have traditionally been met only by the public sector'. And the Department of Health has relaxed the rules on leasing capital equipment in the health service. But requirements that the Treasury scrutinise half of all leases worth between Pounds 1m and Pounds 10m leave the rules too inflexible to attract the private sector, according to Mr Peter Jacobs, chief executive of Bupa, Britain's biggest private healthcare group. The initiative is likely to collapse 'if the private sector keeps facing blockages', Mr Jacobs warns. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI, said recently the whole initiative would be discredited 'unless real holes can be dug in the ground pretty soon'. Business people interested in the initiative complain that the Treasury is itself uncertain about the sort of contribution the private sector could make. According to one banker who has been involved in several infrastructure projects: 'The government does not understand how the private sector operates, what it's looking for in an investment project and how to attract investors.' An executive involved in the leasing business says that 'the Treasury still has a lot to learn. Its paper on leasing and risk transfer showed that they do not understand how the industry works.' The transfer of risk from the public to private sectors has been at the heart of the difficulties in making the private finance initiative work. The Treasury insists that a private sector company which builds a toll bridge, for example, must bear the risk that tolls might be insufficient to cover the costs. If the government accepts responsibility for bailing out the company, the project counts as public expenditure under UK public accounting rules. The Treasury's main - and understandable - concern is that raising private finance to fund public expenditure should not be a form of additional government borrowing. The Treasury accepts that there should be some sharing of risk in joint ventures. Its guidance for departments says that the legal agreements should set out in 'specific and clear terms . . . so that the risk which each party undertakes properly reflects a clearly agreed structure of risk and reward'. But the more the risk is transferred out of the public sector, the higher the return the private sector expects to earn. Keen though it is to see the initiative succeed, the Treasury is uncomfortable with the idea of putting sufficient public money into joint ventures to allow the private sector partner to earn a return on capital of 20 per cent or more. There are also disagreements over what sort of risks it is fair to transfer to the private sector. The Treasury expects government departments to demand the maximum transfer of risk to private sector partners: the partners are concerned to minimise the risk as far as possible to those factors under their control. In transport projects, for example, the private sector should be expected to take risks associated with design efficiency, cost and time overruns during the construction phase, and the efficiency of operations, according to Mr Peter Foy, senior partner at McKinsey, the management consultants. In his role as chairman of the transport group of London First, a business organisation set up to tackle London's problems, Mr Foy has identified a number of risks that the group believes the government needs to assume in joint transport ventures. These include responsibility for losses caused by planning delays, changes in design of the project imposed by public bodies and delays in getting legislative approval. 'Taking responsibility for these types of risk, which are clearly not within the control of the private sector, would be unacceptable to shareholders,' he says. In between these two extremes lie grey areas, says Mr Foy, where the government needs to help private sector operators manage revenue risks, perhaps by guaranteeing a minimum income (and maybe sharing in excess profits). It is in such areas that the greatest difficulties have been encountered in forming joint ventures in which the Treasury can be satisfied that risk has been substantially transferred to the private sector. A second significant obstacle to private and public sector partnerships is the Treasury requirement for competition for public sector contracts. This is a long-standing requirement in public sector contracts as a means of ensuring value for money, and fair competition. However, the requirement can be a disincentive to companies coming up with new or innovative proposals which, once adopted, must then go out to competitive tender for implementation. A company which invests its own money in devising a project could then find that a competitor wins the contract to build it. The government has promised to look into the intellectual property rights of project proposals, so that the companies which develop them can be paid for their efforts. A better solution, according to one banker who is keen to participate in joint ventures, would be for the government to make early progress on creating a stream of joint projects which the private sector can bid for. 'If there are several similar projects coming up, companies will be prepared to invest in a bid on the basis that they will win a contract sooner or later,' he says. 'But with one-offs or occasional contracts, they are less willing to risk their capital.' And that is the nub of the government's problem in convincing the private sector that it is serious about the private finance initiative. Unless it can launch some joint venture projects soon, private partners will become increasingly sceptical about its intentions. Dispelling the growing scepticism requires early progress if the initiative is to succeed.</p>

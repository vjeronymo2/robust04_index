			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Thyssen plans multi-currency DM1bn CP THYSSEN, the large German steel and engineering combine, is issuing a multi-currency DM1bn commercial paper programme, Commerzbank said, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. The programme envisages drawdowns of up to DM1bn, or the equivalent in any other currency, as long as there are no restrictions imposed by the relevant central bank or other authorities. Commerzbank said the funds raised would help cover operating costs. Royal Bank of Scotland has had its long-term rating downgraded by IBCA, the European-based credit-rating agency. The rating has been lowered from AA to AA- because of 'the continuing pressure on earnings and the decline in asset quality' resulting from the slump in the UK economy.</p>

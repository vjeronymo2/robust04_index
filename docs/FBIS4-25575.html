			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yin Hongzhu (1438 7703 4376)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 11 Jun (XINHUA) -- A recent survey by the  State Education Commission's relevant department shows that  today's college students positively support the policy of reform  and opening up and hope that the establishment of a socialist  market economic system is accelerated; they have a strong sense  of participation and study hard in schools; and endeavoring to  become a useful person has become the order of the day.    The survey was conducted simultaneously in 57 schools of  higher learning in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hubei, Guangdong,  and Shaanxi. A total of 14,500 questionnaires were passed out  and some 1,360 college students were interviewed and surveyed  [figures as received].    The results of the survey show that college students  positively support reform and opening up, and are heartened by  the remarkable changes in various aspects of the national life  since the reform and opening up policy was implemented. Ninety  percent of the students believe that reform and opening up have  "enhanced the comprehensive national strength," "raised the  people's living standards," "emancipated productive forces," and  "ushered in the best era in political and economic development  since the founding of the PRC." Nearly one-half of the students  deem that the government's measures to "respect teachers,  emphasize education, and improve the condition of intellectuals"  have yielded some results.    Students are generally optimistic about the future of  socialist market economic system, and they have a better  understanding of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics. The majority of students believe  that China will "certainly succeed" or "encounter some twists  and turns but will ultimately succeed" in establishing a  socialist market economic system. Of the major events of  interest to the students over the past year, a considerable  number of them show an interest in the publication of Volume 3  of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. They believe  that Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics is "Marxism of contemporary China" and "a  relatively systematic theory."    Steady progress in the establishment of a socialist market  economic system has sparked the students' enthusiasm to study.  Compared with two years ago, they have a greater initiative and  are more conscientious in study. Eighty-five percent of them  say they are "more anxious than before to learn some practical  knowledge." Today, the heated discussion on "going into  business" among college students has cooled down, while the  number of college graduates applying for postgraduate schools is  on the rise. Most students, guided by society's demand,  voluntarily adjust their subject of study in a bid to improve  their qualification.    What are the outlook on life and value concepts among  college  students today? The survey shows that the mainstream of  students tends to have a forward-looking and noble-minded  personality. They take "ideals," "conviction," "knowledge,"  "friendship," and "justice" as their dictums and pledge to "work  hard and in a pioneering spirit in all circumstances," and to  "subordinate individual interests to national and collective  interests."    During interviews and surveys, college students show a great  interest in some major domestic and international issues. They  are discontent with the "West's interference in China under the  pretext of human rights issue" and hope that earnest efforts be  made to correct unhealthy practices and eliminate corruption in  the party and society. As far as Chinese education is  concerned, they hope that the educational reform be accelerated;  they are heartened by the importance attached to education by  the party Central Committee, the State Council, and the entire  society. It is understood that many of their constructive  suggestions have been included in the agenda of educational  departments and school administrators at various levels.</p>

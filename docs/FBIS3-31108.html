			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This morning is marked by persistent Chetnik  provocations along some defense lines of Sarajevo --  particularly the area of Sokolje, which early this morning was  exposed to fire from a death sower [M-84 machine gun] from the  direction of Rajlovac. The same area was shelled by 60-mm  mortars and later came under antiaircraft-gun fire.    Meanwhile, the Chetniks from (Lemizovo Brdo) were hurling  grenades at the area of Izvor.    Chetnik snipers have also been used this morning; the one on  Spicasta Stijena has been particularly active. Citizens are  warned to be cautious if they must move around the city.    The Chetniks have not only violated the cease-fire this  morning but have also been seen openly reinforcing their  positions on several locations from where they can attack the  city.</p>

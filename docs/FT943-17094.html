			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Ireland sees faster growth The Irish government has upgraded its economic growth forecast by half a percentage point to 4 per cent per annum for 1994-96, in a report to the monetary committee of the European Commission. The report, 'Ireland's Convergence Programme 1994-96', says Ireland 'remains firmly committed' to the convergence criteria for European monetary union. The government budget deficit will remain below 3 per cent of gross domestic product, and the debt/GDP ratio will fall at an average annual rate of 3-4 percentage points of GDP over the next three years, it says. Inflation is targeted at an average 2.5 per cent per annum.</p>

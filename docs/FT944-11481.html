			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Daughter's sorry tale My daughter foolishly let a business associate (now under police investigation for fraud and deception) know the number and PIN of her Barclaycard. Large sums then were debited to her account by him. Her initial credit limit was Pounds 3,000 but now she is being chased by Barclaycard for Pounds 25,000. Can she refuse to pay beyond the agreed limit? When applying for a Barclaycard, one contracts specifically not to reveal its details to anyone else. Undoubtedly, Barclaycard will rely on the contributory negligence of your daughter to pursue her for the debt. This sorry tale obviously is very complicated. We suggest you contact a solicitor to explore your daughter's situation in detail. The Consumers Association (at 2 Marylebone Road, London NW1 4DF, tel: 071-486 5544) might be able to steer you in the direction of an appropriate lawyer. (Murray Johnstone Personal Asset Management).

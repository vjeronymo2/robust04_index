			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat will not request a U.S. visa in order to address an  Arab-American group and will visit the United States only if he gets an  official invitation from Washington, an aide announced in Cairo. Abdeen Jabara,  president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said earlier this  month that the group had invited Arafat to speak at its April meeting and he  had accepted. But Nabil Shaath, a top political adviser to the Palestine  Liberation Organization leader, announced that Arafat "will not go on an  invitation from an unofficial group." Shaath did not explain why Arafat changed  his mind.  </P></p>

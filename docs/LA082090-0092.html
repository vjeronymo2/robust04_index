			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE INLAND EMPIRE OF THE MOSQUITO;  </P> <P> ERADICATION: CORONA AND NORCO OFFICIALS ARE MOBILIZING ONE OF THE BIGGEST  ASSAULTS AGAINST THE WINGED INSECTS IN YEARS. THERE ARE FEARS THAT THE PESTS  MAY ULTIMATELY PASS ON VIRAL DISEASES.  </P> <P> In summers past, Dee Edling has cooled off each evening in her back yard and  watched the sun set over the Santa Ana River.  </P> <P> Not this year. Not as long as the mosquitoes are around.  </P> <P> "I've just been covered," Edling said. "I go outside and just get eaten alive."  </P> <P> Even with the drought drying up some potential mosquito breeding grounds, Norco  and Corona officials are mobilizing their biggest assault on mosquitoes in at  least six years.  </P> <P> "I don't let the kids go out after sunset," Edling said. "And sometimes  (mosquitoes) get inside, and I have to get up and spray the house."  </P> <P> Councilman Steve Nathan, who has lived in Norco for 22 years, says the  infestation is "the worst we've seen it."  </P> <P> The most dramatic sign of the mosquito problem came during the last week in  July, when the average number of mosquitoes found in mosquito traps climbed  from 125 to 379, said Dr. Major Dhillon, an entomologist with the Northwest  Mosquito Abatement District. Normally, only about 100 would be found in Norco  traps at this time of the year, he said.  </P> <P> In the Greenbriar section of Corona, as many as 800 mosquitoes were found in  each trap, Dhillon said, up from an expected 500.  </P> <P> These mosquitoes, the Culex tarsalis and the Culex quinquefasciatus, or quinqs,  generally breed in stagnant water along the river and bite at night, Dhillon  said. He has been monitoring the population by setting about 45 traps a week.  The traps include several pounds of dry ice, which serve as a lure by giving  off carbon dioxide.  </P> <P> "That's how the mosquitoes find their host 'blood meal,' " Dhillon said. "They  sense that it is a little bird or animal."  </P> <P> So far, the cause of the mosquito outbreak is a mystery. Some officials point  to the hotter and more humid weather, which provides prime conditions for  breeding. Although there has been a drought, water collects when residents  water their lawns or wash their cars.  </P> <P> In Norco and Corona, the mosquito abatement district has had trouble getting to  some breeding grounds, including jungle-like areas along the Santa Ana River  and small duck ponds, exacerbating the problem, Dhillon said.  </P> <P> "I wish I could say that the drought has brought the population down, but I  can't," said Lino Luna, the manager of the district. "We still have water and  that's where mosquitoes will go. A lot of the problems are man-made."  </P> <P> The assault on the mosquito is being waged on two fronts. For the first time in  half a dozen years, officials have taken to the air and doused about 500 acres  along the Santa Ana River, including the bluffs area of Norco and the  Greenbriar section of Corona, with a pesticide called Bti, a bacterial agent  that attacks mosquito larvae but is harmless to humans and other animals.  </P> <P> The pesticide was sprayed once in May and once last week, Dhillon said.  </P> <P> Even more concentrated efforts to control the mosquitoes are being made at  about a dozen dairy farms north and west of Norco. There, district officials  fear that a different type of mosquito, the Aedes dorsalis, will get out of  control. This so-called "dirty water" mosquito can begin breeding in mud  deposits, which are common on dairy farms.  </P> <P> Up until last summer, the Aedes mosquito was seldom found in the district,  Dhillon said. This year's discovery is worrisome because the Aedes can grow  into adulthood in about four days, a much shorter maturing time than for other  mosquitoes. Even more troublesome, they bite during the day and their eggs can  lay dormant for as long as 10 years before hatching, Dhillon said.  </P> <P> Crews are now checking some dairies twice a week and ground-spraying the areas  every seven days, he said.  </P> <P> "We cannot tolerate even one of those mosquitoes," Dhillon said. "If we didn't  control it this year, it would be a real big problem."  </P> <P> In Orange County, Vector Control District officials are concerned about the  threat of an outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis, a viral disease carried by the  mosquito that can be transmitted to birds and humans. The virus can cause  headaches, flu-like symptoms and, in extreme cases, coma and death.  </P> <P> In July, 19 of 293 birds caught in about a dozen traps throughout Orange County  tested positive for the virus, a number 10 to 20 times higher than in recent  summers, said Vector Control biologist Jim Webb. Fifteen of the birds that  tested positive were trapped in Huntington Beach, he said.  </P> <P> So far, four people in Orange County are being tested by state health officials  for the virus, Webb said. In addition, a Moreno Valley man, who is an  electrician at Disneyland, is suspected of contracting the virus.  </P> <P> "It's still debatable whether he got it at Disneyland or in Moreno Valley,"  Webb said. "He said that he sometimes sleeps outside on hot evenings."  </P> <P> Samples were taken of birds at Disneyland, and four of 140 birds, or about 3%,  tested positive for encephalitis, he said.  </P> <P> No cases have been reported in the northwest district of Riverside County,  Dhillon said.  </P></p>

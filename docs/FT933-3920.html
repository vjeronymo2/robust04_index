			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Cadbury unmoved Good results and a cash call from Cadbury Schweppes left the shares steady at 470p but the market deeply divided over the confectionery group's prospects. Cadbury intends to use the bulk of the Pounds 324m to be raised by the rights issue to buy A &amp; W Brands, a soft drinks manufacturer in the US, a move which complements the group's interest in Dr Pepper, in which it recently took a 26 per cent stake. While analysts were united in the view that Cadbury will take full control of Dr Pepper in the near future, thus becoming the third largest drinks group in the US, they disagreed over the logic of the group's strategy. Mr Carl Short at Strauss Turnbull said that even should Cadbury persuade Dr Pepper on the merits of a takeover, a move which would involve it having to tap shareholders for even more funds, it would still have to battle for market share against the market leaders, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. However, Mr Tim Potter at Smith New Court said the Cadbury strategy was 'entirely sensible' and that the company was accustomed to competitive environments the world over. 'Cadbury Schweppes represents one of the best long-term investments in an otherwise dull sector,' he said.</p>

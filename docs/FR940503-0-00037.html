			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Three trade associations, two manufacturers, a Government agency, an accreditation organization and a consultant each commented on the need for more specifics regarding international trade, international recognition of testing and calibration data, and memoranda of understanding (MOUs) and mutual recognition agreements. Most letters contained some reference to these issues, either pointing out the need for explicit language recognizing international trade interests such as ``reduction of non-tariff barriers''; working to ``make the program more acceptable nationally and internationally''; stating that ``it is of great interest to U.S. manufacturers to have U.S./EC recognized accreditation for testing to European specifications''; and identifying the need to ``promote the acceptance of calibration and testing results between countries to encourage international trade''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comment was also made that the NVLAP revision should state that inquiries from other countries regarding memoranda of understandings (MOUs) and mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) will be referred to the appropriate U.S. agency to participate in any detailed negotiations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Other than a general statement, the proposed regulation did not specifically deal with these concerns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One consultant suggested changing &sect;285.22 Assessing and evaluating a laboratory to eliminate the suggestion that NVLAP provides consulting or legal services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Regarding consulting services, communications with laboratories are in the context of these procedures, none of which provide for consulting services. NVLAP identifies the deficiencies noted; it is the responsibility of the laboratory, not NVLAP, to determine how deficiencies will be rectified. Regarding legal services, NVLAP provides guidance to the accredited laboratories on the conditions for referencing accredited status; this is procedural, not legal advice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One consultant suggested that NVLAP expand and elaborate &sect;285.3 Description and goal of NVLAP to include additional information explaining methods for achieving the various objectives and goals in the section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The language in this section clearly defines the goals and objectives of NVLAP. Methods for achieving these goals and objectives are already contained in many other publications, including NIST administrative procedures and various NVLAP programmatic documents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One trade association and one consultant suggested that NVLAP reword &sect;285.8 Referencing NVLAP accreditation, to remove the implication that laboratories must advertise accredited status, etc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 285.8(a) has been revised to make clear that advertising is voluntary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One accreditation organization suggested that NVLAP should not make any changes to &sect;285.33 Criteria for accreditation in response to comments received as a result of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice because it is important that the NVLAP regulation remain compatible with the ISO Guide 25. It was recommended that such changes should be compiled for use in discussions at upcoming ISO meetings related to changing ISO Guide 25. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NVLAP agrees, and is doing this. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One accreditation organization suggested that ASTM Standard E 1301 should be referenced instead of ISO Guide 38, which is ``no longer a viable standard''; ISO Guide 43 should not be referenced because it is very general and being revised. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Guides 38 and 43 served as reference to ensure that the NVLAP procedures meet all current international requirements. In fact, the NVLAP procedures are more robust than the procedures contained in either Guide 38 or Guide 43. NVLAP is committed to meeting international requirements for laboratory accreditation, therefore we reference the ISO guides and standards. We also know that ISO ``equivalents'' are published by other standards bodies. However, we do not plan to invest time in evaluating the equivalence of these standards in order to reference them in our procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One accreditation organization suggested that the reference to ISO Series 9000 documents in &sect;285.4 References might imply that NVLAP accreditation also conveys ISO 9000 registration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Reference to the ISO Series 9000 does not imply that NVLAP is an ISO 9000 registrar. However, NVLAP accepts the statement in ISO Guide 25 that ``laboratories meeting the requirements of the Guide comply with the relevant requirements of the ISO 9000 series of standards including those of the model described in ISO 9002''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One consultant suggested deleting reference to ISO 9004 because it is intended only as a guideline document for use by operators of quality management systems and not for regulatory adoption or referencing as being compatible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The entire ISO Series is referenced because of the strong relationship of this series with the quality systems criteria of ISO Guide 25. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because (1) participation in NVLAP is entirely voluntary, and (2) the changes are primarily administrative, affecting the management of the program rather than laboratories seeking or holding accreditation. Further, the technical components of NVLAP, that is, the specific technical criteria that individual laboratories are accredited against, are not changed in any significant way by this proposal. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

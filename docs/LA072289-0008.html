			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SYMBOLIC EXPRESSIONS: SHOULD CONFEDERATE FLAG BE BANNED?  </P> <P> Raskin failed to recall that the name of the country the Confederate flag flew  over was the Confederate States of America. If he would ban its use, would he  also ban the flags of all other republics that were in this country that are in  use today, including the state flags of California and Texas? Also the flag he  refers to was never the national flag of the Confederacy but only a banner  flown on the field of battle.  </P> <P> As to the reference of it representing a burning American flag, that is absurd;  it is a St. Andrew's cross with 13 stars representing the states of its nation.  </P> <P> Raskin's statement about armed rebellion and treason is incorrect; the states  simply seceded, as was their right at the time, and were forced to defend that  right and defend their homeland.  </P> <P> Raskin's attempt to perpetuate the myth that the Confederate states fought for  slavery is an injustice coming from a man with his knowledge of the law. The  Confederacy fought for the right of the states to govern themselves, as the  Supreme Court has ruled in many cases.  </P> <P> Raskin also forgets that many of the leaders of that short-lived nation went on  to serve the reunited country as senators, congressmen and even on the Supreme  Court.  </P> <P> It is because of rash statements such as Raskin's that this flag is misused by  bigots and misguided radicals, and wrongly thought to represent slavery by  many, when in fact it represents freedom, pride, and our right to defend that  freedom.  </P> <P> CHARLES S.

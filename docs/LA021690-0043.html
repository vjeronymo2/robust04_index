			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> BLOMSTEDT IN PROGRAM OF SECOND SYMPHONIES  </P> <P> Herbert Blomstedt is not a star conductor, and the San Francisco Symphony,  Blomstedt's orchestra for the last five years, is not a virtuoso ensemble.  </P> <P> But Tuesday night in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at its third Southland  appearance in three days, the San Franciscans shone.  </P> <P> What could have been an ordinary symphonic concert became a special occasion,  through superior music making alone. Beethoven's "Leonore" Overture No. 2, not  always a thriller, made a terrific impact. And second-level works by Roger  Sessions and Tchaikovsky showed their more impressive facets. One left the  Music Center uplifted.  </P> <P> The American-born Swedish conductor accomplished these feats simply and  modestly. His long association with the orchestra has resulted in solidity and  single-mindedness in its playing. There seems to be a trust and mutual respect  between players and podium that bridges any technical or mechanical gaps in the  ensemble's execution.  </P> <P> Then there is the apprehendable musicality of Blomstedt's view of these works  -- in addition to the overture, the second symphonies of Sessions and  Tchaikovsky. He projected logic, motivation, emotional balance and continuity  through both readings, which offered flow and contrast and telling details.  </P> <P> The deepest probing is not this conductor's style; Blomstedt does not grab the  listener by the ear and force him to feel. His performances do not reek of  sweat, tears and compulsion. But they are eminently listenable, and usually  admirable.  </P> <P> Beethoven's Second "Leonore" opened this program authoritatively, in wondrous  instrumental transparency. Sessions' enigmatic Second -- even after 43 years  (this ensemble introduced the work in 1947), the work does not give up its  mysteries easily -- moved along in its earnestly light-footed and brainy way.  </P> <P> And Tchaikovsky's cherishable "Little Russian" Symphony, less than crisply  articulated and in moments lacking that choral weight we associate with most  American orchestras, nevertheless exerted its charms in a jaunty, if not always  touching, reading.

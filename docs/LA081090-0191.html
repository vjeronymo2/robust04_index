			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAYLOR G. BELCHER; EX-AMBASSADOR  </P> <P> Taylor Garrison Belcher, a career Foreign Service officer who was U.S.  ambassador to Cyprus and Peru in the 1960s and '70s, has died of cancer at a  hospital here.  </P> <P> Belcher, who retired in 1974 to nearby Garrison, N.Y., was 70 when he died  Monday.  </P> <P> Belcher was a veteran of State Department service and stationed in Cyprus when  President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 appointed him envoy to that then-divided  nation following the eruption of violence between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.  Earlier, he had been consul in Nicosia in 1957 and counsel general a year  later, remaining there until 1960. He had returned as an untitled Foreign  Service officer until his appointment.  </P> <P> As ambassador, Belcher -- a quiet mediator -- was credited with helping break  the centuries-old pattern of violence between the Greek majority and Turk  minority.  </P> <P> In 1969 he left Cyprus for Lima, where he helped shape an agreement that  resolved a lengthy dispute over compensation for expropriated American  properties seized after a military coup.  </P> <P> After retirement, Belcher returned to Upstate New York, where his family had  been members of the original settlement of Garrison-on-Hudson, operating a  ferry service to West Point.  </P></p>

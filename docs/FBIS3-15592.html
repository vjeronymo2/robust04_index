			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Adolfas Slezevicius, Lithuanian prime minister </F> and LDDP chairman: "Stability, Social Market, Patient Work"]    [Text]  <H5>  1. Instead of Introduction </H5>   The government formed by the Lithuanian Democratic Labor  Party [LDDP] has not yet worked a full year (the government  program was approved by the Seimas [parliament] on 31 March  1993). Its activities could be most briefly characterized by  the fact that the integral inflation rate has been 93 percent  since the day the government began its work. Compared with  former governments (the total sum of inflation rate over the  three years exceeded 6,500 percent), this indicator  implies the beginning of a stabilization of the economic  crisis. If we also added the obvious facts that last year,  the growth in pensions, social benefits, and salaries of  employees at budget-financed offices exceeded the rate of  inflation, that is, a real 12.7-percent increase in people's  living standards occurred for the first time after the  declaration of independence, the statements about stabilization,  for which I am often criticized, would not be worth arguing.    I understand those people, each separate person, with whom I  meet in various regions, villages, and towns of Lithuania every  week, that not all of them have felt a slight economic  improvement. The condition of each community member does not  depend on government policy alone. Their personal abilities are  no less important. However, the government must see general  tendencies and direct its policies along these lines. I have  never refused to assist anyone, any countryman in trouble,  certainly, within my possibilities.    However, I cannot understand those who are violently  attacking the formulation of stabilization -- is striving for  stabilization useless for Lithuania? Can anyone offer something  else instead?    It is particularly difficult to understand those opponents  who, being in the former legislature and government, ruined the  country by ill-considered reform and failed to predict its  effects. By the way, I suppose that radicalism is typical of  the opponents also because the latter failed to understand the  results.    Having won the elections, the LDDP did not intend to "settle  scores" with the former government. Last year, we limited  ourselves to naming the "heroes and authors" of reform.  However, their current desire to cast off historical  responsibility for the nation, demagogy, and even the  instigation of social conflicts force me to briefly return to  the legacy we inherited.   <H5>    II. What Did the LDDP Government Inherit? </H5>   A short reply would be the following: Enormous inflation, a  budget deficit, great social problems, and state debts; as well  as fake money, disrupted settlements among economic entities, an  open gate to organized crime and corruption, and a demoralized  Interior Ministry system. I will not expand on society's  spiritual losses inflicted by the opposition policy of the  former government. They cannot be measured in terms of percent.    In the life of every family or individual this manifested  itself not only as the shortage of heating or hot water,  continuous price rises, the total devaluation of savings with  trust in the promises of [former Prime Minister] G. Vagnorius,  the chaos in agriculture, tenants' fear of being evicted from  apartments, but also as false hopes and misleading illusions.  The large credit of human trust in reform was wasted.    I must speak about all this because the opposition cannot  realize its true obligation and tries to blame the economic  crisis on our government, at the same time ruining our attempts  to stabilize the economic situation. Let us recall how during  the elections people demanded punishment of the real destroyers  of the economy. Certainly, if we launch the tradition of  "squaring accounts" with former governments, we will never have  concord or a natural change of power in Lithuania, as well as a  normal state development.   <H3>    III. What Did We Manage To Accomplish In Less Than a  Year? </H3>   I think that the government will summarize the results of  its  activities and present them to the public after its full year in  office. By doing this we, like the president, will establish a  tradition of assessing the road covered and reporting back to  the voters (we remember that this is what we lacked; this was  also one of the key reasons for the collapse of the former  policy). A constant self-critical assessment of one's policy  alone can ensure progress and correct decisions.    The LDDP government, like its former counterparts, has  worked  according to the program approved in the Seimas. Thus far,  however, our government has been the first and the only one to  prepare a plan of definite action for the implementation of the  government program (it was approved at the government meeting on  30 June 1992 with the participation of chairmen from the Seimas  committees). The government program would be left hanging in  the air without such a plan, as was the case with former  governments. As leader of the government, I maintain that the  key goals of this plan have already been achieved, and part of  the draft laws have already been submitted to the Seimas.    We remember the successful introduction of the national  currency, the essential breakthrough in liberalizing foreign  trade, and the preparation of a national program for  agriculture. I think that the draft law on land currently being  debated in the Seimas should become another serious impulse for  land reform, which has the most problems. The free ownership of  land will not only make agriculture private but will also allow  small farmers to cooperate and the successful ones to grow  larger.    In my opinion, we are often groundlessly criticized for the  absence of concepts or plans. This is either poor information  or a superficial attitude. Apart from the agricultural program,  we have also drafted programs for the national systems of  energy, transportation, and communications. Last week, the  government approved the program of industrial restructuring,  although this might have been slightly delayed. It is known,  however, that our government did not take over any more serious  achievements in this sphere from its predecessors.    One could draw the conclusion that the government is aware  of  the perspective and knows what it wants, where it is going, and  what the results of such activities can be. In short, the  government has created a programmatic and conceptual basis for  its activities in all industries and spheres of social life.  The government has also submitted several draft laws on law  enforcement to the Seimas. They should make our state  management considerably more efficient and strengthen law and  order, which are indispensable in any state's life.    Since the very first days of our activities, we have focused  on the execution of the budget. Having started the previous  year with a 52-million litai [Lt] deficit, we finished it with a  favorable balance of Lt65 million. This allowed the government  to review (increase) wages and pensions nine times. The  government assigned Lt343 million of budget revenues for this  purpose, including Lt52 million for the indexation of  inhabitants' savings, Lt96 million for self-governments, and so  on.    Certainly, it is necessary to upgrade the tax system, to  impose more reasonable taxes on profitable businesses, and exact  hidden taxes, which we partially managed to achieve last year  (almost Lt100 million was exacted). It is very important that  the Seimas adopted the 1994 budget at the end of the last year,  that is, before the beginning of the fiscal year. This is also  an indicator of a more stable functioning of the state and the  economy.    I would like to stress once again that the 1994 budget  is much more socially oriented than all previous budgets  since the declaration of independence. Both our social  democrats and other opponents often claim incorrectly that the  LDDP government allegedly does not pursue a social democratic  policy. However, the larger part of the 1994 budget, that is,  59 percent have been earmarked for social security. This growth  is particularly noticeable in such areas as, for example,  science -- 208 percent, education -- 175 percent, health care --  183 percent, and others. Thus, the facts are totally different  -- the government policy is directed toward allaying the costs  of reform for residents. This is being accomplished through  monthly increases in social benefits and payments according to  possibilities rather than through words or promises of a  "bright" future.   <H5>    IV. "Debts," Investments, and Perspective </H5>   There has been much talk about the "dimensions of the debt":  Lithuania is head over heels in debt, its residents'  "grandchildren will fail to repay these debts," and so on. What  is the actual situation? Lithuania's average current debt is  $160 per capita, $90 of which have already been used. The  current government was forced to take out large loans for energy  because it had inherited $86 million of debts and $25 million of  fines for gas, to say nothing of the absence of any working  capital in the energy system. I would like to stress as the  same time that the pure hard currency reserve at the Lithuanian  Bank has climbed by 2.8 times since March 1993 and is now $261  million, which is equivalent to the amount of utilized foreign  credits. Thus, what debt are we talking about?! We must  clearly understand that there cannot be any economic  reform without investment and credit resources. It is only  this that can help us achieve the vital breakthrough in the  policy of economic restructuring. Incidentally, our agreements  with the IMF were concluded for a period of 18 months. A  program for another three years that is being drafted now  projects five credit lines in restructuring different  industries. These are agriculture, social programs, the  restructuring of banks, and energy.    It is evident that we must spend increasingly more credit  reserves on expanding investments. This task has been put  forward and its is being implemented in practice. In  cooperation with various global financial organizations, we are  preparing changes in the acquisition, utilization, and repayment  of credits, and in the organization structure of accounts. This  will allow a more rational utilization of credit resources.  Moreover, the fact that an increasingly larger part of loans  goes to investments through commercial banks is also very  important. Large-scale credit resources and economic  restructuring create more favorable conditions for promoting  investments.    Out of Lithuania's current 3,467 joint ventures, 768 work on  foreign capital alone! The emergence of such ventures has  become very dynamic recently. The total amount of investments  in all joint ventures accounts for more than 85 percent. The  current sum of investments is $200 million. As I have already  mentioned, the system of acquiring and utilizing credits is  being upgraded. A very important document, that will soon be  submitted to the Seimas, is a new draft law on foreign  investments. This law should be more efficient in promoting  investments and introducing equal conditions for foreign and  local investors. We have set up the Lithuanian Development Bank  -- an important institution for receiving and promoting  investments, and the Investment Agency.    We hope that this year we will invest about $150-200 million  or almost Lt600-800 million into the economy through various  forms, state guarantees, the direct state debt, various  commercial credits, and the joint effort of local investors.  These investments and the general changes in the economic  restructuring allow quite dynamic adjustments in the structure  of exports and imports, although Russia remains our chief  partner in purchasing resources. If we consider our exports to  the West, however, in 1993 it accounted for almost 40 percent  (against the meager 15 percent in 1991). It is extremely  important that such economically powerful states as Germany,  Belgium, and the Scandinavian countries become our principal  partners. Certainly, these processes must be encouraged in  every possible way, and this is what we are doing.  <H5>  V. Instead of Conclusion </H5>   Certainly, it is impossible to study all aspects and  problems  of government's activities in one article. I expect to be able  to do this later. The government, as well as I -- its prime  minister and LDDP chairman, are concerned with the situation in  culture, science, and education. We know that their condition  is miserable, and we are holding numerous consultations and  searching for resolutions.    The management of the state is also a complicated problem.  Unlike any other sphere, this one, probably, receives the  largest amount of advice and recommendations -- from liberal and  anarchist to stagnant conservative. I think that the time of  the revolution is over, and our decisions must acquire a  consistent evolutionary character. The officials' competence  rather than number is important. In turn, the government must  train its staff with the awareness of state interests and create  relevant conditions for them.    It is common knowledge that both before and after the  elections, the LDDP spoke out for cooperation with all political  forces. Thus far, we have failed to achieve this. All more  influential parties, except a few personalities, refused to  cooperate and are continuing the "policy of LDDP isolation"  which, in my opinion, is fruitless and damaging to Lithuania.  Meanwhile, Lithuania requires consolidation and political  accord. The road to agreement or a consensus is not a one-sided  effort. It requires overall tolerance, goodwill, and political  wisdom. I believe that many oppositional parties understand  today that the plans to isolate the LDDP have failed. Thus, let  us look for agreement and common ground. The opposition should  abandon the tone of ultimatums, actions which inspire conflicts,  and demagogy in the first place. If we manage to rise above our  party ambitions, Lithuania's political culture and democracy,  that is, every individual, will gain from this.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix A_Supporting Statement Attestation by Employers Seeking To Utilize Alien Crewmembers To Perform Longshore Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) and the Employment Standards Administration (ESA) of the Department of Labor (DOL or Department) are promulgating regulations governing the filing and enforcement of attestations by employers seeking to use alien crewmembers to perform longshore activities at locations in the State of Alaska.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The attestation process is to be administered by ETA; complaints and investigations regarding attestations are the responsibility of ESA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;206, 107 Stat. 2419 (Act), was enacted on December 20, 1993. Among other things, the Act amended section 258 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1101  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) by creating an Alaska exception to the general prohibition on the performance of longshore work by alien crewmembers in U.S. ports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An employer seeking to employ alien crewmembers at locations in the State of Alaska under the Alaska exception shall submit an attestation. An attestation must be filed by each individual employer but may apply to multiple vessels and multiple locations within the State of Alaska.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Department proposes to review an attestation to ensure that it is received at least 30 days before the date of the first performance of the longshore activity, unless the employer could not have reasonably anticipated the need to file an attestation for that location at that time. In no case, however, will ETA accept an attestation received less than 24 hours prior to the date of the first performance of the activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department will review an attestation to assure that it is signed, completed, contains no obvious inaccuracies, and is not, on its face, inconsistent with the documentation submitted in support thereof. In addition, the Department proposes that it will review attestations to determine the following: (1) Whether the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, has notified ETA of a determination that an employer has misrepresented or failed to comply with an attestation previously submitted and accepted for filing, barring the employer from entry to any U.S. port for up to one year; (2) whether the Administrator has issued a cease and desist order that would affect the attesting employer and location at which longshore work is to be performed; and (3) whether the Administrator has advised ETA that the employer has failed to comply with any penalty or remedy assessed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the attestation is properly filled out and includes accompanying documentation for the requirement at &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .537 of the subpart, and does not fall within one of the categories set forth at paragraph (b) of &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .538, ETA shall accept the attestation for filing, notify the INS in writing of the filing, and return to the employer one copy of the attestation form submitted, with ETA's acceptance indicated thereon. The employer may then utilize alien crewmembers for the longshore work at the locations cited in the attestation in accordance with subpart F of part 655 and with INS regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ETA shall make available for public examination in Washington, D.C., a list of employers which have filed attestations, and for each such employer, a copy of the employer's attestation and accompanying documentation it has received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) It is anticipated that the documentation required to satisfy the attestation elements is available from existing data sources, and that the burden will be considerably less in the second and subsequent years in which the employer submits an attestation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

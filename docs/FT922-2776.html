			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / International Company News: Canada opens up calls competition RESELLERS of telephone services in Canada, including the UK's Cable and Wireless and other foreign companies, will be among the main beneficiaries of a landmark government decision to allow more competition in the telecommunications market. The ruling by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) ends the monopoly on long-distance calls held by Canada's provincial phone companies. It also opens the residential market and other services to the resellers, who buy lines at wholesale prices from the utilities and then resell them to users at discount prices. The fast-growing resale market has up to now been confined to business customers. The CRTC was ruling on an application, first brought almost a decade ago, by Unitel Communications (formerly CNCP Telecommunications) and a smaller company for approval to offer a public, long-distance service. Unitel is a joint venture between Rogers Communications, Canada's biggest cable television operator, and Canadian Pacific, the railway and resources conglomerate. The agency's deliberations were complicated by the fact that the provincial phone companies have always used handsome profits from long-distance calls to subsidise their local service. They argued that downward pressure on long-distance rates would inevitably force up local charges. Bell Canada, the biggest of the utilities, estimates that the cross-subsidy was close to CDollars 2bn (USDollars 1.6bn) last year, or 60-65 cents of each dollar earned from long-distance calls. All local calls are still free in Canada, and the monthly basic service fee is only about half that in the US. The CRTC ruled, however, that Unitel and any other new entrants must contribute towards the local service subsidy. The level of the contribution has been set about 15 per cent higher than Unitel had proposed. Long-distance competitors will also have to share the cost of connecting their lines to the phone companies' local networks. Despite these conditions, the end of the long-distance monopoly is expected to lead to fierce price-cutting. Unitel claims it can undercut current long-distance charges by about 15 per cent. It expects to be offering services in large cities within a year. The threat of competition has led Bell and the other provincial phone companies to slash rates by an average of 28 per cent in the past decade. They are trying to recoup this by offering a growing array of value-added services.</p>

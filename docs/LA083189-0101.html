			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> RACE SPONSORS CLEAR HURDLE  </P> <P> The Culver City Chamber of Commerce's plans for giving an extra kick to the  city's Western Hemisphere Marathon through corporate sponsorship won  preliminary approval Monday from the City Council.  </P> <P> The council indicated a willingness to make an exception to its policy and  allow a major sponsor to advertise the race and itself on street banners and  signs. It asked the chamber to come back with a proposal outlining the number,  size and placement of the signs.  </P> <P> The council directed city staff to prepare an agreement giving the chamber  administrative responsibility for the marathon in exchange for 15% of gross  receipts from the race. Profits would go toward youth and community activities  in Culver City and the surrounding area.  </P></p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Indian central bank governor appointed MR C Rangarajan, a member of the Indian government's planning and finance commission, has been appointed the next governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank. He will take over from Mr S Venkitaramanan, who reaches retirement on December 22, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi. Mr Rangarajan, 60, was deputy governor of the Reserve Bank for 10 years until January 1991. He rejoins amid controversy that the bank failed to exercise regulatory controls on Indian and foreign banks involved in the Rs35bn (Pounds 820m) Bombay financial scandal. The role of the central bank in the scandal is being investigated by a parliamentary committee which questioned Mr Venkitaramanan last week, but failed to establish allegations by MPs that he had been personally involved in the scandal. Mr Rangarajan, an academic before he joined the bank in 1981, is widely regarded as a monetary expert and has been associated with India's economic reforms.</p>

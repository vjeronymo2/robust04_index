			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEEKING PREVENTION OF ALCOHOL ABUSE  </P> <P> On behalf of the Commission of Alcoholism, I want to commend you and John  Mitchell for the excellent article on Sept. 3, 1989, "All-Out Against Alcohol."  The article was a meaningful one.  </P> <P> Dr. Trisha Roth is a courageous citizen who has been willing to take on an  unpopular position. We need more people like her in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> The Times is to be congratulated for allowing its readers to know what some  citizens are doing in the prevention of alcohol use by minors, drinking-driver  accidents and the misuse of alcoholic beverages by adults.  </P> <P> Keep up the good work, L.A. Times.  </P> <P> BRUCE A. AULT, Los Angeles  </P></p>

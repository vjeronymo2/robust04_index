			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / IBM spins off FSC defence unit to Loral for Dollars 1.58bn International Business Machines is to sell its Federal Systems Company division to Loral, the US defence contractor, for Dollars 1.58bn (Pounds 1.05bn) in cash. Last month IBM said it had received several offers for FSC, believed to be from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, Martin Marietta and the Hughes Aircraft division of General Motors, as well as Loral. FSC is a US-based division of IBM that sells computers systems and services, mainly to US government agencies. It employs 11,400, almost all in the US. The division posted 1992 revenues of Dollars 2.2bn, up from Dollars 1.9bn in the previous year, but its business has been relatively flat amid US defence spending cuts. For 1992 FSC recorded a net profit of Dollars 71m after being assessed for a portion of IBM's restructuring charges. About 60 per cent of FSC's business is defence related and 40 per cent is complex systems integration projects for agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration and the Postal Service. FSC expects 1993 operating income, before corporate and restructuring charges, of Dollars 165m on revenues of around Dollars 2.2bn. Loral is acquiring all of FSC's businesses, except Fed-eral Systems Marketing, which sells standard IBM products and services to government agencies. Loral said the acquisition will be 'anti-dilutive', and will be financed through borrowings. 'The Federal Systems Company consistently has been a leader in the highly specialised governmental marketplace,' said Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman. 'Nevertheless, this market is changing rapidly today and we have determined that this sale is in the best long-term interest of IBM and its shareholders. We're pleased that FSC employees will join a company that is committed to the defence marketplace over the long term.' Mr Gerstner, who joined IBM earlier this year, has made clear he is not in favour of breaking up the company. The specialised nature of FSC and its heavy dependence upon defence contracts, in an era of defence cuts, made it a prime candidate for sale as IBM slims its operations. Seperately, the FAA said it was facing a Dollars 1.2bn cost over-run on a new air traffic monitoring system, a project on which Federal Systems is the prime contractor. IBM's share price rose Dollars 2 1/8 to close at Dollars 57 3/8 in New York. Loral rose Dollars 2 3/4 to close at Dollars 35.</p>

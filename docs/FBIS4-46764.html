			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kronid Lybarskiy: "The Agreement [dogovor] on a </F> Separate Peace"]    [Text] And so the race with the elaboration of the  "Agreement [soglasheniye] on Accord" [soglasiye], which later,  to the satisfaction of linguistic purists, was transformed into  an "Agreement" [dogovor] has now been successfully completed. On  28 April the first 245 signatures were put under the agreement.  The pompous act for some reason took place in the Georgiyevskiy  Hall of the Kremlin, which symbolizes Russian military glory,  although for the declaration of a civic accord, probably, a more  peaceful place would have been more suitable.    After the "Georgiyevskiy [Hall]" celebrations there were  also  other ones--on a smaller scale.    But of greater significance than any symbolism is the  essence  of the matter: What precisely was signed, and who precisely  signed the agreement.  <H5>  The Kremlin Has Come Closer to Moncloa </H5>   It is necessary to say that during the several weeks that  have passed since the time of the development and publication of  the first variant of the draft agreement it has changed very  substantially. The first thing that should be noted in comparing  a number of intervening variants of the text with the final one  is the fact that the very structure of the document has changed  drastically. It has become more "addressed" [adresnyy], as they  say now. In this sense, it has come to resemble much more the  pacts of Moncloa.    In the original variant, all responsibility and all  obligations were equally divided between all the participants of  the agreement. A sort of collective security was established.  For example, it was provided that all future signatories--from  the Seventh Day Adventists to "Women of the Navy"--obligated  themselves "not to allow" either "a reduction of the defense  ability" or "an irreversible technical lag", and expressed  complete readiness to carry out "budget compensation to the  regions."    In the signed variant there is already nothing of this. The  obligations of the parties are formulated sufficiently precisely  and clearly, above all in what concerns the government and the  Federal Assembly. Besides that, the points of the agreement to a  significant degree lost poetic vagueness and began more to  resemble political obligations.    It is especially clear now what the Federal Assembly needs  to  do. Almost in every part of the agreement a lengthy list of  legislative acts is cited which the Council of the Federation  and the Duma obligate themselves to adopt, moreover, some of  these laws are quite concrete. This is important, for in the  meanwhile the new Russian parliament has worked utmost  ineffectively: Upon the expiration of the parliamentary "100  days" it was discovered that the deputies have not adopted a  single substantial law, but only laws regulating and  "guaranteeing" their own activity.    The Federal Assembly now promises to adopt at last a  constitutional law on the government, civil and land codes, a  new Codex of Labor Law, laws on free economic zones, on banking  activity, on the securities market, and on the subsistence wage.  Also envisaged is the adoption of laws "aimed at the perfection  of the taxation system." The parliamentarians have also  promised, however, to adopt at last the budget for the current  year--for this alone one should give thanks to the "Agreement on  Accord."    Also quite concrete are the obligations of the Federal  Assembly in connection with the laws on local self-government.  In other spheres of lawmaking they were formulated in much more  general form.    The promises given in the agreement by the executive  authority sooner have the character of establishing aims:  Reduction of inflation, increase of investment activity,  overcoming the structural deformations of the economy, an active  social policy, etc. For the time being it is not very clear in  what manner the government intends to carry all this out. It is  not that the budget for 1994 presented to the Duma exactly  during the period of the preparation of the agreement  contradicted the government obligations in the agreement--both  of these documents simply exist independently of one another,  one ouitside the other.    We will hope that the government has nevertheless some  thoughts concerning ways of executing the obligations it has  taken upon itself. However, for the time being these hopes are  not too great. Here it is worthwhile to remember that even the  economic obligations of the Moncloa Pact, assumed in conditions  of a much more favorable situation, were by no means fully  carried out.    Moreover, the executive authority, one must suppose,  realizes  this. Not by chance, literally during the last days before the  signing of the agreement, a cautious reservation was made to the  government obligations: They will be carried out by the  government only "on the basis of the legislation of the Russian  Federation and within the limits of its powers." Thereby the  success of the actions of the executive is closely linked to the  preparedness of the parliament to cooperate with it and with the  powers it will succeed in receiving.    By comparison with the original text, the removal of the  idea  of "an economic conference" from it must be recognized as a  reasonable change. According to the original idea of the  authors, such a conference was to have worked out "coordinated  proposals in the sphere of economic policy." It was proposed to  include representatives of both the executive and the  legislative power, as well as trade unions and entrepreneurs.  The parties, too, made known their claims to participation in  the economic conference. One can imagine to what paralysis in  the course of economic reforms the creation of such an organ  would lead--an evident next "talking-shop."    Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning one circumstance here:  On the whole, in their majority, the government economic  obligations are in the channel of market reforms. The authors of  the document succeeded in resisting the pressure which, without  a doubt, was exerted on them in the direction of the  "socialization" of the agreement. Thereby the agreement fixes  the attained political-economic level of the reforms and does  not permit restoration tendencies, which, evidently, also made  it unacceptable to the "red" opposition.    This is very important. Any accord must nevertheless have  some central point, a base foundation, which is not called into  question by either one of the sides. Today, the recognition of  the fact that a change in the social system has taken place in  our country can be and has actually become such a foundation.  Already this alone makes the "Agreement on Accord" an important  document.    The obligations of the trade unions reduce themselves, in  the  main, to the promise not to strike, except for concrete economic  reasons. The entrepreneurs pledge to do what any entrepreneur  who has not lost his faculties and is not a swindler would do:  Not to stop production without necessity and to fulfill his  obligations to suppliers and buyers.    The role of the remaining participants of the agreement,  evidently, comes most of all to the moral support of the main  acting parties.  <H5>  The Results of Trades </H5>   From a substantive, not a structural, point of view, the  agreement underwent the most important changes in the past few  weeks in the part devoted to the federative structure, which was  previously called "Regional Politics." A whole series of  fundamentally important provisions were deleted from it.    Thus, it was originally proposed that "the subjects of the  Federation agree to the repudiation of the change of their  constitutional statuses within 2 years." Now there is no such  provision. Likewise missing from the agreement is the promise  that "the constitutions, statutes and other legislative acts of  the subjects of the Federation will be brought into conformity  and newly elaborated in strict conformity with the federal  Constitution." As far as is known, the main opponent of this  restriction was the Tatar president, Mintimer Shaymiyev, who not  so long ago defended the right of Tatarstan to its own  constitution, which does not entirely link up with the federal  one.    The bilateral agreement with the federal authorities  concluded by Shaymiyev, evidently, also induced the remaining  subjects of the federation, the republics first of all, to  insist on the withdrawal, from the text of the agreement, of the  moratorium on the signing bilateral agreements about the  delimitation of the subjects of jurisdiction and powers between  the federal and regional organs of power.    All this is the evident price that had to be paid for the  regions' support of the agreement on accord. Has the price been  raised too high and to what extent--still remains to be seen.  For the time being there are rumors to the effect that even the  president of Chechnya, Dudayev, is examining the possibility of  joining the agreement--rumors that appear not completely  improbable and sooner speak in favor of the concessions that  have been made. Nevertheless, the resistance of the regions even  to potential restrictions of their rights should serve as a  serious warning to the federal government: The support on the  part of the regions will not come automatically.    Another significant difference of the original and the final  variants of the agreement concerns questions of security. The  original variant put emphasis on reform of the army and navy  and, in the final analysis, on the transfer of the armed forces  to a professional basis. In the final text there already is no  mention of anything like that. The question of the army as a  separate subject in general is virtually absent in the  agreement. Only the necessity is proclaimed of "strengthening  and increasing the effectiveness of the activity of the power  structures," but, judging by the context, here they sooner have  in mind the so-called "law enforcement organs."    This is supported also by another place of the agreement.  Still on the eve of the signing, the draft retained the  obligation of the Federal Assembly "during the current year [as  per text] to create the necessary legislative basis . . . for  the execution of reforms of the law enforcement organs." At the  very last moment, the word "reforms" was replaced by the word  "strengthening." It is not clear to what degree "the organs" are  responsible for this important change, but the impression has  been created that it was to a considerable degree.    Thus, in the lack of desire to reform themselves the "power  structures" manifest touching unity.    Some innovations in the agreement clearly represent  "address"  concessions, such as, for example, the promise of the government  "to create acceptable economic conditions for the operation of  the agroindustrial complex." This promise is among those that  were put into the text literally at the last moment--at the  obvious demand of the "landowners" [agrarii]. One must suppose,  the hopes that the "landowners" as a result of such a concession  will nevertheless sign the agreement were retained to the very  last moment, for the promise in the agreement was retained, in  spite of the splendid absence of the "landowners" among the  signatories.    With satisfaction it needs to be noted that they judiciously  removed from the final variant the demand, addressed to "every  member of society", to "tirelessly confirm" religious values, as  well as "to propagate the primordial spiritual and moral  traditions of Russia." Thereby the next draft "on the  introduction of like-mindedness in Russia," fortunately, was not  carried out.    Also omitted was the obligation of the parties "not to  utilize the assessment of the events of August 1991 and  September-October 1993 as grounds for intensifying confrontation  and resistance." Evidently, however, it was clear that any such  assessments of these events call forth a confrontational  reaction with one side or another--the memory of them, which has  by no means receded into the past, is too fresh. So that to be  silent about these events in this situation was the only way out.    It would have been a good thing also to remove from the text  the strange passage about "simplified and insulting assessments  of the past"--for the same reason. Our recent past is too dismal  to take it under such high protection. I would like to find out  from the authors of the text: What assessment of that past  precisely would they consider "insulting?" Self-pardon is not  the best method for overcoming the past.  <H5>  Reality or Illusion? </H5>   In completing the signing ceremony, Yeltsin said that  henceforth the "Civic Accord Agreement" has become "a reality of  Russian life." I am afraid that the desirable is here given out  to be the real.    I think that Grigoriyy Yavlinskiy was not right when he  called the agreement harmful: The leader of "Yabloko" suggests  that the present forcing of events will prevent the president in  the future, when this will really become possible and necessary,  to conclude such an agreement again--there are steps which  cannot be taken twice.    There is, of course, no harm from the agreement. Moreover,  it  can entirely exert a certain beneficial influence in the  direction of mollification of the political nerves. The central  idea of the agreement--the necessity of civic peace--is  indisputable, the majority of words in it are correct. The  repetition once more of good wishes cannot bring any harm. It  appears that the very process of the development of the text of  the agreement has led to some rapprochement of the positions of  its participants--thus, for example, the balanced conduct of  Ivan Rybkin, who overcame heavy pressure from his party  comrades, calls forth unquestionable respect.    What is worse is something else. Most likely, already in the  near future the passions in regard to the agreement will be  forgotten, as the agreement itself will happily be forgotten.  This is already now clearly indicated by the reaction of society  to the triumphant event: According to the results of a public  opinion survey, immediately after the signing of more than 52  percent of those surveyed regarded it with indifference or did  not have an opinion of their own.    Such a reaction is understandable. The "Civic Accord  Agreement" can become "a reality of life" only when it fixes  trends that have really ripened in society. They indicate that  society has grown tired of confrontation. But tiredness is not  yet accord. All agree that "to live in this way is impossible,"  but unity about how for all that people should live,  unfortunately, has not yet come into being.    Thank God that the strange idea of Shakhray--to adopt the  Agreement on Accord" as a federal law--was not accepted. If this  had been done--the agreement could not escape becoming the  double of the sadly famous resolutions of the CPSU Central  Committee, the USSR Supreme Soviet, and the USSR Council of  Ministers" with their endless "to pay special attention", "to  intensify," and "to concentrate." As if accord can be planted by  order from above, like a potato! Or like corn.    The agreement will be useful if it does not give rise to  unjustified hopes and, following them, bitter disappointments.  Disappointed politicians are inclined to make indadequate  decisions that strike society with pain.  <H5>  Sometimes a Protocol on Differences Is More Useful </H5>   In the light of what has been said above, a list of names of  the signatories or of those who refused to sign, is certainly  not so important. The real conduct of these or those will hardly  be determined by the presence or absence of their signature  under the agreement. And nevertheless the position of the  parties [to the agreement] represents a certain interest.    Without a doubt, a significant factor is the refusal of the  communists to join the agreement. Personally Zyuganov, who has  already tasted the sweetness of the corridors of power and who  has internally prepared himself to find a niche for himself in  the system, possibly, would also have signed the agreement. He  already repeatedly gave signals that he is prepared to transform  himself into a social democrat of the parliamentary type for the  sake of admittance into the Areopagus of the decision-makers.  But the party, which has brought him into the Duma, decided  differently, and to resist it Zyuganov, in contrast to Rybkin,  did not have enough spirit. However, Zyuganov could not act  otherwise--he understands that outside his party he represents a  political zero.    The decision of the Communist Party of the Russian  Federation  has clearly determined its place in the Russian political  spectrum--next to the National Salvation Front and Anpilov's  Working Russia members. The Communists refuse to accept in the  agreement the fact which is basic in it--the recognition of the  reality of the change of the social system in Russia. They  cannot reconcile themselves to this. Thereby they have  determined their political future: Either to continually secure  their influence through confrontation, or to disappear from the  political scence. For Russian politicians to forget about this  would be foolish.    In fact, a sort of "protocol of differences" precisely  setting forth the positions of the parties [to the agreement]  was signed. Such a "protocol" is also useful, as the  understanding of political reality is always useful. By  contrast, games of the appearance of accord in the absence of a  real will to it are extremely dangerous.    Accord cannot be unlimited. Otherwise it is transformed into  unprincipledness.    Several days prior to the signing of the "Accord Agreement,  on 23 April, an, in my view, extraordinary event occurred in  Russian political life, which nevertheless passed completely  unnoticed. On this day, the newspaper IZVESTIYA published a  verbose article by Zhirinovskiy, with an exposition of his  political program. I shall recall that by decision of the last  congress of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], the  leader of the party was given extraordinary powers, and,  henceforth, the statements of Zhirinovskiy are not the opinion  of a private individual, but the official position of the party,  which has now adopted the name LDPR-PZH [Liberal Democratic  Party of Russia--Party of Zhirinovskiy]. And so, among the many  pearls of this programmatic party article, which I am not  inclined to examine here, is the following: "It is necessary to  `close' down the autonomous republics, oblasts, etc., and  immediately reestablish the guberniya headed by a governor. And  in so doing not hold any discussions. Quickly, rigidly, by means  of a corresponding edict, dispatch the sovereign presidents who  do not want to become transformed into governors to suburban  Moscow dachas for a `discussion.' Let them rest, eat smetana  [sour cream], watch television, only don't let them leave the  territory of the dacha in the interest of their security. After  a couple of years they will leave--it will already be a  different country. And without a drop of blood."    Well, as far as blood is concerned--that we have already  heard: Vladimir Volfovich intends to make his way even to the  Indian Ocean on tanks without a single drop of blood, proceeding  from the "realistic" assumption that no one will start to resist  him. But here in essence the procedure of "dispatching to  dachas" described by Zhirinovskiy is called the internment of  leading statesmen, and the passage as a whole is a call to a  coup d'etat.    The act of Zhirinovskiy, committed by him on 23 April,  clearly qualifies according to Article 70 of the Criminal Code  of Russia: "Calls for the forceful change of the constitutional  order." According to Article 1 of the Constitution of the  Russian Federation, Russia is a democratic federative  law-governed state with a republican form of rule: Through the  "closing down" of the republics, the constitutional federative  basis of the state is fully destroyed. Internment--quickly,  rigidly, and without discussions are an unequivocal act of force.    Thus, the leader of the second largest parliamentary party  group in the Duma, endowed by his party with the powers to  formulate its policy personally, in the heat of the discussion  of the final variant of the "Civic Accord Agreement," declares  his intention to carry out a coup d'etat in the near future. And  the only reaction of society in so doing is the limp answer in  that same IZVESTIYA of Otto Latsis, ridiculing Zhirinovskiy,  like Khlestakov!    The procuracy is silent, which in its time under pressure of  the public had instituted proceedings against Zhirinovskiy in  the matter of the propagation of war, but now is clearly trying  to have this case disappear in the sand.    Also silent are the other parties and election blocs, the  "colleagues" of the LDPR-PZH in the Duma are not conducting  indignant parliamentary inquiries and are not declaring  protests. Mr Gaydar, the defender of democracy, Mr Shakhray, the  defender of federalism, how are we supposed to interpret your  silence? Or do you also share the view that all this is only  inoffensive shameless bragging to which one cannot but call  attention? But then, what reasons do you have to expect that  people will take seriously the parliament, where you sit next to  Zhirinovskiy?    Silent are the "sovereign presidents", the very same who  intend to intervene, and, not even having wiped off the spittle  from their face, place their signature under the "Accord  Agreement" next to the signature of Zhirinovskiy? This is  difficult to fit into consciousness.    And after this you want society to place hopes on such an  agreement? In such a situation the accord looks like connivance.    Zhirinovskiy does not conceal his ultimate political  ambitions. In his dreams he already sees the longed-for moment  prophetically described by A. K. Tolstoy in the unforgettable  "Istoriya gosudarstva Rossiyskogo" [History of the Russian  State]:    "And, having climbed up to the place of Boris, this impudent  fellow, out of joy with the bride, he began to dangle his feet."    If this, God forbid, will happen, then not civil peace, but  full-scale civil war will become the reality of Russian life. In  the grown-up Russian society, forces are announcing themselves  that no longer under any circumstances will resign themselves  either to the railway cars for dissidents "to Taymir, the last  stop--tundra", or to the "bloodless" dashes to the south.  Closing the eyes today to the appeal on the part of political  adventurists, we are sowing the seeds of tomorrow's civil war.    The country really needs civic accord. And not for two  years.  To secure it, not demonstrative, but realistic and principled  actions are necessary. It is impossible to allow for political  deluge to begin "after us."    P.S. A number of days ago, appearing on radio with  commentaries concerning the signing of the agreement, I  expressed the opinion about the dangerous game set forth above,  which the leader of the LDPR-PZH is playing. Soon after this, I  received a call from someone who called himself "colonel of the  tank forces" from the "army in the field" and promised that in  the near future I will be "crushed" (by a tank, one must  suppose?).    We are not talking about me--I am an elderly person who has  long since ceased to be afraid. But then what about civic  accord? Not invite to the signing of the "Accord Agreement" also  the "forces" who killed Ayzderdzis? It goes without saying,  having amnestied them beforehand.</p>

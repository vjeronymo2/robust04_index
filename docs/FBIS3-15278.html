			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Konstantin Borovoy, chairman of the Economic </F> Freedom Party: "Boris Yeltsin Is the Main Cause of Stagnation  in the Russian Economy" -- from page 1 of the weekly DELOVAYA  SREDA supplement, No. 9]    [Text] Today I am worried the most by the stagnation  situation in which we have found ourselves. Or rather a  situation which we have brought on ourselves by granting  President Yeltsin such unlimited powers. The citizens have  ceded him these powers not for his fine looks but to enable him  to conduct transformations in society, the national economy and  politics, taking counsel with representatives of democratic  parties.    Having received this power, however, Yeltsin immediately  stopped in his tracks because he thereby accomplished his  objective.    At present there are all the makings of stagnation in  evidence. Even the president's recent ailment, in my view, also  belongs here, not to mention, for instance, such a decision of  his as a proposal to postpone elections of administration heads  till 1996. What is this if not an attempt to freeze the  situation? Stagnation is precisely a situation being frozen.  In contrast to democracy, where all ailments are exposed and  treated.    Under democracy, officials who, say, have committed crimes  are immediately dismissed and the president or any other head of  government is obligated to do this because he depends on those  who have voted for him, on public opinion, and finally on the  mass media.    Boris Yeltsin, however, does not depend on anyone at  present.  His dependence even on the State Duma can be defined as very  insignificant. What is the point of the president's meeting  with democratic party leaders and proving to them that he is  conducting democratic transformations in the economy and  politics? There is absolutely no need for him to do this  because the entire power is concentrated in his hands.    This situation is terrible and all that one can rely on now  is the president's conscience. Otherwise the consequences of,  let us say, the situation being preserved or of one-man rule  emerging can be rather explosive. Stagnation can well lead to  popular unrest and various actions by political parties.    That Yeltsin is not changing but preserving an extremely  hard- line cabinet of ministers which was imposed on him,  incapable and unwilling to undertake reform, is probably the  most shining sign of stagnation. If we talk of economic  transformations in Russia, what on earth does Chernomyrdin or  Zaveryukha have to do with this?! All that they and people like  them can do is to turn Russian into a Ukraine. This is very  dangerous indeed.    A way to resolve our economic problems lies in raising  economic effectiveness, creating normal jobs, the abandonment of  economic regulation by the state, and stopping subsidies to  unprofitable and unwanted enterprises whose needs are growing in  proportion to what is being handed out to them all the time.  This is a typical pattern of addiction: If six cubic  millimeters is given to a drug addict who is accustomed to two  cu mm a day, soon two will not be enough.    Economic problems can be resolved only by liberalizing the  economy and promoting unrestrained competition. Unfortunately,  at present the economy is dominated by the parasitic interests  of groups whose representatives are in the government.  Moreover, the most incapable representatives of these groups  are in the government.    I will start to support Yeltsin only when there is no  Chernomyrdin in the government and when there is a reformer at  its head. Everything else is empty talk about the need for an  efficient economy, advancement, and so forth.    Today I am giving much thought to how Yeltsin will go down  in  history, how posterity will appraise the present time; and I am  almost convinced that he will not be called a reformer. His  time will be seen as the time of struggle by reformers whom  Yeltsin first supported, then opposed.    True, the president has two years in reserve, but the way he  has begun to use his remaining tenure shows that my assessment  of him can yet become even more sharply negative.</p>

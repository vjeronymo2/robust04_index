			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, June 15 (TANJUG) -- The president of the  Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK), Milan Martic, asked the  co-chairmen of the conference on the former Yugoslavia, Lord  David Owen and Thorwald Stoltenberg, to urge that RSK property  is protected in all new states created in the territory of the  ex-Yugoslavia and in third countries. Martic said that RSK  representatives have so far not taken part in the work of the  international conference on the former Yugoslavia regarding  succession issues. Martic said that no newly-created state in  the territory of ex-Yugoslavia, including RSK, can be excluded  from the succession talks. He asked Owen and Stoltenberg to  mediate in the resolution of the problem of the deposits of RSK  citizens in Ljubljanska Banka, one of the major commercial banks  in the former Yugoslavia which was located in Ljubljana, capital  of Slovenia, to prevent Slovenia from transferring the funds to  the account of the state of Croatia.    RSK was proclaimed by the local Serbs in 1991 in their  ancestral lands in Croatia in response to its violent secession  from the former Yugoslav federation and the downgrading of their  status. RSK is a U.N. protected area since March 1992.</p>

Rabbi Ibrahim Hamra told AFP the authorities began issuing  visas to Jews about three weeks ago, at the rate of 30 a day.    "Only 225 Syrian Jews still have not received their exit  visas," he said. "We hope they will get them in the next few  days."    Some 1,250 of Syria's 4,000-strong Jewish community opted to  stay in Syria after Damascus agreed in 1992 to allow applicants  for exit visas to leave with their families.    About 1,000 remained in Damascus, and 250 in Aleppo and  al-Qamishli in the north.    Hamra said none of those who emigrated went to Israel.  Almost all of them went to New York.    On Monday, Hamra said that around 110 Jews had returned  after  spending more than a year in the United States.    For years the United States has urged Syria to allow its  Jews  to leave.    Damascus previously barred families from travelling together  and required individuals who did leave to put up large sums as  guarantees against their return.    However, in December Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad assured  US Secretary of State Warren Christopher that Damascus would  speed up the issuing of exit visas for Jews.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Arts: Sir David Lean - Obituary Britain's most celebrated film director, Sir David Lean, died in London yesterday after a long illness. Sir David, 83, whose screen triumphs included Lawrence of Arabia, The Bridge On The River Kwai and Dr Zhivago, was taken ill earlier this year while working on a Pounds 23m project in Europe. He was flown home from the south of France for treatment but never recovered, his lawyer Mr Tony Reeves announced. A private funeral will be held and a memorial service is to be arranged. Sir David, who married for the fifth time in December last year to Sandra Cooke, had just completed work on the script of his adaptation of Joseph Conrad's Nostromo. Its future is now in doubt. Sir David's films won a total of 26 Oscars, making him one of the most successful directors despite long periods of inactivity. After learning his trade in the 1920s as a clapperboard boy and a 'wardrobe mistress' he took charge of editing and commentary for Gaumont Sound News in 1930 - later moving to British Movietone News. Within a few years he was Britain's highest-paid film editor, working on successes like French Without Tears, Pygmalion and 49th Parallel. He was invited to co-direct with Noel Coward the story of wartime life in the Royal Navy, In Which We Serve. Its success in 1942 led him to direct three other films written by Coward - This Happy Breed, Blithe Spirit, and the widely acclaimed Brief Encounter - by 1946. The early post-war years saw the critical and box office successes Great Expectations, still regarded by many as his finest achievement, and Oliver Twist. His Dr Zhivago in 1965 was to earn more money than all his other films put together. Another of his box office successes was Ryan's Daughter in 1970. He was upset by the cool critical response the film received and did not make another until A Passage To India in 1984. But recognition of his achievements continued. In 1973 he received the Directors Guild of America's highest accolade, the D W Griffith Award. In 1983, the year before he was knighted, he was given one of the first fellowships awarded by the British Film Institute.</p>

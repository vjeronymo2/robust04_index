			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Arts: 'The Fairy Queen' in Covent Garden - Summer festival time has arrived in earnest So much amusement has been caused by the production of Mozart's masonic opera The Magic Flute in the Freemasons' Hall that people do not seem to have noticed how apposite are some of the other venues occupied by the BOC Covent Garden Festival. Ingenuity has certainly made the most of the available performing spaces. In the very centre of the festival's catchment area lies a Wren masterpiece  -St Paul's Church, with its rear portico (or is it the front?) facing directly on to the piazza. What better to feature there than the music of Purcell, Britain's leading Restoration composer? Ideally, one might have had some of the choral music, at present being recorded complete for the first time, but that looks as if it will have to wait for another year. The work that was presented on Sunday was the semi-opera, The Fairy Queen. The Gabrieli Consort under Paul McCreesh performed it almost complete (a couple of numbers, including the Plaint, were omitted, presumably on the grounds that they were added later). Some acting of a sort was invited, mostly in the lighter passages, but probably should not have been. Singers need a firm directorial hand if jokey ideas are not to get out of control. As it was, the comic interludes rather took over and the atmosphere was of a more plebeian entertainment than usual, which may or may not be true to Purcell's day. The drunken poet reeled in the aisles; Corydon and Mopsa camped up their duet something awful, although Mark le Brocq's impersonation of Benny Hill impersonating a suggestive blonde with pigtails revealed hidden talents. McCreesh and his musicians supported them all with lively playing. It is, however, only a year since William Christie performed The Fairy Queen at the Barbican, and his subtle and expressive way with the music was the more rewarding. He also had the better singers, although the bass Peter Harvey made such a fine job of his Winter solo as almost to tip the balance the other way. The linking narration was provided by Simon Butteriss, a couple of sly asides wittily reminding us that this is a festival which is on the ball.

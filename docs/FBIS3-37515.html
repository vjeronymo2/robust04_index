			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] UNIAN has already reported that the automatic  emergency safety device disconnected the second turbogenerator  of the first generating set at Chernobyl Atomic Electric  Station. The causes of the activation of the automatic device  are being investigated. The first generating set, however,  continues to work at the 450-MW load. The station's third  generating set is only working at 50 percent of its capacity due  to the suspension of nuclear fuel deliveries from Russia.</p>

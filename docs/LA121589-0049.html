			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE 'PRICE OF A PAL' STRIKES A CHORD  </P> <P> I went to veterinary school, believe it or not, because I have an extreme  affection for animals and wanted to devote my life to alleviating their  suffering. What I learned there fascinated and excited me, and made me realize  there was some good to be done. But I paid the same for my education as the  students of human medicine at the same university. I cannot afford to give my  education away. A decade ago, the starting salary for a first-year veterinarian  averaged around $21,000 a year. Today, that average is only about $26,000.  </P> <P> As for Tannenbaum's suggestion that computer billing is leading to "fee  desensitization" and a diminishing client-veterinarian relationship, I say  "Bull!" Computer billing is becoming more and more a necessity in today's  silicon chip society. Especially for larger practices, whose professional  computer systems contain not only billing programs, but patient records,  invoicing, pharmacy records, laboratory information and employee time logging.  "The friendly doctor" is not gone. He or she is just able to use time and  resources more efficiently.  </P> <P> TIMOTHY A. FOUTS, DVM, West Los Angeles  </P></p>

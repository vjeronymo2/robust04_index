			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The Tirana branch of the Committee for  the Protection of the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church  intends to put an end to the temporary stay of [Archbishop]  Janullatos in Albania. This was stated at a joint meeting that  this committee organized with the Tirana branch of the  Association of Political Persecutees. For more details we go  over to our correspondent, Arben Karapici:    [Karapici] It seems that Archbishop Anastasios Janullatos  has finished his stay and temporary religious mission in  Albania. This is, at least, the opinion of the Committee for  the Protection of the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church,  which was confirmed at a joint meeting with the branch of the  Association of Former Political Persecutees in Tirana.    Several cases were reported on at this meeting. The latest  was in Elbasan, where the Orthodox believers of this city asked  Janullatos to consecrate Nikolla Marko from Elbasan as  archbishop of the city's Orthodox Church. As a response to this  demand by the Elbasan Orthodox believers, Janullatos was  reported to have said that he had taken advice from God, who  ordered him not to hurry in such affairs, i.e., the ordaining of  Albanian Orthodox priests.    Petrit Bidoshi, chairman of the Committee for the Protection  of the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, informed those  present at the meeting that Janullatos has maintained the same  stance toward the demand to ordain the priest Arian Koja from  Tirana.    Bidoshi said that both Orthodox priests from Elbasan and  Tirana have high theological backgrounds and, according to him,  they should be appointed as soon as possible. But Janullatos's  stance in this case runs counter to his own religious mission,  Bidoshi stressed.    For the intellectuals present and all the believers who  filled the hall, these two cases were sufficient argument for  the meeting to conclude that the conditions had been created to  terminate Greek Archbishop Janullatos's temporary stay in  Albania.</p>

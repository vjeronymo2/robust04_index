			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow slides in reaction to surge in oil futures Wall Street Blue chip stocks lurched downwards yesterday afternoon after crude oil futures surged to their highest level of the year, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 24.42 off at 3,790.41, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 1.76 to 460.61. New York SE volume amounted to 270m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite eased 0.38 to 442.27 and the Nasdaq composite edged 0.14 lower to 735.84. The afternoon sell-off was triggered by a chain reaction in the financial markets. Spot crude futures jumped during the afternoon amid growing concern over the North Korean crisis. In turn, bonds went into a tailspin and share prices soon followed. As the session opened, investors were inclined to extend the previous session's 32-point Dow rally. The day's economic news presented no obvious obstacles to that ambition - the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production last month had risen 0.2 per cent, while capacity utilisation dipped to 83.5 per cent, from 83.6 per cent in April. The figures, although a shade stronger than economists had forecast, were consistent with the view that the economy had returned to moderate, non-inflationary growth. Still, stocks were moderately down by the afternoon, as profit-takers came to the fore. Later, when the oil market soured, the blue chips retreated by about 30 points before recovering somewhat by the close. Cyclical issues, which led the previous session's advance, dragged the index down yesterday. Alcoa retreated Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 74 1/2 and United Technologies lost Dollars 1 at Dollars 66 1/2 . Exxon remained one of the weakest components. The stock, hard hit by an unfavourable court ruling on the Exxon Valdez oil spill, shed a further Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 57, a new 52-week low. In the beverage industry, the misgivings among investors which hurt PepsiCo and Coca-Cola last week finally caught up with Cott, the aggressive Canadian-based bottler. Its share price plunged Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 14 1/2 on a downgrading by Lehman Brothers, which said escalating competitive pressures could backfire on the company. Meanwhile, PepsiCo added Dollars 3/8 at Dollars 32 1/8 and Coca-Cola held steady at Dollars 39 7/8 . Scott Paper advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 52 7/8 the day after a company briefing that was described by analysts as 'upbeat and positive'. The issue gained extra support from reports that its chairman had boosted his stake in the company. Geon, a leading producer of vinyl resins, climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 28 1/4 in unusually active trading of 1.3m shares. The upturn reflected an improving pricing environment for the company's products. International Game Technology was marked down Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 19 3/8 after it warned that its 1994 earnings would come at the low end of forecasts. Fruit of the Loom, an apparel maker, fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 26 3/4 . The company advised analysts to 'take a more conservative approach' in estimating its second-quarter earnings. Canada Toronto stocks continued to weaken, closing lower on political uncertainty over Quebec amid predictions that the market will soon test thresholds. An analyst said there is downward pressure on bonds, upward pressure on yields, and we still have a long horizon before the situation is resolved. The TSE 300 composite index fell 32.3 to 4,166.3 and declines outpaced advances by 482 to 264 after volume of 55m shares valued at CDollars 699m. All but two of the 14 stock groups ended in negative territory, with banking posting the largest decline of 1.90 per cent. Consumer products and industrial products fell 1.42 and 1.26 per cent respectively. Mining was off moderately, energy issues were flat, and golds gained 1.30 per cent. Brazil Shares in Sao Paulo slipped from early highs to end 1.74 per cent up after lacklustre trade, and dealers predicted more of the same tomorrow in the absence of hard news to give the market direction. The Bovespa index gained 525 at 30,698 in volume of Cr347bn.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Higher sales to US boost Renishaw Higher sales to its main market in the US helped Renishaw, the specialist measuring equipment group that exports 91 per cent of its output, to lift annual profits by 15 per cent. The shares closed ahead 11p at 288p yesterday. Pre-tax profits in the year to end June 30 rose from Pounds 7.14m to Pounds 8.2m on total sales ahead from Pounds 48m to Pounds 50.9m. Operating profits were ahead from Pounds 4.94m to Pounds 7.17m. Sales in the US grew by almost 15 per cent from Pounds 17.2m to Pounds 19.7m. Mr Ben Taylor, assistant chief executive, said that the US economy was improving enough to bring benefits. In addition, the group had been successful in selling so-called retrofit products - equipment that can be fitted to improve existing machining centres' control systems. In contrast, sales to Germany fell from Pounds 8.44m to Pounds 6.83m, while sales to Japan eased from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 5.8m. This was offset by improving sales to other overseas countries (up from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 6m) as the group developed new markets in Korea, Taiwan, India, Malaysia and Hong Kong. It also opened offices in Singapore and Beijing. The group, which successfully brought a new Pounds 1.5m machining facility on stream last April, spent Pounds 3.5m on research and development and Pounds 2.5m on associated engineering. It intends to maintain expenditure at the same levels this year, and will be launching further new prod-ucts. Interest receivable fell from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 1.05m because of lower rates. Net cash rose from Pounds 19.4m to Pounds 22.2m. Earnings per share rose from 10.3p to 12p. A final dividend of 4.4p (4p) is proposed, taking the total for the year to 6.9p (6.5p). The group is also making a 1-for-10 scrip issue. COMMENT A buoyant final quarter brought Renishaw in ahead of expectations. With its high operational gearing, it does not take much of an increase in turnover to move profits, and substantial improvements appear in sight. Its new scanning devices and the Raman imaging microscopes are selling well, and the group is keeping the pressure up on both new products and the search for new markets. At the same time costs have been tightly controlled, and it is generating cash. Interest rates have also moved in its favour. Like-for-like sales in Germany and Japan are up in the first months of this year, indicating further benefits to come. However, this is reflected in a prospective multiple of 21 if profits hit Pounds 9.5m this year.</p>

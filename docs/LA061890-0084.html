			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MURAL PROMOTING DICE CLAY MOVIE DEFACED BY PROTESTERS  </P> <P> A huge building mural promoting a new film starring raunchy comedian Andrew  Dice Clay was splattered with paint Sunday by a protest group that also  unfurled a banner criticizing the studio chief behind the film.  </P> <P> The mural promoting "The Adventures of Ford Fairlane" adorns the side of a  multistory storage building in the 3000 block of Grand Avenue along the Harbor  Freeway. Two callers who claimed to belong to a group calling itself Activists  Against Sexist Pigs said it was attacked about 7 a.m.  </P> <P> The mural was splattered with paint, and a red banner about 15 feet long was  hung from the top of the building. The callers said the banner was intended to  criticize Barry Diller, head of 20th Century Fox studios, which produced Dice  Clay's film.  </P> <P> "There's a responsibility factor with Andrew Dice Clay," a male caller said.  "He claims to be a nice guy, but turns around and slams gays, slams women,  slams people of color.  </P> <P> "We think that the people who are supporting him -- and there are numerous gay  men supporting him -- they have to be responsible to their communities, not  just the gays, but women and people of color," he said.  </P> <P> Both callers denied that they are promoting censorship.  </P> <P> "It has nothing to do with censorship," a woman caller said. "Andrew Dice Clay  has the right to say whatever he wants. But when he engages in (hatred of  women), he has to be stopped."  </P> <P> The incident was the third attack in recent weeks on advertisements for the  film featuring Dice Clay, a Brooklyn comic reviled by some for his jokes about  women, homosexuals, immigrants and others.  </P> <P> The callers said the assault on the mural was carried out by a "diverse group  of people, men and women, gay and straight."  </P> <P> Last Sunday, a poster for "Ford Fairlane" outside 20th Century Fox studios was  splattered with paint by the same protest group. A Dice Clay billboard in  Hollywood was the first target of Activists Against Sexist Pigs several weeks  ago.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 6 KYODO -- Ichiro Ozawa, Japan's  behind-the-scenes power broker, clandestinely paid a three-day  visit to Moscow without detection by the mass media, a Japanese  diplomatic source said Friday.    The source told KYODO NEWS SERVICE the embassy has not  confirmed any contacts between Ozawa and Russian politicians at  least during the day but said he is unsure whether they were  made at night. "Only his wife (Kazuko) and bodyguard  accompanied him," he said. "The embassy was told that he came  here to investigate the political and economic situation."    "However, in actuality, he appears to have come here for the  sake of sightseeing and to take a rest," he said.    Ozawa is secretary general of Shinseito and the arch ally of  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. He is credited with playing a key  part in sweeping Hata to power.    In March 1991, Ozawa, then secretary general of the Liberal  Democratic Party, flew to Moscow for talks with then Soviet  leader Mikhail Gorbachev on such issues as the dispute on the  sovereignty over four Russian-held islands off Japan's northern  shore.</p>

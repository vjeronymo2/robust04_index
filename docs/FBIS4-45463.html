			<p>Incinerated   <F P=102>   NC1606131994 Paris AFP in English 1245 GMT 16 Jun 94 </F> <F P=103> NC1606131994 </F> <F P=104>  Paris AFP </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN     [Text] Al-'Amrusiyah, Lebanon, June 16 (AFP) -- Lebanon  destroyed on Thursday 31 tonnes of hashish with a street value  of about 10 million dollars in what officials described as a  record haul.    General Salim Salim, head of the criminal investigation  department, told reporters the drugs had been mainly destined  for Holland and were seized in cooperation with Syrian  authorities last month.    "It's a sizeable seizure. The Lebanese authorities should be  very pleased indeed today," Denis Gray, a police attache at the  Australian High Commission in Cyprus, told AFP.    Gray, who was representing foreign police based in Cyprus,  witnessed the operation along with officers from the British and  French embassies in Beirut at the al-'Amrusiyah incinerator 10  kilometers (six miles) south of Beirut.    In addition to the hashish, six kilograms of opium, three  kilograms of heroin and two kilograms of cocaine also went up in  smoke.    Around 20 people were arrested when the Lebanese Army in  collaboration with the Syrian intelligence services ventured  into remote mountainous areas of the al-Hirmil region of the  Syrian-controlled al-Biqa' Valley.    "We ventured into very dangerous territory where we had not  gone to since the 1920s," said Salim, who personally conducted  the operations.    Huge fortunes from the drug trade were made in the al-Biqa',  but the government in cooperation with Syrian authorities has  set fire to poppy and cannabis fields in a ban imposed since the  civil war ended in 1991.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: USAir loss near forecast at Dollars 177.6m USAIR, the US airline in which British Airways has a 24.6 per cent stake, yesterday produced the latest in a series of dismal results by reporting a third-quarter loss of Dollars 177.6m. It was roughly in line with the Dollars 180m loss it had predicted at the end of last month. Part of the loss reflected an exceptional charge of Dollars 67.2m for costs involved in cutting 2,500 jobs from its workforce, and the comparable figure for last year's third quarter - a loss of Dollars 105.5m - included an exceptional gain of Dollars 10.3m on the sale of its general aviation activities. Mr Seth Schofield, president and chief executive, acknowledged the figures were poor. 'While revenues and yields have improved from last year, our results are disappointing, especially in the light of more positive results reported for the first two quarters of this year,' he said. USAir, burdened with some of the highest wage costs in the industry, is facing tough competition from low-cost carriers, such as Southwest Airlines, which last month launched an assault on USAir's Baltimore hub in the north-east. It has failed to report an annual profit since 1988. The company hopes to cut its costs by Dollars 200m next year.</p>

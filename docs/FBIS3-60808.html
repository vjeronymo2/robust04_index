			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Dec 28 (AFP)--An underground Islamic  fundamentalist group in Egypt on Tuesday [28 December] claimed  responsibility for the bomb and gun attack on a Cairo tour bus  that wounded eight Austrians.    The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [Islamic Group] said Monday's  attack in Misr al-Qadimah, after which the assailants shot and  wounded eight Egyptians while fleeing the scene, was "in  retaliation for the recent executions" of several al-Jama'ah  members.    Al-Jama'ah claimed responsibility in a statement sent to the  Arabic daily AL-HAYAH, which is published in several capitals.    At least 261 people have been killed since March 1992, when  Islamic militants stepped up their violent campaign aimed at  toppling the secular government of President Husni Mubarak.    The government has rounded up hundreds of suspects and  hanged  23 Moslem fundamentalists since June.</p>

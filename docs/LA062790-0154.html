			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> WARWICK: LET'S REFOCUS ON AIDS  </P> <P> Singer Dionne Warwick says AIDS education campaigns must target minorities, and  in words that are understandable to those who don't have a high-school diploma.  </P> <P> The Grammy-winning singer told an international AIDS and ethics forum Tuesday  that health officials have reached the educated, white, gay male population.  </P> <P> "We must develop new models that are culturally sensitive and  community-specific," Warwick said in calling for "bilingual" AIDS educators who  also know the language of the streets.  </P> <P> "Having our health decisions made by Caucasian males, while it has never been  satisfactory, is no longer acceptable," said Warwick.  </P></p>

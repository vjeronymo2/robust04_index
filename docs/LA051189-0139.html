			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAWRENCE TAYLOR IS FOUND INNOCENT OF DRUNKEN DRIVING IN NEW JERSEY  </P> <P> Linebacker Lawrence Taylor of the New York Giants was acquitted Wednesday of  drunken driving charges stemming from a March arrest on the Garden State  Parkway.  </P> <P> "The justice system works and I'm happy for myself," the eight-time All-Pro  said shortly after he was found innocent of the charges against him.  </P> <P> Municipal Judge John Conte found Taylor innocent based on testimony from two  doctors who said the National Football League star suffered from acute food  poisoning on the night of his arrest.  </P> <P> Authorities alleged Taylor was found sleeping at 3:30 a.m. March 24 behind the  wheel of his Jeep, which was parked on the shoulder of the Parkway. He was  charged with drunken driving despite two blood alcohol level readings of .09  percent. Under New Jersey law, .10 percent is considered legally drunk.  </P> <P> But food poisoning, and not alcohol, was the reason the NFL star felt ill, said  two physicians called as expert witnesses by Taylor's attorney.  </P> <P> Dr. Alan Lupinacci of West Paterson said Taylor became sick from an organism  contained in poorly prepared fettuccine Alfredo eaten on a flight from Atlanta  to Newark the day before his arrest.  </P> <P> Taylor has undergone drug rehabilitation twice in the last three years.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Second, the Technical Amendments of 1993 provide that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution that is not financially responsible under the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards of financial responsibility (except the cash reserve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement) is financially responsible if it establishes to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfaction of the Secretary, with the support of a financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement audited by an independent certified accountant with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally accepted accounting standards, that the institution has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient resources to ensure against the precipitous closure of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution, including the ability to meet all of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial obligations, including refunds of institutional charges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and repayments to the Secretary for liabilities and debts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incurred in programs administered by the Secretary. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary proposes to restate the statute, modifying it only to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propose to require that the financial statement be submitted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the proposed requirements for documentation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial responsibility that will be discussed later.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Technical Amendments of 1993 further provide that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution is not required to meet the general standards of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial responsibility (except for the cash reserve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement) if the institution is an institution that provides a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2-year or 4-year educational program for which the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> awards an associate or baccalaureate degree that demonstrates to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the satisfaction of the Secretary that there is not reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> doubt as to its continued solvency and ability to deliver quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational services, it is current in its payment of all current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities, including student refunds, repayments to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary, payroll, and payment of trade creditors and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withholding taxes, and it has substantial equity in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school-occupied facilities, the acquisition of which was the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct cause of its failure to meet the current operating ratio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement. The Secretary proposes to restate the statute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without modification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Documentation of Financial Responsibility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 498(c)(4) of the HEA provides that the determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an institution's financial responsibility be based on an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audited and certified financial statement of the institution or,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where appropriate, its parent corporation, conducted by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualified independent organization or person in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards established by the American Institute of Certified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Accountants. The statement must be submitted to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary when the institution is applying to begin or continue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. The statute further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides that the Secretary may require the submission of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional audits if the first submission does not establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the general standards of financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility. Although audited financial statements should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rendered in a uniform manner, there is some leeway with regards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to contents of the statements. The Secretary proposes to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions to submit financial statements on an annual basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within four months after the end of the institution's fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year. The Secretary believes that four months from the end of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's fiscal year is a sufficient period of time for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to submit a financial statement. The Secretary also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarifies that, upon request, the institution must provide or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise make available the accountant's work papers in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that all information relevant to preparing an audited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial statement is readily available. Institutions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already required to provide access to such information pursuant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to current &sect;668.23, and the Secretary proposes to reference that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> access to records in this proposed section. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes that an institution may be granted a filing extension to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution upon a showing of good cause. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intends that this extension would be granted on an infrequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis, as the Secretary believes it is imperative to have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial information from the institution that most accurately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflects the current financial situation of the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

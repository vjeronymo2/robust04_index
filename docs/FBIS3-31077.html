			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Miroslav Lazanski: "How To Control Guns"] </F>   [Text] NATO's ultimatum to the Serbian side in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina to withdraw heavy weapons at least 20  kilometers away from Sarajevo in 10 days or face bombing,  according to analysts, is direct military interference of the  Western military alliance, supporting one of the warring sides,  the Muslims, in the civil war in Bosnia.    What are the repercussions in case the Serbs withdraw their  heavy weapons 20 kilometers away from Sarajevo, and what are  they if they do not? What, after all, are the "heavy" weapons  of the Serbian army and what are criteria for determining that?  Could the withdrawal of these arms seriously weaken the  military position of the Serbs in comparison with that of the  Muslims? What will happen if the Serbs in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina reject NATO's ultimatum?  <H5>  Still in Range </H5>   The Serbian side around Sarajevo has artillery pieces of  76-,  105-, 122-, 130-, and 155-mm caliber, and the 128-mm Plamen and  Oganj multiple rocket launchers. They also have mortars of 60-,  81-, 82-, and 120-mm, as well as T-55 and T-54 tanks, and T-54  tanks with 100-mm guns. Are these the heavy arms that NATO  demands to be withdrawn? If the guns of 76- and 105-mm are  withdrawn 20 kilometers away from Sarajevo, the 130-mm guns with  the range of 28 kilometers would still be in range. So would  the 155-mm howitzers, which would reach Sarajevo suburbs, and  122-mm howitzers and the 128-mm Oganj multiple rocket launchers,  whose range is 21.8 kilometers.    Of course, the Serbs also have the 262-mm Orkan multiple  rocket launchers, whose range is over 50 kilometers. So, the  limit of 20 kilometers set by NATO does not solve anything.  True, it could remove the bulk of the Serbian artillery from  the separation line with the Muslim side in and around Sarajevo,  but cannot absolutely prevent attacks on the town itself, or its  suburbs, in case the fighting continues.  <H5>  What To Do With Factories </H5>   Moreover, mortars of 60-, 81-, 82-, and 120-mm are small and  can easily be hidden, which renders the control of withdrawal  virtually impossible. The Serbian side also has the light,  partisan-type, single barrel version of the Oganj and Plamen  missile launchers. These are also very easy to camouflage and  hide and can be used for attacks if the need for this arises.  There is also the question as to what to do with the 30-mm  self-propelled antiaircraft artillery pieces ("praga"), or those  of 57-mm (self propelled antiaircraft guns of Russian  production)? Are these also heavy weapons?    Will NATO also set an ultimatum to the Muslim side to move  artillery 20 kilometers away from Sarajevo? And where and in  what direction? The Muslims in Sarajevo have several guns of  105-, 122-, 130-mm, and several self-propelled artillery pieces  and tanks. Some of these had been left behind in the former  school center of the former Yugoslav People's Army for training  and the Muslim side modified them for use. Others came through  the violation of the arms embargo.    Members of Muslim units in Sarajevo have a fairly large  number of mortars of 60, 81, 82, and 120 mm. They also have  various recoilless guns of Pakistani, Turkish, Iranian, and  Western production. All these are of relatively small and can  be hidden, especially in the town. How will UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Force] control the withdrawal of these weapons to a  distance of 20 kilometers away from the town? Can UNPROFOR  representatives register accurately who violates cease-fires  with artillery just by placing themselves on the line separating  the warring sides? Hardly!    The withdrawal of the Serbian heavy arms to 20 kilometers  away from Sarajevo could be a direct provocative factor and  challenge for the Muslim side to launch an offensive of larger  proportions, especially because Washington holds the view that  the "Muslims should be given a chance to regain militarily what  they have lost in the war." In other words, NATO and the West  are trying, to put it graphically, to tie the hands and legs of  the Serbian side in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and then throw  it in the ring.    The withdrawal of the Serbian heavy weapons 20 kilometers  away from Sarajevo could endanger the vital sections of the  Serbian military industry: the Pretis factory in Vogosca, the  factory for aircraft engines in Rajlovac, the Famos factory, the  Koran factory for tank engines in Pale, and some other plants  for production of weapons and equipment. All these are  relatively close to Sarajevo. The reaction of the Serbs living  in Sarajevo, people who have stayed in their homes, is a special  problem. Will they start moving out?</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Doubt over rail freight sell-off MILLIONS OF tonnes of coal traffic will be lost as a result of the pit closure programme, worsening the outlook for the planned sale of BR's freight businesses as part of the privatisation process next year. Several thousand jobs in British Rail's coal train business are also likely to go. The closures are a particularly severe blow for BR because Trainload Coal, its coal-carrying business, is virtually the only profitable part of the railway. Trainload Coal's business consists almost entirely of carrying coal from pits to power stations. Last year it carried 75m tonnes, but British Coal says power stations are expected to take only 40m tonnes next year. BR will not say how many are employed by Trainload Coal, but the figure is believed to be 7,000. Up to half seem likely to lose their jobs. The downturn in business will jeopardise other parts of the railway because operations that share tracks, engine sheds or other facilities with Trainload Coal may not be viable if required to support the full costs of those assets alone. Operations likely to be affected include other parts of the Trainload Freight business - Trainload Construction, Trainload Petroleum and Trainload Metals. Trainload Freight reported turnover of Pounds 505.3m last year, of which Trainload Coal is believed to have contributed Pounds 300m. Mr Derrick Fullick, general secretary of the train drivers' union Aslef, said he feared that 11 engine sheds would be affected and that eight of them would have to close. Those most likely to be affected are the Stoke and Sunderland depots. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, claimed yesterday that up to 50,000 jobs in areas related to mining would be lost. Mr Andrew Glyn, an economist at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, estimated that a total of 78,600 jobs would disappear. Mr Dobson named 65 engineering and component supplier companies that might be affected. He said jobs in companies supplying the mining industry in towns as far away as Bracknell and Basingstoke were threatened. Labour said jobs were at stake among private contractors working in maintenance. Nacods, the supervisors union, says 15,000 contractors are employed by British Coal. BC said it could not confirm that because it employed companies, not individuals.</p>

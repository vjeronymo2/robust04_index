			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Provincial party Secretary Guan Guangfu spoke  at a provincial economic work meeting which opened on 13 January.    He said: [passage omitted] There is a need to: Strengthen  the position of agriculture as the foundation; bring into full  play the role of large and medium enterprises; pay attention to  the main points of economic growth; strengthen the construction  of basic facilities and basic industries; alleviate bottleneck  restrictions; expedite scientific and technological progress;  strengthen the weak links in textile and other light industries;  improve economic results and quality; and to promote the  sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national  economy. In terms of work methods, we must increase the  momentum in four aspects, namely, we must continue to increase  the momentum: Of reform, to ensure the implementation of the  party central committee and the State Council's reform measures  in Hubei; of opening up to the world, particularly to Hong Kong,  Macao, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States; of  development and promoting the good trend of Hubei's overall and  speedy economic development since Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  southern tour talks; and we must continue to increase the  momentum of implementing policies. The general target of  endeavor for this year is to catch up with the rest of the  country by focusing on economic construction so that  breakthroughs are made in all trades and undertakings.    To ensure the fulfillment of this year's tasks and  objectives, he stressed:    1. We must put agriculture in the first place of economic  work, optimize the rural economic structure, invigorate rural  markets, explore employment avenues, and invigorate the rural  economy.    2. We must improve large and medium state enterprises by  means of reform and opening up. This is the central issue in  this year's economic work. It is necessary to continue to  implement "Enterprise Law" and the relevant regulations, to put  into effect all decisionmaking rights of enterprises, to orient  enterprises toward markets, to reduce enterprises' burdens, to  create a relaxed external environment for enterprises, and to  make a breakthrough in establishing a new enterprise system.    3. We must strengthen the construction and technical  transformation of key industries and key enterprises so that  they are updated. In particular, we must pay attention to the  construction of the Three Gorges project and provide good  services for its construction and Hubei's development.    4. We must continue to widen the scope of opening up and  raise the proportion of the export-oriented economy; foreign  economic relations and foreign trade are aimed not only at  increasing foreign exchange earnings but also at providing  international market information for Hubei's economic  development and providing services for the improvement of its  economic quality and modernization.    5. We must strengthen the construction of transportation,  energy, telecommunications, and other basic facilities to create  good conditions for reform, opening up, and economic development.    He said: This is the third year of sustained economic  development since the province entered a fast development track  in 1992. The basic figures we have set are high and nor is the  development rate slow. However, facing sharp market  competition, we must understand that our fraternal provinces and  cities are also working with enterprising spirit. If we make  slow progress, we will fall behind. We must stand on the  heights of the era and strengthen our sense of urgency, our  sense of responsibility, and our sense of historical mission.    Guan Guangfu pointed out: We must pay full attention to the  main subject of reform and development and correctly handle the  relations between reform, development, and stability. Reform  can help emancipate the productive forces. Without reform,  there can be no major development, nor will there be prolonged  social stability. This will be a year in which the most reform  measures will be introduced. The current reform has an  important bearing on the establishment of the socialist market  economic structure. We must work in a down-to-earth manner with  full political enthusiasm and a clear-cut attitude to score a  complete victory in reform. To carry out this reform, we must  bring about upsurges in study. First, we must study Volume 3 of  the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and his new  concept, knowledge, and methods about the socialist market  economy. Second, we must further emancipate the mind and seek  truth from facts. Third, we must correctly handle the relations  between local and overall interests. [passage omitted] Fourth,  we must be good at proceeding from our actual conditions and  carrying out our work creatively. Fifth, we must persist in  dialectical materialism to reduce the faults in our work to a  minimum.    Guan Guangfu pointed out: This year, in the course of  deepening reform, we must continue to preserve the good trend of  speedy economic development, uphold the fact that development is  a fixed principle, persist in the principle of three  favorable's, maintain a firm grip on development, and regard  development as the central issue in handling the relations  between reform, development, and stability. Speeding up  development is needed in developing the economy, ensuring  supply, and in maintaining social stability. [passage omitted]    Guan Guangfu stressed: First, we must make a breakthrough  in the structural adjustment; second, we must develop our  economy to a certain scale; third, we must seek new  opportunities for more key projects; fourth, we must pay  attention to the method of using talented people to build Hubei  into a capital pool; fifth, we must further widen the scope of  opening up; sixth, we must expedite economic development along  the Chang Jiang and bring Wuhan City's leading role into play.    Guan Guangfu pointed out: Maintaining stable economic order,  as well as social and political stability, is a prominent issue  which should be given full attention this year. Stability is  the basic condition for smoothly carrying out reform, opening  up, and modernization. All localities should strengthen the  comprehensive management of social order, strengthen their clean  administration, and further improve the relations between the  party and the masses and between cadres and the masses. They  should properly resolve the arrears of wages for government  cadres before 1 February.    Guan Guangfu stressed: Strengthening leadership and ensuring  the implementation of policies are the crux of deepening reform  and expediting development this year. First, the implementation  of the party's basic line and major policies should be ensured;  second, leading groups at all levels should be further improved  because this is the organizational guarantee for implementing  policies; third, early preparations should be made for all  tasks; fourth, leaders and departments at all levels should form  a responsibility system for the fulfillment of targets during  their terms of office; fifth, leading cadres in all departments  should do actual work and tell the truth; sixth, collective  leadership should be combined with work distribution and  assuming responsibility for individual work; seventh, general  calls should be integrated with specific guidance.  Departmentalism is not allowed, nor is anyone permitted to keep  the advantages for himself and leave the difficulties for  others. [passage omitted]    During this economic work meeting, Governor Jia Zhijie held  discussions with comrades in charge of prefectures and cities on  this year's reform and development. Li Daqiang, standing  committee member, explained the participants' demands and  questions during the discussions.</p>

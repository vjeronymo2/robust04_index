			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Banana growers breathe more easily after EC deal - Canute James reports on Caribbean reactions to last week's compromise agreement CARIBBEAN BANANA producers are breathing much more easily in the wake of last week's compromise agreement by the European Community's farm ministers on a regime for marketing the fruit in Europe. The region's political and farm leaders have said, however, that the market for Caribbean produce in Europe is still threatened unless production costs can be reduced and quality improved. The Caribbean industry has concluded that its two main concerns of access and price have been met by the formula agreed by the farm ministers, and that the region's fruit will still be competitive against the cheaper, so-called 'dollar area' fruit from Latin America. Caribbean and African producers had feared that they would lose their market share to the more competitive fruit when a single European market was created next month. The four Windward Islands, which produce two out of every three bananas consumed in Britain, said they were satisfied with the new EC import regime, which is based on tariff quotas for Latin American fruit. In lobbying for guaranteed access to the European market the Caribbean and African producers had argued that the community had a legal obligation to protect their market, based on a protocol in the Lome Convention, an aid and trade treaty, under which the EC promises not to place its banana producers 'in a less favourable situation than in the past or the present'. The Caribbean producers feel that, with the dollar area fruit attracting duty of Ecu100 (Pounds 80) a tonne on its 2m tonnes - a - year quota, the region has a virtually guaranteed access for the remaining 1.5m tonnes a year that the EC will need, as the Ecu850-a-tonne duty that Latin American bananas will attract if they breach the quota will make the fruit too expensive. Mr James Mitchell, prime minister of St Vincent, said that with the new EC regime coming into effect in July, the Caribbean will have to improve the quality of its fruit. One repeated criticism of Caribbean fruit has been that its quality has been consistently lower than that of the Latin American fruit. 'The price which we can get will be better for good quality,' said Mr Mitchell. Dame Eugenia Charles, the prime minister of Dominica, feels that there is still a possibility that, even with the tariff, Latin fruit could be cheaper in Europe, bringing down prices paid for imports from the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of countries. The Jamaican government appears to have more reservations than others about the new arrangement, and plans consultation with its partners in the region, although they have already said they are satisfied. Mr David Coore, Jamaica's foreign trade minister, said there will be consultation with the Windward Islands' governments, and with banana distributors in the UK 'to determine whether this arrangement goes far enough and what further action, if any, we may need to take to protect our vital interests in this matter'. Jamaican farm leaders, however, appear more optimistic than the government. 'We were hoping to have a quota and assured entry, but with what has been allocated the Caribbean and other ACP producers, we will be able to survive,' concluded Mr Bobby Pottinger, president of the Banana Growers Association of Jamaica.</p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Fugitive Schneider fails to surface Nearly a month after the international hunt started for fugitive German businessman Jurgen Schneider, the world's police forces have drawn an embarrassing blank. Germany's Federal Criminal Office - the Bundeskriminalamt - said at the weekend it had made little headway in tracking down Mr Schneider, who is alleged to have misappropriated at least DM218m (Pounds 87.2m) of his collapsed property group's funds before disappearing last month. The Bundeskriminalamt, which has set up a special unit to deal with the case, has passed on details of Mr Schneider to other national police forces via the 174-member Interpol organisation in Lyons. The German police force's task is to find proof necessary to support the charge of fraud against the missing executive brought by Frankfurt prosecutors on April 26. Since he failed to return to Germany from a holiday in Tuscany at the beginning of April, the whereabouts of Mr Schneider, 59, has been the subject of widespread speculation. He has been reported to have been in a variety of places, including Paraguay, Switzerland, Tehran, Florida, London and even Frankfurt. But the reports so far have been insufficient to persuade the Bundeskriminalamt to send agents to particular parts of the world to locate him, a spokesman said. 'The trail has gone dead: the German police do not know which way to look,' said one investigator. The latest reported sighting came at the weekend, when a Swiss newspaper reported that Mr Schneider was hiding in a mountain hut. However, the Swiss authorities said they had no information to confirm or deny the report. Other interested parties in the search for Mr Schneider are German banks, which are owed DM5bn by the collapsed property group. Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, which claims DM500m of its money could be at risk, said it received 'several phone calls a day' from people claiming they knew where Mr Schneider was. The bank passed any useful information to the police since 'we are not manhunters', the bank said. One of the focal points in the search is Paraguay, where there have been at least two alleged sightings of Mr Schneider. In the past, Paraguay has harboured a number of German criminals, many of them linked to the Nazi party, and the country has a large German community. The Aktuelle Rundschau, Paraguay's main German-language newspaper, is following up several leads. A spokesman for Paraguay's immigration department said: 'Legally, he is not here. But he could have entered illegally under a different name.' The Bundeskriminalamt said that for the moment it was engaged in 'normal police work', sifting through documents confiscated last month from Mr Schneider's former headquarters in a castle in Konigstein, near Frankfurt. Mr Schneider is also under investigation by the finance ministry in the state of Hesse for alleged tax evasion. This inquiry was launched after numerous Schneider employees reported income on which they had not paid tax, worrying that they might face charges of tax evasion. The German banks have been tight-lipped about steps they may be taking to locate Mr Schneider or the money. They launched a successful action last month to freeze SFr200m (Pounds 93.4m) of Schneider funds traced to a number of Swiss banks. But the banks refused to confirm whether this cash was the DM219m Mr Schneider is known to have transferred out of Germany in March before he went missing. Popular cynicism that the reappearance of Mr Schneider on German soil could embarrass the banks, with detailed disclosures of his connections to big business and government, have fuelled speculation and interest in his whereabouts.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate for </F> Democratic Convergence, Farabundo Marti National Liberation  Front, and National Revolutionary Movement, by unidentified  reporter; place and date not given]    [Text] [Reporter] Following the collapse of the East  European statist economies, very few politicians are bold enough  to propose socialist-oriented government plans, something that  the Salvadoran left has been identified with for a long time.  What is the CD/FMLN/MNR [Democratic Convergence, Farabundo  Marti National Liberation Front, National Revolutionary  Movement] economic proposal for these elections?    [Zamora] There is certainly a common denominator among all  candidates. I personally do not like to talk about a social  market economy because the term no longer has any meaning in our  country. Everybody uses it, even when referring to different  aspects, such as Arena's [Nationalist Republican Alliance]  proposal. For example, the German social market economy is  completely different. Furthermore, this is a tautology, because  the market is social.    The first points in the CD/FMLN/MNR platform are based on  the  following concepts:    First, we believe in the existence of a market. It is the  most important force in the economy.    Second, because the market is deaf to certain signals, we  see  the role of the state as supplemental. The state must create  the legal framework, facilitate redistribution, and correct  market irregularities.    Third, our objective is to achieve self-sustained and  equitable economic development based on the new actors in the  economy. That is the difference between our proposal and  Arena's. Their proposal calls for a concentration of efforts on  strong capital under the assumption that there will be enormous  growth, which will subsequently bring well-being to society.  That is not what happens.    The income of Salvadorans has replaced coffee as the main  source of foreign exchange. For the first time in history, the  main source of foreign exchange comes directly from popular  sectors. Our strategy will not be based on excluding major  capital but on giving priority to the new actors: cooperatives,  the informal sector, and small and medium enterprises.    Fourth, we link social development to economic development.  We see social services -- especially health and education --  not as an expense but as an investment for economic development.    Our fifth pillar is Central American integration. Arena is  proposing integration strictly at the capital and technocratic  level. Many plans have been formulated without consulting  businessmen or other sectors. The integration we propose calls  for the participation of workers, businessmen, and the state.    [Reporter] You have said that you prefer not to talk about  social market economy. Your plan, however, must follow a path.  What path have you chosen?    [Zamora] We propose a method in accordance with all these  principles. It can be summarized in one expression: concerted  efforts.    The wisdom of economic development is not allowing the veto  to begin functioning as it did in the past. Workers veto  government plans and destabilize them; businessmen veto  government plans -- as in President Duarte's case -- because the  grass roots followed a policy of confrontation.    Government policy must be the result of concerted efforts  with the various sectors.    [Reporter] Leftist economic ideas have always been  associated  with statism, with planned economies. You have said you believe  in market forces. Does that mean you have given up the  socialist model?    [Zamora] I cannot give up something I never believed in. I  never believed in that type of socialism because, in my opinion,  it has never been real socialism. It was only statism and  control by a single party; that was it. Do not ask me to give  up something I never believed in. It would be too easy. It  would be like giving up the Spanish king's treasures. Of course  I would give them up because they were never mine.    This is an important question because I want to make one  thing clear: Our government will not be a government of our  coalition. It will be a government where the CD\FMLN\MNR forces  are present, but we will try to express concerted efforts.    There will be no nationalizations during our term. We do not  believe statization [estatizacion] should be exercised under  these circumstances. We are not in favor of expropriations. In  facing the problem of price controls, our position is that they  can only be allowed for a limited time when special  circumstances require them. We believe freezing prices is the  most absurd thing in the world.    We will seek a more efficient economy that is capable of  both  producing and allowing a better distribution of wealth, which is  now very limited.    [Reporter] What will be state's role be in the economy?  Developing a policy of assistance?    [Zamora] We disagree with a policy of assistance. The state  does play an important role in the economy. It has in the past.  Our country's development since the 1950's was based on the  state's support for major capital. It can be seen in all our  laws. Today criticizing the state is fashionable even though  all the major capital was created with state support.    We must determine the scope of state participation. We do  not believe in an enterprise state. The state has too many  problems to resolve to get involved in the hotel business or to  run a textile factory.    We propose a plan that will mean increasing expenses in the  social area. We have clearly proposed tripling the percentage  of GNP spent on education and health in the next five years.    [Reporter] How do you plan to finance those social  expenditures?    [Zamora] First, by redistributing the budget. We cannot live  with military budgets. We must transfer those funds to the  social area.    Second, by revising state expenses. The government spent  more than 20 million colones on radio and television from  October to December. I realize the state must spend money on  publicity when it offers a service and must inform the people,  such as the vaccination and identification card campaigns. It  is not necessary, however, to spend money to say that FINATA  [National Financial Institution for Agricultural Lands] is doing  a good job.    Third, by controlling tax evasion. The Finance Ministry has  estimated it at 40 percent. We believe it is closer to 50  percent. If we manage to reduce it to at least 30 percent, we  will have money for social expenses.    Finally, through international aid. We do not have to sit  back and watch how aid is being reduced. We must seek means of  cooperation.    We believe it is feasible to finance social expenses without  increasing taxes. We are not in favor of increasing taxes, but  we do feel they must be collected. For example, there is  widespread evasion of the value-added tax. There are 706  enterprises here controlling more than 70 percent of all sales.  We simply want people to comply with the law.    Our view is that the central government should be reduced so  local and municipal governments and associations can assume more  responsibility and resources.    [Reporter] In Latin America, the general practice of  opposition political parties has been to change the schemes of  outgoing governments and interrupt the continuity of programs.  What would your coalition do with the economic plan initiated  by the current government?    [Zamora] The key to the country's governability during this  period consists of recognizing the real relationship between  continuity and change.    Once the peace agreements were signed, the country began a  process of national agreement. It is expressed in a reformed  constitution which is the result of a consensus. Now it is not  a matter of starting from scratch every five years. We must see  what plans need modifications.    The current government's handling of macroeconomic variables  is quite healthy. Why change it? There are programs that  permit participation, such as Educo, which must be developed.  Of course, in other areas we will do things quite differently.  The possibility of an energy policy, for example, must be  considered. This government could not implement it, but it will  have to be done through a national agreement. Environmental  issues have been neglected. We will have to make changes there,  too. Credit policy has been mainly for those with more capital.  Now that we are in the electoral campaign, they are talking  about credits for small enterprises.    We must determine where change is necessary. We will analyze  each area one by one and decide where there should be  continuity, where corrections should be made, and where changes  are necessary.    That is our vision.</p>

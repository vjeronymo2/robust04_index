On 29 January  Yuriy Voronov, deputy chairman of the Abkhaz Council of  Ministers, appealed to delegates of the second World Congress of  Russian Unity to send a request to Boris Yeltsin to postpone his  visit to Tbilisi.    In Voronov's opinion, the Russian president's visit to  Georgia could result in bloodshed in Abkhazia because among the  documents to be signed is an agreement on major deliveries of  Russian military equipment to the Georgian army. Voronov said  that Yeltsin's previous two visits to the region led to military  conflicts, first in South Ossetia and then in Abkhazia.    Yuriy Voronov also called for the scrapping of special  procedures on the Russian-Abkhazian border which are aggravating  the crime situation in the border area.</p>

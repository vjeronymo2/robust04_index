			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / PowerGen plan for US float angers Treasury Ministers are angry with PowerGen, the electricity generator, for threatening to break ranks over the Pounds 4bn sale of the government's remaining shares in the generators. The Treasury plans to co-ordinate the sale of its shares in the two generators, PowerGen and National Power, by publishing a prospectus early next year. This will link the sale of the two companies by requiring the public to buy shares in both. PowerGen, which has outperformed National Power on the UK stock market, is considering seeking a US listing months ahead of the planned prospectus. The Treasury is concerned that information on regulatory structure developments facing the companies may have to be published ahead of schedule, tying its hands and making it harder for it to control events. PowerGen's US investors account for 7.5 per cent of its shareholding compared with National Power's 5 per cent. The generator said: 'The timing of the US listing is not critical but we would prefer to see it in place a little ahead of the sale (of the government's remaining shares) to avoid unnecessary complication.' PowerGen has told the Treasury that it is 'seriously considering' a US listing in November. National Power has made it clear that it has no intention of following PowerGen and instead plans to wait until next year. The government expects to start marketing the sale in mid January with a prospectus following about a month to six weeks later. Shares would be issued either in late February or early March. Both generators hope to increase their American shareholding by listing their shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Ministers wanted the generators to list their shares in the US simultaneously with the issuing of all the remaining government shares next year. It sold 60 per cent of each company when they were privatised three years ago. Both companies already have US shareholders who buy shares through American Depository Receipts on Wall Street but some big US institutions are more likely to buy shares if the generators are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Since the public will be required to buy shares in both companies, as in the March 1991 flotation, when 60 per cent of the shares were sold, the government wants to co-ordinate the marketing of the shares. Institutional shareholders will be expected to be given the choice of splitting their investment between PowerGen and National Power. PowerGen, however, may not prove susceptible to ministerial pressure to delay its US listing. It has shown itself to be individually minded, and quick to spot and take opportunities, such as building gas-fired power stations. More recently it repurchased 2.5m of its own shares, representing 0.3 per cent of the total shares in issue, which it believes could boost earnings per share and lift dividend payments.

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: LWT Congratulations to those LWT directors who have sold 13 per cent of their shareholdings at the first opportunity. Like any sensible fund-manager they have top-sliced a windfall profit - making sure of a cosy Christmas while keeping a stake in the business. Despite institutional claims that the kerfuffle over LWT is pure hindsight, the likely consequences were clear at the time. Nor is it clear how investing institutions would react were a similarly bizarre proposal to emerge now. Many apparently find it difficult to object if boards and their financial advisers are agreed on a course of action. Yet unless shareholders find the will to break the cosy consensus, such excessive schemes may not be just a feature of the frothy 1980s.</p>

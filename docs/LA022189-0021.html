			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLACK MARKET BASED ON 'BEER STANDARD' FLOURISHES IN MARXIST ANGOLA  </P> <P> Domingos Francisco, a 15-year-old in a Michael Jackson T-shirt, studied the  passing prey from behind mirrored sunglasses. Slowly, he began to grin the grin  of dollar signs. He had a live one.  </P> <P> "Have a look," he said, selecting a slightly scuffed black loafer from his  tilted wooden table. "Real Italian leather. A good price, too."  </P> <P> How much?  </P> <P> "Sixty thousand kwanzas," said the would-be tycoon. At Angola's bank, about  $2,000. On Angola's quirky black market, based on a "beer standard," about 24  cans of Heineken.  </P> <P> Good old Western capitalism, with a touch of Yankee profiteering, is surfacing  in the darndest places in Africa. Here in Marxist Angola, atop a sunbaked old  trash dump overlooking the Atlantic, is a new market called Roque Santeiro,  "the miracle worker." And anyone with a little nerve can make a fast buck.  </P> <P> It's all illegal, of course. But everyone from Angolan police officers to Cuban  soldiers to Portuguese diplomats are too mesmerized by the sheer variety of the  selection to complain: light bulbs and batteries, argyle socks and Winston  cigarettes, lace panties and nylon boxer shorts, even toy trucks. All theirs  for a fistful of kwanzas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Government Overlooks It  </P> <P> And the Angolan government, trying to resurrect an entrepreneurial spirit  deadened by 13 years of state controls, is looking the other way.  </P> <P> "There's been an intoxication here with the rhetoric of Marxism over the  years," the ambassador of a small African nation said recently. "But in  practical terms, between us, it doesn't amount to much today."  </P> <P> All across Africa, from Tanzania and Ghana -- birthplaces of African socialism  -- to Mozambique and Congo, capitalism is peeking out from beneath the  smothering blanket of Marxism. Countries are peddling their state enterprises  to private firms, letting their currencies float, lifting price controls and  generally trying to ride free-market forces out of their troubles.  </P> <P> The independence movement in Namibia, for example, is amending its long  commitment to socialism as it prepares to take over the newest sovereign nation  in Africa. Seeing the rough going for state control in most of Africa, the  South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) recently announced that it  supports limited private enterprise in an independent Namibia.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Deal With Realities'  </P> <P> "Everybody has to deal with realities," Anatoly L. Adamishin, the Soviet  Union's deputy foreign minister for Africa, said recently. "Personally, I don't  think they are going to build socialism in Namibia. And there are few people in  the Soviet Union who would advise them to."  </P> <P> Angola is the newest and one of the most surprising examples of Africa's move  away from state-controlled economies.  </P> <P> Strongly tied to the Soviet Union and officially unrecognized by the United  States, the Angolan government began to embrace a free-market economic recovery  plan about a year ago.  </P> <P> The government has not accomplished much so far, but it has drafted some new  laws, ended price controls on fruits and vegetables and promised to eventually  sell off the state-run companies, open a Chamber of Commerce and invite foreign  investment.  </P> <P> But the nation's change of heart, along with its willingness to sign the  U.S.-mediated peace accord with Cuba and South Africa, has raised hopes here  not only for an economic recovery but also for a thaw in Angolan-American  relations and an increase in development aid.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Oil Earnings Finance War  </P> <P> Although rich in oil and easily capable of feeding itself, Angola remains one  of Africa's least-developed countries. About half of the country's oil earnings  is used to pay for its 13-year war with the U.S.-backed rebels of Jonas  Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola. (The Soviet  Union contributes $1.5 billion a year in military assistance to the government,  U.S. officials say.)  </P> <P> The war has forced 1 million people from their homes in the countryside,  leaving them with a margin of survival that is "very, very slim," a U.N. relief  worker said. One child in three dies before its fifth birthday. Only in  Afghanistan and Mozambique do children have less of a chance to survive.  </P> <P> The seaside capital of Luanda, once a picture postcard of coffeehouses and  Portuguese architecture, is a study in decay. Many elevators have not worked  for years, and long ago the salt air turned the pastel facades a slate gray.  Interruptions in the water supply are so frequent and persistent that one  embassy keeps a private stock and sends its workers home with buckets full.  Hospitals exist, but medicine does not.  </P> <P> "What happens if we get sick?" a recently arrived relief worker asked an  Angolan health official.  </P> <P> "If you're tough, you live," the official said. "If you're not, you die."  </P> <P> Housing is scarce, and foreign diplomats, relief officials and even U.N.  workers must often spend months in crowded, $100-a-night government hotels  awaiting permanent accommodations. Large steel crates used for oceangoing  freight are being turned into middle-class housing in one neighborhood.  </P> <P> One of Angola's most glaring shortages is of skilled workers. Hundreds of  thousands of Portuguese workers, from plumbers to economists, left in 1975 when  Angola became independent from Portugal. Now Angola spends much of its valuable  foreign exchange earnings to hire foreign companies for the simplest tasks.  </P> <P> Luanda's garbage, for example, is carried away these days by a German-owned  firm, run by Swiss managers, that imports everything from trucks to garbage  bins.  </P> <P> Roque Santeiro is one of the signs that things are changing in Angola. The  market pulses like a Prohibition-era saloon, festive and nervous. On a recent  afternoon, a pair of Angolan soldiers chasing a thief through the crowd fired  two shots into the air, sending hundreds of women with heavy shopping bags  diving for cover beneath wooden tables topped with merchandise.  </P> <P> "Normally, I try not to come here. I don't feel safe," Alice Schacht, a  38-year-old single mother, confided. "But at least you can buy things."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shelves Are Never Bare  </P> <P> Roque Santeiro, and several new markets like it, are the only places in Luanda  where the shelves are never bare. Striped slacks, soda pop, watches, children's  shoes, tape players, shoes, deodorant spray and irons are among the goods that  seem to materialize out of thin air. Prices at the market are set by the force  of demand, not by government fiat as in the rest of Angola.  </P> <P> "Everywhere else in the world, some people work in the government and other  people prefer to work in the market. That's what we do here," said a woman  selling children's clothing, who identified herself only as Maria. "If we buy  this pack of cigarettes for 2,000, and sell it for 2,500, we win 500. Then we  take that money and look for other things to sell."  </P> <P> Domingos Francisco, like most of the marketeers, buys his wares early each  morning at the docks from ships arriving from Europe. When school lets out, he  becomes a shopkeeper, carefully displaying only one shoe of a pair to guard  against theft. He says he makes a profit of about $2.50 a day.  </P> <P> "My family needs many things," he said, "so I must sell things to try and help  them."  </P> <P> The markets serve a valuable purpose in Angola's economy by providing a safety  valve for the overvalued local currency. The official exchange rate is 29  kwanzas to the dollar at the bank, but everywhere else it is 2,000 to 1.  </P> <P> That puts foreign embassies and foreign companies in a bind. To pay their local  employees a living wage would require millions of dollars at the official  exchange rate. A pair of shoes at Francisco's stand would cost $2,000, for  example.  </P> <P> So, many foreign firms use the "beer standard" to meet their payrolls. They  give employees credit at a government supermarket that caters to foreigners and  accepts only dollars. The workers use their credit to buy Heineken or Beck's  beer, for about 50 cents a can, then carry the beer across the street and sell  it for 1,000 kwanzas a can, roughly 70 times the price at the official rate of  exchange.  </P> <P> Beer, hot or cold, is the most readily convertible currency in Angola.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pushed by Lenders  </P> <P> Like most countries in Africa, Angola was pushed toward free-market principles  by its need for Western development help. Organizations such as the World Bank  and the International Monetary Fund, heavily influenced by the United States,  insist on a Western-style economic recovery plan before lending money or  assistance to African nations.  </P> <P> Until recently, the only major relief organizations working in Angola were  UNICEF and the Red Cross. But half a dozen international relief agencies have  set up offices or made exploratory visits in the last year.  </P> <P> The desire for friendship with the United States burns deeply, and it was  partly for this reason that Angola agreed to the recent peace accord that calls  for 50,000 Cuban troops to leave Angola and for free elections in neighboring  Namibia.  </P> <P> Yet Angola remains entwined in a superpower stalemate. While both the Soviet  Union and the United States supported the peace agreement, the Soviets continue  to support the government army and the Americans continue to support the  anti-government guerrillas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. Oil Companies Active  </P> <P> Americans already do plenty of business with Angola. American oil companies  extract 90% of this country's petroleum. UNICEF distributes $6 million a year  in U.S. food aid. But the United States has never had formal diplomatic ties  with the Angolan government.  </P> <P> "Normalization of relations with the United States is very important to us,"  Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos told American journalists recently.  "We have a poor and small country. We have no interest in confrontation with a  superpower."  </P> <P> A prime piece of real estate near Luanda is often cited as evidence of Angola's  sincerity. Situated on a hilltop with sweeping ocean views, the plot has been  vacant throughout the more than 13 years of independence.  </P> <P> Local folklore has it that the government is holding the lot open for an  American embassy.  </P></p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / International Company News: Dasa faces sharp decline in new orders DEUTSCHE Aerospace (Dasa), German aircraft maker, faces a sharp decline in new orders and the two most difficult years in its history, according to Mr Jurgen Schrempp, chairman. New contracts signed this year will be worth less than DM15bn, against the DM22bn originally expected. The decline is all the more dramatic since Dasa's parent, Daimler-Benz, said in its half-year report it still expected 1992 orders to increase. In the first nine months new contracts had been signed to a value of DM9.7bn, against DM11.5bn in the comparable part of 1991. Even so, Mr Schrempp said in an interview with a German news agency, the industry would see an improvement in the medium and long term. Dasa's recent stake in Fokker, the Dutch aircraft maker, laid the foundations for a successful European regional aircraft maker. He was also optimistic that the project for 'a version' of the politically-smitten European Fighter Aircraft (Efa) would go ahead. He said he was confident ministers and air force leaders, due to meet this month and next would give the go-ahead. In the meantime, Dasa has DM38bn of orders on hand, compared with DM40bn last year. Despite difficulties, Dasa would have a positive operating result and make a major contribution to Daimler's earnings this year, Mr Schrempp claimed. It made DM50m profit on sales of DM12.3bn last year. But he also spoke of hefty provisions to pay for capacity cuts. The company recently announced the loss of 7,500 jobs over the next two years, and warned that more will go if Efa is cancelled.</p>

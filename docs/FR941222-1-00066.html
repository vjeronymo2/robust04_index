			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on response data from the RCRA Section 3007  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Questionnaire, the 1991 volume reported by the industry for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewaters from anthraquinone dye and pigment production was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3,988,166 metric tons, or approximately 2.9 million gallons per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day, generated at 25 facilities. Most of the wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently is treated and discharged to a surface water under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPDES system; the remainder is discharged to a POTW (with 5%  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pretreated prior to discharge). Additional information on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volumes and waste managment is not included at the present time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due to business confidentiality concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the 25 facilities that generate this waste, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collected a total of seven samples from the four largest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contributors to the wastestream and from one small contributor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information relevant to this discussion is not included at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present time due to business confidentiality concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated above, several compounds used in anthraquinone dye  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and pigment operations were expected to be present in the waste,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on facility production schedules, and were not detected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, only one compound attributable to anthraquinone dye  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and pigment production was detected in the waste (refer to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background Document for this rulemaking located in the RCRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Docket for this rule (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section) for the methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in identifying contaminants attributable to a process).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This compound, 3-aminoacetanilide, was present in five of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seven samples collected, at an average concentration of 0.15 ppm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, health effects information needed to assess the risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> posed by this constituent does not currently exist. In order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate the potential risk from 3-aminoacetanilide, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed a risk assessment using methylenephenylenediamine as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surrogate compound. The Agency selected a surrogate compound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is structurally similar to the compound detected in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 3-aminoacetanilide), and is estimated, by means of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structural activity relationships (SARs), to be more toxic than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the subject compound. This assessment produced a groundwater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration, prior to dilution and attenuation, of 1.5 times  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the HBL. Thus, the concentration at the receptor well, following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dilution and attenuation, would be expected to be less than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HBL. More detailed discussions on the risk assessment screening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and surrogate compounds are presented in Section II.D of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble, Description of Health and Risk Assessments, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Listing Background Document for this proposed rule, which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> located in the RCRA Docket for this rulemaking (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In conclusion, because the one compound attributable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anthraquinone dye or pigment production detected in this waste is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present in low concentrations, does not have health data needed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to assess risk, and does not indicate a risk using surrogate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicity data, the Agency is proposing not to list wastewaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the manufacture of anthraquinone dyes and pigments as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.Wastewaters from the production of FD&amp;C colorants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing not to list wastewaters from the production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of FD&amp;C colorants as hazardous wastes. This wastestream is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered to pose significant risks to human health and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment, based on the analysis of samples of the waste. Only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three constituents attributable to FD&amp;C colorant processes were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detected in the waste, and these do not present a risk at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations observed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire data, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volume reported by the industry for the wastewater stream from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FD&amp;C colorant production is 3,557,563 metric tons per year, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.6 million gallons per day. Information on the percentage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these wastewaters that are currently pretreated and discharged to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a POTW and other waste management information relevant to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion is not included at the present time due to business  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confidentiality concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency collected three samples of wastewaters generated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from FD&amp;C operations and did not find any hazardous constituents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present at concentrations that pose a risk above EPA's initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk ``level of concern'' ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 1E&hyph;5 for carcinogens, and HQ of 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or greater). The Agency believes that the samples of wastewaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the manufacture of FD&amp;C colorants are representative of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry. In fact, wastewater samples were collected from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two largest-volume FD&amp;C colorant producers in the country, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to one smaller manufacturer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several of the raw materials used in the manufacture of FD&amp;C  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> colorants were dropped from the Agency's target analyte list for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis of dye and pigment wastes because the few existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health studies on these compounds indicate that the compounds are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-toxic. In addition, many of the raw materials used in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacture of FD&amp;C colorants are compounds that contain sulfonic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acid functional groups, for which analytical methods do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exist. Examples of FD&amp;C raw materials dropped from the target  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyte list for these reasons include  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> p <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -toluidine- <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -sulfonic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acid, and sulfanilic acid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The sulfonic acid functional group imparts water solubility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a compound, which generally results in lower toxicity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, several of these materials may pose a risk when present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the wastestream without the sulfonic acid functional group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, without sulfonic acid functional groups, the two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds listed above ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> p <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -toluidine- <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -sulfonic acid and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sulfanilic acid) are represented by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> p <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -toluidine, and aniline,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively. In these cases, the precursors to the FD&amp;C  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactants ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , prior to sulfonation) remained as target  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analytes even when the sulfonated compounds were not on the list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information relevant to this discussion is not included due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business confidentiality concerns. (Refer to the Dye and Pigment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Listing Background Document, located in the RCRA Docket for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rulemaking (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section), for details on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of the target analyte list.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

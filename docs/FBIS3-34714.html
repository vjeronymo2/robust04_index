			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aharon Klein] </F>   [Text] A senior military source attached to the Southern  Command yesterday said: "The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is  deployed and ready to withdraw from the major population centers  in the Gaza Strip and move to the blocs of Jewish settlements.  The IDF will be capable of carrying out such an operation  within one month." The source asserted that the preparations for  the dismantling and evacuation of the military bases were mostly  over while the preparations for the construction of alternative  bases inside the blocs of settlements were at an advance stage.    The senior military source added that the Southern Command  and the General Staff's Logistic's Branch have been making  preparations for a withdrawal over the past few months, while  gearing themselves up to complete the evacuation process by  mid-April 1994, as stipulated by the Document of Principles.  The evacuation process was scheduled to start at the beginning  of March and end in mid-April. "We can withdraw within one  month and if necessary we can do it in even less time," the  source said, noting that "obviously, the date will be decided by  the political echelon. Therefore, one month for evacuation is  sufficient time as far as we are concerned. We have carried out  more difficult things before."    The IDF will summon hundreds of drivers for reserve duty to  help carry out the withdrawal. Some of the drivers have already  received calls to report to reserve duty. These drivers will  help transfer the equipment and the structures in trucks and  transporters from the IDF bases inside Palestinian population  centers in the Gaza Strip. "Everything that is supposed to be  transferred is already marked, noted down in the catalogue, and  anchored in detailed evacuation plans," the source noted. "In  most cases, all we have to do is to load the equipment on the  truck or transporter and start driving."</p>

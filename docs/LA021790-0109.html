			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> EUROPE, AFRICA;  </P> <P> STUDY FINDS BETTER AIRPORT SECURITY  </P> <P> A U.S. commission on aviation security and terrorism appointed after the Flight  103 disaster said that airport security has improved in Europe. But, "if there  is an Achilles' heel in aviation security, it is Africa, which is literally a  basket case," said Rep. James L. Oberstar (D-Minn.), chairman of the House  Public Works and Transportation subcommittee on aviation.  </P> <P> Oberstar, at a London news conference, cited poor training for security  personnel, high staff turnover, insufficient detection equipment and economic  pressures on African governments for shortcomings there. President Bush  appointed the seven-member commission after Pan AM Flight 103 from Frankfurt to  New York via London was blown up by a terrorist bomb over the Scottish town of  Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988.  </P></p>

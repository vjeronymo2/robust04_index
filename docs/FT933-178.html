			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Arts: Today's Television It is always salutary for the English to be reminded of how much the world owes to the Scottish genius for invention. Small Objects of Desire (BBC 2, 10.10) is an ingenious and worthwhile series. Tonight it examines the influence on our lives of the hypodermic syringe which was invented in 1853 by a Scottish physician called Alexander Wood. Critical Eye: The Women at Ten Downing Street (C4, 9.00) follows the wearisome and depressing course of a strike at a metal furnishing factory in the West Midlands. Asian women are not a group who have yet made much of a mark in this country for their militancy. In this case, bad pay, compulsory overtime and poor working conditions led to the women picketting the factory for over a year. American fiction and cinema has gained greatly for putting convicts into chain-gangs, something which so far as I know the British penal system has not used this century. 'Cool Hand Luke' with Paul Newman is one of my favourite films so I will ignore the critical consensus and watch Brubaker (C4, 10.00) in which another Old Delectable, Robert Redford, swings his hammer.</p>

One week ago, General Picon, former chairman of the 4th  Supreme Council of Military Justice, assumed command of Peru's  4th Military Region, headquartered in Cusco, a south Andes  region. According to Radio Programas del Peru Network, the  tragedy occurred under circumstances that have not been clearly  explained yet, when the aircraft was overflying Cusco's Velasco  Astete Airport.    According to an initial military report, the helicopter  crashed for lack of fuel, but witnesses told the radio station  that the aircraft exploded in the air, before crashing. This  second version involves the possibility of the incident being a  terrorist attack.    The crash zone, a 200 square meter area over which the  helicopter debris and bodies of the passengers are spread, has  been surrounded by troops who are keeping the media away.</p>

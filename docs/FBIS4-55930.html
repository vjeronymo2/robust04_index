			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 24 -- After a twelve-minute long session  attended by President Lech Walesa, the cabinet Tuesday decided  to approve of his proposal and pass on a document outlining  major changes in the organization of the Polish Armed Forces to  the National Defence Committee (KOK).    Walesa told reporters after the session that he had asked  the  prime minister and the cabinet to transfer discussion on topics  that "are very important and must not breed conflicts between  us" to the KOK forum.    The president also described the topics contained in the  document, drafted by the National Defence Ministry, as delicate  and requiring in-depth discussion.    Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak noted that KOK members  include  the Sejm and Senate speakers, along top representatives of the  executive branch.    According to Defence Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk, the  document was very mature and there was no need for changes in  it. He also said that the document concerned very important  matters and its final elaboration should not be done under the  pressure of time. Kolodziejczyk acknowledged the right of the  KOK to deal with the matter.    The document provides for the establishment of command  centres for the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. The joint  commander of all three kinds of Armed Forces would report to the  minister of defence. An earlier version of the proposal  envisaged that he would report directly to the president.</p>

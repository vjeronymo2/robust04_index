			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / New school check Mr John Patten, education secretary, yesterday took extra powers to intervene in the running of schools in England and Wales. Inspectors will now be asked to visit schools which have not been classified as 'failing' by Ofsted, the education watchdog, but which have been found to have 'serious problems'. The Department for Education believes that around one in 10 secondary schools inspected could be covered by this description.</p>

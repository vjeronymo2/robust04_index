			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Ocosingo Message" by Eduardo Robledo Rincon, Mexican </F> Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, candidate for the  Chiapas governorship, broadcast over the radio to residents of  Chiapas jungle from Ocosingo on 23 May]    [Text] Red Radio Chiapas, Ocosingo, 23 May 1994    I came to Ocosingo, gateway to the Chiapas jungle, to add my  efforts toward peace. I came to express my respect for those  who risk their lives in the defense of their ideals. I have  said it: I agree with broad sectors of Chiapas society which  believe the social demands that have been made are just. I also  believe, however, just as broad sectors believe, that the path  chosen has resulted in grief, pain, and sacrifice.    I understand that the people of Chiapas must do something  soon. We must do it right to work for reconciliation. We must  make an effort to have peace with justice and to have the  dignity that all people of Chiapas want.    I am convinced that electoral campaigns -- I am not  referring  to mine, but to those of all parties -- must effectively aid the  reconciliation. I believe this, and I have made my campaign a  parallel path for reconciliation. Society must know that.    Therefore, I urge all parties to put differences aside and  make this campaign a crusade for peace. Let us make it an  offensive for peace, like commissioner Manuel Camacho said.    I think everyone, especially the parties, should do his  share  and do it well. We must work from the bottom up, adding not  subtracting. I think that is the way to move closer to peace.    The state's political conditions, which stem from ancestral,  economic, and social problems, call for new rules.    In Chiapas, we must turn our backs on the past, but not on  all of the past. We must remember the best of it. We must be  conservative. We must preserve our culture and old traditions.    In Chiapas, especially in this region, where children do not  attend school and where they die of hunger, where hundreds,  perhaps thousands do not know how to read or write, we must  think of realistic ways to build them a new future, a future  that will guarantee them the right to be born and to live with  dignity. We must build a future that guarantees health,  development, education, housing, employment, and land,  especially land, for them. In other words, we need to guarantee  that everyone will have food tomorrow.    How should we treat this land issue? How should we reconcile  historical reason with the law?    Chiapas has been a different Chiapas since 1 January. Many  of us knew it, but many more just discovered this pluralistic  society: We are several races; we are from several regions; we  speak different languages; we have different climates; we have  different temperaments; we have different religious beliefs.    I believe the secret lies in how to direct this social  energy  toward building a common future; how to make all this strength,  all this energy, a great social victory for the Chiapas people.    I agree with those who say that Chiapas is a heck of a town  to defeat.    I think this new pact can be considered a proposal. It is  like a method of discussion for finding agreements that will  allow us to build our future.    This is why I insist that we should make this political  campaign a permanent debate. It should be a basis for finding  that which unites us and rejecting that which separates us.    This social pact must be implemented by society. To do this,  I propose forming a pluralistic government. When I say  pluralistic government, I am not just referring to a government  with many parties in it. I am referring to a government that  will unite its different religious, environmental, regional,  political, economic, and social aspects.    To do that, we need:     -  just laws, an autonomous judicial  branch, an honest police force, and fair economic  laws;    -  sustainable economic development. We must guarantee an  economic system that will promote the welfare of the population  without jeopardizing opportunities for future  generations;    -  thorough social reform based on education to supply  the necessary tools for finding jobs;    -  democracy based on  legality and legitimacy.     I offer a pluralistic government that will use Chiapas' best  men, regardless of their party affiliation. I will not rule  with my friends. All I need to form a new government is men who  are honest, conscientious, and competent.    Transition is a process. To implement it without problems,  we must have a strong government, a government that cannot be  short-termed. I propose a strong government, very strong; a  government whose strength is based on the law, on what is right,  on consensus, on legitimacy; a government based on the people's  support and on pluralism.</p>

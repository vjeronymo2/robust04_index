			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD-BUSTING OPENING FOR 'GHOSTBUSTERS II'  </P> <P> Soaring temperatures must bring out a taste for slime, or at least ectoplasmic  eradication, according to this weekend's box office figures. "Ghostbusters II"  burst ahead of all other films in ticket sales and broke records for the  biggest non-holiday weekend opening.  </P> <P> Although the sequel played on 1,073 more screens than its supernatural  predecessor, and ticket prices have increased by more than 22% since the  slimebusting foursome made their debut in June, 1984. Roughly 2 million more  people went to see "Ghostbusters II" than saw the opening weekend of the first  "Ghostbusters," which went on to become the highest-grossing comedy of all time  at $220 million. The latest installment garnered about $29.5 million in ticket  sales on its first three days out, beating the original "Ghostbusters" which  grossed $13 million, according to John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations  Inc. which compiles box office figures.  </P> <P> "Ghostbusters II" also set an all-time record for a one-day opening, netting  about $10 million on Friday, according to industry estimates.  </P> <P> The performance of "Ghostbusters II" also provides the first hit under the  aegis of Columbia Pictures' president Dawn Steel and will undoubtedly firm her  position as studio chief. One of Steel's first moves after becoming president  in October, 1987, was to reinstate the sequel, which had languished on the  shelf during the brief administration of British producer David Puttnam.  </P> <P> Puttnam, who had said he did not believe in high-priced sequels, tangled  publicly with Creative Artists Agency over the film and had discussed making  the movie with other, lesser-known actors to keep costs down.  </P> <P> The sequel, which, like its predecessor was directed by Ivan Reitman and stars  Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson and Sigourney Weaver,  premiered Friday and can be seen on 2,410 screens across the country. The first  "Ghostbusters" premiered on significantly fewer -- 1,339 -- screens.  </P> <P> Sales for "Ghostbusters II's" first three days narrowly beat out those for the  opening wekend of "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," which made about $29.4  million its first Friday through Sunday, breaking all records for a sequel.  ("Indiana Jones" opened on the four-day Memorial Day weekend and earned more  than $46 million Friday through Monday.)  </P> <P> "It's pretty exciting," said Columbia Marketing President Buffy Shutt "I think  we expected a big opening. But, it's always a wonderful surprise when you have  the biggest three-day gross ever."  </P> <P> Ticket sales for No. 2 "Jones" dropped to $11.7 million, down 27% from last  weekend. "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier" dropped to $7.1 million, down 60%  from its opening two weekends ago, and landed in the No. 4 spot.  </P> <P> On the other hand, "Dead Poets Society" -- a drama starring Robin Williams as  an eccentric poetry instructor at an East Coast prep school -- gained by about  20% and remained in third place. It was in third place last week when it was  only playing in 687 theaters and kept its hold on that spot this week after the  number of theaters showing it was upped to 1,091.  </P> <P> This weekend the ghost-busting quartet will face more competition when Warners'  much-hyped "Batman" swoops into theatres Friday. Also opening this weekend is  "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids."  </P> <P> </P> <P> WEEKEND BOX OFFICE  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.76IN:2.77IN:2.00IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Weekend Gross/  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Screens/  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Weeks  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Movie(Studio)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Total(millions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Average  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> in Release  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1."Ghostbusters II"  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $29.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,410  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> (Columbia)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $29.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $12,229  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 2."Indiana Jones"  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $11.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,327  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> (Paramount)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $122.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $5,039  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 3."Dead Poets Society"  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $9.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,091  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> (Disney/Touchstone)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $22.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $8,343  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 4."Star Trek V"  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $7.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,202  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C">  2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> (Paramount)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $31.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $3,247  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 5."See No Evil"  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $2.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,686  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> (Tri-Star)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $38.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $1,512  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

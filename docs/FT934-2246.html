			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Lawyers told to end court 'abuse' Lawyers in serious fraud cases were warned yesterday by an Old Bailey judge not to go on 'fishing expeditions' which were forbidden by law and an abuse of court processes. Judge Neil Denison made his remarks as he discharged three witness summonses obtained by lawyers acting for Mr Mohammed Baqi against accountants Price Waterhouse, the Bank of England and Treasury solicitors. Mr Baqi, former managing director of Attock Oil, is due to face trial next year on charges arising from the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. He is charged with dishonestly supplying documents to BCCI's auditors Price Waterhouse. The judge said the summons against Price Waterhouse required the firm to produce all the documents in the BCCI case. This was no more than 'a fishing expedition' in the hope that a trawl through the vast amount of papers which Price Waterhouse would have to analyse at their own expense might produce something useful to the defence, he said. The summonses against the Bank of England and Treasury solicitors had a similar purpose. The judge said: 'This sort of fishing expedition is expressly forbidden by law and to try to get it by witness summons is an abuse of the process of the court.' When judges and lawyers engaged in large fraud trials were constantly exhorted by the Court of Appeal to narrow the issues to be considered by juries the issue of witness summonses such as these would do nothing to simplify the trial, he said.</p>

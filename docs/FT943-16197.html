			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / French troops will 'retaliate': Pledge on Rwandan refugee zone French troops will 'retaliate' if the refugee zone they have created in south-west Rwanda is attacked, Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, said yesterday. But French officials said that, after capturing the capital Kigali, the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) forces had by midday yesterday stopped some 10km short of the line created by French and Senegalese troops around the rapidly filling refugee zone. The French Foreign Ministry said the number of refugees had doubled in the past few days to 400,000, without specifying their ethnic origin, and French troops had on Monday disarmed militia whose 'behaviour was threatening'. Mr Juppe said it was nonsense to suggest France was establishing the safe haven 'as a means of protecting government troops or of blocking the RPF'. He told a press conference the main part of the government forces lay outside the refugee zone, while a French envoy had discussed in Kampala, Uganda, on Monday with General Paul Kagame, the RPF military leader, 'ways of putting the security zone into effect'. The French foreign minister said it was absurd to think 'the total victory of the RPF would settle the problem' and that, after the fall of Kigali to the RPF, 'the reasons for a ceasefire are all the greater'. Admiral Jacques Lanxade, French chief of staff, affirmed yesterday French troops would 'continue to be neutral' so as to help 'all those who felt themselves threatened'. Reuter adds from Kigali: The RPF said yesterday it would form a government within days and declare a ceasefire but hit out at France for what it saw as threats over the safe zones. Maj Gen Paul Kagame, RPF commander, said at a seized Kigali barracks: 'The French must recognise our sovereign rights in our own country. We don't mind having zones where civilians will be protected but the way the matter is being handled raises questions. It comes across as a threat.'</p>

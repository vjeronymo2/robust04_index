			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFF-ROAD GRAN PRIX;  </P> <P> HE'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE MOST RIVALS  </P> <P> At 6 feet 8 inches, Vince Tjelmeland is the tallest professional race driver in  the country, standing two inches higher than Chris Knievel, the Indy car and  Trans Am driver who previously held that distinction in a sport of mostly  jockey-sized competitors.  </P> <P> T. J., as the Yorba Linda ultra-stock driver is better known, finds the  circumstances amusing, and at times favorable.  </P> <P> "No one can borrow my race car," he said during practice for tonight's Mickey  Thompson Off-Road Gran Prix in the Rose Bowl. "They can't reach the pedals."  </P> <P> Several years ago, when Dan Gurney, 6-2, was contracted to drive a sports car  at LeMans, the builders made a bubble in the roof to accommodate Gurney's head.  Tjelmeland did it differently.  </P> <P> "They put a chair down in the garage, put me in it and built the car around  it," he said.  </P> <P> Tjelmeland will drive a Nissan Pulsar tonight in the ultra-stock race, a  one-of-a-kind class developed by the late Mickey Thompson for stadium racing.  The cars were designed to resemble drag racing's funny cars -- full-fledged  race cars masquerading as passenger cars.  </P> <P> After five races in the 10-event stadium series, Tjelmeland is leading with  three wins and 200 points to 195 for defending champion Jeff Elrod of Campbell,  Calif.  </P> <P> Racing will start with heats at 6:30 p.m.  </P></p>

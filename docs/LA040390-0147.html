			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: NO-HITTERS ARE THE NORM, NOT EXCEPTION, FOR AKAU  </P> <P> Shannon Akau of Buena Park High School pitched two no-hitters last week, which  surprised no one.  </P> <P> Akau, The Times' Athlete of the Week, is a threat to pitch a no-hitter every  time out. Dating to March 23, she had pitched three consecutive no-hitters  until giving up four hits in a 7-2 victory over Walnut Friday.  </P> <P> "I don't feel (the consecutive no-hitters are) surprising. It's not even a  topic," Buena Park Coach Brenda Sapp said. "She's a power pitcher. I can tell  you she's up there with (former Valencia pitcher Michele) Granger. I believe  she can throw with any college pitcher."  </P> <P> Akau has pitched five no-hitters this season and has a 7-1 record, helping  Buena Park to an 8-1-1 start. In 56 innings, Akau has 89 strikeouts and only  two walks. Her earned-run average is 0.25.  </P> <P> Tuesday, Akau pitched her second consecutive no-hitter, striking out 15 and  walking a batter in the fourth inning, in a 3-0 victory over Savanna.  </P> <P> The third one came Wednesday, when she had 11 strikeouts and a walk (in the  first inning) in a 12-0 victory over Dominguez. That game was stopped after  five innings because of the mercy rule.  </P> <P> "The pitching has 50% to 80% to do with winning," Sapp said, "but without the  bats we couldn't win a game for Shannon."  </P> <P> In three games last week, Buena Park supported Akau with 21 runs. And Akau has  been doing her part from the batter's box too.  </P> <P> She went three for three against Dominguez, including a three-run home run in  the first inning.  </P> <P> "I consider myself a contact hitter," Akau said. "I don't think being a pitcher  helps me anticipate what the other will throw."  </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Kaci Keffer won the 400-meter race (58.66 seconds), the 300 hurdles (46.43) and  anchored the winning 1,600 relay team to lead Woodbridge to the girls' title at  the Valencia Invitational Saturday. Also for Woodbridge, Cathi Peck won the 800  (2:23.37) and 3,200 (11:27.84).  </P> <P> Rae Rice pitched a no-hitter and had 13 strikeouts in leading Fountain Valley  to a 2-0 softball victory over Sunny Hills Tuesday.  </P> <P> Robin Russell of Newport Harbor pitched her first career no-hitter in a 2-0  victory over Long Beach Wilson Thursday.  </P> <P> Stephanie Smith pitched her fourth no-hitter of the season, striking out nine,  to lead Garden Grove to a 3-0 victory over Bolsa Grande Tuesday.  </P> <P> Shannon Akau  </P> <P> Buena Park High School  </P> <P> * Position: Pitcher  </P> <P> * Height, Weight, Class: 5-3, 110, Senior  </P> <P> * Last Week: Akau pitched no-hitters Tuesday and Wednesday, her second and  third in a row and fifth this season.  </P> <P> * Season: In 56 innings, Akau has a 7-1 record, with 89 strikeouts, two walks  and a 0.25 earned-run average. Akau is hitting .370 with one home run and three  RBIs.  </P></p>

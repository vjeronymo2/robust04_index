			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Zenith edges into black in final period ZENITH Electronics, the US consumer electronics group, yesterday unveiled improved fourth-quarter results. The company registered a small profit of Dollars 500,000, or 2 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1991, a turnround from a loss a year ago of Dollars 27.4m, or Dollars 1.01, a share. The quarter's results benefited from cost-reductions and the absence of Dollars 7m of charges taken in the final quarter of 1990. The improved performance pleased Mr Jerry Pearlman, Zenith chairman, but he warned that 'continuing, deep recessionary conditions mean that more difficult times are ahead'. For all 1991, the company posted a net loss of Dollars 51.6m, or Dollars 1.79, compared with losses of Dollars 54.2m, or Dollars 2.02, in 1990. Sales in 1991 were Dollars 1.32bn, down from Dollars 1.41bn. Consumer electronic sales fell slightly last year to Dollars 1.21bn, from Dollars 1.22bn in 1990, but components - mainly electronic assemblies and displays for the depressed automobile industry - slid to Dollars 111m from Dollars 181 in 1990. Colour television sales were down 13 per cent in the first five weeks of 1992. A weak television market and the start-up costs of its new 'flat tension mask' colour displays were expected to contribute to a loss to Zenith during the the first half of 1992, Mr Pearlman said.</p>

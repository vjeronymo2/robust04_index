			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Blowing down a pipeline at a platform would require a scrubber system to separate liquids. These liquids would need to be disposed of safely which may be difficult during a platform emergency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> What are the benefits and shortcomings of subsea pipeline diversion? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> System dependability might be enhanced by subsea diversion but not enough to offset additional cost over platform diversion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsea diversion could place evacuating and rescuing personnel in peril and could pose a significant pollution problem. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> What are the advantages and disadvantages of having the capability to blow down a pipeline from both ends? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It may be good engineering practice to locate blowdowns at each end of a pipeline. One end may be inaccessible due to fire or failure. If both ends are accessible, a more rapid blowdown can be accomplished. However, the majority of damage and injuries on a platform occurs during the first few minutes and before pressure could be reduced. Actual damage is not likely to be significantly reduced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It would be necessary to bypass the check valve of the outgoing line. The bypass would need to be maintained and tested. Facilities for large scrubbing, liquid handling, and flaring would also be required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Should pipelines be required to have the capability of rapid reduction of pipeline pressure from either end and, if so, what length of time should be specified as the maximum time for pipeline pressure reduction in an emergency situation? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rapid pressure reduction is impractical during emergencies. Larger lines and volumes must be depressurized more slowly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The pest solution is accident prevention and efficient platform evacuation. Gas pipeline pressure cannot be reduced fast enough to prevent early damage during a platform emergency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In an emergency, evacuation is the primary concern. Flaring large volumes of gas could create a dangerous situation for aircraft and boats. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Proposed Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the report of the task group and the analysis of the responses received following the July 23, 1990,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Notice, MMS proposes to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brothers: Our national newspapers have published a  report that al-Quds Palestinian Arab radio in Arabic on the path  of liberating land and man is jamming the enemy radio's Arabic  broadcasts. To clarify matters, the Technical Division of  al-Quds Radio wishes to explain the following:    1. General Rabin used to jam al-Quds Radio. He has  designated several radio stations to jam most of our operating  waves. Our masses in the homeland and the diaspora have been  aware of this fact since the beginning of our transmission.    2. To face the enemy's jamming of al-Quds Radio, we are  obliged to change our frequencies from time to time,  particularly those on the medium waves.    3. Whenever the enemy increases its jamming of al-Quds  Radio, especially during signing ceremonies of treacherous and  humiliating agreements, to prevent our voice from reaching our  people's masses, we change our main medium wave and choose a  frequency that is close to that of the enemy's radio so that  jamming will also affect the enemy's radio.    4. Edmond Sehayek, head of the Zionist enemy Radio's Arabic  Department, is the first to know about the jamming his equipment  is carrying out against al-Quds Radio, the Palestinian Arab  Radio on the path of liberating land and man.    Edmond Sehayek, head of the Zionist enemy Radio's Arabic  Department, whose radio usually changes facts, uses equipment to  jam our radio, contrary to his published allegations. At the  same time, he keeps silent over Rabin's decision to continue  jamming of al-Quds Radio because he knows that al-Quds Radio is  the radio of the Palestinian masses in the homeland and the  diaspora and the radio of those who have no voice and who fear  that its voice will reach people. Therefore Sehayek jams our  operating frequencies.    [Signed] The Technical Division of al-Quds Radio</p>

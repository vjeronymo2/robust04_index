			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (4): Tangled web of interchange unravels - The Technologies, OSI 'YOU can die of boredom sitting in a standards meeting week in week out,' says Mr Mark O'Neill. He should know. As a strategy chief at the Department of Trade and Industry he is responsible for getting the UK business community interested in the implementation of Open Systems Interconnection (OSI). OSI offers a complicated seven-layer model of communications protocols. These should ensure a seamless exchange of information across computers from different suppliers. And the Government OSI Profile (Gosip) is aims to simplify the tangled world of OSI protocols. 'We try and reduce the sheer number of options available to people by focusing on those areas of direct use and interest to people,' he says. Mr O'Neill and his team at the DTI's Millbank Tower have concentrated the world of OSI into manageable chunks. OSI base standards for local area networks contain detail on the co-efficiency of the wrapping applied to electrical cable. Mr O'Neill that thinks the end-user can be spared such fine print. 'You find yourself with a 300-page document, and that is not realistic for the end-user. Gosip reduces it all to something simple.' Gosip has whittled the 400 options contained in the OSI model down to 12 essentials. Although it is a government sponsored initiative, Gosip aims to lead the commercial sector. 'We don't just sit in Millbank and make it up,' says Mr O'Neill, 'because we want to do what people want we built feedback into the process.' Computer suppliers have been quick to hitch their own standards groups to the official bodies and have good incentives for keeping abreast of standards. 'The government backing for OSI is driving us as suppliers,' says Mr Simon Goodwin, connectivity manager at NCR in London. A user base in local and national government obliges NCR to sign up. Suppliers have done more than ape the OSI line. They have set up a parallel bureaucracy. EurOSInet brings together representatives of the leading vendors in meetings around Europe. Companies nominate one European office to represent their perspective on evolving standards. Internal documents make it plain that active participation in maintaining common European standards is commercially vital. NCR's Copenhagen office is responsible for briefing the rest of the organisation on the significance of a European procurement standard. It characterises the OSI market in stark terms: '320m people, a yearly spending on IT equipment in the Dollars 100bn size.' Enter the EC and a new acronym. European Procurement Handbook for Open Systems, Ephos, is the Brussels answer to Gosip. It is serious. 'In order to sell in Europe NCR must deliver products that follow the procurement standards or be able to justify why the NCR approach is better.' This is NCR Copenhagen's line on Ephos. Ephos owes its existence to a 1987 EC directive that sought to include IT systems in the single market boat. On March 26 this year, 200 representatives of standards bodies gathered in Brussels to push the Ephos boat out. The message was that Europeans could establish IT procurement standards on a par with the rigid US government rules. The list of attendees sounds like a lost language. Ositop, Spag, Ewos and OSTC were among the acronyms celebrated. Where does Ephos leave Gosip? Some observers of the standards scene are cynical about the proliferation of OSI committees. One source close to the DTI claims that commercial realities seem to have taken a back seat in the round of meetings between the two. An industry observer uncharitably characterises the Gosip/Ephos interface as 'the bleeding edge'. 'Ephos promises a level playing field for suppliers across Europe,' says Mr O'Neill, stressing the cordial relations Gosip staff enjoy with their near neighbours in Ephos. 'We fully support the Ephos initiative. There is some repetition of work, but not as much as you'd think.' Mr Colin Tulley is on the IT planning group at Trafalgar House. It is his lot to translate the work of EC and DTI standards bodies into useful tools for a conglomerate that embraces shipping, engineering and construction interests. He displays a refreshingly practical attitude. 'We've said we'll support the Gosip profile where possible but we'll go outside the guidelines if there's a business argument for doing so.' One of the key features of OSI is X400. This is a communications protocol that provides a common electronic mail vehicle for the internal networks of large organisations. Trafalgar House has implemented X400. Mr Tulley speaks of the achievement with a mix of surprise and pride. 'We've actually got X400 up and running. Trafalgar House has a plethora of different computer systems and X400 is a flexible E-mail based vehicle for outside clients too.' John Brown Engineering is an arm of Trafalgar House that has pioneered OSI. Documents, images and drawings are the stuff of its precision engineering business. These articles need to be transported internationally. 'The idea is to exchange technical drawings, to update and come to agreement readily,' says Mr Tulley. The means is X400. OSI compliance has meant a modest investment for Trafalgar House so far. A Hewlett-Packard Unix machine to run the Open Mail X400 product cost around Pounds 40,000. As the John Brown project expands, one or two more of these machines will be dedicated to communications. But pricing out a communications strategy is not a high priority. 'There probably isn't an identifiable tangible payback for this kind of technology,' says Mr Tulley, 'The point is that it helps you service your customers more effectively.' From the John Brown pilot, Trafalgar House plans to expand the reach of its OSI products via a private network that will link every operation in the group. Mr Tulley is at pains to underline the commercial reality behind the conglomerate's attachment to the DTI's favourite protocol. 'We have a sceptical view, freedom to choose suppliers is our motive, in an ideal world we want to switch from hardware platform to platform with ease.' Mr Tulley welcomes Gosip as a cut-down version of OSI that allows the user to choose which options he wishes to support. But he claims many standards are open to interpretation and says a full scale implementation of OSI is impractical. 'It takes up too much room on the machine and that's the penalty you pay for having standards built by a committee.' Such instinctive dislike of officialdom may be the grand design's biggest handicap.</p>

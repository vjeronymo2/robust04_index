			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Corp and Apple Japan forge alliance APPLE Computer Japan has forged an alliance with Mitsubishi Corp, Japan's largest trading company, aimed at capturing more of the Japanese market for business systems, Reuters reports. Mitsubishi said it would form an Apple Task Force with 50 systems engineers by the end of the year, and open an Apple Business Centre in Tokyo's Marunouchi business district. Mitsubishi hopes its Apple-related sales will rise to Y30bn (Dollars 225.56m) in fiscal 1994. Apple's own sales in Japan jumped 33 per cent to about Y52bn last year, making Japan the computer-maker's fastest-growing market.</p>

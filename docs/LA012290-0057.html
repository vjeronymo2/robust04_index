			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KRICKSTEIN HURT, COULD MISS DAVIS CUP  </P> <P> Aaron Krickstein limped out of the Australian Open today (Monday), his title  bid wrecked by a groin injury that also threatens his place on the U.S. Davis  Cup team.  </P> <P> Krickstein plays singles on the U.S. squad, which faces Mexico in a first-round  Davis Cup match at the La Costa resort in Carlsbad, Calif., on Feb. 2-4.  </P> <P> Unseeded David Wheaton defeated Krickstein, seeded fifth, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-3,  in the fourth round. But Krickstein clearly was hampered by the injury to the  left side of his groin, which he suffered late in his third-round victory over  Swede Lars Wahlgren.  </P> <P> "I hoped I'd be able to play through it," Krickstein said. "It was OK for a set  but at 2-2 in the second I hurt it again.  </P> <P> "I've strained it pretty bad and I couldn't move very well to my right at all.  </P> <P> "It was hard to concentrate. I knew I wasn't 100% by any means. I was just  hoping with treatment it would be OK."  </P> <P> Krickstein said he was not certain about his Davis Cup status.  </P> <P> "You never know," he said. "The injury is high on the bone and it's a tough one  to treat. I'll just have to wait and see what happens in the next few days."  </P> <P> Wheaton, the last American in the men's singles, said he was aware late in the  match that Krickstein was not moving freely.  </P> <P> "I could see his lunging ability really wasn't there," he said.  </P> <P> Wheaton's advance to the first Grand Slam quarterfinal of his career continued  the 20-year-old Minneapolis resident's meteoric rise.  </P> <P> He was ranked 441st at the end of 1988, but has risen to 66th just 12 months  later.  </P></p>

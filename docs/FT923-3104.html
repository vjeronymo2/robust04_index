			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Observer: Civilising The task of getting Britain's public services better managed is clearly being taken seriously by William Waldegrave, as witness his importing of business psychologist John Nicholson as a special adviser. Besides producing numerous publications including the BBC book How do you manage?, he is chairman of the John Nicholson Associates consultancy which has advised such blue chip clients as Mercedes-Benz, IBM and Hitachi on customer-service initiatives. His speciality is on changing attitudes in organisations to make their culture more user-friendly, rather than just 'sticking spears up people's backsides'. A former academic, Nicholson almost became a rock musician after graduating from Oxford. His group was called The Blue Monks and Their Dirty Habits. He also played the piano for the Balliol Players in a spoof of an Aristophanes-style comedy in which Chris Patten, now our man in Hong Kong, played Queen Victoria. All useful early training, no doubt, for his objective of helping 'civil servants behave in a civil way'.</p>

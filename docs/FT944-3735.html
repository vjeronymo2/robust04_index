			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Business Travel: Shanghai ring road Shanghai was celebrating last week. Flags flew and multi-coloured bunting hung from tall buildings. The cause of the joy was the opening of the city's elevated ring-road in China's largest city. Traffic jams are probably the biggest headache in Shanghai, which is why the Liberation Daily devoted its front page to the story under the banner headlines 'A Glorious Historical Monument Appears'. The four-lane road loops over the Huangpu river that divides Shanghai's old Puxi district from the fast-emerging Pudong development zone. It connects with two suspension bridges.</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: Sweden to merge forestry interests THE SWEDISH government has announced plans to merge its interests in three state-owned forestry groups to create one of Europe's 10 largest pulp and paper companies. The move will assist the government's privatisation ambitions and lead to the new company being quoted on the Stockholm Stock Exchange next spring. The companies being merged are Assi and Doman, both 100 per cent state-owned, and NCB, a quoted company in which the state holds 51 per cent. Assi and Doman will combine at the year end before making an all-share bid worth SKr1.1bn (Dollars 137m) for NCB next March. Although the state will own 95 per cent of the combined group after the bid, it plans to reduce its holding to 85 per cent by selling a 10 per cent stake to Swedish institutions. Mr Per Westerberg, Sweden's industry minister, does not exclude further limited privatisation, although the aim is to keep the company majority state-owned. The new group will have annual sales of SKr15bn, making it nearly as big as MoDo, Sweden's third-largest forestry group. It will have 13,000 employees, 5,000 of them in eight European countries outside Sweden. Mr Westerberg said the aim was to create a financially strong company, capable of expanding further in Europe and guaranteeing employment in Sweden. The group's equity-to-assets ratio will be 53 per cent and profits after financial items are estimated at SKr700m in 1993. It will be Sweden's largest forest owner, with 3.2m hectares of productive forest land, and its largest producer of sawn timber products. It will also be one of Europe's largest producers of corrugated board. Synergy gains will amount to more than SKr100m.</p>

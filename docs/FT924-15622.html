			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / The Long View: Share prices enjoy floating IT HAS been an up-and-down year for the UK equity market but the FT-SE 100 Index passed the three-quarters mark this week showing a net capital gain of about 2 per cent since the beginning of January, and a total return including gross dividends of some 6 per cent. That compares well with a nine-month return of about zero on overseas equities but not so impressively with perhaps 9 per cent on long-dated gilt-edged and nearly 8 per cent on risk-free wholesale money market deposits. In spite of the dreary overall performance of the stock market this year, and indeed over the past five years, there is still a formidable marketing structure in Britain geared to promoting equity-based products such as with-profits life insurance contracts, unit trusts and personal equity plans. And company pension schemes continue to bet as heavily as ever on an equity market revival. In these circumstances, given the right kind of signal, the market will surge. Two such green lights have flashed this year, when the Conservatives unexpectedly won the election in April and when sterling tumbled out of the ERM last month. Curiously, both of these rallies have totalled 14.9 per cent in terms of the Footsie. In between, however, the grim underlying reality of economic recession and corporate distress has dragged share prices back. The City of London's hordes of analysts have repeatedly failed to get to grips with the seriousness of the industrial situation. The big brokers, naturally, are at the very forefront of the equity promotion effort. It is hard for them ever to be bearish, especially when it is clear that on any plausible excuse the market will suddenly leap ahead by 10 or 15 per cent. But some major brokers were suggesting with quite amazing optimism at the end of last year that company earnings per share would rocket by 20 or 25 per cent this year and dividends would continue to rise by 5 per cent or so. In fact profit expectations are continuing to be deflated - there was a big downgrade by ICI's official corporate brokers this week, for instance. And although devaluation will boost the sterling value of overseas profits it is the dollar, which is the key currency here; even last night sterling was down by no more than 8 per cent against the dollar since December 31. Meanwhile dividends on the All-Share Index are at present showing a year-on-year fall of 1 per cent and it was worrying to see a mainstream company like Sears slashing its payout by more than a third this week. A whole swathe of big British companies may decide that their dividends are out of line with their reasonable expectations for earnings. Conceivably, dividends overall could drop significantly in 1993. Certainly forecasts by some analysts of dividend growth of 5 per cent, or even more, seem quite unrealistic. The continuing upward drift in gilt-edged yields, now approaching 9 1/2 per cent and heading for 10 per cent according to several leading bond broking houses, is also a threat. When the UK entered the ERM two years ago share prices initially soared because of expectations that gilt yields would fall and therefore equity yields would fall too (that is, share prices would rise) because in recent history the ratio of the two yields had never fallen below 2. In fact the ERM was very negative for company profits and dividends, which was eventually recognised in a decline in the yield ratio to little more than 1.7 at one point this summer. With our exit from the ERM the reverse logic applies. Share prices have justifiably jumped, because the overseas operations and exports of London-quoted companies are worth more in terms of sterling. On the other hand, rising bond yields pose a threat. For the time being the yield ratio can take the strain (it has risen to 1.96). But a combination of a 10 per cent gilt yield and a prospective equity dividend yield below the current 4.8 per cent could begin to make the lights flash red. For the time being, though, the market could benefit from some positive factors. It is possible (if far from certain, given sterling's continuing weakness) that short-term interest rates could fall further. This could encourage private investors to switch from building society accounts into the stock market, in a small-scale British version of the American phenomenon that has kept Wall Street so high this year. Institutional investors could also be flush with cash. There is a dearth of new equity issues, and the government has financed much of its borrowing requirement out of the reserves and through foreign currency borrowing. There is a window opening which might allow share prices to go higher. I am much more worried about next year, however. A modest devaluation-based economic revival could begin, putting pressure on sterling and interest rates. The cyclical forces which have been favouring the equity market may begin to act against it. In these circumstances the private sector may begin to be 'crowded out': the government may well need to sell Pounds 40bn or more of gilts next year, and although foreigners were buying up half the gilt issues while the UK was in the ERM they are unlikely to play more than an occasional speculative role while sterling floats. There are the makings of big trouble here, and the government has to realise that a public sector deficit that was financeable within the ERM might not be tolerable outside. True, at the same time there will be much more scope to tighten fiscal policy and relax monetary policy, reducing the torrent of gilts and taking some of the pressure off the stock market. Yet there cannot be much confidence in this government's ability to conceive and implement tricky shifts of strategy.</p>

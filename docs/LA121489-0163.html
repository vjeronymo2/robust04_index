			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: L.A. FACES SUIT OVER HYPERION SEWAGE PLANT  </P> <P> El Segundo city officials said Wednesday that they will file a lawsuit against  the city of Los Angeles alleging that the sprawling Hyperion Sewage Treatment  Plant is a public nuisance.  </P> <P> The city contends that the plant poses serious health and safety problems for  residents living near it.  </P> <P> El Segundo officials said that it could take 30 to 60 days to prepare the  lawsuit, which would come at a time when Los Angeles is under federal court  order to update and expand the plant. The only thing that would stop the city  from taking legal action would be if Los Angeles solves odor, noise and other  problems caused by Hyperion that have plagued El Segundo residents, they said.  </P></p>

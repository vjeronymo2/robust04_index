Due to the quantum confinement effect, semiconducting  nanoparticles produce a series of new phenomena,[.sup]1,2[/]  among which the materials with ultra-fast optical nonlinear  response have been particularly noticed. It is predicted that  these semiconducting materials will be the basic optoelectronic  materials of the future. The study of the opto-absorption and  -relaxation properties of nanoscale crystals will help us  further understand the mechanism of nonlinear optical response.    When the size of a semiconducting nanocrystal is as small as  the Bohr radius a[.sup]B[/] of its own phase, a series of  changes of electronic state and optical property can be  observed. These phenomena are observed in the semiconducting  nanocrystal systems of CdS, CuCl, CdSe, PbS.[.sup]3,4[/] The  ratio of the nanocrystal radius R to its Bohr radius  a[.sup]B[/] can be used as the general guideline to determine  the influence of the quantum confinement effect on the  electronic state:[.sup]5[/] When R/a[.sup]B[/] &lt;&lt; 1, the  nanoparticles are in the strong quantum confinement zone, and  their energy levels of electrons and holes are clearly  separated; however, when R/a[.sup]B[/] &gt; &gt;  1, the  nanocrystal is in the exciton confinement zone where the  excitons act as quasi-particles whose translation kinetic  energy's degree of freedom is confined within the  three-dimensional space; as a result the exciton energy increase  is limited. Currently, only CuCl nanocrystals are being  researched as an exciton-confinement-zone material, and they are  also good model materials for the study of excitonic molecule  properties. This paper presents the preparation of cuprous oxide  (Cu[.sup]2[/]O) nanocrystals and discussion of their optical  properties, as well as a discussion of results based on the  model of exciton responses to the quantum confinement effect.  <H5>  1. Experiment </H5>   The Cu[.sup]2[/]O nanocrystals are made by the  oxidation-reduction method in a micro-emulsive liquid. The  process flow diagram is as follows:      The Cu[.sup]2[/]O nanocrystals made by this method are all  coated with sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (DBS) molecules, and  form a transparent sol with toluene. The crystal sizes can vary  within the limit of 5-10.0 nm as determined by the initial value  of [CuAc[.sup]2[/]]/[DBS]. The transmission electron  microscope and the low-angle X-ray scattering experiments show  that the spread of the Cu[.sup]2[/]O nanocrystal dimensions  is very narrow. About 93 percent of the crystal dimensions have  the median radius, and the rest are distributed within the 10  percent of the median radius. The radius distribution of the  nanocrystals is thus well suited for the study of optical  properties.    The room-temperature photoluminescence and excitation  spectra  of the Cu[.sup]2[/]O nanocrystal sol series are measured with  a Hitachi F-4000 fluorescence spectrometer.  <H5>  2. Results and Discussions </H5>   The visible-ultraviolet absorption spectra of  Cu[.sup]2[/]O nanocrystal (9.0 nm) organic sol starts at 650  nm. The absorption rate gradually increases toward the  high-frequency region, but there is no clear indication of   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-09D></FIG>              structural absorption characteristics. This implies that the  phenomenon is influenced by two factors: one is the temperature  and solvent effects; and the other is the size effect. Because  the dimensions of the nanocrystal are far greater than the Bohr  radius a[.sup]B[/] (0.7 nm) of its own phase, the increase of  the exciton energy is not obvious, and the energy separation  induced by the confinement effect is very minor.    Figure 1 shows the photoluminescence spectra of the  Cu[.sup]2[/]O nanocrystals. The excitation luminescences are  (1) 330 nm, (2) 400 nm, (3) 440 nm, (4) 460 nm, (5) 510 nm, and  (6) 532 nm. Five luminescence bands are visible in the  neighborhood of 400 nm, 475 nm, 505 nm, 540 nm and 565 nm. The  last four bands correspond to the existing four luminescence  bands in the exciton systems, namely, indigo, blue, green, and  yellow.[.sup]6[/] The energy changes in the exciton  confinement zone are comparatively small. The luminescences are  undoubtedly fluorescence resonance emissions. In addition, the  luminescence at 400 nm indicates the presence of energy jumps  between bands within the Cu[.sup]2[/]O crystal. The emission  luminescence has not been reported in the past, but its  absorption structure was reported long ago.[.sup]7[/] The  emission from the bottom of the conduction band in the exciton  confinement zone possibly originates from the bound excitons  formed at the bottom of the band; however, further proof is  needed. As to the luminescence phenomenon of solids at high  energy level (or energy band), it is rarely seen in solid-state  phases and many other nanocrystals. However, in our research we  have observed that the phenomenon of increasing high  energy-level radiation jumps not only takes place in the  aforementioned Cu[.sup]2[/]O nanocrystals, but could also  occur in the coated CdS and PbS nanocrystals. It is quite likely  that in the high energy-level neighborhoods of the quantum  confinement and dielectric confinement zones, stable bound  excitons are formed, and consequently, they reduce the  non-radiation jumping probability of the electrons or holes due  to vibrations or impurities; thus, they enhance the radiation  jumping. The phenomenon deserves further probing, because it has  direct bearing on the enhancement of the system's nonlinear  optical phenomena.     Figure 2 shows the excitation spectra of Cu[.sup]2[/]O  nanocrystal (0.9 nm) emission at (a) 600 nm and (b) 580 nm. They  are equivalent to the exciton wavelength absorption  structure.[.sup]8[/] Figure 2 shows the exciton jumps in the  indigo, blue, green, and yellow series are all mutually  related,[.sup]6[/] and have an obvious relationship with the  jump at about 380 nm. There is a corresponding spectral region  of each individual series, and occasionally these spectral  regions overlap. The relatively low vibrator absorption  intensities of the yellow and green exciton series are caused by  the dipole forbiddenness of the jump.[.sup]9[/]   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-10A>           Photoluminescence Spectrum of Cu2O Nanocrystal (9.9 nm) Sol </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-10B>           Figure 2. Excitation Spectrum of Cu[.sup]2[/]Nanocrystal (9.0 nm) Sol </FIG>     Another interesting phenomenon in the excitation spectra is  that the dipoles allow the indigo and blue exciton series having  the multi-peak structures of jumps. Such structures are caused  by the quantization of the exciton energy which in turn is due  to the spatial quantum confinement effect.[.sup]10[/]  Hanamura[.sup]2[/] has suggested a simplified mode. He  assumes the exciton to be a quasi-particle situated in a  semiconducting nanosphere; when R/a[.sup]B[/] &gt; &gt;  1, the  exciton energy (l = m = 0) that allows jumps is expressed as    E[.sup]n[/] = E[.sub]0[/] -  E[.sup]b[/][.sup]ex[/] +  n[.sup]2[/]E[.sup]c[/], (1)    where E[.sup]c[/] is the quantum confinement energy  (h[.sup]2[/][.sup]2[/]/2 M R[.sup]2[/]) and  E[.sup]b[/][.sup]ex[/] is the exciton bonding energy which  varies with exciton's principal quantum number. The quantization  of excitons follows the equation E[.sup]b[/][.sup]ex[/] =  E[.sup]x[/]/n[.sup]2[/], where E[.sub]x[/] is the  effective exciton Rydberg energy  (e[.sup]4[/]/2h[.sup]2[/]_e_[.sup]2[/][.sup]0[/]),  M = m[.sup]e[/] + m[.sub]h[/],  =  m[.sup]e[/]m[.sub]h[/]/m[.sub]e[/] + m[.sub]h[/],  and hence the equation    E[.sup]n[/] = E[.sub]0[/] -  E[.sup]x[/]/n[.sup]2[/] +  n[.sup]2[/]E[.sup]c[/] (2)    is used to describe the different exciton jumps with  different principal quantum numbers in the same series. Our test  results as shown in Figure 2 and Table 1 have proved the  validity of Equation (2).       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1. Theoretical Value and Experimental Values of Indigo Exciton Jump    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Experimental value (R = 4.5 nm, a[.sup]|Calculated value (R = 4.35 nm, E[.sub]-|  |B[/] = 0.7 nm)                     |c[/] = 146,413 nm, E[.sup]x[/] = |  |                                      |12,407 nm)                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |E[.sup]1[/] = 468.2                 |468                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |E[.sup]2[/] = 451                   |451                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |E[.sup]3[/] = 438                   |441.9                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |E[.sup]4[/] = 428.8                 |432.1                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |E[.sup]5[/] = 420.6                 |420.6                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The aforementioned results demonstrate that the conclusion  that the exciton energy increase in the exciton confinement zone  is limited is valid only for the energy jump when n = 1. When n   2, the blue shift of the jump is relatively significant. In  this case, exciton jumps of different principal quantum numbers  split away from one another, while the nanocrystal optical  nonlinear response produces mesoscopic  strengthening.[.sup]2[/] This phenomenon will benefit our  study of mutual reactions among the excitons within the exciton  confinement zone, such as the super-radiation  phenomenon.[.sup]1),11[/] Thorough research on the above  phenomenon would be very worthwhile.

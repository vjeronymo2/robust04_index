			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Crimea's wishes must be heeded Sir, Re 'On the brink over Crimea' (May 24), Ukraine's borders are inviolable. But Ukraine does not necessarily covet Crimea. Russia does. Ukraine has said this territory belongs to its original inhabitants, the Crimean Tatars. Slaughtered and forcibly relocated during imperial Russian and, later, Soviet times, the Crimean Tatars have been welcomed back to their ancestral homeland by the present-day Ukrainian government. They do no want Crimea to become part of Russia again. Why does your editorial fail to take into consideration the desires and aspirations of the native people of Crimea, while scolding Ukraine and, implicitly, rationalising resurgent Russian imperialism? It is Russia that is engaged in brinkmanship and the west which appears intent on repeating the crimes of appeasement at Munich and betrayal at Yalta. That way lies war.

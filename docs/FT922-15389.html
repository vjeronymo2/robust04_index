			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Leading Article: New challenges for Mr Mieno THE BANK of Japan has overplayed its waiting game; monetary policy has remained too tight for too long. The desire of its governor, Mr Yasushi Mieno, to appear independent of political influence has prevented the interest rate cuts needed to boost confidence and revive Japan's ailing economy. Yesterday's modest fiscal package will do little to improve growth prospects; fiscal policy is a notoriously ineffective tool for stabilising economies. And the risks facing Japan's economy justify a more aggressive easing of monetary policy than today's Official Discount Rate cut. It is slow growth, not a revival of inflation, that now threatens Japan's economic stability. Mr Mieno was right to keep monetary policy tight throughout 1989 and 1990 to deflate Japan's asset price bubble; it appeared he would succeed without causing a recession. But last year's hero risks turning into today's villain. The governor may well have gone too far already in a deflationary direction. The Bank of Japan remains obsessed with the need to prevent a resurgence of land and retail price inflation, even though the stock market is at a five-year low; residential land prices fell last year for the first time in 17 years; broad money growth has reached a record low; and wholesale prices fell in February. Meanwhile, the impending signs of recession are accumulating: gross domestic product fell in the last quarter of 1991; industrial output fell in February compared with the year before; and business and consumer confidence are depressed. Failing the test The latest cut has brought interest rates down by just 2 1/4 percentage points from their 1991 peak. An effective central banker must be willing both to raise interest rates at the first sign of inflationary pressure and then cut them aggressively when falling inflation risks turning into output deflation. Mr Mieno has yet to pass the latter test. Japan may still escape the full-scale debt deflation that the US and UK are currently enduring. The Japanese financial sector has been hit by the combination of high real interest rates, the fall in stock market wealth and accumulating bad debts. But, so far, companies and consumers have escaped relatively unscathed. Japan's consumers are not being hit by the paralysing combination of heavy debts and rising unemployment that has stalled recoveries in the US and Europe. Householders were largely unable to borrow against residential property values during the boom, and unemployment remains low. The corporate sector is more exposed to high interest rates and falling stock prices. Even so, corporate liquidity remains above its levels of the early 1980s. International side-effects Slow rather than no growth remains the more probable outcome for Japan this year. But the international side-effects of this domestic slowdown are great. Domestically, the credit squeeze may be confined to the financial sector. But the unwillingness of Japanese banks to lend, and their need to contract assets to meet international capital standards, is starving world financial markets of new capital. Nor can export-oriented Japan ignore the effects of its domestic policies on its main trading partners. Its trade surplus has doubled over the past year, owing largely to falling imports. Yesterday's fiscal package will have done little to raise import demand. But if easing trade tension was the aim, the action was a modest step in the right direction. It offered no new spending on top of the small increase already agreed; its effect on growth this year will be modest. But by bringing 75 per cent of this spending forward to the first half of the fiscal year, it suggested there may be more money to come. A shift towards more public spending, and less public saving, is the best way to reduce the trade surplus. Robust domestic demand growth is also a prerequisite for smooth US-Japanese relations. The best way to spark recovery is to push interest rates down. The  3/4 percentage point cut will not suffice, and Mr Mieno must be willing to cut rates again if business and consumer spending fails to respond. An independent central banker is better than a politically compliant one, but there is no merit in being independently wrong.</p>

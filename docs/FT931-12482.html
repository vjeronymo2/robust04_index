			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Construction Contracts: Iraqi invasion compensation claims FISHER GROUP, the UK international chartered loss adjusting group headquartered in Banstead, Surrey has been appointed by the Kuwaiti authorities as loss adjusters for processing the larger claims arising from the illegal occupation of Kuwait by the Iraqis in January 1991. This is believed to be one of the largest loss adjusting contracts ever awarded. The multi-million pound contract marks the second phase of claim settlement in Kuwait. Under the terms of its contract, Fishers will advise on claims for compensation for damage and losses caused by the Iraqi rinvasion. Although the claims cannot yet be quantified, Fishers expects them to be valued at several billion ponds. Loss adjusting for the first phase involving just the smaller claims was carried out by an American consortium. The processing of major compensation claims in Kuwait is based on the implementation of the Security Council of the United Nations' resolutions which provide for claims to be met by external Iraqi funds. The Kuwaiti authorities established the Public Authority for Assessment of Compensation which, in turn, appointed Fishers to undertake the contract.</p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN'S MARTINEZ STYMIES DOMINGUEZ HILLS, 9-0  </P> <P> It's a safe bet that, after 22 years, Fili Martinez and his valuable left arm  have become friends. But every so often, his pitching arm throws him a curve.  </P> <P> Examine Martinez's performance before and during a California Collegiate  Athletic Assn. baseball game at Cal State Dominguez Hills on Thursday: The Cal  State Northridge senior allowed just two hits and struck out 14 en route to a  9-0 shutout in the first game of a crucial three-game series between the teams.  </P> <P> But before the game, Martinez felt as if weights were strapped to his wrist.  </P> <P> "It took forever for my fastball to get to the catcher in the bullpen," he  said. "My curve was hanging and nothing felt right."  </P> <P> Rest assured that when he took the field, everything looked right.  </P> <P> Ask the Dominguez Hills batters, who couldn't touch Martinez's pitches until  Adrian Rodriguez ripped a single up the middle in the sixth inning to spoil the  no-hitter. Rob Campbell's ninth-inning double was the only other hit the Toros  managed.  </P> <P> Ask CSUN Coach Bill Kernen, who said of Martinez's outing: "It was one of those  dominating performances where they don't even sniff. He's one of the  top-quality left-handed pitchers in college baseball.  </P> <P> "I've had some -- I know."  </P> <P> Martinez (8-3), who attributed the effectiveness of his breaking pitches to the  steady breeze that blew across the diamond, had never faced Dominguez Hills  (15-28-2, 10-17-1 in conference play) before.  </P> <P> But by beating them Thursday, he kept Northridge's bid for a conference  championship -- and a playoff berth -- alive.  </P> <P> Northridge (29-18-1, 15-11-1) scored two runs in the second and erupted for six  in the fourth.  </P> <P> With two out in the fourth, Greg Shockey hit a full-count pitch for a triple to  the right-field wall, scoring Randy Thompson.  </P> <P> Chae-Ho Chong followed with a walk and Rusty McLain singled in the infield to  score Shockey.  </P> <P> Denny Vigo was hit by a pitch to load the bases, setting the stage for Mike  Solar's grand slam over the left-field fence.  </P> <P> Northridge scored its final run in the fifth when Thompson, who singled up the  middle, came home on a single to left by Shockey.  </P></p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Moslems flee Serb vision of ethnic purity AS THE federal army and Serb irregulars continue to starve into submission the people of Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, inhabitants of the small town of Rudo are only now beginning to feel the impact of ethnic war. Located south-east of Sarajevo, Rudo's population of 12,000, three-quarters Serb and the rest Moslem, peacefully co-existed until May 21. That was when the White Eagles arrived. The White Eagles is a fanatical armed Serb organisation, which appears determined to establish ethnically pure Serb areas in Bosnia-Hercegovina. When they arrived in Rudo, Dr Jasmir Brajnanac, a 28-year-old doctor, and Moslem, decided it was time to leave. 'I had no choice,' she explained as she waited for help and accommodation from the Moslem Crisis Centre in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia. 'On May 21, the White Eagles demanded I take an oath of loyalty to Serbia and the new Yugoslavia. This was no simple oath. It involved agreeing to military conscription, a curfew, permission to leave the town, and using the health centre to treat Serb military personnel. I did not want to sign this piece of paper. I fled.' After two days and nights of travelling through forests and along side-roads, Ms Brajnanac reached Croatia, where she joined 238,480 refugees and displaced people from Bosnia-Hercegovina, and another quarter of a million made homeless or displaced by the war in Croatia. Ms Vesjna Camka, a Moslem born in Banja Luka, northern Bosnia, and who has also sought refuge in Zagreb, said those Moslems who remained behind in Bosnia were either the old or the young, determined to fight for Bosnia's independence. 'The old are afraid to leave because they believe they will lose their pensions and apartments. Already, in Banja Luka, the Serbs are going through all the apartments in order to find out who is not a Serb,' Ms Camka said. She added that many young Moslems had taken to the forests to fight. Even in Croatia, attempts continue to carve out ethnically pure regions in eastern Slavonia, east of the republic, despite the deployment there 10 days ago of United Nations peacekeeping troops. On Sunday night, 22 Croats from the village of Tovarnik, eastern Slavonia, were ordered out of their homes and on to a bus by Serb irregulars. 'This is a policy of ethnic cleansing,' said Mr Mik Magnusson, the UN's chief spokesman in Croatia. 'These Croats were pressurised by the Serbs to leave their villages. We brought them back to their homes. We will have to guard them. But as soon as we turn our backs, a bomb will be thrown at them.' 'Those Serbs who were forced by Croats to flee their homes from western Slavonia, central Croatia, are now being resettled (by Serbs) in houses in eastern Slavonia which were once inhabited by Croats,' said Mr Magnusson. Although UN officials yesterday said one of their main tasks in eastern Slavonia was to create conditions for those people who wanted to return to their homes, a group of poor, elderly Croats who are from the region, but who have taken refuge in Zagreb, said they had little hope in the future. 'My pig is dead. My house is burnt. My Serb neighbours and friends have fled. Everybody fears revenge. What would I be returning to?' asked Mrs Marija Culic, 81. EC to decide on curbs, Page 2</p>

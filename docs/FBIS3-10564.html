The Guayaquil daily EL UNIVERSO reports  that out of 600 persons polled 63 percent said they agree with  holding a referendum, while 37 percent said they are opposed to  it. EL UNIVERSO adds that 66 percent do not know what the  questions of the referendum are, while 34 percent do know what  they are.    Other questions asked were whether congress should be a  single chamber as it has been up to now or whether there should  be two chambers. Another question was on the issue of double  nationality for emigrants who have acquired another citizenship.    Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen announced that on 1  May there will be a referendum on eight questions that refer to  elections, duration of deputies' terms, reelection for  presidential and other public offices, and parliamentary control  over state funds.    The referendum has been criticized by the majority of  Ecuadoran political sectors, who say that it is unconstitutional  and irrelevant. However, the poll discloses that the majority  of people support the referendum.    The same poll states that 33 percent of people feel that the  questions are very important; 34 percent say they are quite  important; 27 percent describe the questions as not very  important; while only 6 percent believe they are not important  at all.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The ubiquitous badge featuring North Korean  President Kim Il-song has disappeared from the lapels of North  Korean officials attending international conferences, fueling  speculation as to what the development signifies.    Rep. Pak Chong-su, who led a South Korean delegation to the  91st International Parliamentary Union (IPU) meeting in Paris,  said last week he noticed that all nine members of the North  Korean delegation were not wearing the Kim Il-song badge.    In addition, all six North Korean representatives at a Paris  meeting of the United Nations Educational, Social and Cultural  Organization (Unesco) did not wear the badge, according to Pak.    The absence of the badge, the symbol of Kim Il-song's  "chuche  (self-reliance)" ideology, is drawing attention because all  North Korean officials had until recently worn one as though it  were a bodily appendage, Pak said.    "It is a big change, considering the rigidity and  inflexibility of North Korean regime and society," Pak said.    Pak speculated that North Korea's leaders may be preparing  "a  grace period" during a transition of power from Kim Il-song to  his son and heir-apparent, Kim Chong-il.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Management: A flight of discovery - How a Belfast aerospace company has introduced benchmarking into its strategy fewer still in aerospace and defence - can claim to be employing more people today than they were four years ago. Short Brothers of Belfast (Shorts for short) is one of them. The size of the company's workforce - more than 8,000 at the last count - is one indication of the liberating effect that privatisation appears to have had on the world's oldest aircraft production company. Taken over by Canada's Bombardier Corporation in 1989, Shorts was the instant beneficiary of an investment programme by Bombardier and the UK government. The Pounds 200m Shorts received has been used to increase efficiency, extend its capabilities and significantly improve its financial performance. Last year's pre-tax profit of Pounds 28.5m compared with a Pounds 47m loss in 1988. But while costs have been cut, product quality sharpened, lead times narrowed and a more customer-orientated culture instilled, the competitiveness of Shorts' international markets means the company can aim for nothing less than world-class standards. That is one reason why 18 months ago it embraced benchmarking as an important part of its quality management strategy. Roy McNulty, Shorts' quietly spoken president, defines benchmarking as 'the continuous improvement of what we do by learning how others do it'. 'What we do,' he adds, 'can be products, processes or services, whilst 'others' can be other divisions within Shorts, companies within the Bombardier group, direct competitors, or best practice companies.' Initially, Shorts was attracted to benchmarking by a desire to evaluate the first phase of the investment programme, and to ensure that Pounds 70m of still uncommitted funds were sensibly targeted. The company talked extensively to three consulting firms - Andersen, Ingersoll Engineers and Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton - before choosing Booz on the basis of its knowledge of the aerospace industry. Benchmarking at Shorts, explains Brian Little, vice-president and general manager of manufacturing, has been one tool in a wider programme for change. That has involved identifying customer needs more closely, establishing deeper relationships with a smaller number of suppliers, and investing in people. Of the two benchmarking studies so far undertaken, the more ambitious compared seven of Shorts' manufacturing processes with those of 28 worldwide competitors. Teams of four to five people - roughly divided between Shorts and Booz representatives - were set up last spring and worked full time on the project for 12 weeks. Little says it was important to establish a realistic benchmarking methodology - eliminating accounting distortions and isolating the true manufacturing value added from tax breaks and other incentives - as well as attempting to quantify the real 'cost drivers' in an individual process. For each process, Shorts worked out its relative cost position, as well as best practice performance metrics. For example, in composites fabrication its utilisation rate was 4-5 per cent more efficient than the two benchmark companies, its overhead structure 5-14 per cent cheaper and its factor costs in one case 63 per cent lower after stripping out state subsidies. Shorts found that its parts-flow performance, graphite utilisation, scrap rates and quality costs relative to total costs were in line with best practice. On some products, though, its scrap rates were worse than the benchmark. Overall, Little claims the survey found Shorts 'as competitive as any company in the world' in five of the seven processes. In the other two - which Little won't identify for commercial reasons - 'we have had to do quite a lot of re-engineering, particularly to reduce the costs of our operating systems and practices'. In one case, the study highlighted an important choice: whether to buy in technology that is two to three years ahead of the field or try to develop it in Belfast. Process improvement plans have been clearly based on observed best practices, and performance metrics used as process performance targets. In the current recessionary markets the studies have also given Shorts a more detailed picture of its rivals' pricing relates to their costs. Shorts' corporate services benchmarking project, by contrast, appears less advanced. But by comparing other companies' practices in areas like information technology, sales and marketing, finance, and facilities engineering, Shorts hopes to be able to identify savings. Little, who is something of a benchmarking evangelist, insists 'there is always something to be learned from visiting someone else's factory. It can be a great trade'. He admits it is more difficult benchmarking direct competitors. But, intriguingly, he says: '90-95 per cent of the data required to do a reasonably effective cost-competitive benchmarking job are in the public domain. Plant visits help but a lot of information comes from suppliers, magazine articles, public accounts and simply studying the physical size of other people's manufacturing operation. It is particularly easy in the US where the Freedom of Information Act helps and trade union agreements can be quite detailed.' Companies that try to discourage benchmarking studies are wasting their time, he says. 'Moreover, we have discovered that the people who are most secretive generally have the least to hide.' Japanese companies have been mostly co-operative. 'They usually believe you won't use the information, or that by the time you do they will have moved ahead again,' Little observes wryly. Visits can also be useful closer to home, and with non-competitive 'partners'. Little is confident Shorts can improve the capacity utilisation of its autoclave (curing oven) by studying a local bakery, and that a garment manufacturer can pass on valuable lessons about managing materials flow.</p>

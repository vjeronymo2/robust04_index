			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Recession maintains its grip for ninth quarter THE RECESSION maintained its grip on the UK in the three months to September, making it the ninth quarter of flat or falling output. But while the latest official figures showed no sign of recovery, they are unlikely to trigger any further easing of policy in the near future. Gross domestic product, excluding oil and gas production, dropped by 0.3 per cent compared with the previous quarter, and was 0.8 per cent lower than the same quarter year on year, according to provisional seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical Office. The CSO reported yesterday that overall third-quarter GDP was unchanged compared with the three months to June, re-flecting a sharp 6.7 per cent rise in oil and gas extraction. Compared with the same period a year ago, GDP fell by 0.7 per cent. The Treasury said the figures were in line with their Autumn Statement forecasts of a 1 per cent drop in economic output for 1992 as a whole. The forecast, published last week, implies another big fall in GDP in the fourth quarter. Treasury officials said the latest figures were of limited value in assessing present economic conditions, because they mainly reflected conditions before the big relaxation in government monetary policy after Black Wednesday (September 16), which has included three base rate cuts and a large sterling devaluation. The Bank of England, which highlighted the problem of debt deflation in its latest quarterly bulletin yesterday, is understood to have advised the government to wait and see how the lower interest rates and last week's fiscal measures affect inflation and activity before considering whether to cut base rates further from seven per cent. The third-quarter fall in non-oil GDP reflected a drop in manufacturing output, after two consecutive quarters of growth, and poor performance by the service industries. Total GDP has fallen by 4 per cent since the recession began more than two years ago. Excluding oil and gas extraction, the fall has been 4.1 per cent. Neither fall is as steep as those in output during the recession in the early 1980s when GDP fell by 5.5 per cent overall and by 6.2 per cent, excluding oil and gas extraction. However, then the economy recovered after only seven quarters. Service industry output, which accounts for over half of total GDP, fell by 0.3 per cent in the third quarter compared with the second quarter and was 0.5 per cent lower year on year.

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Nigerian strike crumbling amid union disarray The oil workers' strike in Nigeria yesterday appeared to be winding down further, in the face of the military government's intransigent stand against it. One union official said that a decision had been taken at the weekend to 'suspend' the strike, though later another official said a meeting today would decide the issue. The strike was launched two months ago by the Pengassan and Nupeng unions to back a package of demands, including an end to military rule and the release of Mr Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of last year's annulled election. But some strikers have already been drifting back to work since General Sani Abacha, the military ruler, sacked the union leaders last month. A union spokesman, Mr Arthur Onoviran, said that executives of both unions met for seven hours on Saturday and decided to suspend the strike. The decision was made 'in the interest of the suffering masses of Nigeria, the economy and the oil industry'. But afterwards Mr Milton Dabibi, secretary-general of the white-collar Pengassan union said that a meeting would be held today 'to decide whether or not to suspend the strike'. In the face of the government's unyielding attitude and the drift back to work, there appeared to be some disagreement among union leaders over how to act and how to press their continuing demands. But with the impact of the strike already waning, it appeared many union members would be very reluctant to follow any attempt to prolong the stoppage. Once 'suspended', it will be difficult to resuscitate the strike. Union officials said they still demanded that the military government release Mr Abiola from jail and restore democratic institutions that were swept aside in November. They also want reforms in the state's management of the oil industry, where under-investment has led to heavy job losses. During August the strike cut more than a quarter from Nigeria's 2m barrels-a-day output of crude oil, the country's only major export, and led to fuel shortages. Most of the lost production was at Shell's onshore operations, while offshore producers were largely unaffected, with Chevron raising output 12 per cent, according to industry sources. The companies said last week production staff were returning to the oil fields and tanker drivers in Lagos and the south-west had resumed work. Nigeria's main oil refinery at Port Harcourt was again producing. The oil workers became isolated in their struggle against Gen Abacha's regime, which has rejected their demands. Strikes in other sectors of the economy were shortlived or haphazard, and the movement to end military rule lacked political leadership, despite strong popular support, especially in Mr Abiola's native south-west. The virtual collapse of the strike leaves the government in its strongest position in several months. Mr Abiola and several of his outspoken supporters are in jail, a strike in the most important industry appears to have been broken, the national executive of the oil unions have been replaced by government nominees and the government has carried the army in the clampdown against pro-democracy forces. Without a government in waiting, the oil workers have not been able to achieve their aims. The strike has shown that an oil industry stoppage is a powerful weapon but cannot alone bring down a determined regime. Mr Abiola's future remains in doubt. He has been held since June for declaring himself president on the anniversary of his unofficial victory in the 1993 presidential election. He faces charges of treason. Fears about his health led to repeated demands that he be allowed hospital treatment.</p>

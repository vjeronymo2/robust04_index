			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2), as herein pertinent, prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor thereof or underwriter therefor from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments (other than sales load) are deposited with a qualified bank as trustee or custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amounts as the SEC may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Applicants submit that both PLACA and PMLIC are entitled to reasonable compensation for their respective assumption of mortality and expense risks. Applicants represent that the 1.25% mortality and expense risk charge assessed under the Contracts is consistent with the protection of investors because it is a reasonable and proper insurance charge. Applicants further submit that the mortality and expense risk charge is a reasonable charge to compensate PLACA and PMLIC for the risk that annuitants under the Contracts will live longer than has been anticipated in setting the annuity rates guaranteed in the Contracts, for the risk that the Contract account value will be less than the death benefit, and for the risk that administrative expenses will be greater than amounts derived from the Contract administrative charges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. PLACA and PMLIC each represent that the charge of 1.25% for mortality and expense risks assumed by PLACA and PMLIC is within the range of industry practice with respect to comparable variable annuity products. This representation is based upon PLACA's and PMLIC's analysis of publicly available information about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels, the existence of charge level guarantees, and guaranteed annuity rates. PLACA and PMLIC each will maintain at its administrative offices, and have available to the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of, its comparative survey. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Applicants acknowledge that the proceeds of CDSCs may be insufficient to cover all costs relating to the distribution of the Contracts. Applicants also acknowledge that if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion of such profit may be viewed by the Commission as being offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the sales charge. PLACA and PMLIC each have concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit the PLACA and PMLIC Accounts and the Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by PLACA and PMLIC at their respective administrative offices and will be available to the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. PLACA and PMLIC each represent that the PLACA and PMLIC Accounts will invest only in management investment companies which undertake, in the event such companies adopt plans to finance distribution expenses under Rule 12b&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act, to have a board of directors or trustees, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company, formulate and approve any such plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants assert that, for the reasons set forth above, the requested exemptions from section 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of a mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts meet the standards in section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants assert that the requested exemptions are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

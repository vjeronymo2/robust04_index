			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Pounds 8.4m offer for Lancashire &amp; London Anglo Scandinavian Investment Trust, which already owns 27.5 per cent, has launched an Pounds 8.4m bid for fellow trust Lancashire &amp; London, which is linked to several companies associated with the family of Sir Walter Salomon, writes Philip Coggan. The bid follows skirmishes in which Anglo attempted to install its own managers, SG Investment Management, at Lancashire &amp; London. The bid offers cash equivalent to Formula Asset Value (FAV), subject to a minimum of 100.75p. Anglo said yesterday that the current FAV would be 104.75p, compared with the net asset value of Lancashire &amp; London of 106.25p. There is also a debenture stock alternative to the cash offer.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Charima Reinhardt: "The FDP Intends To Stress </F> Its Difference From Other Political Parties"]    [Text] Bonn, 4 Jan -- In the 1994 election year, the Free  Democratic Party [FDP] intends to distinguish itself more  extensively from other political parties, including its  coalition partner, the Christian Democratic Union/Christian  Social Union [CDU/CSU]. The FDP will focus on performance and  plans to further elites to a larger extent.    According to party chairman Klaus Kinkel, the political  debate will be focused on the preservation of the state ruled by  law and on combating unemployment. To create jobs, a  "modernization thrust" of the economic sector is required, as  described in Federal Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt's (FDP)  paper on Germany's economic base. In the discussion of the  coalition on internal security, "a few things" cannot be had  with the FDP. Kinkel mentioned as examples the great bugging  campaign and CDU/CSU floor leader Wolfgang Schaeuble's proposal  to use the Bundeswehr in conflicts at home. The FDP will,  however, complete all projects adopted by the coalition "in a  fair way and as agreed upon." They include the amendment of the  asylum law and the nursing insurance. The FDP will not accept a  change of course in European policy. Those who believe the  Germans could "leave the European policy course are wrong," said  Kinkel.    The foreign minister announced "massive controversies" with  the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. He said he would  put the blame for increasing foreign policy difficulties on the  SPD, which rejects an amendment to the Basic Law for Bundeswehr  combat missions outside the NATO area. In environmental policy,  the FDP will distinguish itself from the Greens, whose  environmental policy ideas "fail to take market economy  considerations into account."    Generally, Kinkel believes that 1994 will be a difficult  year  for his party. "Much will be at stake" for the FDP. He called  upon the liberals once again to demonstrate calmness and  cohesion. Kinkel rejected North Rhine-Westphalian FDP Chairman  Juergen Moellemann's proposal to reduce the federal cabinet this  year. He said such a change should not be considered shortly  before Bundestag elections. The government must now "do a good  job."</p>

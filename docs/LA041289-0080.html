			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The father of a missing Fresno baby was found dead and his wife unconscious at  a Visalia motel in what police said might have been a suicide pact. Fresno  police said John Ray, 32, apparently killed himself with an overdose of  prescription drugs on Saturday -- the day he was to take a lie detector test in  connection with the disappearance nearly two weeks ago of 4-month-old Cindy  Ray. Janine Ray, 26, was revived and interviewed briefly by a detective who  said she was not yet sufficiently recovered to tell him anything "substantive."  Fresno Police Sgt. Mike Guthrie said Visalia police found in the motel room  "documentary evidence" that could lead to the missing child. Police said John  Ray had a record of abusing his wife, leading to the suspicion that someone may  have taken the child to protect her.  </P></p>

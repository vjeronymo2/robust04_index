			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 100-ACRE FIRE SPREADS SOUTH OF GORMAN  </P> <P> A campfire apparently sparked a brush fire that scorched at least 100 acres  Sunday near Pyramid Reservoir in Los Padres National Forest.  </P> <P> About 75 campers were evacuated from the Hard Luck Campground south of Gorman,  but there were no injuries and no structures were threatened in the blaze that  erupted about 11:40 a.m., said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Juanita Freel.  </P> <P> More than 200 firefighters were battling the fire on the ground and from the  air.  </P> <P> The blaze was spreading slowly Sunday afternoon toward the northwest, near  Snowy Creek, spokeswoman Susan Mockenhaupt said.  </P> <P> She said the steep and rocky terrain near the creek made fighting the fire  difficult, but said she expected decreased winds and temperatures and increased  humidity during the night to help firefighters.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Mike Graham said the blaze started when a  stray spark from a campfire ignited a tent and flames spread to the surrounding  brush.  </P></p>

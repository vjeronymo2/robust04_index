			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Thailand and Laos have resolved a dispute over  the ownership of the Mittraparb (Friendship) Bridge by agreeing  to divide it at mid-point, informed sources said yesterday. An  agreement on ownership is expected to be signed today by Foreign  Minister Prasong Sunsiri and his Laotian counterpart Somsavat  Lengsavat when they meet at the Foreign Ministry in Bangkok, the  sources said. The agreement will set aside the boundary question  and enable technical officials to continue negotiations on the  administration and maintenance of the bridge.    Director General of the Department of Energy Affairs Dr  Prathet Sutabut is to lead a Thai delegation to Vientiane soon  to discuss administration and maintenance of the bridge.    Thai officials said any agreement reached by the delegation  would be an "interim measure" to, facilitate the administration  and maintenance of the bridge and to divide jurisdiction. But  it will have no bearing on the boundary line between the two  countries along the Mekong river. The agreement will state that  both sides will continue to regard the river's deepest point  beneath the bridge as the natural boundary line, the officials  said. [passage omitted]    Technically, under the Thai proposal, the ownership line  would move closer to the Laotian side of the bridge in  concurrence with the international borderline along the Mekong  River. But the proposal from Vientiane would require a change  to the Thai constitution.    According to Thai estimates, about 1,000 vehicles will use  the bridge daily when it is opened. Prathet said in a recent  interview that under a tentative agreement, a BtlO toll will  apply to four-wheeled vehicles and about Bt50 will be levied on  coaches and trucks. At this stage, the fee will be collected  only one-way. Thailand-bound and Laos-bound vehicles will pay  an entry fee at the entry point and will not be charged at the  exit point, Prathet said. The bridge will be opened between 8  am and 6 pm.    However further discussions will be needed to conclude all  the details, he said.</p>

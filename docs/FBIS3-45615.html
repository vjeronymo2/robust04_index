Meeting with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl here Thursday [20  January] afternoon, Qiao Shi, visiting chairman of China's  National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, stressed  that China should develop its relations with Germany from a  strategic point of view.    "We desire to develop our long-term and stable friendly  relations with Germany based on the principles of seeking common  ground while reserving differences, mutual respect and trust,  peace and mutual benefit," Qiao said.    Kohl said Germany and China share special ties, they can  closely cooperate not only in economy, but also in other areas.    He said as China has a time-honored culture, bilateral  cooperation can also be extended to science and technology.    "There is much that I am willing to do in this regard," Kohl  said.    Both Qiao and Kohl shared a common view that a series of  agreements signed between the two countries during Kohl's visit  to China last November will be fully implemented.    Kohl said: "What we have promised will be surely abided by."    He stressed, "China has always supported Germany's  reunification while Germany supported China's reunification in  the past and will continue to do so in the future."    During the meeting, Qiao briefed Kohl on China's domestic  situation and reforms.    "We hope for an early resumption of China's status as a  signatory party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT)", which will make China's economic relations with  countries all over the world to take onto the normal way," Qiao  said.</p>

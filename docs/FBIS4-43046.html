			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- FDP [Free Democratic Party]  Chairman Klaus Kinkel has reaffirmed that his party will not  change its course for the Bundestag elections despite its result  in the European elections. "We are determined to continue our  coalition with the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian  Social Union]," Kinkel stressed at noon today after committee  meetings of the Liberals in Bonn. He assumed that the FDP would  "double" its Sunday [12 June] result at the Bundestag elections  and that the coalition with the CDU/CSU could continue after 16  October. The presidium and the executive had agreed that  blaming individuals within the FDP would not help anybody. The  party now had to concentrate on clarifying its policies to the  people.</p>

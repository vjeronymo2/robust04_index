			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Slovak state sales hitch The Slovak government has postponed final decisions on a range of privatisation proposals, involving state property worth up to Kcs250bn (Pounds 5.15bn), originally due to be considered by yesterday. The government is now expected to study the proposals over the next three weeks, before a general election on September 30 and October 1. About a quarter of the proposals involve privatisation through vouchers, which went on sale last Monday. Some projects have already been approved, and the government has said it is committed to pushing through as much of the programme as possible before the election.</p>

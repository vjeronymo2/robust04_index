			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA)-- Chinese Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen said today that U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher's recent visit to China has not produced as  many results as originally expected.    Qian made the assessment at a press conference here today.    In response to a question about U.S. President Bill  Clinton's  reported disappointment over Christopher's China visit, Qian  said, "I am also somewhat disappointed. More results could have  been achieved.    "During my first round of talks with Christopher, I was the  first to say something disappointing. The meeting between us  was prepared in accordance with an invitation I had extended to  Christopher when we met on January 24 in Paris.    "In his letter to me in mid-February, he said he would like  to visit China in mid March, which I agreed, because this visit  had the possibility of reaching agreements that are beneficial  for further developing relations between the two countries.    "Something had occurred just before the visit of the  secretary of state, which disappointed us. In my view, these  matters at least demonstrated that the U.S. side didn't have  enough sincerity for this visit."    On U.S. granting China most-favored-nation trade status  (MFN), Qian said, its renewal will benefit both China and the  United States. Its removal will be bad news for both countries.    Qian said that the MFN status is a reciprocal and mutually-  beneficial arrangement between China and the United States, and  it is the base for normal trade for the two countries.    "The United States has given the MFN status to many other  countries, and I have never heard it will be removed. If the  U.S. Government should remove the status for China, trade  between China and the U.S. can hardly be carried on," he said,  adding that, if it should happen, China and the U.S. would be  the first to suffer losses, and other countries and regions like  Hong Kong and Taiwan will also suffer.    Qian also said that it can be hardly said that in his talks  with U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, the differences in the  views on the human rights issue were narrowed, but the two sides  did reach some common understanding on specific methods and  measures to handle that issue.    He said, "that can be considered progress in this regard."    Answering a question on whether or not removal of the MFN  status for China will make economic relations between China and  the U.S. deteriorate, and whether or not that will lead to a  deterioration of their political relations, the foreign minister  said, "deterioration of economic relations will surely have some  negative influence, but efforts being made by both sides are  just to prevent this kind of deterioration from occurring."    More than one third of the questions put forward today  during  the hour-long press conference were related to Sino-U.S.  relations. About 600 Chinese and foreign reporters were present  at the conference, which was sponsored by the ongoing session of  the National People's Congress (NPC).</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / International Company News: Woolworth tumbles to Dollars 13m WOOLWORTH, the large US retailing group whose interests range from Woolco department stores to Susie's fashion shops and various shoe chains, yesterday reported a slump in first-quarter profits, at Dollars 13m after tax. This compares with Dollars 38m in the same period a year earlier. Helped by favourable exchange rate comparisons, sales advanced very modestly to Dollars 2.13bn, against Dollars 2.06bn. Within this overall figure, speciality stores saw a 6.3 per cent sales improvement, but general merchandise remained unchanged. Had 1991 revenues been translated at 1990 foreign exchange rates, the overall increase would have been reduced to less than 1 per cent. On the stock market, which was prepared for drab first-half performance in 1991, the shares eased by Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 30 1/8 yesterday. Woolworth attributed the profits fall to recessionary conditions in North America and to the goods and service tax which took effect in Canada on January 1. It said that its Canadian operations had also been hit by the recent court ruling insisting on Sunday closing in Ontario, home of about 40 per cent of Woolworth's Canadian stores. Neither was the company optimistic about an early improvement in the trading environment: 'Adverse economic conditions continue to negatively impact consumer spending in the US, Canada and Australia and the consensus view is that economic recovery will not commence until the latter part of 1991', said Mr Harold Sells, chairman. Total operating profits in the first quarter, ahead of corporate expenses, almost halved from Dollars 91m to Dollars 49m. Domestic operations saw their contribution slip from Dollars 73m to Dollars 53m, while foreign operations plunged from an Dollars 18m profit to a Dollars 4m loss. Woolworth said the 'strong operating profit gains' of its German subsidiary were offset by the poor performance of the Canadian business.</p>

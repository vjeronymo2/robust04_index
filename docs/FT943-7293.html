			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Better a trading partner than a paranoid enemy Sir, As a London-based US citizen observing the Cuban situation, I agree with your leader's timely suggestions ('A new deal for Cuba', August 22). It is absurd for US taxpayers to subsidise further a costly and militant posture against most Cuban residents, whose principal ambition is greater exposure to the 'free world's' markets; its goods, services, ideas, tourists, institutions and its relative freedoms. The anti-Castro lobby in Florida should take the lead in encouraging political and economic liberalisation within Cuba. History has shown that a paranoid enemy is usually more problematical than a co-operating trading partner. Karl A Ziegler, The Centre for Accountability and Debt Relief, 6 Bradbrook House, Kinnerton Street, London SW1X 8EL</p>

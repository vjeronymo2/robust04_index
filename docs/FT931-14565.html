			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Executive pay rises slow to average 6.3% BRITISH executives' pay rises slowed to an average of 6.3 per cent last year compared with 9.3 per cent in 1991, says the latest index from the Noble Lowndes group of management consultants and actuaries, Michael Dixon writes. The index includes the value of benefits such as cars and pensions as well as salaries and bonuses. Chief executives of companies with Pounds 600m-plus turnovers continued to pull ahead of other managers. An average rise of 7.2 per cent took the big company chiefs' total package to just over Pounds 250,000 compared with a total for all managers of Pounds 80,577.

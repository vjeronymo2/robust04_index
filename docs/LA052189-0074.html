			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: THE GODFATHERS "MORE SONGS ABOUT LOVE AND HATE." EPIC **: ALBUMS  ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> This second effort from the besuited British quintet best-known for the  roiling, boiling single "Birth, School, Work, Death" (1988) is as bedrock-solid  as it is ultimately unspectacular. Not a bum track in the bunch, but aside from  "Walking, Talking Johnny Cash Blues" -- a definite cult classick -- and the  current single "She Gives Me Love" -- which pretty much packs everything these  wise guys know into one lashing, slashing hunk of pop aggression -- there's  naught that memorable either. Still, fans of dour vocals, sour romance, kinda  Kinks-y, semi-Stonesy, sixtieszoid riffslinging -- (some HAIR-raising guitar  outros here) can lay their ample heads on this weary bosom and find that the  heart of rock 'n' roll is still making an offer you can't refuse.

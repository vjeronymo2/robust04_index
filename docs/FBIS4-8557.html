			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, April 13 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Defence  Minister Pavle Bulatovic on Wednesday described NATO air strikes  on Bosnian Serb positions as an act of aggression against the  Serb people, which could have unconceivable consequences.    In a statement to the Yugoslav news agency TANJUG, Bulatovic  said that the United Nations had sided with the Moslems and thus  discredited its peacekeeping role and moral prestige.    No one may use "arms to deny anybody's right to defend  themselves and the Serb people have a legitimate natural right  to self-defence, guaranteed them by the U.N. Charter," he said.    The defence minister said that NATO bombing of Serb  positions  around Gorazde had hit "not only all the Serbs, but also the  conscience of every man opting for peace and ending of the war  in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [no closing quotation mark as received]    Said Bulatovic: If NATO's aim had been to persuade all  warring sides to start negotiating it produced nothing but an  exactly opposite effect -- it encouraged those favouring a war  option, and worried those well aware that peace cannot be  reached by the force of arms.    He went on to say that, after an impartial justice show,  representing an act of aggression against the Serb people, which  could bring about unforeseeable consequences, one should expect  and hope that NATO would give up the law of the stronger and  enable the warring sides to lay their arms and return to  negotiating a peaceful settlement.</p>

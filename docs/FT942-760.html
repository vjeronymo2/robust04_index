			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Brent Walker director 'did not know of Pounds 5m fee' A former non-executive director of the Brent Walker Group knew nothing of a Pounds 5m commission fee supposedly paid to a close business associate of Mr George Walker, the former chairman and chief executive of the property and leisure group, the Old Bailey heard yesterday. Mr John Hemingway, a solicitor who regularly attended main board meetings of Brent Walker, had never heard of the payment made by Brent Walker to Mr Michael Eland, he told the court. He was giving evidence in the trial of Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, the former Brent Walker finance director. The prosecution alleges the two men were involved in fraudulently boosting the Brent Walker Group's profits by Pounds 19.3m between 1984 and 1987. Mr Walker denies four charges of theft totalling Pounds 17m, two charges of false accounting and one of conspiracy to falsify the company's accounts. Mr Aquilina denies one charge of the theft of Pounds 4.5m, three of false accounting and one of conspiracy to falsify accounts. Mr Peter Rook, prosecuting for the Serious Fraud Office, was questioning Mr Hemingway about a Pounds 5m payment supposedly made to Mr Eland as commission for his work in seeking out attractive new investments for the Brent Walker group in continental Europe. The prosecution claims the payment was bogus and part of an attempt to conceal the profit-boosting fraud by a series of complex circular transactions involving the apparent sales of film rights by the Brent Walker film division. It alleges that the claimed profits were bogus since the sales were ultimately funded by Brent Walker itself. Mr Hemingway agreed he had met Mr Eland on several occasions - usually in the company of Mr Walker or Mr Aquilina. However, he had no idea how much Mr Eland was paid or on what basis. He could not remember the commission fee ever being discussed at a Brent Walker board meeting. Neither could he remember seeing any details of the payment in the Brent Walker accounts, he told the court. Mr Rook then asked him whether he had been aware of the transfer of Pounds 5m and Pounds 7.5m in 1989 from Brent Walker to Goldcrest films, part of the film subsidiary. Mr Hemingway replied that he had been unaware of these transfers until he was interviewed by SFO investigators in 1991. The trial continues today.</p>

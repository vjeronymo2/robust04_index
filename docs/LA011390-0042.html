			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH MEETS WITH FAMILY OF SOLDIER KILLED IN PANAMA  </P> <P> President Bush took time out on Friday to meet privately with the family of  Army Pfc. James Markwell, a Ranger medic killed by gunfire during the Dec. 20  Panama invasion.  </P> <P> The White House said Bush, in Cincinnati where he spoke to a gathering of the  city's Chamber of Commerce, expressed his personal sympathy and gratitude for  the sacrifice that Markwell made for his country.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, speaking with reporters later,  said the President's talk with the family of the dead soldier was "a pretty  emotional meeting."  </P> <P> Fitzwater said that "we were all pretty broken up about it," referring to the  President, as well as several aides and Secret Service agents.  </P> <P> He said that the soldier's mother, Mrs. William Rouse, showed the President a  poem that her son had written when he was 15 years old about being in the  military, as well as a "death message" that he had written before going into  combat.  </P> <P> Fitzwater said that in that message her son "was proud of what he was doing. It  was a little message for each of the people he knew in life."  </P> <P> "That was really tough," Fitzwater added.  </P> <P> Bush has sent letters of condolence to all the families of all those killed in  Panama, officials said.  </P></p>

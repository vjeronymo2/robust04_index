			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> LOVING RE-CREATION OF 'BLUE DAHLIA'  </P> <P> The Pacific Theatre Ensemble has carved out a genre for itself: a kind of  meticulous reproduction of period pieces, from the only partially successful  "Romanoff's" to the more distinguished Victorian gothic "Slaughterhouse on  Tanner's Close." Its latest effort, at the attractive Court Theatre on La  Cienega Boulevard (which seems the ideal '40s setting for this piece), is a  stage version of the 1946 movie, "The Blue Dahlia," produced by John Houseman  and written by Raymond Chandler from his own unfinished novel.  </P> <P> Once again, it's director Daniel O'Connor, responsible for "Tanner's Close,"  who gives this adaptation fidelity, breadth and bustle -- a fluidity that ebbs  and flows like film, but punctuated by the Blue Dahlia nightclub's latest  sensation: a torch singer (the sensational Christine Ebersole) with a  repertoire of top '40s songs used here to securely anchor the action to the  stage in a manner that would never happen in the movies.  </P> <P> The story is virtually untampered Chandler, with a script that sticks closely  to the film that featured Alan Ladd, Veronica Lake and good old William Bendix.  It's the tale of a Navy flyer who, at war's end, comes home to an unfaithful  wife and is caught in a web of murder and deceit from which, "neither tarnished  nor afraid," he eventually emerges vindicated after many "mean streets"  machinations and a panoramic sense of a still pubescent Los Angeles full of  innocence and stock footage.  </P> <P> In fact, the story lacks plot distinction (a fascinating account of the  improbable making of the film may be found in Houseman's book, "Entertainers  and the Entertained"). But nostalgia for the Chandleresque, for the halcyon Los  Angeles that was, add up to iconography -- a preoccupation with the piece as an  image of its time, much enhanced by the devotion and fidelity of the bright  younger generation that comprises this talented cast.  </P> <P> There are 41 characters in O'Connor's adaptation, performed by half as many  quick-change artists who never let the tempo flag. Repetitive moments written  into the original screenplay hit the stage version in its second half, but  these are barely felt in the uninterrupted flow of action, with smoking guns,  sultry women, skulking hoods and characters swirling about the stage as  continual window dressing: "extras" fleshing out this play with the trappings  and tradition of film.  </P> <P> It is skillfully done, with respect and even with adoration. The ensemble is  remarkable in its abilities to do several things at once, while the leads are  valiantly undertaken by Ramy Zada as Navy flyer Johnny Morrison; Steven J.  Markus and Ross Hindley as his squadron buddies Buzz and George, respectively;  Jeffrey Josephson as the sinister Eddie Harwood, owner of the Blue Dahlia  nightclub; Marcia Firesten as Eddie's estranged wife; and, to a lesser extent,  Jill Jacobson who seems to be forcing her role as the faithless Helen Morrison.  (Jacobson and Markus also produced the show.)  </P> <P> Thomas Buderwitz's two-level set is crammed with accurate detail, from the  prominent jukebox (that looks swiped from the movie), to the old-style pay  phone on the wall, the antique Coke machine, period posters and old-time radio.  Lori Martin's costumes are equally impeccable, from the guys' broad-brimmed  Borsalinos, wide lapels and affection for Hawaiian shirts, to the women's hair  styles, shoes and gowns. Ebersole's gifted crooning, Toni Destefanis' staging  of jitterbugging couples and William Maloney's musical arrangements will bring  a lump to the throat of anyone over 50.  </P> <P> This said, there remains a philosophical question. As with "Tanner's Close" or,  for that matter, "Romanoff's," does such loving reproduction amount to anything  more than a piece of affectionate recreation? A valentine to the memory of  Raymond Chandler and, beyond him, to an entire and specific Hollywood era? The  answer is no. "The Blue Dahlia" must be admired and enjoyed within these  limitations. But taken at face value, strictly for what it is, it can be great  fun and splendid entertainment.  </P> <P>  At 722 N. La Cienega Blvd. Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays 2:30  and 7:30 p.m., until April 23. Tickets: $20; (213) 466-1767.  </P></p>

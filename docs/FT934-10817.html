			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Forte unsettled Shares in Forte were unsettled by talk in the market that CIGA, the loss-making Italian hotelier currently being courted by the UK group, had been made a more attractive offer by Hyatt Hotels, of the US. Forte came off 7 at one stage, but rallied towards the close to finish 3 adrift at 216p. Turnover was an average 2m. Forte struck a management deal with CIGA last month, paying Pounds 33m cash and inserting some of its own luxury hotels with a value of about Pounds 125m into an Italian operating company. However, the two groups were undergoing due diligence, and leisure analysts have been told that the deal is some months away from being finalised.</p>

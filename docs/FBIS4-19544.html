			<p>BFN     [Text] On Friday, [15 April], the Triomphant, the first of  France's second-generation missile-launching nuclear submarines,  made its maiden voyage from the naval port of Cherbourg. It  will undergo a period of testing before entering into active  service in 1997. During the next few days, the 13,000-tonne  vessel will make its first static submersion off Cherbourg, and  it is scheduled to arrive in Brest within two weeks. According  to its manufacturers, it is "the most silent submarine in the  world."</p>

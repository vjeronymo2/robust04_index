			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / People: European connection Peter Walker, the former Conservative cabinet minister and now a life peer, has added the chairmanship of Cornhill Insurance to his list of boardroom responsibilities, reviving an insurance connection which stretches back to the early 1950's. Walker made his debut in the City as an insurance broker, forming Walker Young, which was one of the building blocks of the Slater Walker empire. The appointment combines Walker's long experience in insurance with his pronounced pro-European sympathies. Germany's Allianz, Europe's biggest insurance company, took over Cornhill in 1986. Walker, who will head a seven-man German-style supervisory board, takes over from Cecil Burrows, 70, who has been with Cornhill since 1938 and chairman since 1988. The new chairman is not promising any fireworks at this stage - but some steady expansion could clearly be on the cards. Since 1986 Cornhill's share of the UK general insurance market has remained stubbornly low at around 3 per cent. The formidable German company is not normally content to play a minor role.</p>

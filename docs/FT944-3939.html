			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / International Company News: Investors issue writ against News Corp A long-running row between News Corporation and investors in securities issued in 1989 by its subsidiaries has flared again after 18 private investors issued a writ in Frankfurt against the media group owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch. The dispute goes back to December 1993, when News Corp published a notice in the Financial Times and the German Borsenzeitung telling holders of its preference shares and convertible bonds - exchangeable for shares which News held in Pearson - that they would also get Royal Doulton shares when exercising their exchange right. However, in February, News Corp issued another notice saying investors were not entitled to shares in Royal Doulton, the fine china manufacturer demerged last year from Pearson. The convertibles were denominated in D-Marks and the preference shares were in sterling and Dutch guilders. News Corp's conflicting notices had serious financial implications. The value of the conversion package was less without the Royal Doulton shares than the redemption value of the bonds. Moreover, many holders had sold Royal Doulton shares they did not own in anticipation of receiving them as part of the exchange property. The loss to investors, including covering the short positions, has been estimated at Pounds 15m (Dollars 24.6m). The 18 claimants demand delivery of the Royal Doulton shares, or the financial equivalent, and compensation for their transaction losses The case will be closely watched by UK-based bankers and investors involved in the dispute. In September, News Corp rejected arbitration when a group of disgruntled investors and banks tried to take the case to the City Disputes Panel in London. Last night, News Corp said: 'We have not received a copy of any German proceedings, and cannot therefore comment at this stage.'</p>

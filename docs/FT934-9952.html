			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Weakness in US Treasuries starts a flood of new issues JUST AS investors were thinking about shutting up shop early as one of the most profitable years in the Eurobond market draws to a close, they have suddenly been faced with an avalanche of new issues as borrowers make a last-minute dash to the market. The weakness in the US Treasury market, which has also shaken investor confidence in the European government bond markets, has prompted fears that the time to raise funds at current low interest rates is running out fast. However, since investors are increasingly reluctant to blot their copy-books at such a late stage in the year, issuers may well have to pay a higher yield than they planned to ensure a successful placement of their bonds. Investors are likely to be able to take their pick of a wide range of offerings this week. In the French franc sector, Electric Power Development Co, the Japanese government-guaranteed agency, is expected to make a rare appearance with a FFr1.1bn offering of seven-year Eurobonds. The yield spread on EPDC's bonds, which will mark the issuer's first deal in the French franc sector since 1987, is likely to be in the high teens. Depfa, the German mortgage bank which has been active in the Eurobond market in recent weeks, is due to launch its well-flagged offering of 10-year bonds, which should raise between FFr2bn and FFr3bn. The yield spread is expected to be in the low 20s. The Spanish autonomous region of Andalucia has had to lower its sights as a result of the increased activity in the French franc sector. It had hoped to achieve a yield spread of between 35 and 40 basis points for its forthcoming FFr1.3bn offering of 10-year Eurobonds. But syndicate managers now expect Andalucia to pay between 43 and 45 basis points over French government bonds. Other issues which should emerge this week include a Dollars 500m 10-year offering from BAT Industries, an issue of the same amount but with a five-year maturity from Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz, and a Pounds 200m credit-card securitisation from Standard Chartered Bank. The market is also limbering up for a large yen offering from the Republic of Italy, which could raise as much as Y300bn. The offering could be launched in the Samurai market, the Japanese domestic bond market for foreign borrowers. There is strong demand among domestic Japanese investors for bonds offering a margin over the Japanese bond market's current low yields. This has led to a considerable erosion in the spreads which foreign borrowers have to pay. For example, on Friday, the Republic of Turkey achieved relatively aggressive pricing for its two Samurai deals, which raised a total of Y80bn. It paid Libor plus 90 basis points for the Y30bn five-year tranche and Libor plus 140 basis points for the Y50bn tranche, which has an eight-year maturity. The acceleration in new issue volume has taken the spotlight off the high-quality Spanish borrowers scheduled to tap the Eurobond market in the coming weeks. But these offerings are expected to be snapped up because of the market's favourable perception of Spain and the relative low supply of Spanish debt. Andalucia's French franc offering could come early this week. The Basque Country is hosting a presentation for investors in Zurich on November 15, which is expected to be followed by an SFr150m - SFr200m offering with a maturity of between seven and 10 years. Instituto Nacional de Industria, Spain's state industrial holding company, hopes for a spread of between 37 and 42 basis points on its pending Dollars 500m offering, which is likely to have a five-year maturity.</p>

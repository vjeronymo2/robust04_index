			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA does not plant to use NIST 1828 material in its standard solutions. However, the agency presently uses the material for the purpose for which it was intended, as a reference material for calibration purposes, and will continue to do so. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency proposed to conduct 40 trials under Test 1 (20 at .008 BAC and 20 at .032 BAC) and 20 trials under Test 2 (at .000 BAC). For reusable devices, these 60 trials would be conducted using a single unit. For disposable devices, these 60 trials would be conducted using 60 separate units. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA's notice explained that some alcohol screening devices indicate the presence of alcohol in a manner that is unambiguous and requires no interpretation, such as by the use of a light or numerical reading. For these devices, NHTSA proposed that Tests 1 and 2 (at .008, .032 and .000 BAC) would be performed by an investigator at the DOT Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (VNTSC). To conform with the Model Specifications, the notice stated that the device must perform with no positive results at .000 BAC, not more than one positive result at .008 BAC and not more than one non-positive result at .032 BAC. If the device is capable of providing a reading of greater than 0.000 BAC and less than 0.020 BAC, the device must perform with not more than one such result at .000 BAC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA's notice explained that other devices indicate the presence of alcohol in a manner that requires interpretation and may involve some ambiguity, such as by the use of color changes. For these devices, NHTSA proposed that Tests 1 and 2 (at .008, .032 and .000 BAC) would be performed by ten individuals who have no knowledge of test BACs and qualify as test interpreters. VNTSC would select these individuals using manufacturer's restrictions, if any. These individuals would be asked to read the manufacturer's instructions for the interpretation of the device's read-out, and interpret the test results independently. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To conform with the Model Specifications, the notice proposed that the device must perform, with each interpreter, with no positive results at .000 BAC, not more than one positive result at .008 BAC and not more than one non-positive result at .032 BAC. If the device is capable to providing a reading of greater than 0.000 BAC and less than 0.020 BAC, the notice proposed that the device must perform, with each interpreter, with not more than one such result at .000 BAC. These aspects of the Model Specifications have been adopted without change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An organization that represents substance abuse program administrators suggested that, if practical, the ten individuals select to interpret the devices should have no medical training since it is likely that the persons who will be administering the tests in the field will have no such training. The agency plans to select individuals with varying backgrounds and experience. While we do not believe there is justification for imposing a restriction on the selection of individuals who have medical training, it is likely that few if any of the individuals selected will have such training. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A manufacturer of saliva screening devices suggested that the Model Specifications should provide for a familiarization period, to ensure that investigators and individuals who will be evaluating these devices are familiar with the manner in which the devices should operate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preamble to the proposed Model Specifications explained that individual evaluators will be asked to read the manufacturer's instructions before they perform their evaluations. These individuals will be provided sufficient time to become familiar with these instructions, and will also be given instructions for conducting the evaluations. Investigators will also provide themselves with sufficient time to read the manufacturer's instructions and become familiar with the devices they are testing, as well as the evaluation procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA stated in the February 15 notice that, through the independent interpretation of ten individuals, it believed the Model Specifications would ensure that the results of tested devices are visible and will remain so for a reasonable period of time and area likely to be interpreted in a consistent manner. The notice indicated that the tests would require approximately two hours to run. The agency requested comments on these aspects of the proposed Model and Specifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments were supportive of these aspects of the proposed Model Specifications, except that two commenters objected to the requirement that screening results remain visible for two hours. One of the commenters considered this to be an unreasonable requirement, particularly when (according to the commenter) the primary basis for the requirement is the convenience of the testing facility that will be evaluating the device. The other commenter was concerned that this two-hour period could invalidate the results, since some devices require that the user read and record the test result within a specific period of time (such as two minutes). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon further consideration based on these comments, NHTSA has decided to modify the requirement that results must remain visible for two hours. It is not feasible, however, for the agency to eliminate the requirement altogether. In part to facilitate the evaluation of these devices, and also to be consistent with the DOT Alcohol Testing Procedures (49 CFR Part 40), which provide that the waiting period between screening and confirmation tests must be at least 15 minutes but should be no longer than 20 minutes, NHTSA will modify its testing methods so that the interpretation of results will be accomplished within 20 minutes of dosing. Accordingly, the results of disposable interpretive devices will need to remain visible for a period of only 20 minutes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The notice explained that, to NHTSA's knowledge, no reusable devices currently use interpretive readings and the agency believes it is unlikely that manufacturers would begin to use such readings in reusable devices. Accordingly, NHTSA proposed that the Model Specifications would not include a methodology for testing reusable interpretive devices. We requested comments on this aspect of the proposed Model Specifications. The commenters that addressed this issue agreed with the agency's proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For disposable devices that use interpretive readings, NHTSA proposed to combine Tests 1 and 2, and number the units and expose them to the three BAC levels using a methodology that would not reveal to the person interpreting the test the dosage received by any particular unit. NHTSA requested comments on this proposed methodology. No comments were received. The proposed methodology has been adopted without change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

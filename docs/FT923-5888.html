			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Armenia's troubled leader puts on a brave face: Ter-Petrosian is beset by growing opposition, economic crisis and an undeclared war JUST ONE day after repelling an opposition attempt to sack him last week, Armenia's president, Mr Levon Ter-Petrosian, seemed unfazed by his growing problems as he nonchalantly put another cigarette in his gold-tipped holder. In an interview the 47-year-old former academic appeared unmoved by the bitter undeclared war with neighbouring ex-Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, an economic blockade that has shut down half of the country's industry, and the increasingly restive opposition. 'Of course I am being condemned and accused,' said Mr Ter-Petrosian, speaking softly in Armenian, one of 13 languages in which he is conversant. 'But it would be interesting to hear what solutions they would suggest instead.' Things are bad in Armenia. Mr Ter-Petrosian claims his nation is not at war, but merely provides humanitarian assistance to ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh, the disputed enclave that lies entirely within Azerbaijan. The reality is different. The land-locked nation of 3.3m people is committed to securing a favourable outcome in the four-year-old war, which has killed more than 2,000 people and crippled the economy. Many fear the latest ceasefire may turn out to be another in a long line of failed efforts to secure peace. In the capital, Mr Ter-Petrosian admitted, a certain degree of corruption and lawlessness prevails. In addition to bureaucrats demanding bribes, merchants complain of organised criminal gangs demanding protection money. One gang recently blew up a city centre cafe, whose owners wouldn't pay up. 'In a transition period there is a certain anarchy and uncontrollability,' he said. Azerbaijan, through which 80 per cent of Armenia's fuel and goods were previously transported, has blockaded its neighbour because of the war. This has sent Armenia's fuel prices up 70-fold since last January, according to Mr Steve Tashjian, the energy minister. The instability in neighbouring Georgia, Armenia's only other source of fuel, cut off supplies for the entire month of June, Mr Tashjian said. Since then supplies have arrived at only half the needed volume. Last winter, Armenia's light industry - which makes up more than half its economy - came to a standstill, and now is up to just 50 per cent of previous production, Mr Tashjian said. The economy contracted by at least 12 per cent last year, according to an International Monetary Fund report. The figure excluded the worst months of last winter, January through March, when there was no natural gas and virtually the entire nation stopped working. Outside Yerevan, there is almost no electricity, and power is available in the capital itself for only 12 hours a day. Worried Armenians have been chopping down trees from their sparse forests, and in the capital stacks of firewood can be seen on flat balconies. Mr Tashjian, an American on leave from the US electricity supply company Southern California Edison, said that if natural gas supplies continue from Georgia, Armenian industry will be able to operate at current levels for 60 days of the winter. If Armenia wants to get its economy going Mr Tashjian said, it must eventually restart its two nuclear units at Medzamor, 30 km south-west of Yerevan. The units generate 830 mw of power annually, or one-fourth of the nation's needs, before they were shut down following Armenia's devastating 1988 earthquake. The public continues to strongly oppose their reactivation. Mr Tashjian said it would cost Dollars 200m and take two years to get just one of the units going again. 'We either must reactivate the plant or find a substitute,' he said. The war was the primary complaint voiced by opponents who held three days of protests in Yerevan against Mr Ter-Petrosian last week. A day later he survived a no-confidence move by insisting that, should a public referendum support his leadership, the opposition-majority parliament would be dissolved. The taunt caused his critics to back down. Mr Ter-Petrosian is trying to give the appearance of marching gamely ahead. He doesn't mind too much having traded his former career at Yerevan University for his current job. 'I will only have regrets if I am convinced that my current drive is a failure.' Mr Ter-Petrosian made it clear that, in his opinion, no-one can yet claim justifiably that it is.</p>

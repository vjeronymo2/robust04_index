			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Europe's most respected companies: Customer loyalty and clear policy top agenda Europe's most respected companies include a retailer which has stuck to its core business and an international engineering group largely created over the past six years. Marks and Spencer, the high street retailer, almost a national institution in Britain, and ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the pioneering Swedish-Swiss multinational industrial group, emerged as clear winners when top executives were asked to identify their most respected European companies, regardless of sector. Both companies won the praise of their peers, in particular for their leadership and management qualities. ABB's supporters highlighted the group's strategy, while M&amp;S's customer focus attracted much support. M&amp;S received particularly strong backing from UK-based respondents, while ABB won more broad-based support from executives across Europe. Both companies obtained the most votes from companies in their respective sectors. The survey asked senior executives in each sector - chairmen, chief executives and finance directors - to identify their most respected competitors on seven dimensions of excellence: customer focus, staff, products and services, business performance, leadership and management, strategy, and environmental issues. Respondents were invited to identify the qualities behind these judgments and to nominate the European company they most respected overall. Because this is the first peer group survey of its kind in Europe, year-on-year comparisons are not possible. In addition, response rates in some sectors, for example steel, property and entertainment sectors, were low and have been excluded from the sector results. The questionnaire was sent to 637 companies, achieving a response rate of around 30 per cent, relatively high for a postal survey. There was a slightly higher response from the UK. Since the results are based on the views of those executives who did respond, they are impressionistic rather than scientific. Nevertheless the results, which span 17 different sectors and nine countries across Europe, provide a unique snapshot of senior management attitudes and current thinking, providing some important insights into which qualities Europe's business leaders most admire. In particular the results highlight the willingness of many senior executives to vote for companies outside their countries. Italian and French executives tended to vote for international companies, suggesting a more pan-European focus. British and German executives were more inclined to vote for their domestic counterparts. A wide range of companies qualified for accolades. The overall top 25 companies irrespective of sector, include world-class competitors from most industry sectors and eight nations. Nine of the top 25 are based in Britain, four each are French and German, three are Swiss, two are Belgian and two of the top five, Royal Dutch/Shell and Unilever, are Anglo-Dutch. Only one of the top rated companies - Virgin, the UK-based airline and entertainment group run by Mr Richard Branson - is not a quoted company. Another, L'Oreal, the world's largest cosmetics group, is quoted but majority controlled by Mrs Liliane Bettencourt, daughter of the group's founder. Some, like British Telecom, the UK-based global telecommunications group, have made the transition from government ownership to the private sector quite recently. Forty per cent of the top 25, including three financial stalwarts - Deutsche Bank, Union Bank of Switzerland and Zurich Insurance - are in service sectors, but the top 25 also includes heavyweight industrial players such as Rolls- Royce, Bayerische Motoren Werke, GEC and Siemens. Significantly most of the top 25 companies also headed the lists for executives' most respected companies in their own sectors, often by a large margin. For example, Royal Dutch/Shell, Unilever and Roche were all clear winners in their respective sectors. There were, however, surprises. For example, Reuters topped the media sector by a large margin, but did not appear in the top 25. Neither did Philipp Holzmann, which won the construction, homebuilding and building material group, or Muenchener Ruckversicherungs Gesellschaft which led the insurance sector. In general, respondents indicated the winning companies showed a commitment to their shareholders, customers, and employees. The most frequently cited qualities across all sectors were consistent growth and long-term profitability, clear business objectives and high customer loyalty. At the other end of the scale, demonstrations of commitment to equal opportunities, progressive qualities regarding childcare and taking a strong position on social issues earned little praise. Perhaps more surprisingly investing heavily in research and development also came low down the scale of respected qualities. Some cited characteristics stand out at country level. Customer loyalty was the most valued quality in the UK, but came lower down the scale of priorities for respondents from the other large European countries. Growth and profitability was the most important attribute for respondents from Germany and France, and ranked second in the UK and Italy, but came eleventh in Spain. A satisfied staff was rated the most important in the Netherlands and was high on most other country lists. But it was not regarded as being particularly important in either the UK or Italy. Training and development was rated as the third most important quality in Germany, but was only tenth for UK respondents. Providing staff with the resources to deliver high quality services and products was the top attribute in Italy, and fourth in the UK, but was less important in France and Germany. At sector level it was harder to draw firm conclusions. Nevertheless the survey produced some surprising and some predictable results. For example, it was predictable that customer loyalty was the most highly valued attribute in the retail sector and came first or second in construction, engineering and food processing industries. Customer service ranked as the most important or second most important attribute in the banking, chemicals, electronics and telecommunications. However, although research and development was rated the joint top attribute in pharmaceuticals it hardly received a mention in other sectors. The use of technology was the number one attribute for the media sector and ranked number three for telecommunications, but was lower ranked in other industries. More predictably pollution reduction was judged to be the most important factor for companies in the construction, electricity and water, and oil and gas sectors. Significantly in those sectors which are undergoing substantial regulatory change or technological development - for example electricity, water, and telecommunications - adapting to the needs of the 1990s was the top rated quality.</p>

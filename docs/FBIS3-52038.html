In assessing his trip to Leticia, a  Colombian town near the Brazilian border, President Franco told  JORNAL DO BRASIL that "Colombia is an important partner."  Moreover, Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who accompanied Franco  in his trip to Leticia, said: "Through a free-trade zone we  would be able to negotiate under better terms with other trade  groups, such as NAFTA."    Franco and Gaviria installed the Brazilian-Colombian  Neighborhood Commission, which will be entrusted with finding  solutions to problems concerning the fight against narcotics,  environmental protection, and the adoption of measures to  improve health and education conditions and assist Amazonian  indigenous groups.    The ideas is to expedite negotiations with Colombia before  Gaviria leaves the presidency. Colombia is holding presidential  elections at the end of the first half of this year, and Gaviria  will be running for the OAS General Secretariat. The proposal  to establish a South American Free Trade Zone (comprised of the  Mercosur [Common Market of the South] countries Brazil,  Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay; Chile; and the five Andean  Group member countries Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia) was  also discussed at the Mercosur presidential summit held in  Colonia, Uruguay last week.</p>

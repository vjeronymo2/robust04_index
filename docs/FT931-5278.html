			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Income funds buy utilities THE 'Barclays' factor continued to influence the market yesterday, with many of the City's biggest income funds severely shaken by Barclays' decision to halve the final dividend. These funds were said to have focused their interest yesterday on utilities, which are perceived by fund managers as providing safe earnings and a strong dividend return whatever the economic conditions. The prospect of Europe-wide reductions in interest rates gave further impetus to the sectors. Water stocks performed exceptionally well, with dealers citing the unravelling of some heavy programme trade business late on Thursday, as driving share prices higher. The biggest business in the waters was seen in the Footsie-100 stocks where Anglian closed 6 up at 528p, North West Water 3 1/2 better at 513p and Thames which settled 6 1/2 to the good at 531p. The generators moved sharply higher in heavy turnover, despite their recent strong outperformance of the rest of the utilities stocks, with National Power settling 8 higher at 326p and PowerGen the same amount better at 330p. Scottish Hydro shrugged aside worries that the company may be ejected from the Footsie 100 following the forthcoming March 9 meeting of the steering committee and edged up 3 to 256p. The 70p call on the Scottish generators shares is due on April 6. Southern Electric, viewed by some as another prime candidate to drop out of the Footsie-100, closed 9 up at 479p.</p>

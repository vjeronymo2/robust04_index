			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc stocks hit 15-month high as squeeze continues but only slightly - yesterday after the arrival of 14,675 tonnes of the metal into LME warehouses was reported. This brings total LME stocks to 83,125 tonnes, their highest level for 15 months. The premium for metal for immediate delivery compared with zinc for delivery in three months (the backwardation) increased to Dollars 224.50 a tonne by the close, compared with Dollars 217 on Monday. But the cost of borrowing cash zinc for one day settled just below Dollars 20 a tonne compared with Dollars 60 reached at one stage on Monday. LME executives had known for some time that a technical squeeze on the zinc market was looming, were in touch with the principal parties involved and preferred to use diplomatic pressure, rather than overt interference, to maintain an orderly market, traders and analysts suggested. The LME had been probing people's intentions and ability to meet commitments and was satisfied events could be allowed to take their course. However, an unexpected element of panic entered dealings on Monday afternoon when Dollars 60 a tonne was being paid to borrow cash zinc for one day. This took the executive by surprise because it had assurances from Metallgesellschaft and its clients would ensure the market was kept liquid. The German group's UK trading subsidiary has a number of clients which have built up large holdings of zinc to cover disruptions in supplies. 'With the best will in the world, sometimes these situations get out of hand,' a trader said. The fact that the premium to borrow cash zinc for one day fell back below Dollars 20 a tonne yesterday showed that enough metal was being made available at a reasonable cost, traders said. In December 1989, when a squeeze on the market threatened to widen the daily premium sharply, the LME executive imposed a limit of Dollars 20 a tonne on the daily backwardation. Analysts defending the executive's decision not to act this week pointed out that action would have brought protests about interference with free market forces. 'They're damned if they do and damned if they don't,' said one. Zinc for immediate delivery was Dollars 1,425 a tonne (down Dollars 5) at the close last night while metal for delivery in three months was Dollars 1,200.50 (down Dollars 13).  ------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ------------------------------- (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------- Aluminium  -1600   to  347,000 Copper     +5375   to  224,150 Lead        -125   to   70,225 Nickel      +414   to    6,210 Zinc      +14675   to   83,125 Tin         -255   to   17,555  -------------------------------</p>

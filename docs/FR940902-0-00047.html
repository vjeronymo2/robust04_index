			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 627.420(e)(4) is amended to correct a miscitation from &sect;627.435(e) to &sect;627.435(i).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 627.420(e)(5) prohibits the use of the cost-plus percentage of cost method. This prohibition comes from both OMB Circular A&hyph;102 and the FAR. A few commenters indicated that this was an advantageous procurement method. This Federal-wide prohibition is being maintained in the final regulations due to the fact that these types of agreements provide a disincentive to vendors/subrecipients to reduce costs, since the higher the overall cost of the agreement, the higher the profit. It is recommended that JTPA entities negotiate specific dollar levels of profit, or investigate the possible use of other types of agreements, such as cost-plus award fee. Further, there appears to be some misunderstanding concerning the allowability of using fixed-price agreements. Fixed-price agreements are the preferred type of agreement when using the sealed bid (Invitation for Bids) process. Fixed-price agreements may be performance-based and may be chargeable to a benefiting cost category based upon a documented cost analysis, as discussed above, the services provided, and whether the agreement is for tuition or for a commercially available training package, as discussed in connection with &sect;627.440.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 627.420(g) which reiterates the requirement found in section 164(a)(3)(I) of the Act that procurement transactions between units of State or local government or entities organized principally as the administrative entity for SDA's or SSG's, shall be on a cost-reimbursable basis. The final rule now clarifies that cost-plus types of agreements are not allowable (e.g., cost-plus fixed-fee). Based on one comment, language is added concerning the payment of tuition and/or entrance fees to schools that are part of a governmental entity. The specific instances under which tuition and entrance fees may be paid, without breaking them down to their specific cost elements, are listed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters addressed &sect;627.420(h), which establishes the requirement that recipient and subrecipient procurements clearly specify deliverables and the basis for payment, and include specified clauses. A few comments were received questioning the example that was given in the preamble to the interim final regulations of withholding final payment to an OJT contractor until the participant has been retained on the job for a specified period of time after the completion of training. The commenters wondered if the Department has predetermined deliverables for OJT. The discussion was intended merely as an example and does not set a hard and fast rule for OJT contracts, although the Department sees that such a contract provision might facilitate retention upon completion of OJT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the final regulations, paragraph (h)(2) on required clauses is revised, to break it into three paragraphs: clauses required for subrecipient awards; vendor awards; and vendor and subrecipient awards. In response to concerns expressed, the applicability of clauses such as copyright and rights in data is narrowed. Several commenters correctly pointed out that the regulations did not specify what the patent, copyright and rights and data clauses should be. The final rule is amended to remove the requirement for patent rights (since it is not expected that many patentable items will be developed using JTPA funds) and to include additional information on copyright and rights in data clauses. In the case of the copyrights clause requirement, the application of this clause is limited to those awards which involve the use or development of copyrighted materials. Also, the breach of award and termination clauses are expanded to cover all awards. In the newly designated paragraph (h)(4)(i), which relates to breach of agreements, this clause is now required to be included in all agreements, rather than be limited to those which exceed the small purchase limit. The rationale for this change is that a breach in a small purchase situation can be as damaging to the JTPA program as those in large dollar awards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 627.420(i) establishes the requirement that recipients and subrecipients have written protest procedures. A few comments were submitted on this section. One wondered how paragraph (i)(2), the referral of violations of law, related to TEGL 6&hyph;84 and the incident reporting system. This section of the regulations is amended to reference &sect;627.500(b) of the regulations, which establishes the referral requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Selection of Service Providers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 627.422 establishes the requirements for the selection of service providers. One commenter felt that the selection of service providers should be essentially a blind process, in which the specific sector of the provider is secondary to the provider's demonstrated ability. This is an accurate statement of the general intent of the Amendments and of the Department in developing this section of the regulations. Given the large amount of funds that are budgeted for JTPA titles II and III, it is important to ensure that procurements are done in a manner that will not only promote the integrity of the process and the efficient expenditure of the monies but will also allow organizations an opportunity to fairly compete to provide these services. Although it may be administratively easier to sole source the bulk of the JTPA monies, this not only is unfair to the other potential service providers in a specific geographic area, but it also could result in a diminution of the number of organizations that are able to provide services to the JTPA system as well as in an increase of costs due to the lack of competition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

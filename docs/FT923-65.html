			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Denmark produces tightly-priced Dollars 500m issue to top up its foreign reserves DENMARK turned to the Eurobond market yesterday to help top up its foreign exchange reserves, producing an extremely tightly-priced Dollars 500m issue that brought sharp intakes of breath from some underwriters. The lead-managers, though, reported that most of the paper was placed during the day, apparently disproving a view that borrowing costs in the international bond market would rise sharply after the events of recent days. The five-year issue had attracted bids at a yield of over 45 basis points above US Treasuries, but Daiwa won the mandate at a bid below 30. At launch, the bid spread was 28.2 basis points over Treasuries. Even the lead-managers said this was some four or five basis points below the market clearing level, though other banks said the yield should have been up to 10 basis points higher. Demand was said to be strong from the Far East, with more than half the bonds sold being placed there overnight. Daiwa said it and the two co-leads - Westdeutsche Landesbank and Warburg - had placed some 80 per cent of the Dollars 420m of bonds they had underwritten between them. That was a higher proportion than most others had thought possible given tight pricing. After breaking syndicate, Daiwa stood behind the issue, picking up some bonds as the yield spread rose to around 32 basis points. That appeared comfortable with the break-even for the syndicate at around 34 basis points, however, and the spread tightened later to under 30. The deal drew a mixture of grudging support and disbelief from other bankers. Even for a borrower renowned for squeezing every last basis point out of the market, the pricing was seen as very tight. Other bankers said only once the price had found its final level in the secondary market could the deal be judged.</p>

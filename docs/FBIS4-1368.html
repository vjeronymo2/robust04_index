			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Justice Minister Ossumane Ali Dauto revealed in  Maputo yesterday that some 6,000 Mozambican citizens who have  been sentenced to prison terms, or may be under custody  following judicial rulings, will not be allowed to vote in the  country's first presidential and legislative elections scheduled  to be held in October of this year.    Quoting Article 12 of the Electoral Law, Minister Ali Dauto  added that others not allowed to vote include those whose  sentences cannot be appealed, those clearly recognized as insane  -- even though they may not be impeded in terms of a sentence  --, those admitted to psychiatric establishments, and those  declared insane by a medical team.    Information released by the Information Ministry suggests  that, of the 6,000 Mozambicans mentioned above, 5,000 are  detainees and the others are in custody. [passage omitted]</p>

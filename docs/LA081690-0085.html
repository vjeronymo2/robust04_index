			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIGEO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The son of a San Diego evangelist who plans to buy the scandal-plagued PTL  ministry is in County Jail on a burglary charge, police said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Police arrested Mark Stephen Cerullo, 33, the youngest son of evangelist Morris  Cerullo, in connection with an aborted burglary attempt at a home-improvement  store July 29, said police spokesman Bill Robinson.  </P> <P> Mark Cerullo was apprehended by security guards at the Home Depot store in the  3500 block of Sports Arena Boulevard, where he allegedly posed as a store  employee and tried to leave without paying for an air-conditioning unit,  Robinson said.  </P> <P> Mark Cerullo is charged with one count of burglary and one count of grand  theft, said Linda Miller of the district attorney's office. He is scheduled for  arraignment Aug. 28 in Superior Court, Miller said.  </P> <P> Mark Cerullo is on probation from a February, 1989, burglary conviction,  Robinson said.  </P> <P> Last spring, a federal bankruptcy judge gave Morris Cerullo approval to buy the  PTL cable network and Heritage USA theme park formerly owned by Jim Bakker.  </P> <P> Morris Cerullo produced the funds needed to purchase the network, pending  approval from the Federal Communications Commission, and has reportedly been  trying to raise $45 million needed to buy the theme park.  </P></p>

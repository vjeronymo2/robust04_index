			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis--Informed Palestinian sources say that the  Fatah Revolutionary Council led by Yasir 'Arafat yesterday heard  a report by Faruq Qaddumi, the Fatah secretary general, in which  he attacked the recent Cairo agreement between Israel and the  PLO. The sources say that Qaddumi's attack was particularly  directed at 'Arafat's agreement to concede the right of  representation for the national authority abroad. The sources  said that a number of the Fatah Movement's Central Committee  members are unwilling to leave for Jericho and assume their  duties within the so-called national authority. The source said  that Faruq Qaddumi, Hani al-Hasan, Khalid al-Hasan, Muhammad  Jihad, and Muhammad Ghunaym have refused to go to Jericho,  especially since there are differences on coordinating work  between the Fatah commands at home and abroad.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 7 (CTK) -- The need of a strong  private sector as a source of prosperity of Slovakia's economy  is emphasised in the program of the new Slovak government of  Premier Jozef Moravcik which he will present to Parliament on  April 12.    The government intends to speed up the privatization process  with equal use of all its forms so that after the second  privatization wave is completed more than half state-owned  property is transferred into private possession, says the  statement obtained by CTK today.    Moravcik's cabinet will seek to facilitate the entrance of  foreign capital in the country's economy and is also willing to  offer companies put up for privatization to foreign buyers who  offer the most "interesting" business projects.    The new government, during its six-month term of office,  will  seek to bring to zero the growth of Slovakia's gross domestic  product, to maintain the growth of prices between 10 to 13  percent and privatization under 17 percent. It will seek to  achieve such a growth of Slovakia's foreign currency reserves as  to ensure the internal convertibility of the Slovak currency and  a positive payments balance. To preserve macro-economic  stability the government will seek a standby loan from the  International Monetary Fund (IMF), the statement says.    "The interconnection of the processes of economic and social  transformation remains the basic approach," the statement says  in the part dedicated to the social sphere. In order to solve  the problems of almost 15-percent unemployment rate which in  some regions rises up to 26.7 percent, the growth in long-term  unemployment and a situation in which almost half of Slovak  households live on the border of the sustenance level (15.2  percent of families live under this border) the government  intends to reassess the policy of providing material allowances,  extend job possibilities and protect the labor market.    Moravcik's cabinet considers integration into European  political, economic and security structures to be a strategic  priority for Slovakia's foreign policy orientation. "The  government confirms Slovakia's interest in full membership of  the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) and of the European Union  (EU)," the statement says. It will also seek to smoothly  complete the process of the ratification of an agreement on  Slovakia's association with the EU.    "We would like to achieve a consensus in society which would  secure stability and calm cooperation of all Slovak citizens  regardless of their nationality and the color of their skin,"  the document says.</p>

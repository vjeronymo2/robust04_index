			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / US Money and Credit: President gets easy ride in first week THE bond market has given the new president an easy ride, bidding down the yield on the long bond to below 7.3 per cent in the week of his inauguration. Apart from the obvious point that investors cannot react to President Clinton's economic policy until he comes up with one, the main reason why the markets have treated him so gently is that they have been preoccupied with other matters - chiefly, the size and structure of the next quarterly refunding round. Explaining the background to the refunding question is relatively simple. The new Democratic administration is considering whether it should reduce the size of future long bond auctions and increase the issuance of shorter-dated maturities proportionally, in order to cut the cost of funding the federal deficit. Saving money on paying for the deficit is crucial to any attempt to cut the size of the shortfall in the federal budget. Interest servicing costs in the last fiscal year exceeded Dollars 200bn, more than two-thirds of the deficit. Analysts estimate that by switching from longer to shorter-dated maturities, the government could save several billion dollars a year on debt payments. A lot is at stake, and the fact that the new occupants of the Treasury are seriously considering changing the borrowing mix has obsessed the bond market. If dealers and investors can guess correctly about the outcome of the deliberations, then they can either make, or more pertinently, avoid losing, a considerable amount of money. The short sellers, in particular, are keeping a close eye on the situation - none want to be caught with sizeable short positions if the Treasury announces plans to reduce long bond auctions. Such a move would inevitably push prices sharply higher as the market moved to discount the news, leaving short sellers badly squeezed. Above all, the refunding question has made the market nervous, leading to greater than normal volatility. Last week, for example, a rumour that the new Treasury secretary, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, was about to call a press conference to deny there would be any reductions in long bond issuance left longer-dated securities noticeably weaker. However, within a few hours, prices had recovered strongly after Ms Laura Tyson, an economic adviser to the Clinton administration, said the structure of the borrowing mix was a subject under review. If the government does choose to alter the shape of its financing, it will not come without a cost. Economists warn that issuing more shorter-dated paper will push up yields at short end of the market, which means the Treasury only saves money if the increase in short-term rates is smaller than the decline in long-term rates caused by the initial shift away from the long end. Moreover, shortening the maturity of the federal debt assumes the relationship between short and long rates will remain the same for some time. This is a dangerous assumption. If the yield curve were to flatten dramatically, with short-term rates rising sharply, the government could end up worse off than before. Also, any narrowing of the spread between long and short rates would hurt bank profits, which could squeeze the supply of credit to the economy. The Treasury is not due to announce details of the next quarterly refunding round until February 3, so the market has another week or so to stew over the matter. While opinion on Wall Street is divided over whether the authorities will cut the size of the long bond auctions, those analysts who expect a shift in the borrowing mix believe the change will probably not be introduced until the second refunding programme, due in May.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'DANGEROUS' APPEARANCE BY BILL HICKS;  </P> <P> COMEDY: THE FORMER MEMBER OF THE TEXAS OUTLAW COMICS IS SLATED TO PERFORM AT  THE IRVINE IMPROV ON MONDAY.  </P> <P> Comedian Bill Hicks performed his first stand-up comedy routine at a Baptist  Bible camp talent show when he was 13, borrowing freely from Woody Allen's  self-deprecating, nebbish routine. You know -- jokes like being breast-fed from  falsies.  </P> <P> But now Bill Hicks is "dangerous."  </P> <P> That's how the alumnus of the so-called Texas Outlaw Comics is being billed  these days. It also, not coincidentally, is the title of his debut comedy album  released last spring.  </P> <P> And just how "dangerous" is Hicks, who will perform at the Improv in Irvine  Monday night? Here's Hicks, roaming the stage, smoking cigarettes and liberally  seasoning his observations with obscenities, on:  </P> <P> * His drinking days: "I'd get pulled over by the cops and I'd be so drunk I'd  be dancing to their lights, thinking I'd made it to another club: 'Turn the  music up! Hey, what is this, a leather bar?' "  </P> <P> * Small Southern towns: "You know in many parts of our troubled world people  are yelling, 'Revolution! Revolution!' In Tennessee, they're yelling,  'Evolution! We want our thumbs!' The thing is they see people with thumbs on TV  all day. That's gotta drive them hog wild."  </P> <P> * Nonsmokers: "A bunch of whining little maggots. Aren't they? Obnoxious,  self-righteous slugs. I'd quit smoking if I didn't think I'd become one of  them."  </P> <P> * Drugs: 'Drugs are so bad.' 'Drugs are so bad.' Yeah, yeah. Well how come  Keith Richards still walks? Explain that Mr. Surgeon General! You never hear  the Surgeon General mention Keith, do ya? Aha! A little hole in the theory  there."  </P> <P> As Hicks sees his "dangerous" appellation, it all has to do with "freedom."  </P> <P> "The origin of that title came from a Thomas Jefferson quote," Hicks explained  in a phone interview. "His quote was 'No idea is dangerous to society wherein  that idea can be openly discussed.' That's why the album is called 'Dangerous,'  because I'm discussing drugs and things drugs do."  </P> <P> A former drug user himself, Hicks maintains he is not promoting drugs.  </P> <P> "I'm saying I did have some good times on drugs, so don't say they're all bad  like they do on the commercial. . . . Alcohol is the No. 1 offender and there  are alcohol ads on TV right after the (anti-drug) drug commercial. Tell me  about mixed messages. That's my point. Get off my back."  </P> <P> Hicks added that the "dangerous" label also applies "to fascists and  fundamentalists and puritanicals" who undoubtedly "would view my act as  dangerous."  </P> <P> Described by one critic as "a firebrand who seems on the verge of  self-immolation as he uses his incendiary wit to torch American hypocrisy,"  Hicks obviously has found his comedy niche.  </P> <P> The New York-based comedian was in Chicago last week to tape his first  television comedy special. He expects the show, which will air on HBO in 1991,  to give him a big career boost.  </P> <P> "It's real good for me because, first off, you'll get to see the real me on  stage, without the network restrictions," said Hicks, who has appeared several  times on "Late Night With David Letterman," where he has had to tone down his  act.  </P> <P> The Bill Hicks that network television audiences have seen is not the same Bill  Hicks comedy club audiences see. "It's like you see Richard Pryor on Carson,"  he said. "Is that the real Richard Pryor? Well, to a degree."  </P> <P> Hicks, who sneaked out of the house to hang out at a comedy club when he was in  high school, moved to Los Angeles to become a comedian in 1980 when he was 18.  He began developing his own comedy voice on stage at the Comedy Store.  </P> <P> "I was loosening up a lot and trying to be natural and organic," he recalled.  "I'd talk about anything I felt like. I tried to keep it very personal, which I  still do."  </P> <P> Hicks moved back to Texas in 1982, where he joined a group of like-minded  comedians who performed at the Comedy Workshop, a Houston comedy club that  earlier spawned Sam Kinison.  </P> <P> "We formed a group called the Outlaw Comics and did theme shows like 'Outlaw  Comics Get Religion,' 'Outlaw Comics Get Political,' " he said.  </P> <P> "We really had a love of comedy and we strove to be original. That was the  hallmark -- not gigs, not how much we were getting paid. We had no respect for  hack sellouts."  </P> <P> Hicks, who has been compared to Lenny Bruce, said he thinks "highly" of the  legendary free-speaking comic.  </P> <P> "What I like about him is his spirit of honesty," he said. "He was totally  honest about what he was feeling and going through. That's what I endeavor to  do: to be honest and real.  </P> <P> "I don't care if you're obscene, filthy, horrendous -- as long as you're  honest."  </P> <P> Hicks maintains that he doesn't do anything in his act just for shock value. As  for the use of four-letter words, he said: "It's the way I talk. I don't think  any of the material relies on them. . . . (Profanity) is not the punch line.  </P> <P> "The whole thing," he said, "is I want to open everybody's mind up to how to  look at the world. That's all: to show that there are other ways to see things  and here are a few of them."  </P> <P> Indeed.  </P> <P> "Keith Richards outlived Jim Fixx, the runner and health-nut dude. . . . The  plot thickens. . . . Keith Richards is shooting heroin into his eyeballs and  still touring, all right? I'm getting mixed signals. I picture nuclear war and  two things surviving: Keith and bugs."  </P> <P>  Bill Hicks will appear at 8:30 p.m. Monday at the Improv, 4255 Campus Drive,  Irvine. Tickets: $8. Information: (714) 854-5455.  </P> <P> </P></p>

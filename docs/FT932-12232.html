			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Technology: Sneezes in season - There is a low count for hay fever remedies, writes Paul Abrahams in a series on drug discoveries SEX causes hay fever. It is the amorous activities of plants that represent the primary culprit for hay fever sufferers' seasonal snuffles and sneezes. And the peak period in the northern hemisphere is fast approaching. Hay fever, known medically as allergic rhinitis, affects anywhere between 10 per cent and 25 per cent of people. And its incidence seems to be growing. In Switzerland, the proportion of the urban population suffering rose from 1 per cent in 1926 to 5 per cent in 1958 and 10 per cent in 1986. In Sweden and the UK the number of cases doubled between the early 1970s and the early 1980s. And in Japan the malady was almost unknown before the 1950s but now affects about 10 per cent of the population. Admittedly, some of the increase is probably due to the public's greater awareness of allergies, as well as more accurate diagnosis and a growing tendency for people to consult doctors. However, epidemiologists are convinced there has been a real rise in hay fever incidence. The world market for allergy treatment and prevention was worth about Dollars 6.6bn (Pounds 4.3bn) last year and is set to rise to Dollars 10.8bn by 1997, according to Market Intelligence Research Corporation, the market research group. These figures, also covering asthma which MIRC defines as an allergy, include antihistamines and combinations of antihistamines, decongestants, nasal corticosteroids, topical corticosteroids and ophthalmic anti-allergy agents. None of the existing treatments helps all patients, however. Given the millions of hay fever and perennial rhinitis sufferers, there is surprisingly little research in the area. The symptoms range from a few sneezes on a summer afternoon to persistent nasal blockage, loss of smell, headaches, running eyes and throat irritation. The illness can even trigger asthma attacks. Hay fever is caused by pollen entering the nose. Given the tiny size of pollen grains - less than a thousandth of a millimetre in diameter - the havoc they cause is surprising. Pollen grains are an integral part of plants' sex lives. Normally, when a grain lands on a plant's stigma, or female receptacle, it absorbs water, cracking a fatty layer on the outside of the grain and allowing its proteins to escape. Enzymes aimed at helping the proteins penetrate and fertilise the stigma are also released simultaneously. Unfortunately, pollen is not particularly intelligent. Unable to distinguish a human nose from a stigma, it releases its chemicals in the nostrils. The chemicals released are harmless and in most people have no effect. However, hay fever sufferers do not have a mechanism for identifying them as benign. Just as asthmatics have hyper-reactive airways, so hay fever sufferers have hyper-reactive noses. Their immune system views their arrival as aggressive behaviour and overreacts to the harmless pollen. In hay fever sufferers, antibodies called Immunoglobulin E, or IgE, lock on to the pollen. The IgE triggers a reaction in cells called mast cells which then release mediators. These powerful chemicals, which include histamines, leukotrienes and bradykinins, are designed to help the body resist infection. They do this in three ways: First, they increase the size of even the smallest vessels so that immune cells can pass in and out more easily, to attack the infection. This creates the inflammation associated with allergies. Second, they act as distress signals, calling in more immune cells to the scene of infection. Finally, they trigger the creation of mucus in neighbouring cells. The mucus is used to pick up dust and microbes, sweeping them out of the nasal passages and down the throat. The additional production of mucus is the cause of hay fever sufferers' streaming noses. The sufferers' problems are compounded because their bodies also react to the pollen invasion by producing more mast cells. This means that the following day when the body comes across additional pollen there are even more mast cells to create a reaction. For this reason, symptoms can deteriorate as the pollen season continues. At least most hay fever sufferers only experience running, itchy and blocked noses during peak pollen periods. A few suffer from perennial rhinitis, normally induced by dust-mites. This tiny creature looks like a speck of dust and is only 0.5mm in size. A badly infected mattress can contain up to 40,000 per gram of dust. Their effect in sufferers' noses is similar to that of pollen. The most commonly-used treatments for hay fever are antihistamines. These chemicals block the receptor with which histamine would normally interact and so prevent the blood vessels being dilated. First-generation antihistamines had a tendency to cross the blood-brain barrier and cause drowsiness. The most recent generation, called H1 receptor antagonists, is much more specific in their action and are non-sedating. They include Seldane, manufactured by Marion Merrell Dow of the US, Hismanal, produced by Janssen, Johnson &amp; Johnson's pharmaceuticals wing, and Tavist by Sandoz of Switzerland. Reactine, Pfizer's medicine, was given a safety and efficacy endorsement by a sub-committee of the US Food and Drug Administration only this week. Claritin, Schering-Plough's treatment which was licensed in the US this month, should win between 20 and 30 per cent of the American market, according to Robert Luciano, chairman and chief executive. 'Claritin will do exceedingly well. We already have that share in Europe, and I think we will exceed it in the US,' he says. Shearson Lehman Brothers estimate non-sedating antihistamines have worldwide sales of about Dollars 1.4bn a year. However, both Seldane and Hismanal have been associated with potentially serious cardiac complications when taken in overdose. Seldane can also be dangerous when used with ketoconazole, an anti-fungal, and erythromycin, a commonly prescribed antibiotic. Other treatments include steroids such as Glaxo's Beconase which inhibits the release of mediators. Fisons' Rynacrom, which contains sodium cromoglycate, has a similar effect. Despite the low level of hay fever research, scientists continue to look for new drugs to block the action of the mediators that trigger the inflammation. Hoechst is looking at bradykinin-antagonists, while Zeneca, Imperial Chemical Industries' bioscience subsidiary, and Upjohn of the US are looking at leukotriene-antagonists. Meanwhile, Ciba is working with a small US biotechnology company, Tanox, on an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody that would block the action of IgE. Max Wilhelm at Ciba explains: 'IgE is an important element in triggering the release of histamines and other chemicals that cause hay fever and asthma. In theory, if we block the action of IgE, then you should prevent the body over-reacting to allergen. This is an exciting area, but don't hold your breath waiting for it - it's some way off.' Other areas of research include antagonists against platelet-activating factor, more commonly known as Paf. This substance is a naturally occurring product of endotheliel cells, neutrophils and other body cells, which are produced in response to inflammations. The theory is that if you can block its manufacture, it should reduce the symptoms of the disease. But analysts Shearson Lehman Brothers do not expect leukotriene-antagonists or PAF-antagonists to reach the market until the mid-to-late 1990s. No single therapy is likely to prove effective for all hay fever sufferers, but together they should eventually provide a wider armoury with which to tackle the illness. As plants begin another breeding system, new treatments cannot come a summer too soon for sufferers awaiting another sneezing season.

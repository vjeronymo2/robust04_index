			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Nissan fears over football club plan NISSAN, the car manufacturer, yesterday said it was concerned that Sunderland Football Club's plans for a new 48,000-seat stadium, shopping and leisure complex on land next to its car plant could create traffic congestion which would affect its strictly scheduled just-in-time component deliveries. The club's proposed Pounds 120m complex on green-belt land beside Nissan's 750-acre Sunderland site includes parking for nearly 20,000 cars.</p>

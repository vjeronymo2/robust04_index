			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Apec Meets in Seattle: Christopher puts stress on human rights - US secretary of state ties economic relations with Pacific nations to questions of democracy AS ITS name implies, Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation was established to discuss economic and trade issues. But from the moment that Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, kicked off the 15-member grouping's annual ministerial meeting in Seattle on Wednesday, the impossibility of isolating trans-Pacific economic relations from political issues was clear. So, by implication, was the limited scope for true regional co-operation. Mr Christopher chose to make a tough statement of US policy on Asia, firmly tying economic progress to human rights and democracy. 'Just as security is the bedrock for the pursuit of prosperity, so democracy is the foundation for security,' he said. 'Democratic nations make better neighbours and better trading partners.' The US approach is at odds with the views of almost all other Apec members, who resent its insistence on democracy and human rights as an intrusion into the affairs of Asian countries. The secretary of state, who is hosting the ministerial meeting which ends today, made clear that the US saw its economic future as a Pacific nation and that it was committed to retaining a strong military presence in order to deter aggression between Asian countries. But he also said that 'great areas of Asia' were lagging behind in introducing democracy. 'The yearnings for freedom are not a western export,' he said. 'They are a human instinct. All across Asia, the US is working to respond to those yearnings.' Mr Christopher said human rights were a key issue in relations with two Apec members - Indonesia and China - and issued the most explicit statement yet that China's most-favoured nation (MFN) trading status would not be renewed next year unless there was 'overall significant progress' on human rights. It is only to be expected that linkage of MFN to human rights is vehemently rejected by China. But tying trade issues to politics is also opposed by many other Asian countries - most vocally Malaysia, whose prime minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, is boycotting the Seattle meeting. Asian countries tend to fall in with China's view that economic development is the top priority and personal freedom secondary. At the least, they believe that human rights should not be linked to trade. Mr Rizalino Navarro, the Philippines trade minister, said: 'We're as concerned about human rights, but in the case of a number of countries, the lower level of per capita income does not provide the majority of people with decent food, clothing and shelter. That's the first priority.' Mr Navarro saw the different concepts of human rights as a cultural difference across the Pacific which, together with differing degrees of economic development, meant that Apec should proceed only slowly towards becoming a closer community. Mr T H Chau, trade and industry secretary of Hong Kong - which would be severely affected if the US revoked China's MFN status - said: 'We believe that trade issues should not be politicised and that MFN is the wrong tool for pursuing other aims that the US has.' Bodies such as the United Nations existed to deal with political issues. Australia also indicated that it came close to espousing the Asian view. Mr Peter Cook, trade minister, said his country did not shirk the issues of human rights and democracy, but took a broader view of what constituted human rights. He said that while the population of Asia had grown by two-thirds over the past 20 years, the number of people living in abject poverty had halved. 'In human rights terms, that means more people have clothes on their backs, food on their tables and shelter,' Mr Cook said. Concerns about the US approach are likely to mean that most Asian countries will favour keeping Apec as a looser, informal grouping for the foreseeable future. The visionary report of an eminent persons group, which calls on Apec ministers to decide now that that they will agree in 1996 on a timetable for achievement of an Apec free trade area, is expected to be largely shelved.</p>

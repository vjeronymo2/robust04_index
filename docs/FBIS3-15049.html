Questions Put to  Press Secretary and His Replies"]    [Text] [Kuchkina] What does the press secretary's job  entail: dispelling rumors, telling the truth as it is, shaping  the president's image, or to some extent adjusting policy?    [Kostikov] This job is relatively new in our political  setup, and there are no hard-and-fast rules. When I had my  first conversation with B.N. [Yeltsin] he set me no tasks,  evidently based on my sound reputation as a democratic  journalist. So the press service and the press secretary have  been shaped by me myself depending on my level of political  culture and, of course, society's level of political development.    [Kuchkina] What is the mechanism for your statements? At  the president's request? Your own initiative, when you have  picked something out? Do you make a statement autonomously or  do you agree everything with the president?    [Kostikov] It depends on the specific case. If what is  needed is an official reaction on a complex question with  political or economic consequences, everything is agreed.    [Kuchkina] Even including the wording?    [Kostikov] As a rule the president sets the political tone.  He says two or three key phrases which provide the opportunity  to formulate something in the context of the situation that has  arisen. There are various forms depending on the weight we want  to impart to the statement. For instance, sometimes I say: I  am authorized to state -- then it is clearly coming from the  president. Whether [a statement is made] on the president's or  the press secretary's initiative, it is always with the  president's consent. But the press secretary has no pretensions  to pass everything off as the president's opinion.    [Kuchkina] What if B.N. reacts to something by saying: Why  did you do that?    [Kostikov] That has not happened. I may be mistaken as to a  particular detail, but the president is too broad-minded a man  and too big a statesman to react to minor mistakes.    [Kuchkina] I had thought about your job and wanted to ask  certain questions when I saw and heard on television something  the whole country saw and heard, once and then a second time,  namely that on Saturdays Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy  apparently goes to the bathhouse with the president and plays  checkers with him, and that he is generally pleased that  everything is proceeding correctly; Gaydar and Fedorov have  already departed and Kozyrev and Chubays are next in line; that  is, it is as if he gives the orders and the president executes  them obediently, which amounts to a public backslapping of the  president. It is apparently the press secretary's job to give  society some explanation regarding this, and I waited for you to  do so. You kept silent. Why? Is it an oversight or did you  have nothing to object to since the foregoing is the truth?    [Kostikov] I will explain why I did not react. Naturally it  is utter nonsense: Zhirinovskiy has not once met with the  president tete-a-tete, he was invited to the Kremlin only once  for a meeting with B.N. as one of a number of faction leaders on  the threshold of the elections and referendum.    [Kuchkina] That is, no personal meetings?    [Kostikov] None. The president did not go to the bathhouse  with him, did not walk along snowy paths, did not drink cognac,  and did not sit down at the same table. It is typical loudmouth  mendacity on Zhirinovskiy's part. Which, incidentally, is not  characteristic of him alone. It is a level of nonsense to which  the press secretary should not react.    [Kuchkina] I cannot agree with you. What is obvious to you  is completely unobvious to the mass of people who, having  swallowed some piece of information, draw their own conclusions.  Not about Zhirinovskiy as a loudmouth liar who takes people in  but who does not have a hand laid on him, but about a turnaround  by Yeltsin and about a possible secret pact with Zhirinovskiy,  about which certain politicians and newspapermen both here and  in the West are readily spreading rumors. I think these things  do great harm to the president and his policies. A mass attack  is in progress. Several times I have been sent local  newspapers, most of which are in the hands of the democrats'  opponents, let us call them that, and they print the most brazen  lies, the most blatant antidemocratic, antipresidential  propaganda, and in the provinces people simply read the local  press and believe it. Especially when the voice of denial does  not reach them from here. Up to now television has been a kind  of government channel and if Zhirinovskiy says something on it,  that means it is true. The democrats' arrogance has already  played its fateful role. Why repeat the same mistakes? Why not  issue a press release one day saying that this, this, and this  are lies? In any form, even a witty one. In my view one simply  has to "lower oneself." Not to political intrigues but to  people who are interested to know whether the Liberal Democratic  Party leader is in fact so powerful.    [Kostikov] I think the press has fallen down on the job  here. If a journalist, an agency, or a newspaper had called me  the next day and asked, I would have responded. I dream of  giving weekly briefings for journalists. The organizational  difficulty is that to hold them without a preliminary  conversation between the press secretary and the president would  be of no interest to journalists, and B.N. has a very hectic  schedule. But I had a conversation with B.N. on this subject  and he agreed that before every briefing we would have a quiet  half-hour together. I hope that he has now recovered, God grant  him health....    [Kuchkina] Let us talk about health. The well-known story  of the telephone conversation that never took place, when one  president could not find the other, or the other could not wait  long by the telephone -- here you expressed yourself in the same  way as you did regarding items in the press associated with the  subject of health. True, rather mutedly. I rarely frequent  "society," but every time I do I hear "totally accurate"  information "received from competent sources" that the president  has a tumor in this or that place, that he is not long for this  world, that soon everything will be over. I live near the White  House: In September-October these rumors were being  persistently spread among the crowd there. They have now spread  to official offices, to ceremonial launches, and everyone  declares that he knows all about this. I would like to hear  information from you because I know how disinformation is  circulated, including that with a political aim.    [Kostikov] You have partly answered the question yourself.  As regards the telephone: When communications are set up, and  that means interpreters and technical services enter the  conversation -- both presidents have to be near the telephone.  Our president was at the telephone twice. He waited a decent  time but Clinton was either not in the vicinity or was late.  Indeed, when Clinton was here we saw that he was tardy for  every event.    [Kuchkina] Did Yavlinskiy not tell journalists that Clinton  could not get through to Yeltsin but his American acquaintance  got through to him at night, saying: Grisha, if you have the  only telephone in Russia on which it is possible to converse,  why do you and not the president have it?    [Kostikov] Well, that is halfway to being a joke among  friends. As regards ill health. The press and society are  entitled to monitor the president's health and demand reports on  it, but only when this is done normally and with good  intentions, whereas when political speculation begins.... That  is why I said God grant him health. When you work long enough  in a particular team a element of family feeling arises. I say  this as I used to say God grant health to Vasiliy Semenovich, my  father, when he was alive. Or like I say this to my mother. It  is natural human warmth. But on the other hand, you realize  that the president's health is national capital, especially in  our case, when the level of political stability in the country  depends directly on Yeltsin. Therefore we all suffer when B.N.  becomes run-down or catches a cold, like now, or, like six  months ago, when his radiculitis became exacerbated. As regards  speculation, I have noticed that this wave usually begins  abroad, and in a few days safely completes the migration to our  press. There is nothing accidental here, the president is a  major political figure who stands in many people's way. Just  watch which newspapers this appears in -- the attentive reader  or analyst will see everything clearly.    [Kuchkina] That just applies to an analyst. While I, I  repeat, am talking about society, which does not consist wholly  of analysts, and this massive barrage of rumors is doing its  destructive work.    [Kostikov] My position is that it is still necessary to take  account of people's psychology. For 70 years it has not been  the done thing in this country to talk about the health of  supreme great leaders [vozhd] and other leaders [lider]. Just  like before those 70 years. In churches prayers were said every  day for the health of the sovereign emperor, but that is as far  as it went. In the people's opinion the leader is somewhere  high up there and there are things about which it is not done to  speak. Unlike the West, where a leader's every step and every  gesture is on view, and the leaders themselves encourage this.  B.N.'s health is entirely normal for a man of his age. His  mother died recently at a ripe old age, all his relatives have  lived a very long time, and he comes from very vigorous genetic  stock.    [Kuchkina] So everything I mentioned is lies?    [Kostikov] Even dishonorable lies.    [Kuchkina] What about the rumor that he is completely  incapable of working, not up to the job, insane?...    [Kostikov] The situation is completely the reverse. The  president is doing a great deal of work. He is a workaholic.  He virtually works a 24-hour day.    [Kuchkina] I think you are incorrect in saying that in the  people's opinion a leader is somewhere high up and remote. We  have managed to get used to Yeltsin as a democratic leader, as  one of us, which is why the people followed him as a person who  is close to them. But lately he has somehow kept aloof at  inaccessible heights, he has shut himself away. It is the  accepted thing to gossip about his aloofness at crucial and  noncrucial moments. This particularly applies to the night of 3  October -- why he did not address television viewers? In this  case I personally know why. Because at that time he was tackling  a task of immense importance and he had to solve it before  appearing on the screen and addressing the people. But why is  he absent now? Notwithstanding the fact that he is terribly  busy he must return to contacts with society in one form or  another.    [Kostikov] I quite agree with you, and the letters we are  receiving contain the refrain: Return our president of old to  us, we want to see him on a truck with a megaphone, in a crowd,  among us....    [Kuchkina] No, I do not buy that, I subscribe to a  completely different view. A change of tasks has occurred.    [Kostikov] Yes. Previously it was necessary to win power in  order to protect democracy, power is now in his hands. An  enormous country and an enormous burden of power.    [Kuchkina] I am not talking about going on walkabouts among  the people or about video clips. I am talking about necessary  appearances and the manifestation of his presidential will now,  when the social situation is so complex.    [Kostikov] The situation is in fact alarming. The state of  the Federal Assembly, especially the State Duma, causes the  greatest concern. There were hopes that the Duma would be  different, more professional, and wiser, but we can see that  leaders of factions are not at all concerned that Russia needs  judicial reform, laws which would indicate the parameters of a  market economy. So much time has passed but the Duma has still  not gotten down to its legislative work. Many leaders went  there to make political capital, to flex their political biceps.    [Kuchkina] You are emphasizing the Duma at a time when a  considerable amount of criticism has been concentrated on the  government, and it can be seen that changing its course involves  danger, as does changing the president's course. But I want to  draw your attention to Kronid Lyubarskiy's sensational NOVOYE  VREMYA article entitled "Falsification." Apart from describing  cases of blatant substitution [?of ballot rigging] [podstanovka]  and sharp practice, the author resorts to scientific  mathematical models and shows that if there is a constant  electorate in cities of 70 percent for reforms, 20 percent  against, and 10 percent neither for nor against, that is,  Zhirinovskiy's former electorate, and scientifically speaking it  is impossible to have such a change of correlations as occurred  12 December. The falsifiers were convinced that a thief is not  a thief unless he is caught in the act. But mathematics is a  crafty thing, it reveals deceit even in places where it has  apparently been well concealed. In this context the author  talks of the "poorly heard voice of the majority," in adapting  to which the president and government have started adjusting  their policy, and that is their dramatic mistake.    [Kostikov] First, summaries of, so to speak, states of  mind, sentiments, and expectations are regularly put on the  president's desk. He is aware of all this. Second, I do not  know of a single step by the president which would attest to a  change in his democratic orientation. If you listen to his  Message to the Federal Assembly, all guidelines for democratic  reforms are clearly stipulated there. There is no retreat.    [Kuchkina] What about the departure of Gaydar and Fedorov?    [Kostikov] It was they who departed. The president did not  instigate their departure in any way. On the contrary, as far  as I know he devoted a great deal of effort to get Gaydar,  Pamfilova, and Fedorov to stay.    [Kuchkina] People say that the president is powerless in  relation to the premier?    [Kostikov] There is no powerlessness of any kind. The  president and the premier each have their own set of powers.  B.N. does not want to violate this setup and interfere in all  the actions of another plenipotentiary figure. At the end of  the day economic policy is entrusted to the premier. The  president determines the broad course. But the government  implements it. The president can dismiss the entire government,  but first it must have a chance to carry out the president's  wishes, implementing them by the methods which it thinks best.  I personally think that Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin himself  does not realize the full extent of the seriousness of the  aspirations of those who are acting behind his back.    [Kuchkina] What about his consultations with Starodubtsev?    [Kostikov] You know, I would very much like B.N. to ask the  premier this question in a personal conversation. Does  Starodubtsev have such a wealth of experience in forming the  agricultural economy's structures that in the reform process  they will ultimately be able to start feeding Russia? In this  sense has the experience of the State Committee for the State of  Emergency been devalued? Generally the president and premier  have good personal contacts. In addition, while highly  appraising Gaydar's acts on the night of 3-4 October, when he  went out into the square in front of Moscow City Soviet, I  cannot fail to give due credit to Chernomyrdin's chivalrous --  in the full sense of the word -- conduct on the same and the  preceding days, when he adopted a pro-presidential position  without hesitation and did not deviate from it.    [Kuchkina] That is correct. But what can you say about  Chernomyrdin's defense of Gerashchenko? The democratic press  has been full of criticism of Gerashchenko's autonomous policy  associated with the "illegal cash office," whereby prior to the  October days "under-the-counter" trillions disappeared goodness  knows where, that is, it is known where -- on support for the  Supreme Soviet; with monetary reform in the summer; and with the  unification of finances with Belarus, for which Russians will  pay dearly, and a clear position on the restoration of the  Soviet empire can be discerned behind everything.    [Kostikov] Oh, how I would love to obtain answers to all  these questions! But allow me to confine myself to saying that.    [Kuchkina] Which of the president's reactions do you recall  as being the strongest?    [Kostikov] Like every Russian man he is very emotional  inside and restrained outwardly. Maybe one moment has remained  the most striking for me. When his mother died. For the first  and only time I saw him weep. And again when people were  preparing to impeach him and he went out onto the congress  platform without preparation and delivered himself of a very  powerful emotional performance.    [Kuchkina] Do you happen to know why the president said in a  conversation with Ryazanov that he never thinks about death? Is  he not afraid of dying?    [Kostikov] I think...because he has already done something  for Russia. Who is afraid of dying? He who has done nothing,  accomplished nothing, and not fulfilled himself. B.N. is doing  something to which he devotes his whole self as a moral person.</p>

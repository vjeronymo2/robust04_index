			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (g) Once a certificate has been suspended for a failed engine, as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the manufacturer must take the following actions before the certificate is reinstated for that failed engine:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Remedy the nonconformity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Demonstrate that the engine conforms to applicable standards or family emission levels by retesting the engine in accordance with these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Submit a written report to the Administrator, after successful completion of testing on the failed engine, which contains a description of the remedy and test results for each engine in addition to other information that may be required by this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Once a certificate for a failed family has been suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the manufacturer must take the following actions before the Administrator will consider reinstating the certificate:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Submit a written report to the Administrator which identifies the reason for the noncompliance of the engines, describes the proposed remedy, including a description of any proposed quality control and/or quality assurance measures to be taken by the manufacturer to prevent future occurrences of the problem, and states the date on which the remedies will be implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Demonstrate that the engine family for which the certificate of conformity has been suspended does in fact comply with these regulations by testing engines selected from normal production runs of that engine family, at the plant(s), port facility(ies) or associated storage facility(ies) specified by the Administrator, in accordance with the conditions specified in the initial test order. If the manufacturer elects to continue testing individual engines after suspension of a certificate, the certificate is reinstated for an engine actually determined to be in conformance with the applicable standards or family emission levels through testing in accordance with the applicable test procedures, provided that the Administrator has not revoked the certificate pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Once the certificate for a family has been revoked under paragraph (f) of this section and the manufacturer desires to continue introduction into commerce of a modified version of that family, the following actions must be taken before the Administrator may consider issuing a certificate for that modified family:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) If the Administrator determines that the proposed change(s) in engine design may have an effect on emission performance deterioration, the Administrator will notify the manufacturer, within five working days after receipt of the report in paragraph (g) of this section, whether subsequent testing under this subpart is sufficient to evaluate the proposed change or changes or whether additional testing is required; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) After implementing the change or changes intended to remedy the nonconformity, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the modified engine family does in fact conform with these regulations by testing engines selected from normal production runs of that modified engine family in accordance with the conditions specified in the initial test order. If the subsequent audit results in passing of the audit, the Administrator will reissue the certificate or issue a new certificate, as the case may be, to include that family, provided that the manufacturer has satisfied the testing requirements of paragraph (i)(1) of this section. If the subsequent audit is failed, the revocation remains in effect. Any design change approvals under this subpart are limited to the family affected by the test order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) At any time subsequent to an initial suspension of a certificate of conformity for a test engine pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, but not later than 15 days (or such other period as may be allowed by the Administrator) after notification of the Administrator's decision to suspend or revoke a certificate of conformity in whole or in part pursuant to paragraph (b), (c), or (f) of this section, a manufacturer may request a hearing as to whether the tests have been properly conducted or any sampling methods have been properly applied.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

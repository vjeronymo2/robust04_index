			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Radio Today" program -- monitored in progress] </F>   [Text] ...14th of April the deputy prime minister, Mr.  Baholo, was murdered by soldiers in the Makoanyane Barracks  outside Maseru and four cabinet ministers taken hostage. The  circumstances of Mr. Baholo's death are still unclear, although  we know that his body was riddled with bullets. His funeral  will take place on Saturday 23 April in Leribe and Friday has  been declared a day of mourning, with schools and buildings  closing.    There is a strong military presence in the town, but apart  from sporadic gunshots, everything is quiet at the moment,  although Friday's public holiday reflects the government's  concern about possible unrest. Prime Minister Mr. Mokhehle has  not given any statement as yet on the abrupt departure of half  his cabinet, but we believe that the ministers of information,  natural resources, and trade have fled to Botswana, and the  ministers for education and justice to South Africa. Whether  the government of Lesotho will be able to overcome the present  difficulties remains to be seen. This is Sara Hilderbrand for  Radio Today in Maseru.</p>

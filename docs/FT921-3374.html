			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Budget and You): Rules on product selling - Securities and Investment Board NOBODY could accuse the Securities and Investments Board of over-elaborate stage management. It announced measures which will profoundly alter the selling of investments this week. When did it do this? At 11 am on Wednesday, just as John Major was paying his visit to the Queen. So it is not surprising that the package of measures for disclosure unveiled by Sir David Walker, chairman of the SIB, have not received much attention. This is a shame, as they radically alter the information available to you when you buy an insurance product. Now, you will have just about enough information to calculate a guesstimate of the true cost of the policy you are buying, and to make clear the penalties for early surrender. You will not, however, be given as much information as the SIB intended when it published its discussion paper in October, which means that investors must still pore closely over the small print before reaching any decisions. The system of 'polarisation' has been maintained, as have the requirements on 'best advice'. So any intermediary must either be required to pick the best product from all the companies in the market, or only offer the products of one company. The measures on disclosure are more complicated: Surrender Values SIB has stuck by its guns and requires companies to state the value you would receive for a policy if you surrendered it after one, two, three, four, and five years. The total value of premiums paid in at each of these points must be stated, so you can see whether you would manage to receive your money back. If after year five you would still not receive as much as you had invested, SIB requires the company to print the 'crossover' year (which can be as late as year 12 for a 25-year endowment policy) when the surrender value is higher than the premiums paid in. Also, companies must print surrender value ratios in the With Profits Guide. They do not have to show this to you, but you have the right to request it. Do so. The information could be invaluable. For example, if you were buying a 25-year policy, this would tell you how great a share of the final maturity value you would receive after 24 years. If this figure is as low as 40 per cent you should probably steer clear. Effect of Charges The 'Reduction In Yield' figure, showing by how many percentage points total life office expenses would reduce a notional yield of 7 per cent for endowments and 8.5 per cent for pensions, will now appear in a form which non-actuaries might understand. At present RIY produces an apparently piffling figure - for example '1.0 per cent' means that charges would cut the yield on your endowment from 7 per cent to 6 per cent. The SIB will now ensure that this is stated in terms of the number of pence in the pound which would be knocked off your policy proceeds. So an innocuous RIY of 1.0 per cent now becomes a rather more alarming 14p in the Pounds 1. The total spread for 25-year endowments is from 6p to 40p. Hopefully offices near the top of this scale will soon either get their charges in order, or cease trading. Charges in illustrations This is the climbdown. Offices need to reveal their own reduction in proceeds, but in published illustrations and projections they are required to assume that their RIP is the industry average - even if their costs are much worse. Projections must use a common assumption for investment yield, and the SIB's reason for disallowing company-specific costs is that companies would then object to not being allowed to quote company-specific investment return, which could be misleading. With a company-specific RIP you can derive your own projection. Warnings These have been toned down. At one point, the key information was to include the words 'Warning]' in relation to the penalties for early surrender. This was thought too pejorative, so it will now read 'BE CAREFUL]' Status Disclosure The phrase 'appointed agent' to describe non-independent advisers was misunderstood. Tied agents must now call themselves 'company representatives'. Political risk could yet rear its ugly head. The industry has until April 30 to make comments on the proposals, which must then be passed by the Office of Fair Trading, and by the Department of Trade and Industry, which might by then be controlled by Labour.</p>

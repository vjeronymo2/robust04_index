			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Baxi down 25% to Pounds 6.87m Baxi Partnership, which makes domestic heating boilers and claims to be the UK's largest employee-owned manufacturer, made profits of Pounds 6.87m before tax and profit-sharing in the year ended April 2, down 25 per cent on last year's Pounds 9.16m, writes Ian Hamilton Fazey. Turnover was 8 per cent higher at Pounds 77m, primarily because of a six months' contribution from recently-acquired HS Group. The profit fall was caused by intense competition in the UK heating market and development costs in aluminium castings. The poorer performance means employee shareholders will get an 18 per cent (20 per cent) share of profits, or Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 1.87m).</p>

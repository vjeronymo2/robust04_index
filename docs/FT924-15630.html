			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / USAir hits at BA deal critics USAir, the US airline in which British Airways wants to invest Dollars 750m for a large minority stake, has hit back at opposition from other big US carriers to the proposed alliance, saying the deal is both legal and competition-enhancing. 'Our proposal is pure-and-simple a business transaction,' said Mr Seth Schofield, USAir's chief executive, in response to a press conference held by the 'big three' US carriers on Thursday, publicising their objections to the BA-USAir tie-up. 'It meets every requirement and stipulation of US law and should be judged on those merits alone.' US rules prohibit foreigners from owning more than 49 per cent of a domestic airline's shares or over 25 per cent of the voting stock. The BA investment would fall within these limits, but the rival US carriers argue that provisions attracted to the deal would give BA effective control over USAir. Mr Schofield, however, noted that the heavily loss-making US airline industry has already lost over 100,000 jobs in the past few years. 'The Big Three have not saved those jobs,' he said, 'and blocking USAir's arrangement with British Airways will threaten even more jobs. USAir could face more immediate problems, if a ballot among its 8,000-plus mechanics results in a proposed labour contract being turned down. Balloting was continuing yesterday, but if the contract is rejected, strike action - recommended by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers - could be taken.</p>

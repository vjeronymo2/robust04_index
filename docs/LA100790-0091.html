			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION EFFORTS SHOW WEAKNESS OF CITIES LEAGUE UNIT  </P> <P> The letter to the editor from Patricia McGuigan, president of the Orange County  League of California Cities (Sept. 16), was the first public statement I've  seen in over a year from this important group; let's hope it's the last for an  era or so.  </P> <P> In defending her committee's role in the transportation woes of the county, Ms.  McGuigan has but one paltry offering, an innocuous reference to a monthly  meeting held to "coordinate transportation projects."  </P> <P> The balance of her letter, couched in the semibureaucratese favored by those  who have nothing to utter but warm air, is a feeble attempt to justify the  existence of this obscure and ineffective committee.  </P> <P> I dare say the county would survive the immediate dissolution of this group,  placing whatever leftover dreams it had where they rightly belong -- on the  supervisors' desks.  </P> <P> Minor items such as the coordination of traffic lights between cities or a  realistic study of the effect on neighboring cities when Anaheim and Santa Ana  finally build their temples to the jockstrap egos of their mayors and other  elected "public servants" are but two modest suggestions.  </P> <P> The supervisors should well be able to handle these problems now that the  airport is built and the lawsuits haven't yet arrived from various aggrieved  builders and contractors.  </P> <P> D.J. COULSON, Orange  </P></p>

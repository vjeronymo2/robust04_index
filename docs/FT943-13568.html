			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / BAT-man's opening: A look at the tobacco giant's strike into Uzbekistan Mr Victor Chzhen, deputy prime minister and privatisation minister of the ex-Soviet republic of Uzbekistan, saved his bombshell until the last moment. Executives of the UK-based tobacco and financial services group BAT Industries, meeting ministers in the capital Tashkent, were expecting to clarify details of a preliminary agreement to acquire a majority stake in Uzbekistan's tobacco industry. Towards the end of the meeting, however, Mr Chzhen made a 'suggestion'. Might BAT perhaps buy not 51 per cent, but 97 per cent of the industry immediately - involving an extra up-front payment of some Dollars 54m? BAT's chairman Sir Patrick Sheehy said he would discuss the proposal with his team; within 24 hours a carefully worded letter was despatched to Mr Chzhen informing him that his suggestion was 'regretfully unacceptable'. Such are the uncertainties of doing business in Uzbekistan. Although its former communist president, Mr Islam Karimov, has embraced market reforms, the country has a reputation for being a tricky place in which to operate. But in spite of bureaucratic wrangling, and poor infrastructure and communications, companies such as BAT are showing that it is possible to do deals with a republic which for centuries straddled the Silk Road trading route, and has ambitions once again to be a centre of east-west trade. The 22m-strong state is starting to attract interest from both east and west. The first products of a joint venture between Coca-Cola and a local company appeared in Tashkent last month; US mining company Newmont has a gold-mining project; and Daewoo, the South Korean conglomerate, has a joint venture to produce cars from next year. The BAT deal, which should be completed within weeks, is Uzbekistan's biggest privatisation. BAT is spending Dollars 60m on its 51 per cent stake in Uz Tobacco, a state enterprise comprising the republic's only cigarette factory, in Tashkent, and tobacco-processing plants in the second city Samarkand, and in Urgut, a tobacco-growing centre. BAT plans to invest a further Dollars 232m over five years, refurbishing the Tashkent plant, building a cigarette factory in Samarkand, and installing new equipment in Urgut. Within five years it hopes to increase domestic cigarette production from 4bn cigarettes a year to up to 25bn - outstripping the republic's estimated demand of 20bn a year. BAT's equity holding is set to increase to 97 per cent over five years as it puts money into the venture. 'This is the first time we have agreed such a large joint venture, and in effect handed over a whole industry to a foreign partner,' says Mr Ismail Jurabekov, Uzbekistan's first deputy prime minister. Getting to this stage has, however, taken eight months of negotiation and been fraught with difficulties. BAT's team in Tashkent says operating in Uzbekistan can be more frustrating than in the third world. Its biggest complaint is the bureaucracy. 'In Africa, you may be kept waiting, but usually you are dealing with someone who can make a decision, and after a while they will make a decision,' says a team member. 'Here, nobody wants to make a decision.' One reason may be the political struggles going on inside the government, where ministers jostle for position and appear anxious not to make political mistakes. Another problem is the lack of proper legal and tax frameworks. Land-leasing is unknown in central Asia, and in establishing the rent for its 99-year leases on its factory sites, BAT is setting the benchmark for future investors. It is urging the government to equalise the tax treatment of imported cigarettes, which are excise-free, and those produced domestically, which are subject to an excise tax of 900 per cent - a relic of the Soviet era when imports were small. While some difficulties have been surmounted, risks remain. The ruthless political efficiency of the ruling People's Democratic Party, which has outlawed the main opposition movement, has not been matched by economic performance. Inflation was running at an annualised 1,500 per cent in the first quarter of this year; there are negative real interest rates and cheap credits are propping up near bankrupt state enterprises. There is little hope that the som, the new currency introduced this month, will hold its value any better than its predecessor. If the value of Uzbekistan's currency is questionable, so is the worth of its industrial assets. At the Tashkent cigarette factory, the most modern equipment dates from the 1960s; the oldest from 1922. In the factory, electric cables dangle from the ceilings. Subjected recently to a standard BAT factory safety inspection, Taskent scored 2.3 per cent. The pass mark is 70 per cent. 'The machinery and buildings in these places really have negative value,' says Sir Patrick. 'What you are buying is the business, and the market. You have got to have a lot of confidence that you are buying this negative base, but you can make money from it.' Sir Patrick is confident that his deal will make money for BAT, and for Uzbekistan. BAT gets a monopoly of domestic cigarette production for five years. It acquires the rights to local brands, and the opportunity to manufacture locally, 'value-added' international brands. It gets a skilled, but low-cost workforce (average wages are about Dollars 10 a month) and manufacturing capacity that should eventually enable it to export cigarettes to other former Soviet republics. For its part, Uzbekistan gets much-needed dollars, and an industry rebuilt. The new factory in Samarkand will create 500 jobs, and the government can look forward to increased excise and value-added tax revenues as cigarette output rises. It should also earn more from tobacco exports - currently more than 30,000 tonnes a year - as BAT will provide technical assistance to Uzbekistan's farmers, and hopes to introduce, alongside the existing 'Oriental' tobacco crops, the Virginia and Burley varieties needed for producing international-quality cigarettes. Some evidence that such ventures can succeed in former Soviet republics can be found 2,000 miles west, in eastern Ukraine. In Priluky, BAT bought 65 per cent of a newly-privatised tobacco factory last year. In a republic whose economy is arguably in a worse state than Uzbekistan's, and selling cigarettes for the equivalent of a few US cents a pack, the Priluky plant made a profit last year. New technology has enabled it to introduce a higher-quality brand. 'These areas may be risky,' says Sir Patrick, 'but if you take a long-term view, the opportunity is there to get in at a low price, and add value.'  -------------------------------------------------------------------- CIGARETTE PACKETS: A PUFF FOR THE WEST  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Present annual production of cigarettes:                        3.6bn Estimated annual demand for cigarettes:                     20bn-22bn Forecast annual production of UzBAT 25bn  joint venture after 5 years                (10bn-12bn after 3 years)  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

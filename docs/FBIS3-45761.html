Looking back and ahead, how, facing the new circumstances and  new tasks, shall we accomplish the province's economic targets  for 1994 in a better way? With this question in mind, our staff  reporter Guan Qizhi interviewed acting Governor Zhang Wule on  New Year's eve.    Acting Governor Zhang Wule gave a systematic explanation of  the economic approach and measures mapped out for 1994 in this  province. Today, we bring you the second part of this interview.    [Begin recording] [Zhang] As to the reform measures to be  promulgated by the central authorities next year, the provincial  party committee and government, through conscientious study and  discussion, are fully supportive of them, because they are  measures that must be taken for the establishment of a market  economy. Meanwhile, the local governments [words indistinct] on  matters of importance, matters of principle. The reform of the  financial and tax system is mainly aimed at introducing the  system of tax sharing, or in other words, redividing all the tax  categories of the state into central and local taxes.  Therefore, this reform has the greatest impact on all  localities. The reform of the monetary and investment system is  mainly aimed at [words indistinct] technical transformation and  the construction of infrastructure and differential policies  will be adopted. For instance, in the sector of general  industry and communications, there is strong competition which  calls for complete adoption of the mechanism of market  competition. Banks should be operated the way commercial banks  work. Therefore, these projects are required to show relatively  high efficiency and competitiveness.    The second category of projects are ones that have good  social benefits, and especially transregional ones. They are  key construction projects of the state. This is the second  category.    The third category includes energy, communications, and raw  materials projects. This category enjoys priority support from  the state. According to this categorization, we have our  advantages and disadvantages. For example, we are less  competitive on competitive and transregional projects, while  [words indistinct] on energy and raw materials projects.  [passage omitted]    As to the price reforms, there will be many measures  promulgated next year. For example, electricity charges will be  raised, the price of raw coal will be completely decontrolled,  and the price of oil will be basically decontrolled. This  province foresees a grim situation as far as commodity prices  are concerned. Therefore, the provincial government has decided  that this province will not set forth any new price reform  measures, so all those that are promulgated next year will be  coming from the state.

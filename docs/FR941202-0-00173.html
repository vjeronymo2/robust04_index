			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Pertaining to Section 15.33: Species Included in the Approved List for Captive-Bred Species. Deletions of Species in the Approved List <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Animal welfare organizations and one conservation organization commented that Peach-faced lovebird ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Agapornis roseicollis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and Plum-headed parakeet ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Psittacula cyanocephala <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) do not meet the criteria for approval in &sect;15.31(a) and wild-caught birds are in trade. The Service has reviewed its own and international import trade records for Peach-faced lovebirds and is satisfied that all specimens of the species known to be in trade are captive-bred. The commenters expressed concern that imports of Peach-faced lovebirds from South Africa could be wild-caught birds, since the species occurs in the wild there. The Service reviewed the wildlife import declarations for all Peach-faced lovebirds imported from South Africa to the U.S. from 1988 through 1992 and is satisfied that the birds imported were captive-bred. Virtually all shipments had been certified by the South African CITES Management Authority as captive-bred. This species meets the criteria for approval in &sect;15.31 and will remain on the approved list of captive-bred species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has reviewed import trade records for Plum-headed parakeets and found wild-caught specimens of this species in trade, although none have been imported into the United States. Therefore, this species does not meet the criteria for approval in &sect;15.31, and the Service is not including the Plum-headed parakeet in the approved list of captive-bred species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Government of Australia communicated its concern with listing in the approved list of captive-bred species the following species: the Port Lincoln parrot ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Barnardius zonarius <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), Swift Parrot ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lathamus discolor <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), Green rosella ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Platycercus caledonicus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), Yellow rosella ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Platycercus flaveolus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and Blue-bonnet parakeet ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Psephotus haematogaster <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). They stated that these species are not common in captivity in Australia and that there are problems associated with the smuggling of wild-caught specimens of these species. The Service proposed these species for listing in its March 17, 1994, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, based on the information available to it at that time, which showed that specimens imported into the U.S. were captive-bred. Given this new information from Australia, the Service agrees and is not including these species in the final list of approved captive-bred species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Animal welfare organizations and one conservation organization recommended that the Gouldian finch ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chloebia gouldiae <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), Long-tailed grassfinch ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Poephila acuticaudata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and Double-barred finch ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Poephila bichenovii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) be deleted from the approved list of captive-bred species because of the high mortality these species suffer in transit and quarantine. Although the Service recognizes the problems with mortality of birds in trade, the statute does not allow the use of such information in listing captive-bred species on the approved list. The Service is committed, however, to enforcement of the Humane and Healthful Transport Regulations in 50 CFR Part 14, which apply to these and all other bird species imported into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

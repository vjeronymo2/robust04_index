			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Gold price and drought take toll on Cluff SHARES IN Cluff Resources, the gold mining group, fell another 15 per cent, to 11 1/2 p, yesterday after it revealed a 26 per cent fall in first-half profits and warned that its two operating mines faced a tough second half because of the severe drought in Zimbabwe. Pre-tax profit to the end of June fell from Pounds 1.09m to Pounds 802,000 on turnover reduced from Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 6.97m, because of low gold prices - the metal has been trading in sterling terms at its lowest level for 13 years - and the higher value of sterling against the dollar. Gold production in the half-year, mainly from Freda Rebecca, Zimbabwe's biggest gold mine, increased from 34,548 to 35,625 troy ounces in spite of the country's widespread difficulties from the effects of drought. Mr Algy Cluff, chairman, said the Zimbabwe government had been forced to impose a 25 per cent cut in power supplies because of the lack of water and gold output might suffer by at least that amount if cuts continued. Even if the rains came next month, power would be a problem for six to eight months. Mr Cluff said Zimbabwe was also 'taking the medicine prescribed by the International Monetary Fund' and was vigorously attempting to reduce inflation. This had required interest rates to be set at just under 50 per cent. Although Cluff's debt was low - gearing was 15 per cent - this was having an adverse impact. Also, the company would need to borrow some money for the Peach Tree Mine near Bulawayo, which is scheduled to start up next month.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Modernising Mexico open for water business  -Foreign prospects in a fast-developing sector British and French companies are competing fiercely to gain a hold in Mexico's water sector, drawn by an industry that is being partly opened to private investment and is in desperate need of modernisation. Over the past year Thames, Severn Trent, North West Water, Biwater, Anglian Water of the UK, and Lyonnaise des Eaux and Generale des Eaux of France, with local partners have won contracts worth more than Dollars 1bn to build water treatment plants or to modernise municipal water systems in Mexico. Other British and French companies have bid unsuccessfully for contracts. Further investment is likely to run into billions of dollars. Just a fifth of Mexico's sewage is treated, a proportion that will have to grow when new laws regarding water quality are enforced. A quarter of the population does not have access to running water, and still more receive irregular service. However, foreign companies in Mexico warn that the market is highly competitive and grumble that margins are so low that they often do not justify the still considerable risks. 'Mexico is a big market,' says Bob Tippings of Biwater in Mexico, 'but there are a lot of players. We have more profitable business in Venezuela where there is less rivalry.' Apart from the foreign companies, there are half a dozen Mexican construction companies keen to win water contracts. Operators further complain that doing business with Mexico's municipal governments can be time consuming and frustrating. Despite regulations that permit private investment, many say there is considerable resistance to their presence at the lower levels of the government, and this has led to costly delays in construction and financing of plants. 'The municipalities are a disaster,' says one government water official. 'They are too small, badly managed, and have no tradition of managing water efficiently.' The World Bank, in a recent report on Mexico, says water contracts at the local level are decided more on political than economic grounds. Waste water treatment plants are generally seen as the best opportunity in the short term. Some private operators reckon that there needs to be about Dollars 5bn of investment in treatment plants if municipal governments are to meet new federal regulations that subject them to fines if they do not clean their waste water. Under the most common scheme, the private operator pays for the treatment plants, and in return is given management and ownership with a guaranteed amount of business for a set number of years, under the so-called Built-Operating-Transfer blueprint. Such BOTs have been negotiated in Puerto Vallarta, Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Hermosillo, Obregon, Puebla, Leon, La Paz and Tampico. Private operators have so far found it difficult to raise debt collaterised by future revenues because of concern about the creditworthiness of the municipalities. The worry is that the municipal government will not be able to pay the operator the agreed price for treating water and renege on the contract. Banobras, a state development bank, has now agreed to guarantee the contracts between the municipal governments and the operator, thereby giving the collaterised debt a higher credit rating. Mexico City plans eventually to give private companies full operational control over its water system. Last year the city government split the capital into four regions, and awarded contracts to four consortiums of water companies. In the first phase, the companies will install 700,000 meters on a contract basis; in the second they will operate the system in the name of the government; and in the third they will take full control, buying water in bulk and selling it directly, at regulated prices, to customers.</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN WITH CHILDREN HIT BY STRAY BULLET  </P> <P> A woman passer-by pushing a baby stroller was accidentally shot in the arm  Friday by suspected gang members who opened fire on a passing car in Pacoima,  Los Angeles police said.  </P> <P> The woman, whom police did not identify, was in stable condition at a Pacoima  hospital, Lt. Gary Williams said. A stray bullet hit the woman as she was  walking along the 12700 block of Van Nuys Boulevard accompanied by a 3-year-old  child and a 1-year-old baby in a stroller, Williams said.  </P> <P> Police recovered a loaded Uzi semiautomatic carbine from the scene, Williams  said.  </P> <P> Two young men were arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon,  Williams said. He did not identify them because authorities had not determined  whether they are juveniles.  </P> <P> The young men are suspected of being involved in other shootings in the area  last week, Williams said.  </P> <P> Williams said he did not know whether gang members were in the car that was  fired at. There was no description of the car or its passengers. Police were  continuing to investigate the shooting.  </P></p>

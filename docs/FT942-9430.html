			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Uncle Sam, salesman A salesman who won two separate orders totalling Dollars 10bn from the same customer in three months would normally deserve congratulations and a hefty bonus. But when the salesman is the US government acting on behalf of private companies and the customer a foreign sovereign state, it becomes instead a subject of serious global concern. Such tactics jeopardise the stability of the multilateral trading system and threaten the economic and political interests of the US, as well as of other countries. That, unfortunately, is not the view in Washington. Rather, the Clinton administration is hailing its role in clinching the sales of Boeing aircraft and AT&amp;T telecommunications equipment to Saudi Arabia this year as the first fruits of an aggressive government-backed export drive. Indeed, this early success, which builds upon the use of such tactics in the sale of military hardware, is being seized upon as vindication for a broader policy of government support for industry. This includes sharply increased subsidies for commercial research and development. Inevitably, other bidders for Saudi contracts have cried foul. The US response has not been convincing. If, as it insists, political arm-twisting did not secure the AT&amp;T deal, why did Mr Ron Brown, the US Commerce secretary, need to intervene in the negotiations? Given that Saudi Arabia is a US client state which depends heavily on an American defence umbrella, Washington's protestations look thin. Official meddling It is illogical for the administration to fall back on the assertion that it is only doing what other countries have long done. The argument is inconsistent with the long-running US complaint that official meddling prevents free competition on Japanese markets. Exactly the same charge can be levelled at the way the recent Saudi contracts were awarded. Washington is on firmer ground in pointing out that many European governments, notably France and Britain, have long peddled high-level political influence to secure orders for national exporters, while Japan has achieved the same goal in developing countries through tied-aid policies. Nonetheless, the fact that the US is in some respects a recent sinner does not mean it is a justified one. Though government salesmanship may bring short-term gains, it is bad for everyone in the longer term. Customers get a poor deal, because their choice is not based on the quality and price of what they buy. Exporters are damaged by being encouraged to curry favour with bureaucrats, rather than meet customers' needs. Unhealthy collusion Governments suffer, both because excessively enthusiastic championing of exports can breed unhealthy collusion with private companies, and because their own integrity and judgement can be compromised. Witness the British government's recent embarrassment over the Malaysian Pergau dam affair. Furthermore, the practice unfairly penalises companies from countries whose governments have limited resources and international clout. In reality, aggressive export promotion is the obverse of trade protection. It similarly distorts markets, impairs efficiency and invites a spiral of beggar-my-neighbour escalation. Some European Union governments may, indeed, urge a competitive response to the US. That temptation needs to be resisted. Instead, the EU should seek talks with the US and Japan aimed at reversing the proliferation of government-sponsored export drives. One aim should be to strengthen the controls on subsidised export credits negotiated in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and to provide for stiff sanctions against offenders, preferably by bringing the whole area under the new World Trade Organisation. In addition, tougher international rules are needed to prohibit tied aid and limit covert political intervention in export contracts. That latter goal may prove difficult to achieve. But it can be facilitated by encouraging the privatisation of purchasing entities. Clinton administration officials say they would be prepared to scale down, or even eliminate, their export promotion efforts if other governments did the same. The EU should put those professed good intentions to the test.</p>

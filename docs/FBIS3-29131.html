Hosokawa  said, "the basic relationship between Japan and the U.S. will  not be impaired if trade ties deteriorate a bit."    In the wake of the breakdown of the bilateral "framework"  trade talks, U.S. President Bill Clinton said Monday he is  weighing up the possibility of introducing sanctions against  Japan, because of its restricted foreign entry in the cellular  phone market.</p>

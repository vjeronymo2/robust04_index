			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Mexican setback for Allied Domecq: Further progress expected in second half from Spanish purchase Allied Domecq, the drinks and retailing group, reported a 16.5 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 310m despite a setback in the Mexican spirits market. With spirits, wine and retailing showing only marginal growth overall, financial items accounted for almost all the rise in profits from Pounds 266m a year earlier. Finance charges fell by Pounds 20m to Pounds 80m while disposals brought a Pounds 2m profit against a loss of Pounds 21m a year ago. Trading profits rose Pounds 1m to Pounds 388m on turnover up 5.5 per cent at Pounds 2.87bn. Mr Tony Hales, chief executive, said the group would make further progress in the second half thanks to underlying growth and a full contribution from Domecq, the Spanish drinks group Allied acquired earlier this year for Pounds 809m. Domecq, which contributed two months' trading profits to the first half, suffered a 5 per cent fall in sales volumes in Mexico because of political and economic uncertainty. Allied said the local market should recover next year. In contrast, Domecq's Spanish volumes rose 13 per cent. Integration of Domecq into the group was going well, the company said. Trading profits from Allied's existing spirits and wines businesses rose Pounds 1m to Pounds 153m. In the UK, Teacher's whisky, Beefeater gin and Harveys sherry increased market shares. Retailing profits rose Pounds 5m to Pounds 118m with underlying profits up 5.4 per cent. Return from leased pubs were flat but managed pubs' profits were up 6 per cent. Drink sales rose 5 per cent and food sales 20 per cent. Profits at Victoria Wine, the off-licence chain, were up 35 per cent thanks to the acquisition of Augustus Barnett but only 1 per cent without its inclusion. In the US, like-for-like sales at Dunkin' Donuts grew 4 per cent and at Baskin-Robbins, the ice cream chain, by 1.5 per cent. Profits at Carlsberg-Tetley, the group's UK brewing joint venture with Carlsberg, the Danish brewer, fell 9 per cent. Its beer volumes rose 1.5 per cent while the UK market slipped 0.5 per cent. Margins were hurt by discounting and growth of the lower margin take-home trade. 'We are looking for stability rather than profit growth' at the joint venture, said Mr Hales. The board declared an interim dividend of 7.75p a share, up 6.2 per cent. Earnings per share were 18p against 14.8p including the exceptional items or 17.8p against 17.1p without. The group is changing its year-end to August 31, effective next year.</p>

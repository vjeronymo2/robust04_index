			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> BOARD TO CONSIDER PROJECTS  </P> <P> Fifty-five building projects put on hold when voters passed a growth-management  initiative in March will be considered by the Board of Directors on Oct. 3 and  10.  </P> <P> The board must decide which of eight commercial projects can proceed under the  city's new commercial-construction limit of 250,000 square feet annually. So  far this year, 54,341 square feet have been allocated, leaving 195,000 square  feet of allowable development. The eight projects total 262,090 square feet.  </P> <P> The 47 residential projects total 310 units. Sixteen units of the annual  construction limit of 250 have been allocated, leaving 234 remaining units.  </P> <P> The board agreed Tuesday that all the projects will be considered under the  less stringent Phase II requirements of the initiative, even if the properties  are approved under the 1990 limits with their much stricter Phase III rules.  </P> <P> The slow-growth initiative is being challenged by a coalition of community  groups. Hearings on the suit are not expected for at least six months.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUSTICES RULE USER FEES ARE NOT TAXES, AVERTING $22-BILLION BUDGET HEADACHE  </P> <P> The Supreme Court, sparing Congress and the Bush Administration a big budget  headache, ruled unanimously Tuesday that government "user fees" are not taxes  and therefore may be imposed by federal agencies without being enacted into  law.  </P> <P> If the decision had gone the other way, it could have threatened as much as $22  billion in fees collected by various federal agencies, ranging from the Coast  Guard to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Securities and Exchange  Commission.  </P> <P> An adverse ruling also would have greatly complicated federal budget  negotiators' efforts to reduce the deficit this year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Way to Hike Revenue  </P> <P> In most instances, Congress passes a law authorizing the charging of fees in a  regulated industry and leaves it up to the agency to decide who pays exactly  what. Recently, congressional leaders and the Bush White House have talked of  adding new "user fees" as an attractive way of increasing revenue without  raising taxes.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the justices, overturning a lower court ruling in Oklahoma, said  that the current method of handling user fees is legal.  </P> <P> "So long as Congress provides an administrative agency with standards guiding  its action," the agency officials can take on the authority to set specific  fees, wrote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.  </P> <P> The delegation of authority for setting fees for some government services had  been challenged by such groups as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National  Assn. of Manufacturers and the National Taxpayers Assn., which charged that  this way of raising money was both unwise and unconstitutional.  </P> <P> In briefs to the high court, they said that the Constitution does not permit  legislators to hide behind bureaucrats imposing fees and instead requires them  to pass laws prescribing the amount charged and who must pay. Moreover, they  said that the fees charged by agencies such as the NRC and the SEC actually pay  for the operation of the agency itself, and thus should be considered taxes and  not a fee for service.  </P> <P> Last year a district judge in Oklahoma agreed with these arguments and ruled  unconstitutional a 1985 congressional budget act allowing federal regulators to  impose "reasonable" fees on users of pipelines carrying natural gas and  hazardous liquids. The judge concluded that pipeline fees set by the Department  of Transportation actually are taxes and that the Constitution reserved for  Congress alone the "power to lay and collect taxes."  </P> <P> Although the pipeline case involved only about $9 million in fees, the Justice  Department saw the ruling as a potential threat to user fees in general and  appealed the case (Skinner vs. Mid-America Pipeline Co., 87-2098) directly to  the Supreme Court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Longstanding Principle'  </P> <P> O'Connor said that her opinion "reaffirmed our longstanding principle" that the  Constitution permits Congress to delegate to the executive branch the power to  carry out the details of its laws.  </P> <P> During the New Deal era of the 1930s, this issue provoked a major  constitutional conflict between the Supreme Court on one side and the  Democrat-dominated Congress and Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration on the  other. On several occasions, the conservative court struck down New Deal laws  on the grounds that it was unconstitutional for Congress to give Roosevelt's  new agencies the power to regulate the economy.  </P> <P> In 1937, however, the high court changed course and accepted the modern  bureaucratic system in which the lines between regulations and laws, or between  taxes and fees, are not so clear. In the 52 years since then, the justices have  not struck down a single law on the grounds that Congress has abdicated its  constitutional powers to the executive branch.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in an important taxing victory for the Western states, the court  ruled Tuesday that states may tax businesses for oil and gas taken from Indian  reservations.  </P> <P> On a 6-3 vote, the justices upheld New Mexico's tax on oil corporations  operating on Indian lands, concluding that this tax does not subject a company  to illegal multiple taxation nor does it infringe on the rights of Indians  (Cotton Petroleum vs. New Mexico, 87-1327).  </P></p>

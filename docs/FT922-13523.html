			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / Mexican prices rise 1% Mexico's consumer price index was up 1 per cent in March, against 1.2 per cent a month earlier, Jeanne Grant reports from Mexico City. Although inflation continues to fall this year, the cumulative increase for the first three months of 1992 now stands at 4.1 per cent. Single-digit inflation, the government's goal for the year, seems unlikely to be achieved. Most analysts predict a figure of between 12 and 14 per cent.</p>

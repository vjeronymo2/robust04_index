			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 30, IRNA -- An English daily here  Saturday commented on the desire that both Iran and Iraq have  expressed in recent years to improve mutual ties and called on  the two countries to iron out differences.    The idea of "trust" as pointed out by Iraq's deputy foreign  minister, who recently paid a visit to Iran, is a key word in  the absence of which nothing can be accomplished between the two  countries, wrote 'KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL' in its editorial.    "In fact", the paper said, "since a year or two after the  termination of active hostilities between the two countries,  both Tehran and Baghdad have tried to bring about that needed  atmosphere of trust so that as a next step dialogue can be  established to resolve the many outstanding issues between them".    If up to now there has been little or perhaps no advance in  the resolution of issues it must be because there has been a  pronounced failure in the efforts to establish that element of  trust, the daily noted. The article then referred to the bomb  explosion in Tehran on April 19 and said that the Iranian  disciplinary forces have blamed, for the first time, Baghdad for  having been behind the incident.    "No country should support terrorist activities jeopardizing  the lives of innocent people in other countries. That holds  specially true about Baghdad in view of its ongoing economic and  political isolation under the U.N. sanctions."    The daily advised Baghdad to open a new chapter in its  foreign relations with other countries based on understanding  and trust to help alleviate the suffering of its people as a  result of the past two wars.    The element of trust is specially of great importance in  Baghdad's relations with Iran in view of the nature and  magnitude of the unresolved issues, the paper noted. The  approval of bomb planting in a busy Tehran street goes directly  counter to the spirit of desire for normalized ties with Tehran,  the daily said adding that Baghdad has more enemies on its hands  than it can handle and there is no reason why it should want to  aggravate ties with Iran.    The paper concluded by saying that Iran and Iraq have a lot  in common and Tehran can become a helpful future friend for Iraq  if differences are ironed out.</p>

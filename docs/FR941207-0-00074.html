			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The federal share of a grant received under this subtitle may not exceed 75 percent of the costs of a proposal described in an application approved under this subtitle. The matching requirement can only be met through a hard cash match, and must be satisfied by the end of the project period. A certification to that effect will be required of each recipient of grant funds and must be submitted to the Office of Justice Programs with the application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart B_FY 95 Correctional Boot Camp Initiative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;91.10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> General.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Scope of Boot Camp Program. Funding is appropriated in fiscal year 1995 to provide grants to states and multi-state compacts to plan, develop, construct and expand correctional boot camps for adults and juveniles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Adult and juvenile boot camps, referred to as ``correctional boot camps,'' are programs that ``provide a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  structured environment for delivering non-traditional corrections programs to criminal offenders.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) With respect to this program, the mandates of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 5601 et seq.) shall apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eligibility.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Funding is available for both adult and juvenile boot camps. To be eligible for the funding of boot camps, states must comply with the general assurances in &sect;91.3(b) or demonstrate steps taken toward compliance. While the majority of assurances are applicable to the adult correctional system, those states applying for grants for juvenile boot camps must include the juvenile system in the state comprehensive correctional plan and demonstrate how construction of the boot camp will make secure space available to house violent juvenile offenders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For purposes of the FY '95 boot camp program, a ``violent felony'' means any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, or an act of juvenile delinquency that would be punishable by imprisonment for such term if committed by an adult, that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) involves the use or attempted use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon against another person, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) results in death or serious bodily injury to another person.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) States must document that the boot camp program does not involve more than six-months confinement (not including confinement prior to assignment to the boot camp) and includes:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) assignment for participation in the program, in conformity with state law, by prisoners other than prisoners who have been convicted at any time of a violent felony;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) adherence by inmates to a highly regimented schedule that involves strict discipline, physical training and work;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) participation by inmates in appropriate education, job training, and substance abuse counseling or treatment; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) post-incarceration aftercare services for participants that are coordinated with the program carried out during the period of imprisonment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) States must provide assurances that boot camp construction will free up secure institutional bed space for violent offenders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Evaluation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Recipients will be required to cooperate with a national evaluation team throughout the planning and implementation process. Recipients are also strongly encouraged to provide for an independent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of the funded program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Jurisdictions are strongly encouraged to engage in systematic planning activities and to develop and evaluate boot camps as part of a comprehensive and integrated correctional plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Limitation on funds. Grant funds cannot be used for operating costs. States will be required to show how operating expenses will be provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Matching Requirement. The federal share of a grant received may not exceed 75 percent of the costs of the proposed boot camp program described in the appoved application. The matching requirement can only be met through a hard cash match, and must be satisfied by the end of the project period; facility operating expenses may not be used to meet the match requirement for the construction project supported. Match may be made through grantee contribution of construction-related costs. A certification to that effect will be required of each recipient of grant funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Innovative Boot Camp Programs. Jurisdictions are encouraged to explore the development of ``innovative'' boot camp programs which incorporate principles based on the accumulation of research and practical experience, and reflect sound and effective correctional practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Laurie Robinson,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Assistant Attorney General, Office of Justice Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29963 Filed 12&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;18&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

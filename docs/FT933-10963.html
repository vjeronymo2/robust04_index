			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Finance &amp; the Family: John Govett Unit Management JOHN GOVETT Unit Management has formed a Greater China fund by reconstructing its Pacific Income fund. The new unit trust aims to achieve capital growth through investing in companies with exposure to the rapidly growing Chinese economy, principally through Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. Managers will be looking for companies which have 10 per cent or more of their sales, profits or assets located in China. In the case of South Korea, which has only recently re-established diplomatic relations with China, they will also pick companies with strong prospects of moving into the Chinese market. Initially, the fund is not planning to buy any of the mainland Chinese 'B' stocks available to foreign investors. Instead, the heaviest initial weightings are likely to be in South Korea, with about 40 per cent of the fund, Hong Kong, with 25 per cent, and Taiwan, with 15 per cent. Eventually, a proportion of the fund might be invested in the 'B' shares, with other investments elsewhere in Asia and the Pacific rim in companies with substantial interests in China. The initial charge on the fund is 5.75 per cent, and the annual is 1.5 per cent. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 50 a month.</p>

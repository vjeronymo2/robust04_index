On  his way home, he stopped over in Vladivostok, a Russian city on  the east coast, and met with Russian Foreign Minister Kozthev.  Although both sides stressed their bilateral relations had  become mature and had withstood recent tests, they also admitted  that differences were unavoidable and they had yet to improve  their cooperation. According to reports here, Christopher warned  Russia against taking actions alone on issues in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the Middle East, but Kozthez insisted  that Russia must not be excluded from the process of  deliberating on international affairs and complained that  Russia's cooperation with the United States in foreign affairs  did not bring any substantial benefit to Russia.    The less-than-friendly exchange [jiao feng 0074 6912]  between  the two foreign ministers was an inevitable result of the  changes in U.S.-Russian relations.    For a certain period, leading Russian politicians continued  to stress the need to safeguard Russia's national and state  interests and to play a leading role in international affairs.  Russian Foreign Minister Kozthev recently made it plain that  Russia was "facing the task of resolutely, and even toughly in  some aspects, safeguarding and developing our interests," and  should "reinforce its status on the international stage." At  the same time, Russia changed certain practices it pursued in  previous years and took a series of diplomatic initiatives.    In order to contend for the dominating power in the  political  settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis, Russia took the  initiative in getting involved in the issue early this year.  When the United States and its West European allies issued an  ultimatum to the Serbs in Bosnia, Russia not only opposed the  Western plan for launching air strikes against the Serbs, but  also persuaded the Serbs to withdraw from the vicinity of  Sarajevo and hand over their heavy weapons. Russia then  dispatched its own peacekeeping troops to Bosnia. Recently,  when the Croatians and the Muslims in Bosnia reached an  agreement on establishing a federation in Washington, Russia  summoned the Serb leaders to Moscow almost at the same time to  discuss corresponding steps. In addition, Russia not only  strongly opposed NATO's eastward expansion, but also put forth  the "pan-European security conception" in order to check and  balance the "peace partnership" initiated by the United States.  In Middle East affairs, Russia also showed a positive attitude  toward participation in the process of peace. After Russian  Foreign Minister Kozthev met with PLO Chairman 'Arafat in  Tunisia, Moscow announced that `Arafat and Israeli Prime  Minister Rabin had been invited to visit Russia in order to seek  a breakthrough in the impasse in Palestinian-Israeli relations.    Russia also became tougher when dealing with its relations  with the United States, and this caused concern and apprehension  in the United States. After the Ames spy case was exposed, the  Russian Government rejected the United States' demand to recall  the Russian diplomat in charge of intelligence affairs, and then  took corresponding action after the United States expelled the  Russian diplomat. During former U.S. President Nixon's visit to  Russia, President Yeltsin refused to meet him on the grounds  that Nixon had met with the opposition leaders. This move was  viewed here as "making it hot" for the Americans. In view of  the United States' activities of drawing some former USSR  republics over to its side and forcing Russia to withdraw troops  from the Baltic countries, Russia reiterated that it had the  right and duty to interfere in affairs in the "close neighbors  outside its territory." The appearance of the above-mentioned  situation made people in the United States think that relations  between the two countries had become frigid, and were  "undergoing the most serious crisis since the dissolution of the  Soviet Union." THE WASHINGTON POST said that "the Russian bear  has awoke." Russian Foreign Minister Kozthev used a figure of  speech: "The honeymoon is over, but the marriage remains in a  good condition."    According to analysis by the mass media here, the changes in  the political situation after the Russian parliamentary election  constituted the major reason for certain changes in its foreign  policy. The radical economic reform scheme, which was called  "shock therapy," was set back, and Russia did not actually  benefit from the assistance promises made by the United States  and the West. This forced the Russian authorities to adjust its  foreign policy by making themselves farther distant from the  United States and trying harder to safeguard Russia's status and  influence as a big power.    The mass media here held that, although the United States  recently kept a wary eye on the changes in Russia's foreign  policy, it still continued to stabilize U.S.-Russian relations  and took this as a major component of its efforts to play a  "global leading role." For its own interests, Russia also needs  to cooperate with the United States in some fields and to  maintain the lukewarm "partnership."    In order to patch up relations with Russia, U.S. Secretary  of  Defense Perry [as published] recently visited Moscow. Before he  set off, he indicated that the United States would pursued a  dual policy. On the one hand, it would promote Russia's  positive developments through various types of cooperation; on  the other hand, it would prepare for Russia's adoption of a  policy hostile to the West.</p>

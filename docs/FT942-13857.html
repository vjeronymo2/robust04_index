			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Year-end sale forecast by Four Seasons Hotels Four Seasons Hotels, the Canadian luxury chain, says it has had over 50 initial inquiries from buyers interested in acquiring the group. Mr John Richards, senior vice-president, said yesterday the group expected to conclude a deal by the end of the year. Four Seasons announced earlier this month it was seeking a buyer because Mr Isadore Sharp, its founder and controlling shareholder, wanted to loosen his ties with the group over the next three to five years. Mr Sharp and his family own 18 per cent of the group's shares, but control 70 per cent of the votes. The buyer would initially make an offer to outside shareholders, followed later by the purchase of the Sharp family stake. Mr Richards said the group would formally be placed on the market by Goldman Sachs at the end of this month. He added that the initial inquiries had come from all over the world, although the majority were from North America. The group is also trying to sell six of its properties, including the Four Seasons (formerly the Inn on the Park) in London, although it says it will insist on the right to continue managing the hotel. Mr Richards said the group expected to sell three of the hotels by the end of the year.</p>

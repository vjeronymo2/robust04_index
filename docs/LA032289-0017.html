			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OLD HOLLYWOOD LOTS DISAPPEARING;  </P> <P> PRESERVATIONISTS HOPE TO REWRITE ENDING AT STUDIOS  </P> <P> When word got out that a Hollywood studio where Harold Lloyd, Lucille Ball and  Francis Ford Coppola once plied their talents had been nominated as a  historic-cultural monument, the entertainment industry saw it as an ominous  sign.  </P> <P> Suddenly it seemed as though old concrete barns and other nondescript  structures still being used for creating movies, television shows and  commercials could be frozen in time, even if experts agreed that they had no  architectural distinction.  </P> <P> For Hollywood Center Studios, the nomination posed an infuriating dilemma. The  owners wanted to replace some seismically unsafe buildings made of hollow clay  tile that were hastily and cheaply erected in the 1920s. But they could be  prevented from doing so if the studio became a landmark.  </P> <P> What might have been a commonplace skirmish between a property owner and a  neighborhood organization has turned into a far more significant conflict  between the studios and historic preservationists.  </P> <P> Both sides say the future character of Hollywood itself could well be at stake,  even though only one other studio has been directly involved so far. Paramount  owns the Western Costume Co. building directly to its east on Melrose Avenue  and may want to tear it down.  </P> <P> Surprisingly, no one has yet attempted to inventory remaining historic film  studios, and until recently they received scant attention even from local  preservation groups. The city of Los Angeles has conferred cultural-historical  monument status 418 times since 1962, yet such designation has rarely been  sought for a movie studio.  </P> <P> But now officials of two preservation groups, Hollywood Heritage Inc. and the  Los Angeles Conservancy, want to retain the flavor of the movies' Golden Age by  trying to prevent further destruction of the remaining barns and bungalows that  give Los Angeles, especially Hollywood, a unique look.  </P> <P> The studio owners, citing recent renovation efforts at lots like Paramount's,  say that they also want to maintain continuity with the past. But they contend  that Hollywood is really preserved on celluloid and videotape, not in old  edifices.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Flexibility Asked  </P> <P> What is needed, the studios say, is more flexibility, not less, to accommodate  the ever-changing technological demands of their high-pressure industry.  Otherwise, they say, exasperated film makers will be more tempted than ever to  take their productions elsewhere.  </P> <P> "Imagine if the Ford Motor Co. was told it had to keep the building where the  Model T was produced," said Thomas McGovern, vice president of Raleigh Studios  on Melrose Avenue. "How would they put out the Ford Taurus or the Probe?"  </P> <P> To preservationists like Hillary Gitelman, executive director of Hollywood  Heritage, a nonprofit organization with about 300 members, the studios have a  significance that extends beyond the business enterprises that occupy them --  associations and memories worth preserving for future generations.  </P> <P> "These are the industrial sites around which Hollywood grew and developed," she  said. ". . . They're really important to the world in terms of the myths that  were created here and the cultural impact of those creations."  </P> <P> Only one year after the Model T Ford was introduced in 1908, Los Angeles' first  movie studio was established on the site of a vacant downtown Chinese laundry.  By 1915 there were 60 film studios in the area, according to historian Marc  Wanamaker.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Recognized Landmarks  </P> <P> Today, about 17 facilities dating from 1940 or earlier remain. Yet KTLA-TV, the  neo-Colonial building on Sunset Boulevard where "The Jazz Singer" was made in  1927, and KCET-TV, the oldest continually used studio in the country, are the  only active studios officially recognized as landmarks. Spanish-style brick  structures from the '20s still stand on KCET's lot, also on Sunset Boulevard.  </P> <P> Preservation has not exactly been a watchword of the film industry. No one  stopped 20th Century Fox 30 years ago when it began dismantling its back lot to  make way for Century City or interfered with Universal Studios when, a few  years later, it started replacing historic buildings with office towers.  </P> <P> As recently as 1987, the owners of Culver Studios on West Washington Boulevard  in Culver City demolished two glass-enclosed sound stages from the silent  screen era after first trying to find a new home for them. "I couldn't give  them away," said Bob Sirchia, vice president for operations. "There was zero  interest in them."  </P> <P> It was only when Hollywood Center Studios protested its nomination as a  monument that Hollywood Heritage began to recognize the value of the old  studios. "It had never come up before," Gitelman said, noting that it usually  takes a threatened demolition to mobilize preservationists.  </P> <P> Of the cities where historic studios are located, only Los Angeles currently  has an ordinance that can specifically be used for their preservation, although  West Hollywood is expected to follow shortly. Hearings are being held on a  proposed ordinance that could affect the future of Warners Hollywood Studios on  Sunset Boulevard, which dates back to 1918.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Culver City Situation  </P> <P> No such ordinance exists in Culver City, home of Lorimar (formerly the site of  MGM-UA) and Culver Studios, where David O. Selznick made "A Star Is Born" and  much of "Gone With the Wind." Lorimar has the last remaining glass-enclosed  sound stage and uses it to make sets.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, the roster of monuments includes two former studios, the  Tudor-style Charlie Chaplin facilities on La Brea Avenue (now the home of  A&amp;M Records) and Mack Sennett's on Glendale Boulevard in Echo Park (now  owned by a storage company). But in 1981, the city's Cultural Heritage  Commission rejected monument status for an abandoned studio on Santa Monica  Boulevard and Van Ness Street, where Mickey Rooney got his first major role.  </P> <P> Ironically, perhaps, the preservation controversy erupted only a few years  after the studios themselves decided that sprucing up their lots, even at  considerable cost, was good for business. Many lots had been neglected,  especially during the 1960s and early '70s, when the movie industry was in a  slump.  </P> <P> So little thought was given to design back then that at Paramount, for example,  a dressing room building from the 1920s was expanded in piecemeal fashion  whenever a star demanded more space. Interior detailing everywhere was stripped  for a more streamlined effect, according to Ann Mullaney, executive director of  design development.  </P> <P> Former Paramount executives were so oblivious to their surroundings that it  took 16 years after the studio bought the adjoining Desilu lot in 1967 for the  defunct television studio's logo to be removed from the water tower.  </P> <P> But once the decades of indifference ended and more picturesque surroundings  became available, producers began lining up to secure offices on these lots and  soak up the ambiance, according to studio managers.  </P> <P> Over the last six years, major renovation has occurred at three historic  Hollywood studios, including the two that are now the focus of  preservationists' attention and Raleigh Studios, a rental lot where "The Girl  From Yesterday," starring Mary Pickford, was made in 1914.  </P> <P> Paramount, the last major film studio still located in Hollywood, won an award  last year from the Los Angeles Conservancy for its preservation efforts.  Architects have worked from original blueprints to painstakingly restore the  original buildings, and grass was planted over parking lots to re-create the  park-like setting of 1926.  </P> <P> Since Paramount purchased Western Costume Co. last year, it has been widely  assumed that the studio would replace the 76-year-old building. This  speculation intensified after the historic collection itself was sold earlier  this month to three investors, including novelist Sidney Sheldon. Although  Paramount's Mullaney said the Western Costume building does not appear suitable  for conversion to offices, studio officials say they have not yet decided what  to do with it. They are clearly nervous that preservationists might seek to  have the building declared a cultural-historical monument.  </P> <P> As with Western Costume, it is Hollywood Center Studio's role in the  development of the film industry, not its architecture, that has drawn the  preservationists' attention.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Surprise for New Owners  </P> <P> Not long after Francis Ford Coppola went bankrupt and was forced to sell his  Zoetrope Studios in 1984, the new owners of the renamed Hollywood Center  Studios discovered that a private citizen had nominated their lot on Las Palmas  Avenue as a monument.  </P> <P> Under the Los Angeles law, such status can be conferred not only on buildings  with architectural significance but also on "historic structures or sites in  which the broad cultural, political, economic or social history of the nation,  state or community is reflected or exemplified. . . ."  </P> <P> If the owner objects to the designation, demolition or substantial alteration  can be delayed for 360 days while a buyer is sought. But the Cultural Heritage  Commission cannot dictate how a site is to be used or force private enterprises  such as studios to open their doors to the public.  </P> <P> Although the ordinance theoretically controls only major structural changes,  the studios say that once a building is flagged as a landmark, every proposed  alteration is subject to frustrating delays and red tape.  </P> <P> For instance, had Paramount Studios been a monument, said Christine Essel, vice  president for planning and development, it would have been impossible to secure  the permits necessary to get Stage 29 ready in six weeks for live broadcasts of  "The Arsenio Hall Show," as the producers demanded.  </P> <P> Once headquarters to silent screen comedian Harold Lloyd, Hollywood Center  Studios, which first opened in 1919, was also the site where Howard Hughes  produced and directed "Hell's Angels," giving Jean Harlow her first starring  role.  </P> <P> In the 1950s, "I Love Lucy," "The Ozzie and Harriet Show" and "The Burns and  Allen Show" were made there. George Burns still maintains an office there.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shocking Realization  </P> <P> It was not until Hollywood Center Studios was denied a permit to demolish some  two-story gray buildings, which the city itself had pronounced seismically  unsafe, that the new management realized the significance of the  cultural-historical nomination, according to Albert J. Tenzer, vice president  and chief financial officer.  </P> <P> Outraged, Tenzer invited Thomas Hines, a UCLA professor of architecture and  urban planning, to inspect the buildings. Hines saw no harm in tearing them  down, although he urged that a bas relief be saved.  </P> <P> "They (preservationists) deal in what I would call the 'Indian burial ground  syndrome,' " Tenzer said. "You can't touch anything because the ghosts that  surround and permeate the hallowed grounds are not to be disturbed."  </P> <P> The impasse at Hollywood Center Studios, now a rental lot, led City Councilman  Michael Woo to create a task force to try to resolve the dispute between  studios and preservationists, perhaps by developing new legislation  specifically tailored to the studios' needs.  </P> <P> Optimistic about the prospects for resolution, Woo said, "The preservationists  are showing themselves not to be purists, in terms of being absolutist about  their positions."  </P> <P> Woo fashioned a special compromise for Hollywood Center Studios that will give  the facility partial designation, thereby allowing the unsafe buildings to be  torn down. The agreement also allows interiors changes to be made without  interference from the Cultural Heritage Commission.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Planning Unit Formed  </P> <P> The studios, which recently formed a Studio Planning Council to address  preservation and other government-related issues, say more flexibility is  needed if producers are to be kept from abandoning Hollywood for other states  that are eagerly trying to lure their business.  </P> <P> "You can't freeze something and keep it economic," said Robert Bertram Burke, a  lawyer who has represented Paramount and Hollywood Center Studios. "It's like  shooting somebody and formaldehyding them so you can keep them looking like  they did when they were 30."  </P> <P> Yet although California loses about $3 billion as a result of "runaway  production," there are signs that the state is beginning to recapture some of  the production work it has lost over the last few years. Last year, 55% of all  feature films were shot in California, a 2% increase over the previous year,  according to Michael Walbrecht, spokesman for the California Film Commission.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, preservationists say, it is important to consider the future, when  maintaining old buildings sitting on valuable real estate may not be as  fashionable. "We want to protect these resources for our children," Gitelman  said.  </P></p>

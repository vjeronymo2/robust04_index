			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Bangkok KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT in Thai and  Bangkok MATICHON in Thai on 8 June carry editorials on the  arrest by Thai police of three Iranian suspects in the foiled  attempt to car-bomb the Israeli Embassy in March.    Police have finally arrested three suspects in the attempt  to  sabotage the Israeli Embassy by using a truck laden with C-4  explosives, the editorial in KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT says. The  600-word editorial, on page 2, entitled: "A Sporadic Fad Cannot  Cope With Sabotage," believed there are more than three people  involved in the attempt. Short of evidence and information,  police cannot make further arrests, especially of those who are  the masterminds behind the plot. Those people are dangerous  because they have the power to order more operations to be  carried out despite the fact that a number of terrorists have  been arrested.    The editorial supports the instruction by the police  director  general who wanted investigators to urgently wrap up inquiries  so that the three suspects can be tried by the court of justice  and the result be made known to the public. It says:  "Investigators should be able to produce substantial evidence  to charge the three who are foreign nationals. Otherwise, the  case could affect bilateral relations." There has already been  a sign of that -- Radio Tehran yesterday reported that the  Iranian Government had filed a protest letter to the Thai  Government asking that a trial be carried out promptly, it says.    The paper concludes: "We support the order issued by the  police director general for police to intensively monitor people  suspected to have links with international terrorist groups and  to tighten security for key establishments following the arrest  of the three suspects. It goes without saying that the order  was meant to block the attempts by terrorists to mount pressure  on the police while investigations are being conducted against  the three. We hope that officials will respond to the order of  the police chief and carry out their duties seriously and  consistently, and not just on and off as in the past."    MATICHON's 800-word, page 2 editorial is entitled: "The  Arrest of C-4 Bomb Suspects." It also urges the police to prove  that the three arrested suspects are real terrorists and not  just scapegoats. "Since the suspects are foreigners listed as  members of international terrorist groups, the government  should, in order to give more weight to the arrest, seek  cooperation from the Malaysian Government for more information  on the suspects as it was found that they once lived in  Malaysia. Cooperation from Malaysia would enhance Thailand's  credibility in doing justice to the arrested terrorists,"  MATICHON says. It also wants the government to contact Iran on  the issue. "Iran is another country which should be able to  supply Thailand with information about the suspects who hold  Iranian passports," says the editorial. It adds: "Anyway, we  cannot expect much from Iran since it is natural that Iran would  rather be cautious and try to demonstrate that it has nothing to  do with activities by international terrorist groups."    The paper stresses it cannot accept the fact that terrorists  have chosen to carry out their operations in Thailand. "The  Thai Government must make it clear to the parties fighting in  this century-old war of genocide that they cannot carry out  sabotage in this country thus exposing the Thai people to  danger. If they want to fight with each other to the last of  their men, let them do that somewhere else, not in Thailand,"  the paper says. It adds that the Thai Government must also make  that policy known to those countries which support international  terrorism, and have them relay the message to terrorists not to  come to Thailand.</p>

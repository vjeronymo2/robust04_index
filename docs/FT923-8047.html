			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / US bond market takes time to heal: Speed of Salomon Brothers' return to health in wake of scandal is unmatched by regulatory changes A year ago this week investigators from the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department were crawling all over Wall Street to find out who had been involved in the rigging of billion-dollar treasury auctions. At the same time, on Capitol Hill, politicians were demanding a complete regulatory overhaul of the bond market in the wake of what one congressman said was 'financial treason'. One year on, Salomon Brothers, the principal culprit, is in remarkably good health, even if the scars have not fully healed. The firm was forced into radical change after its bond-trading desk was discovered to have faked customer orders in treasury bond auctions. Much credit for weathering the storm has been given to Mr Warren Buffett, who took over as interim chairman of Salomon in the wake of the scandal and stepped down in June this year. Last month the firm reported second quarter pre-tax operating profit of Dollars 647m (Pounds 336m), the largest by a publicly quoted Wall Street securities firm. The bond market, however, looks much like it has for decades. The process by which the treasury sells the government's securities - which a year ago almost all agreed was antiquated and shoddily supervised - is virtually unchanged. This week, for example, the treasury will sell Dollars 36bn in new securities, in almost the same way it sold them before the scandal. Some minor reforms have been introduced. For one, more institutions are eligible to become primary dealers. Yet the number of primary dealers (39), is the same as a year ago - the cost in committing to being a primary dealer has kept newcomers away. The auctions remain dominated by a handful of big primary dealers, and most institutional buyers submit bids for bonds and notes through the dealers. The dealers have to cope with stricter surveillance by regulators, new rules about record-keeping, and random spot-checking of customer bids. The Salomon affair taught many dealers a sharp lesson in supervision, says Mr Patrick Rothstein, head of government securities at Merrill Lynch. He says: 'The players (in the market) are now painfully aware of what can happen if you take your eye off the ball for a few moments.' The treasury says it will supply extra securities after auctions if it detects prices are being forced up by a supply shortage resulting from market manipulation. The new weapon has not been used, and the treasury hopes the threat will deter price 'squeezes' of the kind Salomon created last year. Some important planned reforms - reallocation of regulatory responsibilities among government agencies and the automation and redesign of the auction process - are a long way from implementation, mostly because of in-fighting on Capitol Hill. A turf battle between different congressional committees has meant legislators have been unable to agree on the transfer of powers. The plan to give the SEC a regulatory role in the bond market has run into opposition. Mr Junius Peake, a financial consultant who testified before both congressional banking committees about market reform, says the secretary of the treasury should have a free hand to manage bond market operations: 'I'm a little nervous about him being second-guessed by the SEC.' Government officials admit testing of a new computerised auction process is some way off, and that it might be years before a system is operating. Ultimately, major market reform is unlikely because the government opposes it. Mr Jerome Powell, under-secretary of the treasury for finance, said recently: 'I don't think fundamental changes in the bond market or in the way traders do business are called for, or will happen.' The investigation into whether other firms colluded with Salomon to break treasury market rules also seems to be progressing slowly. The authorities are keeping silent, but the roles of several of Salomon's clients whose names were linked to an auction the firm rigged last May have been investigated, including the powerful money managers Mr George Soros and Mr Michael Steinhardt. The Salomon executives who resigned over the scandal will probably face civil charges related to the fact that they waited three months before reporting the bond desk's illegal activities to regulators. The man at the centre of the whole affair, Mr Paul Mozer, the former head of bond trading at Salomon, is negotiating a plea bargain agreement with government prosecutors. In a recent interview breaking his silence of a year, Mr Mozer said he was responsible for only one 'spur-of-the-moment' infraction of the rules, and maintained he was being made a scapegoat by the media, congress and the new management of Salomon. Salomon still has to fight more than 50 lawsuits related to the scandal, but its management believes the worst is over. Salomon is suffering from scores of staff departures and defections that came in the first six months after the scandal, and it is only now regaining its footing in the profitable securities underwriting business. It has also had to set aside almost Dollars 500m from the past year's earnings to pay government fines, settle SEC charges and cover the cost of future lawsuits. Yet, restructuring of the firm's management in the past year, rationalisation of Salomon's compensation system, and shifting of resources to emphasise the firm's core strengths of bond sales and trading should all pay dividends in the long term. It may be too early to tell, but Salomon could emerge from its troubles a better firm. Government officials argue that the same can be said about the treasury bond market, which they claim is better run and more efficiently regulated. The lack of real progress on regulatory reform, however, and the likely long wait for the automated auctions the treasury promised last year, means the federal authorities have less to be pleased about than does Salomon.</p>

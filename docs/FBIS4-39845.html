			<p>BFN     [Text] President Askar Akayev intends to strengthen state  power in Kyrgyzstan. He said so at Monday's conference with the  heads of local government bodies.    This does not mean a change in the general political course,  he explained. According to him, some provisions and concepts  adopted earlier are untenable and illusory, and the real  developments in the country's political and economic life make  it necessary to alter objectives.    He continues to be in favor of democracy, Akayev pointed  out,  but real life has proved that democratic methods are  ineffective, that they hinder the endeavors to reach tangible  results on the road to reforms.    Under the circumstances a strong state power has no  alternative, since "The people are not prepared for  democracy," Akayev stressed.    He will resolutely dismiss those people who will hinder the  implementation of government resolutions or stand in the way of  carrying out the program for economic restructuring to be  accomplished in the next three years.    On the other hand, Akayev noted that "we could establish an  authoritarian regime, as other CIS states did, the more so as  many want it, but this will be unproductive."    The passion for parliamentarianism in Kyrgyzstan has led to  the fact that the Supreme Council engaged in  politically-motivated criminal investigations, not in normal  legislative activity, taking up the duties of the national  security committee, Interior Ministry and courts of justice,  which scared the potential investors away.    "Many people in Kyrgyzstan viewed parliament as the  apotheosis of democracy," Akayev stressed. "In the meantime the  activity of the present legislature hinders the country's  movement on the road of reforms and creates the reputation of a  scandalous country for Kyrgyzstan."</p>

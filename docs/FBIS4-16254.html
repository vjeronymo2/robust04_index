			<p>BFN     [Text] 0n 14 April 1994, Prime Minister Vyacheslaw Kebich  held a news conference concerning the results of his visit to  Moscow, where the signing of the pact on the unification of the  monetary systems of Russia and Belarus took place. According to  the Belarusian prime minister, the pact consists of two parts;  only seven articles were put in force at the time of the  signing. They relate, in particular, to the lifting of customs  duties on Belarusian goods exported to Russia. Russia's losses  in this case will not exceed its expenditures for maintaining  Russian troops on Belarusian territory as well as for  transporting industrial cargo, oil, gas, etc. The strongest  difference of opinion in the process of signing arose during the  discussion of the second part of the agreement, which is related  directly to the creation of the monetary union and comes into  conflict with Article 145 of the Belarusian Constitution.  Kebich told journalists that Belarusian people's deputies will  have to consider introducing amendments to the Constitution in  force, which will deprive the Belarusian Central Bank of being  first to determine money issuing policy on the territory of  Belarus, and will transfer this function, as well as some  others, to the Russian Central Bank. In the event of Supreme  Soviet's refusal to carry out such manipulations [as received]  with the Constitution, Kebich intends to launch a national  referendum on this issue. The Belarusian prime minister also  informed of the free-of-interest credit in the amount of 200  million rubles, which will be granted to Belarus in the first  half of 1994 for balancing the monetary systems of both  countries. In the event of the cancellation of the agreement,  this sum must be returned to Russia. "This is a choice of my  life. I have made it and I do not feel sorry about it," Kebich  stated. By now, the final word rests with the Belarusian  parliament, because a real rapprochement of the two Slav states  can be achieved only after the ratification of the agreement and  the introduction of amendments to the Constitution.</p>

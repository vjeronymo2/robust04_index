			<p>BFN     [Text] The chairman of the Council of State, His Excellency  David Kpomakpor, said yesterday that the Liberian National  Transitional Government is adamantly opposed to the formation of  a transitional army. Speaking at a press briefing at the  Executive Mansion, Chairman Kpomakpor wondered why people could  be advancing the idea of the formation of a transitional army at  a time when Liberians are talking about disarmament.    According to LINA [LIBERIAN NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY], the State  Council chairman said the council did not at any time consider  the idea of a transitional army debatable as it is  counterproductive and contrary to the Cotonou Accord. He  dispelled speculation that the council was discussing the idea  of a transitional army. He termed such proposals on the part of  warring factions as a lack of good will, noting that instead of  talking about the formation of a transitional army, they should  be submitting themselves to the disarmament process. Chairman  Kpomakpor said what is necessary now is for this nation to be  rid of arms and other warlike materials and hoped that warring  factions will see wisdom in the need to disarm.    On ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States  Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] neutrality, Chairman Kpomakpor said  that it is unfortunate that the warring factions are looking for  scapegoats as all of the armed groups are accusing ECOMOG of  being partial. On the suggestion of changes in the transitional  government, the State Council chairman said this could not be  ruled out and disclosed that the council will shortly appoint  managing directors and heads of autonomous agencies after  constituting the various public corporation boards. He,  however, said the council will only appoint managing directors  and heads of autonomous agencies based on their qualification  and not on the basis of factional connection.</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Development aid record said to be lagging BRITAIN was criticised yesterday for continuing to let its development aid lag behind the standard set for rich industrialised countries. Although British aid is among the best managed in the world, the amount continues to fall well below the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product (GNP). Furthermore, the gap is widening, according to a review published yesterday by the Paris-based Development Assistance Committee (DAC), which monitors industrialised countries' aid performance. The biannual study arrives asthe prime minister is under pressure to fulfil a 1983 statement that he hoped Britain would reach the UN target. British Official Development Assistance (ODA) has increased only marginally in volume since the early 1980s, to reach Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.5bn) in 1989. It has fallen as a share of GNP, from 0.49 per cent in 1978-1979 to a mere 0.31 per cent in 1989, says the report. At that level, Britain is only the 13th most generous donor among the 18 countries belonging to the DAC, although the study shows that the UN target is bettered by only four of them - Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark. France claims to spend 0.78 per cent of GNP on overseas aid, but that falls below the UN target to 0.54 per cent if its overseas territories are counted as part of France rather than overseas developing countries. In real terms, Britain's ODA rose by 1.1 per cent in the five years to 1989, slightly less than half the 2.3 per cent average rate of increase for industrialised donor governments over the same period. The DAC recognises that the British government is planning to do better by increasing the volume of aid by 17 per cent over the next three years, but feels that is not enough. 'Based on present planning, the real increase in the UK aid programme is likely to remain slight' and aid as a share of GNP might well fall further, said a communique by the DAC. The high quality of British aid, delivered by a strong administration with long experience in developing countries, makes it 'all the more desirable that the British aid efforts be increased', the DAC added. That would also help other donor governments to win more public support for a boost in aid. Britain's practice of focusing aid on the poorest countries comes in for praise, as does its policy of using aid to encourage better government, with economic and environmental reforms. 'The UK considers that good government and development are closely linked,' said the DAC. More donors should follow the same philosophy, it argued.</p>

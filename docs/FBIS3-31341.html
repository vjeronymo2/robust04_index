			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zagreb, 16 Feb (TANJUG) -- Any decision on possible  air strikes on the Serbs, if they do not withdraw weapons from  their positions around Sarajevo, must be taken by the UN  Security Council so international consensus can be reached,  Russian President Yeltsin's special envoy Vitaliy Churkin said  today at the end of his visit to Zagreb.    "However," Churkin noted, "it is not our intention to bring  about a crisis over this issue in the relations between Russia  and the international community." Churkin added that "Russia has  good communications with the Serbian side just as Germany  communicates well with Croatia and the United States does with  the Muslims."    Churkin expressed dissatisfaction with "some aspects of  NATO's decision" to give an ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs  since, in his words, this has created "duality regarding the  situation in Sarajevo."    "These decisions go beyond the framework set by UN  resolutions. If this standpoint had been adopted at a session of  the UN Security Council, we would have full unanimity in the  stands of the international community," Churkin said.    In his view, air strikes "are the last resort in the event  of  direct attacks on UNPROFOR or in a difficult humanitarian  situation."    Reflecting upon his visit to Sarajevo, Churkin said that  "his  impressions were encouraging" following talks with commander of  the UN peace force General Jean Cot, Serb General Ratko Mladic,  Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic and Prime Minister Haris  Silajdzic.    "My impression in the wake of all these talks is that all  the  sides to the conflict are now thinking about peace rather than  further fighting," Churkin said and added that General Mladic  "convinced him that he would meet UNPROFOR's demand with maximum  flexibility."</p>

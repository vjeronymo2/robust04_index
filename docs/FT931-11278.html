			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Founding family reduces Stakis stake The Stakis family is reducing its stake in Stakis, the hotels and casinos group founded by Sir Reo Stakis, by taking up only a small proportion of the Pounds 28m rights issue announced last week. Yesterday the joint brokers, Smith New Court and Allied Provincial, placed 21.29m of the family's rights shares at 9 3/4 p each. The effect will be to reduce the family stake from 24 per cent to 18 per cent. Privately, company officials welcome the chance to increase institutional shareholdings in the group, which returned to marginal profit last year.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew on 12 April, in  a page 4 report by Moti Bassok on the Cairo talks, reports that  "significant progress was made yesterday on a series of  security, civilian, and military issues. Political sources in  Jerusalem assessed yesterday that the agreement on the Israeli  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho will be signed by the end of  the month. Two days after that, Israel will release 2,500  Palestinian prisoners."    Basok reports that "a timetable for the Israeli withdrawal  from Gaza and Jericho following the signing of the agreement was  determined yesterday. Other things decided were a timetable for  the release of Palestinian prisoners and the deployment dates  for the Palestinian police force. Progress was also achieved on  the issues of control of water resources, security in Gaza's  naval zone, and control over the Gaza Strip and Jericho  airspace. Most issues pertaining to judicial powers were also  resolved."    Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 12 April on pages 1  and 19 carries a report by No'omi Levitzky saying that "the  substantial entry of Palestinian policemen to the Gaza Strip and  Jericho will start in early May. The force will number 9,000  policemen: 2,000 from the territories and 7,000 from abroad.  The deployment of the policemen in Gaza and Jericho will be  completed by the end of May. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  withdrawal will proceed at the same time and will be completed  three weeks after the agreement is signed.    "The IDF withdrawal timetable at this stage looks as  follows:  During the first week after the agreement is signed, the IDF  will withdraw from Rafah and Jericho. During the second week,  it will pull out of Khan Yunus, and in the third week, it will  leave Gaza and the northern part of the Strip. The body in  charge of managing the autonomy will settle in Jericho during  the first week after the agreement is signed."</p>

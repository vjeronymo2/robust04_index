			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz has said that the  Geneva summit has established the basis for an understanding  that will become evident when the Arab and Israeli negotiators  meet in Washington. Buwayz said that President al-Asad's use of  the term "the peace of the brave" is a clear indication of the  existence of an understanding, at least along broad lines. He  added: Whoever thought that this summit would be an adventure  was wrong.    Former Prime Minister Dr. Salim al-Huss maintained that the  Syrian-U.S. summit has given an important push to the peace  process in the area. He said: President al-Asad, as usual,  stuck to his guns regarding the correlation of the Syrian,  Lebanese, and Jordanian tracks, and he emphasized the need to  abide by UN Resolution 425, which concerns Lebanon. In doing  so, he was speaking as an Arab president who is aware of his  pan-Arab responsibilities. He was great in clearly expressing  commitment to a just and comprehensive peace to safeguard the  Arabs' interests and rights.</p>

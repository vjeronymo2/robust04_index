Both of them were  sentenced for the 1981 events and the assassination of the late  President Anwar al-Sadat.    Organization leader Shu'ayb is doing a life sentence in  Tanta  Prison after being convicted of involvement in the 1981 events  and 40 terrorist acts in Asyut. Last March he began to contact  a group of his colleagues and other elements from inside the  prison in order to form an organization to be tasked with  assassinating a number of public figures, with special emphasis  on police officers and men. Ramadan Hasan Salih, Muntasir Ahmad  Husayn, and Khalid Ibrahim 'Abd-al-Rahman, all of them from  Asyut, helped him to set up the organization together with  Mahmud Mustafa Hasaballah from al-Buhayrah, who is a doctor at  the general hospital in Fuwah.    The intelligence service discovered all the arrangements  made  by the terrorist organization and monitored the instructions  sent from the prison to the various members in a number of  governorates. All the arrested defendants were handed over to  the public prosecution office for interrogation. [passage  omitted]</p>

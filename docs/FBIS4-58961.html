			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah, Lutfi Shatarah, Naji </F> al-Harazi, Taj-al-Din 'Abd-al-Haqq, and Salwa al-Ustuwani: "War  of Conflicting Statements in Yemen"]    [Excerpts] London, Sanaa, Abu-Dhabi, Damascus, Aden --  Many questions have been asked in Arab and foreign diplomatic  circles about Sanaa's sudden decision yesterday accepting Arab  League mediation. Some interpreted the fact that Yemeni Foreign  Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah yesterday contacted Arab  League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid as perhaps an  indication of a new understanding of the difficulty of settling  the Yemeni crisis by military means, or a desire to "avoid Arab  isolation" and to avoid charges of "arrogance of power" being  made against the leadership in Sanaa. [passage omitted]    On the military front, the fighting has continued between  the  two sides. Sanaa sources said that north Yemeni forces have  occupied al-'Anad airbase and opened al-Dali' road to Aden,  which they expected to fall soon. The northern command was so  confident yesterday that it transported a number of  correspondents, including an AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT correspondent, to  a point the sources said was "nearest to Aden." Probably in the  area of al-'Alam or Dar Sa'd, but there has been no confirmation  of that.    Commenting on that, a highly placed Socialist Party [YSP]  source said that that was part of the media campaign aimed at  weaking the morale of the southern forces. He wondered why  Sanaa neglected to mention the battles against al-'Amaliqah  units in the Abyan Governorate, where access to Aden is much  easier than access through al-Dali' road in the Lahij  Governorate.    The YSP source stressed that it would be impossible for the  northern forces to reach Aden. He also denied that the al-'Anad  airbase (in the Lahij Governorate) had fallen to these forces.  He said the southern forces had secured the al-Dali' road after  wiping out a northern battalion that was moving from Mukayris  (in the north of the Abyan Governorate) to Lawdar (in the  center) to reinforce al-'Amaliqah forces. He added that another  battalion was destroyed as it tried to escape to al-Rahah area  near al-Kabsi camp where remnants of the northern 2nd Armored  Brigade are situated.    Another source said that southern forces deployed in the  area  between Karish and Mukayris captured a number of tanks and an  entire infantry battalion and were advancing towards Ta'izz, and  also that the artillery brigade in Yarim joined the Basuhayb  Brigade and in doing so completely blocked the al-Dali' road in  the face of the northern forces trying to advance on Aden. The  source added that the situation in Aden was calm today and that  employees have returned to their offices.    As far as fighting in the Abyan Governorate against  al-'Amaliqah forces is concerned, southern sources said they  expected the battles there to be decided today, now that the  town of Zinjibar was under control with the northern units  retreating towards al-'Urqub. [passage omitted]    The sources said that the delay in settling the situation in  Abyan was due to the fact that the northern forces used Iraqi  fighting expertise and used tactics unknown to the southern  forces, such as withdrawing from an area after mining it and  then storming it heavily after the entry of southern light  forces (infantry and militia), and also due to the fact that  low-flying aircraft were mistaken by the southerners for their  own until they suddenly started to bomb them, which hampered the  liquidation of al-'Amaliqah pockets there. [passage omitted]    Eyewitnesses in Aden yesterday saw 30 southern aircraft  taking off in the direction of the positions of al-'Amaliqah in  the Abyan Governorate. Western diplomats said that was going to  be the "decisive battle to expel the northern forces from the  south." Southern sources say that an Eritrean pilot, an Iraqi  pilot, and an Egyptian pilot from the extremist groups were  being interrogated and will be shown to the Arab League  delegation. Aden television showed a family of 11, five of them  killed by indiscriminate northern shelling of al-Sharj.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK and France clash on EU aid Britain and France are fighting over their shares of Ecu30bn (Pounds 23bn) in structural aid for industrially depressed, high-unemployment regions. The funding is for so-called Objective 2 areas, judged to be in industrial decline. It is a much smaller portion of the overall Ecu156bn regional aid budget for 1994-99. Most of that goes to the four poorest member states, whereas Objective 2 funding is funnelled to the black spots in the European Union's larger economies. The problem arises because the regulations approved in July concentrate the Objective 2 pot on a maximum of 15 per cent of the EU population. Total bids put in by the 12 would cover 23 per cent of the Union's inhabitants. Commission officials say that after very hard negotiations, 10 of the member states are more or less satisfied. But the UK wants Objective 2 funding to cover 40 per cent of the British population, while France wants coverage for a third of its inhabitants. Both countries have been asked to resubmit more reasonable bids. If they do not, the Commission will be obliged to decide for them, and that would lead to serious political friction. Eligibility for the Objective 2 aid has until now required: an unemployment rate greater than the EU average; a higher percentage of industrial employment than the EU average; and a decline specifically in industrial jobs. These criteria, which are relatively easy to measure, were ratified in July. But new, more judgmental criteria, for instance on aid to rebuild inner cities, were added, complicating the share-out and stimulating over-bidding. Commission officials, however, are particularly dismissive of some of the areas on the UK's shopping list, such as the Isle of Wight and swathes of the governing Conservative party's heartland in south-east England, which they do not regard as meeting the criteria. The clash between Brussels and London and Paris could widen if the Commission makes any significant concession to the UK and France, since any extra funding they get would have to be taken from their partners.</p>

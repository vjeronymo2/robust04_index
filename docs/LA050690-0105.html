			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THEATER NOTEBOOK: DURANG'S 'LAUGHING WILD' IS A REAL HIGH-WIRE ACT  </P> <P> Christopher Durang, who gave you "Sister Mary Ignatius," "Beyond Therapy" and  "The Marriage of Bette and Boo," is back to rattle your theater senses with his  newest play, "Laughing Wild," opening Saturday at the Tiffany Theater in West  Hollywood.  </P> <P> "Like most of his writing, it's brutally funny," said director Dennis Erdman  ("How the Other Half Loves"), who also staged "Bette and Boo" at Los Angeles  Theatre Center last year. "But there's also a foundation of pain, which makes  it very hard to act. If there's too much pain on the surface, it smothers the  comedy. If there's too little, it's flaccid. So it's a fine line to travel, a  real high-wire act."  </P> <P> Walking the wire in the two-character comedy are Jean Smart of TV's "Designing  Women" and Harry Groener of "Dear John," who were also acting buddies in  college.  </P> <P> "The characters have no relation to each other on the planet except that they  both inhabit it," Erdman said. "She explodes; he implodes. She has no  boundaries; he's obsessed with boundaries. But both are struggling to survive  in a world of chaos, missed connections, injustice. . . . In the end, there are  no easy answers. The world is what the world is. But the characters are still  asking questions, trying to find a way to deal with each other. And yet the  pain is never purged."  </P> <P> And he calls this a comedy? "It is a comedy," the director said earnestly. "It  is. It really is."  </P> <P> Also this month:  </P> <P> Tonight: One middle-aged and one young married couple exchange notes on modern  gender roles in "Ruby, Ruby, Sam, Sam," opening at Hollywood's  Cast-at-the-Circle.  </P> <P> Thursday: Murder and greed are the main ingredients in the new comedy "The  Heirs," opening at the West End Playhouse in Van Nuys.  </P> <P> Friday: Mary Gallagher dramatizes the plight of illegal immigrants in the  40-character "De Donde?" (in Spanish, "Where are you from?"), opening at  Friends and Artists Theatre in Hollywood.  </P> <P> Saturday: Two yuppie couples -- one straight, one gay -- try to get past the  superficial good life in the Broadway hit "Eastern Standard," coming to the  Coast Playhouse in West Hollywood.  </P> <P> May 15: Tony Kushner's work in progress, "Millennium Approaches," exploring the  clash of a changing society and morality, opens at Taper, Too in Hollywood.  </P> <P> May 15: Santa Monica Playhouse Young Professionals Company presents "Mezzanie,"  a drama on the darker side of being a teen-ager.  </P> <P> May 16: Sam Shepard's tale of battling brothers, "True West," opens at North  Hollywood's Gnu Theatre.  </P> <P> May 18: Durang's dark, dark comedy on modern parenting, "Baby With the  Bathwater," comes to the Waterfront Stage on the Santa Monica Pier.  </P> <P> May 19: Len Jenkin's "Dark Ride," a theatrical journey through the human  unconscious, opens at Beyond Baroque in Venice.  </P> <P> May 21: Closed on Broadway but back in Hollywood, the Michael Bennett/Marvin  Hamlisch award-winning musical "A Chorus Line" opens at Las Palmas Theatre.  </P> <P> May 23: "The Glass Menagerie," Tennessee Williams' tender story of Laura  Wingfield and her gentleman caller, is revived at East West Players in  Hollywood.  </P> <P> May 24: Lovers pop out of each other's hearts -- and beds -- in Timothy Mason's  contemporary romantic comedy, "Only You," opening at 2nd Stage in Hollywood.  </P> <P> May 25: "The Pixley Caper," Dan Roth's affectionate takeoff on the '40s-style  detective novels of Raymond Chandler, opens at the Attic Theatre in Hollywood.  </P> <P> May 25: Chicago's offbeat igLoo, the Theatrical Group arrives with Paul  Peditto's "A Fire Was Burning Over the Dumpling House One Chinese New Year," at  6543 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood.  </P></p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / German employment prospects look up The Bonn government's election campaign was given a further lift yesterday by an upbeat assessment of employment prospects from the federal labour office. Although the west German seasonally adjusted jobless total rose last month for the first time since May, and the number of long-term unemployed reached a record high, a decline of 71,000 in the unadjusted figure for the whole country was welcomed as 'most pleasing' by Mr Berhard Jagoda, labour office president. The seasonally adjusted jobless total in the west rose 4,000 after falling 18,000 in July, while the unadjusted figure in the east (the only data published) fell 31,000. On the basis of unadjusted figures, the western unemployment rate fell from 8.3 to 8.2 per cent, while the eastern rate declined from 15.1 to 14.7 per cent. The usual post-holiday fall in unemployment was far more marked than in earlier years, and the jobs market was responding more quickly to the economic recovery than 'experts' had forecast, Mr Jagoda added. Labour office officials said their own budget estimate of 400,000 new benefit registrations this year was no longer valid, and expected further improvements as the year advanced. The present pan-German unemployment total is some 250,000 higher than a year ago. August also saw a sharp fall in numbers working short-time and an increase in registered vacancies in both parts of the country. However, Mr Jagoda said he was concerned that a third of those without work had been jobless for more than a year, and urged companies to take on more employees rather than pay for overtime. Even last year, in the depths of recession, the average employee put in 59 hours of overtime, equivalent to more than 800,000 full-time jobs, according to Mr Jagoda. Industrial order data for July, also published yesterday, showed the economy was still recovering, although at a more modest pace than in recent months. Manufacturing orders increased by a provisional 0.7 per cent, following a revised 2.8 per cent rise in June. While domestic demand rose 1.8 per cent, foreign bookings slipped by 1.2 per cent. However, overall orders were still 8 per cent higher than in July last year. Economists suggested the strength of the D-Mark might be starting to affect exports, while the weakness of the US currency appeared to be reducing American orders for German cars.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Bush and Clinton wins send signal on Nafta THE victories of President Bush and Governor Bill Clinton in Tuesday's Michigan and Illinois presidential primaries have sent a signal to negotiators to push on with the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Despite protectionist rhetoric from their opponents, both candidates held firm in support of the pact, though Mr Clinton said it must be 'the right kind of Nafta', with labour and environment rules. On Tuesday, Mr Bush spoke by phone with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Canada's premier Brian Mulroney. A US trade representative spokesman said the US and Mexican leaders 'reaffirmed their commitment to Nafta'. Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, said last week the negotiators had been making remarkable progress and a preliminary text could be sent to Congress for review this year. Mr Mulroney said 'agreement in principle is possible once several matters of substance are resolved'. Problems remain on cars, energy, financial services and agriculture, but the US and Mexico are near accord on a domestic-content rule they believe would set up a North American clothes-making area competitive with Asian producers. The Mexican presidency said the three leaders thought the talks were moving 'at a satisfactory pace'. Their teams would keep meeting to close an agreement. Top negotiators meet in Washington on March 23.</p>

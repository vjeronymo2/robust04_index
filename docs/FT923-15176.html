			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / International Company News: Irregularities stall DKr2bn rights issue HAFNIA HOLDING, which controls Denmark's second-largest insurance group, yesterday postponed trading in a new rights issue. The issue was intended to raise DKr2bn (Dollars 344m) and is vital to the company's plans to strengthen its financial base. The postponement follows the revelation on Wednesday that through an options deal, which Hafnia's board claims was unauthorised, the group has been forced to take 73 per cent of the shares in Interbank, a small bank. The options deal has cost Hafnia DKr288m. Hafnia yesterday also said that it is looking into other possible irregularities. The group's board spent yesterday in discussions with the bankers and the institutional investors which have guaranteed the new share issue. Mr Holger Laveson, the chairman, last night said that the discussions have gone satisfactorily but are not complete. A full statement will be made today. Meanwhile, Copenhagen brokers Carnegie, which is one of the brokers establishing the options deal, said that in its view the deal was valid and that it expected Hafnia to honour it.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Cresson survives but suffers from growing discontent AS expected, France's conservative opposition parties failed in their attempt this week to bring down the Socialist government of Mrs Edith Cresson, when their censure motion on its handling of the George Habash scandal fell far short of the required parliamentary majority. But Mrs Cresson's government cannot easily shrug off the political damage caused by the controversy over the ostensibly unauthorised hospitalisation in Paris of the Palestinian leader. The affair has undoubtedly added to the popular discontent with the administration of President Mitterrand. Winding up the debate with a combative defence of the government's record, Mrs Cresson called on her socialist supporters to mobilise 'for the next 400 days', to be ready for the general elections scheduled for the spring of next year. It was a forceful performance, but the critical date for Mrs Cresson's government is not 400 days away, but less than 40, in the local and regional elections of March 22. At the best of times, the socialists would expect to be handicapped in these elections, weighted in favour of the rural vote and conservative local forces. But to judge from recent opinion polls, that verdict is likely to be severe. The socialists' share of the vote may slide to below an average of 20 per cent. If that happens, they could no longer claim to be the largest single party in France. The pressure on President Mitterrand to replace Mrs Cresson with, say, Mr Jacques Delors, President of the European Commission, might then become intense. It might become hard to resist pressure for early general elections. Socialist support in the Rhone-Alpes region, according to a survey by the BVA polling institute, is likely to fall to 18 per cent, 10 percentage points less than in the previous regional elections of 1986. In the Auvergne region, the socialist vote could drop from 30.8 per cent to 19.5 per cent. In the Ile de France region round Paris, the Socialist vote would drop even further, to 16 per cent, compared with 28.6 per cent in 1986.</p>

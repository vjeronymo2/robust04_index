[Suarez] Good morning, how are you?    [Naranjo] Well, I woke you up early once again. We were  unable to make the connection on Sunday [22 January], but here  we are now. I want to convey greetings on behalf of the people  from Las Tunas and from Cuba as a whole, who remember you with  great gratitude.    Reverend, we understand that you and singer-composer Silvio  Rodriguez have been invited to participate in a day of protest  against the blockade in the United States. Can you tell us  something about this invitation?    [Suarez] This invitation was extended by Teresa Gutierrez  and  former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who have planned this  activity, first, to convey once again the international opinion  against the U.S. blockade against Cuba; and second, to a certain  extent, to stage a demonstration of support to the bill that  Charles Rangel, representative from Harlem in New York, will  submit within the next few days, between 10 and 12 February. He  proposes free communications with Cuba, which would represent a  blow to the Torricelli law, a law we have endured for so many  years. The invitation is for me, together with Rev. Lucius  Walker, Ramsey Clark, Teresa Gutierrez, and Bishop Gumbleton, to  speak on the occasion. They want me to speak at this event.  Silvio will support the cultural part of the event in addition  to other activities they have planned. The invitation also  includes....    [Naranjo, interrupting] I would like to ask another brief  question. Have there been any difficulties concerning the  issuance of visas to enter the United States?    [Suarez] Both Silvio and I have requested visas from the  U.S.  Interests Section in Havana. At first, they said there would be  no problems; but then they told me that my application would be  sent to the State Department in Washington and that I should  have an answer in three and four weeks. So, I am waiting for an  answer. [passage omitted]</p>

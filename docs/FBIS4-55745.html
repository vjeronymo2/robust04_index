			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ferenc Kulin, head of the parliamentary </F> group and deputy chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, by  Tibor J. Keri; place and date not given: "The MDF's Tone Did  Not Prove To Be Expedient"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Keri] According to the  election results, the whole society has rejected your party,  when the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of  Free Democrats [SZDSZ] won the first round everywhere....    [Kulin] You should not say more than the figures show, and  the figures show that almost 70 percent of the citizens  participated in the vote, including more than 30 percent who  voted in favor of the MSZP. This shows that our society is  equally divided into socialist, liberal, and national trends.    [Keri] In your opinion, what did the MDF do wrong in the  past four years?    [Kulin] The reasons for the defeat of the MDF and of the  coalition are not subjective. The process of change in the  regime in the whole region is taking place much more slowly and  with more conflicts than society expected. It is almost an  automatic development that the parties carrying out the change  in the regime in our region lose the elections.    [Keri] The MDF and the government have often been accused of  arrogance, haughtiness, "mission-awareness," and lack of  sensitivity in the past years.    [Kulin] These accusations of arrogance and loftiness were  created by the mass media. However, I admit that the MDF  leaders were crude to the press and some intellectual circles  from the very beginning, but not with society and the common  people. Therefore, it is not true that the government led by  the late Jozsef Antall disregarded the people or the citizens.  It is, however, true that the MDF turned its back and became  rude to those who wrote and spoke of the MDF with hatred even  before the 1990 elections. The accusations of arrogance  originate from this circle of journalists, and some Hungarian  intellectuals picked up this accusation, people who had lost  their public offices in the wake of the change in the regime. I  would look for the mistakes somewhere else. The tone with which  we addressed the society did not prove to be expedient. [passage  omitted]    [Keri] In your view, did the negative television campaign  against the MSZP chairman influence voters? Did the dismissals  carried out in the Hungarian Radio have any effect on the  election results?    [Kulin] I am very curious to know, but I cannot judge this.  I would welcome a thorough and objective opinion poll about  these issues. My personal experiences are controversial: A  similar number of people agreed with those dismissals and said  that it harmed the MDF. As for the MSZP and its chairman, Gyula  Horn, he must be aware that his name and his past symbolize  forces that constantly led to conflicts in Hungarian political  life.    [Keri] In your view, what can we expect from the Hungarian  Radio and Hungarian Television after the elections? What can  the heads of News, Panorama, or Sunday News expect, programs  that the public regards as too ardently pro-government?    [Kulin] I firmly believe that a new phase of the media war  is beginning now. Obviously, the political forces which now  have the right to make personnel decisions will reorganize the  leadership of these two institutions in accordance with their  taste and will.    [Keri] The present government also formed the media  according to its own image....    [Kulin] No, it failed to do so. The ideas and the balance  of intellectual forces that emerged in the past 40 years have  such a preponderance in the media that the changes that  pro-government leaders could make were only the tip of the  iceberg. The News, Panorama, and other programs can only be  regarded as the tip of the iceberg.    [Keri] Will there be scapegoats for the expected election  defeat of the MDF? Do you think that you might be such a  scapegoat, since you were the one who worked out the party's  program?    [Kulin] I do not think so because I do not believe that the  program decided the fate of the party. I believe, of course,  that an analysis of responsibility, including personal  responsibility, will take place in the party. Nor do I think  that the defeat could lead to a split in the party. It is  possible, however, that, after the establishment of the new  parliament, the leading bodies of the MDF will offer the  possibility of personnel changes at the national meeting.</p>

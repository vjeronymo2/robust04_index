			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Government communique issued on 23 February; place not </F> given]    [Text] Following the second round of the legislative  elections, public order is being disturbed in various  prefectures, as well Lome district, by some irresponsible  citizens who are perpetrating acts of violence and vandalism  here and there thus threatening the security of people and  property.    The government hereby condemns these blind and undemocratic  acts of violence and launches an urgent appeal to all opposition  party leaders and all citizens to help create an atmosphere of  tolerance that would guarantee freedom of speech for all, and  thus prevent our dear motherland from becoming a closed field of  sterile political struggle at a time when all states in the  subregion are preoccupied by the economic problems caused by the  devaluation of the CFA franc.    Our country Togo gives the impression of prioritizing the  political debate to the detriment of the daily difficulties  facing the majority of our people. The government, in its  concern to protect our common interest, will take all necessary  measures to maintain public order and to assure the security of  people and property throughout the national territory. Firm  instructions have been given to the security forces to prevent  all disturbances and to deal with all troublemakers in our  cities and villages. They will be sought after and brought to  court.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dispatch by Basim Abu-Sumayyah from the occupied territory] </F>   [Text] Israeli and Palestinian sources have stressed that  Israel and the PLO reached a final draft agreement to implement  the Gaza-Jericho accord yesterday while meeting in Davos.  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres are expected to meet in Cairo in 10 days  to sign the agreement.    Israeli sources said that the two sides are drafting the  technical details of the agreement, which should begin to be  implemented within the next two weeks. These sources added that  the Davos draft agreement includes the following points:    -- Israel's demands and security requirements will be  guaranteed;    -- Israel will control road junctions in the Gaza Strip;    -- Only Israeli police will carry out searches at the  border crossings. Palestinian police will be present at these  crossings;    -- The two sides will reach an understanding on the size  of the Jericho area so that this matter will not constitute an  obstacle in the talks. Israel will be flexible in this regard;    -- The citizens of the self-rule area will be able to move  freely to the al-Nabi Musa, near Jericho, and al-Maghtis, on the  Jordan River, to perform religious rites only;    -- The Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho will have access  to the joint recreation area to be built between the Israelis  and the Palestinians on the Dead Sea;    -- The passages leading to these areas will remain under  Israeli military control;    -- Special passages for the self-rule residents to move  about without restriction will be established. These passages  will ultimately be linked to a highway linking Amman to the  self-rule area across the King 'Abdallah Bridge.    -- Israel will have the right to protest the entry of  suspect Palestinians; and    -- Special Israeli search rooms will be created at the  border crossings. The Palestinian police will not be allowed in  these search rooms.</p>

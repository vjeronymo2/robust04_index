			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend pleases The market gave approval to BICC's preliminary numbers which, although slightly below expectations on the pre-tax profits figure, gave encouragement to investors due to a maintained dividend. 'The numbers were clean, there were no funnies and there was evidence of a recovery in the Australian business; all very good news for investors,' was the view of one leading electricals specialist. He did, however, qualify the good news by pointing out that the widely accepted slowdown in the continental European economies would have a substantial effect on the cables business in Europe. BICC shares galloped ahead from the outset, outpacing the electricals index and the wider market to close a further 21 up at 366p; turnover of 10m was the highest single day's business since last October.</p>

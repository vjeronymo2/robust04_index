			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The United States has begun to adopt a flexible  attitude on the issue of setting numerical trade targets. A  senior Foreign Ministry official on 21 December commented on the  apparent change in the U.S. stance.    He said: "It is a feint operation. There is no change in  the U.S. belief in the importance of trade results. American  experts and the media have criticized the way the United States  has pushed for numerical targets as a way of seeking managed  trade. The United States is probably shying away from using the  term numerical targets in the face of this criticism."    He continued: "The substance of the U.S. policy of attaching  more importance to trade results than on the market opening  process, and of pressing Japan to raise the share of foreign  goods in the Japanese market to levels comparable with the rest  of the G-7 nations, remains unchanged."</p>

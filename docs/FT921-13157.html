			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Argentina tries to draw in ex-Soviet migrants ARGENTINA wants to attract thousands of migrants from the former Soviet Union to populate the country's vast interior. Officials even hope that the migrants will bring millions of dollars in investment capital with them. 'We are considering immigrants who would bring capital to dynamise the economy. We are talking with the European Community to provide credits for potential migrants to settle and create companies in Argentina,' said Mr Geraldo Molnes, the interior ministry's population secretary. Argentina is the second Latin American country to offer to take such migrants. Venezuela said at the weekend it was seeking some with scientific and technical skills. Argentina covers an area the size of India but a third of the population is in Buenos Aires, leaving most of Patagonia - the far south - sparsely inhabited. Populating Patagonia has obssessed Argentine officialdom since it took control of the region early in this century, but the comforts of city life in Buenos Aires have been generally preferred to the distant steppes. Mr Molnes hopes any newcomers will go to Patagonia and to small cities in the interior. The government hopes immigrants will begin arriving at a rate of 20,000 a year and quickly reach 100,000 a year. Mr Molnes denied that Argentina was discriminating against dark-skinned immigrants from nearby countries in favour of Europeans. An EC diplomat, though, poured cold water on the notion: 'They have not made a formal approach yet. In any case, some of us do not trust the Argentines, who give the impression of just wanting the money. Others, especially the Germans, say it amounts to trade in human lives. It could be done tastefully, but I doubt anything will come of it.'</p>

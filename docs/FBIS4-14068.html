			<p>BFN     [Text] The government today made it clear that there is no  change in its stand on the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  [NPT]. The parliamentary affairs minister, Mr. V.C. Shukla,  told the Lok Sabha that India's policy is consistent that the  treaty should be universal and nondiscriminatory. He was  responding when several opposition leaders demanded that the  government should make its position clear in view of the  reported U.S. pressure for convening a regional conference on  the issue. Raising the matter during zero hour, Mr. Chandrajit  Yadav, Janata Dal, said the government should not agree to  anything which will stop the research and development work for  peaceful uses of nuclear energy.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / US Money and Credit: Treasuries suffer from the jitters THE US Treasury bond market is most definitely suffering from a case of the jitters, and there are indications the bearish sentiment will continue this week. Last Friday saw a sharp fall in the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, with the  7/8 of a point drop - to 99 17/32 - sending the yield on the paper up above the 8 per cent mark again, to 8.04 per cent. The price on Friday was still  5/16 higher on the week, but the emerging negative trend seems likely to continue. The nervousness stems from mounting fears among investors that the US economic recovery will be stronger and faster than had been previously anticipated. Good news for the US economy means bad news for the bond market, and investor concerns about recovery and fiscal stimuli resulting in more inflation are producing higher interest rates in the market. It does not seem to matter to market psychology that top US officials are on the record as brushing aside any serious concern about inflationary pressure. Nor does it seem relevant to the knee-jerk bond market that few economists or bankers actually expect much beyond a very gradual and fragile US recovery. Equally, the market is still worried about an election year tax cut that could worsen the already horrific US budget deficit. But last Friday's presidential veto of a Democratic tax package describes the situation perfectly - a highly partisan battle of words between Mr Bush and the Democrats that is resulting in a prolonged period of inaction rather than fiscally dangerous decision-making. While in Washington, an overly optimistic Mr Nicholas Brady, the Treasury Secretary, suggested last week that the recovery is now here, many economists in New York are less bullish. Mr Philip Braverman, chief economist at DKB Securities, noted that the US economy remains vulnerable to new recessionary setbacks, possibly stemming from major real estate, bank and insurance company bankruptcies. Mr Braverman also warned that the perception of an economic pick-up is due to a combination of transitory factors, inflated by inappropriate seasonal adjustments. The market's response to such common sense caution is a great big 'So what]' Something of a panic has hit a large number of the narrow-minded and short-term denizens of the Treasury bond market. A few indications of an improving retail sector started the ball rolling. Never mind that one or two statistical indicators do not a roaring retail recovery make. Then, on Friday morning, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's monthly regional survey also indicated an improving trend - helping to trigger Friday's sell-off. This week the bond traders will be glued to their Reuter monitors once again, watching a stream of more data and once again confusing the forest with the trees. On Wednesday, for example, the latest numbers on durable goods orders could show a 4 to 5 per cent increase. Secondary home sales figures for February could meanwhile show a 7 or 8per cent rise. If those two numbers are not enough to spook the market, then personal income and spending figures on Friday should do the trick. These, respectively, are expected to show improvements of 0.4 per cent and 0.7 per cent. In this environment, the market will also be keeping a weather eye on the Treasury's expected auction of Dollars 14.75bn in two-year notes and Dollars 10.25bn in five-year notes. Ms Maria Ramirez, the bond analyst, said a coupon of 5 7/8 or even 6 per cent may be required to attract investor interest, which would suggest the highest level since last October. The bottom line would seem to be that the US recovery may well be getting under way, but not nearly so fast as the statistic watchers fear. Whether such common sense matters to bond traders is quite another matter.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US MONEY MARKET RATES (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Last   1 week   4 wks   12-month   12-month                            Friday      ago     ago       High        Low  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fed Funds (weekly average)   3.75     3.63    3.75      11.00       2.00 Three-month Treasury bills   4.15     4.14    4.02       8.29       3.76 Six-month Treasury bills     4.37     4.36    4.18       7.70       3.89 Three-month prime CDs        4.32     4.38    4.25       7.17       4.01 30-day Commercial Paper      4.23     4.25    4.20       7.12       3.90 90-day Commercial Paper      4.30     4.30    4.20       7.02       3.92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US BOND PRICES AND YIELDS (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Last   Change             1 week      4 wk.

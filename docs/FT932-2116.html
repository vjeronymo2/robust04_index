			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Serbs set Krajina on course for union REBEL Serb leaders from Croatia said yesterday that their weekend referendum on the union of their self-styled state with other Serb-held territory was the 'final act' towards the creation of a new Serb state. Elsewhere, Sarajevo radio reported fierce fighting between Croat and mainly Moslem Bosnian troops in four towns in central Bosnia as United Nations commanders played down the threat by a Moslem commander in Tuzla, the north-eastern industrial city, to unleash toxic chlorine to 'neutralise all living forces in almost all Europe'. Local officials of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), Serb-held territory which covers about a third of Croatia, yesterday confirmed a high turnout for the two-day poll. The overwhelming majority was expected to vote Yes on union with Srpska Republika, the self-proclaimed Serb state in Bosnia, with the option to unite later with Serbia and Montenegro, the remaining members of Yugoslavia. The RSK comprises three enclaves of Croatian territory seized by rebel Serbs during Croatia's 1991 war of independence from former Yugoslavia. Mr Milan Babic, the mayor of Knin, the stronghold of the RSK, said: 'This is the final act of carrying out the people's will. The rest is up to the politicians.' The referendum was held amid warnings by Serb leaders that Croatia would cross UN lines to prevent the vote. Mr Nikica Valentic, Croatian prime minister, said Zagreb would not intervene to stop the referendum, and called for a diplomatic solution to the Krajina question. Meanwhile, a 10-lorry UN convoy carrying food and medicine yesterday headed for Gorazde, one of six UN-designated safe areas, and the UN resumed its humanitarian airlift to Sarajevo. Mr Milan Panic, former Yugoslav prime minister, arrived in Belgrade yesterday to meet Serbian opposition leaders, aides said, Reuter reports from Belgrade. His return on a visit from the US coincides with an outcry in Serbia and abroad over the police beating and arrest of Mr Vuk Draskovic, opposition leader. Mr Panic is seen in Serbia as the only serious contender for power against President Slobodan Milosevic.</p>

			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Cookery: Ginger up your new year cake - Philippa Davenport guards against bad luck GINGER IS said to bring good luck. Will the eating of it early in 1993 lessen the chances of another annus horribilis, I wonder? In the hope that it will, I am planning to eat a good deal of it on Twelfth Night. This sheds new light on the notion of going gingerly into the new year. The easiest way to guard against bad luck might simply be to crack open a porcelain jar of stem ginger in syrup and treat it like a fondue: give everyone a fork for spearing the nuggets and offer bowls of whipped cream or creme fraiche for dipping, and squares of best bitter chocolate (Black &amp; Green's) to nibble on the side. I also like the idea of making an Italianate ginger trifle - using panettone instead of sponge cake, Marsala as the booze, and a mixture of sliced stem ginger, segments of clementine and well toasted hazelnuts under billowing layers of custard and cream. Already a festive favourite in this household is a ginger cake made along lines traditional in Cumberland, Westmorland and Yorkshire. In those areas celebratory dishes are often laced with such ingredients as rum, molasses and all manner of spices. These recipes are a link to the flourishing trade in times past with the West Indies and Far East, and they serve as a reminder that Whitehaven was once one of the most important ports in Britain. Old cake recipes like the one which follows are often known as pepper cake, rather than ginger cake. This may be because freshly ground black peppercorns are sometimes included for extra aroma and heat. It is more likely, I think, to stem from the more frequent inclusion of Jamaica pepper. This is the small brown berry native to Jamaica, a little larger than than a peppercorn and not actually a true pepper at all, better known today as allspice. Its name derives from the fact that it is thought to have something in its aroma of cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg combined. A cake like this will only taste as good as it should if allowed to mature for four or five days between baking and eating. So there is no time to lose. Make it today and serve it on Twelfth Night for a lucky 1993. Serve it for tea, sliced just as it is or spread with butter. Or, for a delicious pudding, top fingers of the cake with whipped cream or creme fraiche and serve them alongside a dish of Cox's Orange Pippins or Kidd's Orange Reds cut into crescent moon slices and fried in butter until gilded and sizzling hot. YORKSHIRE PEPPER CAKE Heat the oven to 325oF (170oC) gas mark 3. Butter a deep 8 in sq cake tin and line the base with buttered greaseproof paper. Stir together in a large bowl 6 oz plain flour, 2 oz rye flour (or wholemeal in the absence of rye flour), 1 1/2 teaspoons bicarbonate of soda, 1 tablespoon ground ginger, 1 1/2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon ground Jamaican pepper (in other words allspice) and  1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Make a well in the centre. Mix together in a separate small bowl some stem ginger chopped into small pieces and some sultanas or dates, 7 oz in all, say 4 oz ginger and 3 oz sultanas or dates. Sultanas add juicy sweetness. Dates, which should be stoned and chopped, give the cake a delicious fudgey quality. Dice 4 oz butter into a saucepan. Drizzle over the fat 6 oz each strong dark honey, such as heather, and black treacle. (If preferred the 12 oz of sweetener can be made up of equal weights of unrefined brown sugar, honey and black treacle.) Warm gently over low heat, stirring now and again, until the butter has melted and the ingredients are blended. Set the pan aside to cool the contents a little while you break 2 eggs into a cup and mix into them with a fork 2 tablespoons milk. Then pour the warm butter and treacle mixture into the bowl of spiced flour, and beat with a wooden spoon until smooth and glossy, gradually adding in the beaten eggs. Stir in the chopped ginger and sultanas or dates. Turn the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for about 70 minutes. Cool on a rack and wrap tightly as soon as cold in fresh greaseproof paper and foil. Store for four days before eating.</p>

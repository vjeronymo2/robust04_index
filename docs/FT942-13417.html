			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / International Company News: Overseas sales bolster profits at Kellogg Kellogg, the US breakfast cereal manufacturer, reported an underlying 6 per cent increase in net income, to Dollars 183.7m, for the first quarter. The rise came in spite of lower cereal volumes in its domestic market. Mr Arnold Langbo, chairman and chief executive, said cereal volumes in the US fell from the previous year's levels because of inventory reductions and competitive price-promotion early this year. Profits were driven by improved operations globally, Mr Langbo said. He said there was volume growth in cereals in Europe, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, and growth in convenience foods in North America. Turnover rose 6 per cent, to Dollars 1.61bn from Dollars 1.52bn, with global volume up 2 per cent. Stated net earnings rose by less than 3 per cent, to Dollars 183.9m from Dollars 179.2m, but both figures included one-time revenues and charges. Excluding these items, earnings per share rose by 9 per cent to 81 cents, a figure boosted by the company's stock repurchase scheme. Kellogg, like other US makers of premium cereal brands, has been fighting tough competition in its domestic market from cheaper products and own-label brands.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, it became clear that an exercise of discretion was almost unavoidable in determining whether a violation was minor. This was inherent in the view that the specific circumstances, along with the kind of violation, were critical in determining whether or not it was minor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, the option of listing all or nearly all minor violations in the regulations would result in a list that was either too long or too short to be of significant value. It would also not provide a mechanism for channeling the exercise of discretion that appears inherent in the decision on whether a violation is minor, and consequently would not appear to foster national consistency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A second option considered by EPA would define as minor those violations limited to particular categories of regulatory requirements (e.g., recordkeeping, reporting, labeling, monitoring, workpractice standards, etc.). This option, however, exhibits the same basic problems as the first option. Here again, violations within these broad categories could be considered significant or minor depending on the circumstances. This second approach still did not provide a method for determining when a violation in one of the broad categories would be considered minor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the importance of the specific circumstances of a violation in categorizing it as significant or minor, EPA considered and is today proposing a third option. In today <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s proposal a minor violation would be defined as one that is minor in nature, in light of a list of factors that must be considered as a whole. This list contains such factors as whether the violation is readily recognizable by an officer or employee of EPA; the risk and degree of environmental harm resulting from the violation; the time, effort, or expense required to correct the violation; the frequency and duration of the violation; and the importance of the violated requirement to the regulatory program. For example, determinations that the violation is manifest; that it poses little risk of environmental harm; that it has not been identified in a previous enforcement action against the respondent; that it occurred once or only for a short period of time; or that correcting it should require little time, effort, or expense would be indicators of the minor nature of a violation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA recognizes that this list is not exhaustive of all factors that may be relevant to whether a violation is minor in nature. Therefore, the definition includes a provision for consideration of other appropriate factors. However, the list is indicative of the types of factors that EPA will consider in determining whether a violation is minor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While EPA considers these factors as relevant to determining whether or not a violation is minor in nature, information may not be available on all of these factors when decisions are made regarding the propriety of issuing a field citation. If information is not available for any of the factors noted in the proposed list of factors, then that factor would be treated as neutral on the issue of whether a violation is minor in nature. In addition, EPA <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s proposal calls for evaluating the factors as a whole. Specific requirements are not proposed for each of the factors individually, i.e., EPA has not proposed a specific time requirement for ``duration of violation'' or a dollar amount for ``expense required to correct a violation.'' The specific circumstances of the violation would be considered in light of all of these factors taken as a whole.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A final factor has been added to the definition of minor violation to make clear that EPA reserves all rights to determine the appropriate enforcement response to a violation. A violation is not a minor violation under the definition proposed today unless it is minor in nature as described above, and unless the Agency, in its descretion, decides to address it as a minor violation. This is to make it clear that the field citation regulations proposed today do not provide a basis for respondents to claim that an alleged violation is minor in nature and therefore EPA's only available enforcement mechanism is issuance of a field citation. Today's proposed regulations are not intended to limit in any way EPA's ability to fully exercise its enforcement discretion. The Agency reserves the right to determine what, if any, enforcement approach is appropriate in a specific case. EPA believes this is consistent with Congressional intent for the field citation program, as section 113(d)(3) provides that ``[t]he Administrator may implement *&blank;*&blank;* a field citation program through regulations establishing appropriate minor violations for which field citations *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> may <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  be issued by officers or employees designated by the Administrator.''

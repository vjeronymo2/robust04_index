			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BULGARIAN HARD-LINERS PURGED  </P> <P> The Communist Party at a hastily called meeting of the Central Committee  expelled more of the old guard from its leadership Friday in the second purge  of top party posts in four weeks.  </P> <P> Dropped were six hard-liners in the Politburo and 26 members of the  policy-making Central Committee, including former leader Todor Zhivkov, who was  ousted as party chief on Nov. 10.  </P> <P> The committee's actions are seen as strengthening the hand of new Bulgarian  leader Petar Mladenov in his push toward democratic reform.  </P> <P> Friday's unannounced meeting also struck from the committee's record an  expression of thanks made to Zhivkov for his leadership. Zhivkov ran Bulgaria  in a rigid, Stalinist fashion for 35 years and is currently under investigation  for corruption.  </P></p>

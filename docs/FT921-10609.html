			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Hills reticent on time-scale for Nafta deal MRS Carla Hills, US trade representative, ended a two-day trip to Mexico without offering any clear commitment that a North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) would be presented to Congress this year, only saying: 'If we get a good agreement, I think it will be presented (before the US elections).' She would not comment on what constituted a good agreement, nor how likely it was one would be reached.

Mr Albert Bustamente, a Texan congressman, stressed the uncertainty over prospects of a Nafta when he said an accord might not be reached this year, but could be wrapped up in two or three years. Mr Jim Kolbe, a congressman from New Mexico, said the elections and weak state of the US economy could delay signing of the treaty. Despite uncertainty over when a treaty will be presented to Congress, the trade negotiators are still working to resolve remaining differences, currently meeting in Ottawa. Mexican officials, who earlier said a completed draft could be ready by January, now say it will be ready by the end of this month or in early March. This raises the prospect that a completed treaty will be initialled in the next few months. But speculation is growing that President Bush, citing lack of time, would wait until after the elections before presenting the document to Congress. Mrs Hills' remarks have not dispelled that speculation. This would be thought acceptable by the Mexican authorities, who would have something concrete to show for the enormous political and economic risk President Carlos Salinas de Gortari took in proposing a free trade agreement in June 1990. Mrs Hills and members of her delegation met President Salinas and the ministers of trade, finance, agriculture, ecology and labour. She described her visit as 'not at all a negotiation, 'a very good 30 hours.'</p>

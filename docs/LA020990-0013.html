			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NO GIMMIES ON THIS GOLF COURSE  </P> <P> The burglary detectives quietly shadowed the suspicious truck as it made its  way slowly through a Van Nuys commercial and residential area. The truck made a  U-turn, cut its lights and finally pulled over. Two men in black rubber diving  suits got out with a knapsack and disappeared into the darkness.  </P> <P> For the detectives, suspicion turned to excitement. It was 3 a.m. and they  believed they had stumbled onto a caper in progress. The two dark figures came  back with a full knapsack and dumped it in the back of the truck in the 5700  block of Valjean Avenue.  </P> <P> Backup officers were called. The truck was stopped. Flashlight beams dipped  into the back. There was the booty, too much to even count: more than 1,000  wet, slightly used and allegedly stolen golf balls.  </P> <P> The scene of the crime: the pond along the fourth fairway at Van Nuys Golf  Course.  </P> <P> "We were so disappointed," Los Angeles Police Detective Richard Weaver said.  "We thought we really had something a little more serious going on. It was just  golf balls."  </P> <P> Ryan Hefley, 24, of Pomona and Scott McQueen, 25, of La Mesa were arrested on  suspicion of theft. A third man in the truck was questioned but released  because he did not take part in the midnight swim.  </P> <P> The golf balls rightfully belong to the course, police said. Course starter  Jack Parrett said employees periodically harvest the pond and sell the balls  for as much as $1.25 each. "If you take several hundred, you are talking about  a lot of money," Parrett said.  </P> <P> Weaver said the suspects told investigators that they had earned extra money  for five years by moonlight diving at golf courses throughout the West.  </P> <P> The balls were seized as evidence. Hefley and McQueen remained in jail late  Thursday in lieu of $250 bail each.  </P> <P> "They are still sitting there in their wet suits," Weaver said.  </P></p>

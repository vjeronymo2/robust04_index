			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Borrowing hits Pounds 683m as recovery strengthens: Consumer lending rises while factory prices remain subdued Subdued price rises at the factory gate and buoyant consumer borrowing figures provided fresh evidence yesterday that April's tax increases have so far not upset steady growth with low inflation in Britain. The Central Statistical Office reported that the prices charged by UK manufacturers for their products rose by only 1.9 per cent in the year to July - the lowest increase since December 1986 - while net borrowing by consumers to cover current purchases of goods and services grew by a record Pounds 683m in June. The two sets of statistics reinforced the impression that the UK is enjoying an unusually benign recovery from the recession of the early 1990s. Among yesterday's good news, the CSO reported that the 'core rate' of output price inflation, which excludes food, beverages, tobacco and petroleum, also increased by only 1.9 per cent in the year to July: its lowest rise for nearly 27 years. But at the same time, it announced that prices for industry's raw materials and fuel rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent between June and July after a sharp 1.3 per cent increase in June. Treasury officials hailed the drop in annual output price inflation from 2.1 per cent in June as encouraging. The Confederation of British Industry said it highlighted the competitive nature of the UK's post-recession economy. But some City economists warned that the Bank of England was still likely to push for an increase in bank base rates from 5.25 per cent in the months ahead. 'There are signs that gains in input prices and manufacturers' price expectations are starting to feed through (into output prices),' said Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist of Salomon Brothers International in London. 'The drop in the year-on-year rate of output price inflation will not prevent a rate increase in the next few months, and probably in September,' he added. Economists at James Capel, the UK stockbroker, said they thought base rates might rise in October. Yet, although yesterday's credit figures showed the biggest monthly gain in net lending to consumers since figures were first collected in the 1980s, there was little sign of concern in the Treasury that they might signal a re-igniting of inflation. Officials pointed out that June's Pounds 683m increase in net lending followed weak net lending of Pounds 208m in May. The CBI pointed out, in addition, that the record increase in net lending coincided with heavy price discounting at the start of the summer sale. An indication that strong consumer borrowing continued into July came yesterday from Barclaycard, which said its turnover increased by 10 per cent in the year to July after growing by 7 per cent in the year to June.

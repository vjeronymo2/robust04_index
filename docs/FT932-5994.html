			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Number of Lloyd's agencies 'to fall sharply' THE NUMBER of agencies at Lloyd's of London is set to fall sharply as new corporate investors demand much higher standards of advice and service, a new report has concluded. Mr Oliver Laughton-Scott, director of De Lisle Jessup Scott, the insurance consultancy which prepared the report, said: 'This is Lloyd's big bang.' Lloyd's announced at the end of April that it hoped to attract incorporated capital by the start of next year as part of its new business plan. It is preparing a rulebook which will outline the terms on which 'incorporated Names' - which will trade on the basis of limited liability - can participate. The report suggests that the number of members' agencies - which handle the affairs of the individual Names who provide the market's capital - at the market could eventually fall to as low as eight. Seventy members' agents traded at Lloyd's last year, compared with 83 in 1991. The report suggests corporate investors will demand rigorous information about the market when they choose which of the market's 200 or more syndicates to support. Members' agents and Lloyd's advisers will need to be big enough to bear the costs of providing necessary analytical and advisory services and maintain a broad spread of investors. 'The requirement for a higher standard of analysis is likely to put smaller members' agents under increasing pressure,' the report says. It suggests that agencies which combine members' and managing agent functions - where they both look after the Names who provide the market's capital and manage syndicates - will find it increasingly difficult to survive. The number of so-called 'combined agencies' fell from 37 in 1991 to 32 last year. Pointing to the ability of combined agencies to sustain their own syndicates by channelling capital towards them, the report says new corporate investors 'will be more alert to the inherent conflicts of interest' and 'are likely to require firmer safeguards'. Additionally, members' agents which are part of combined agencies may find access to detailed information from rival managing agents more difficult than independent members' agents, it says. The report is sceptical of Lloyd's ability to ration capacity available to new investors through an auction or bidding system. 'The proposed auction system will require investors to bid for participation without being able to guarantee participation on specific syndicates. This will prove unacceptable to potential investors,' the report says.</p>

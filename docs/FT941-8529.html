			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / German move triggers further rate cuts The Bundesbank's interest rate cut on Thursday triggered further reductions in other European rates yesterday. Sweden and Denmark both moved to cut rates yesterday, underscoring an already promising outlook for economic growth in both countries this year. The Danish central bank, making its 11th rate cut in six months, shaved 0.25 per cent off the rates for its key deposit, discount and 14-days certificates of deposit. The deposit and discount rates now stand at 5.50 per cent while the CDs stand at 6 per cent. Sweden's Riksbank, meanwhile, cut its marginal rate from 7.50 per cent to 7.25 per cent. The government, facing a huge budget deficit, is relying chiefly on monetary policy to help stimulate growth expected to top 2 per cent this year after three years of recession. Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the Danish bank governor, said Denmark, also expecting similar growth this year, needed cuts in interest rates to sustain the recovery but would follow the general trend in Europe. 'When you are participating in an integrated European economy, you cannot conduct an independent interest rate policy,' he said. The Swiss National Bank cut its Lombard rate to 6.375 per cent from 6.5 per cent, while the Bank of Spain said yesterday it cut its daily intervention rate to 8.55 per cent from 8.8 per cent, signalling a possible cut in its benchmark rate next week. Italy, Belgium, Austria and the Netherlands cut their rates on Thursday immediately after the Bundesbank move. The Belgian cuts, effective from yesterday, take the , central rate to 6.55 per cent from 6.7 per cent and the discount rate to 5 per cent from 5.25 per cent. Italy's central bank cut its official discount rate by half a percentage point, to 7.5 percent, with effect from yesterday. Austria cut both its discount and Lombard rates by a quarter percentage point to 5 per cent and 6 per cent respectively, with effect from yesterday. The Dutch central bank cut its official rate on advances, its benchmark rate, from 5.25 to 5 per cent. Currencies, Page 11</p>

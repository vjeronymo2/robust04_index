			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Museveni Meets With Klestil"] </F>   [Text] Vienna -- The UN Human Rights Commission's  resolution condemning the genocide in Rwanda offers a  possibility to bring about a cease-fire between the warring  parties, Ugandan President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni said in Vienna.    After his meeting with Federal President Thomas Klestil in  Vienna Museveni said that efforts are being undertaken to bring  about a cease-fire on the basis of that resolution. There will  be an international trial calling the perpetrators to account,  "because there can be no peace without justice," Museveni said.    Commenting on the Austro-Ugandan framework agreement on  development cooperation that was signed on Thursday [26 May],  Museveni said that real development results from investment, not  from financial assistance. Investment is based on reciprocity;  with neither party "a parasite living off the other." Talks  with Austrian businesspeople have been very satisfactory,  Museveni said.    Klestil told the press that the framework agreement will  increase opportunities for cooperation.    Uganda is a country full of natural beauty and has been  economically and politically stable over the past few years.  With these words at the Austrian Economic Chamber on Friday,  Museveni tried to establish contacts with the Austrian tourist  industry and potential investors and trading partners.</p>

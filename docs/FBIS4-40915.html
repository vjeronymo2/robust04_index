			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Regular weekly interview with State Council Chairman Eduard </F> Shevardnadze by Nato Oniani -- live]    [Excerpts] [Oniani] Mr. Shevardnadze, it can be said that  the first tangible steps in an Abkhaz peace settlement were made  last week. [passage omitted] Was the latest agreement what the  country needed? Was it something you were looking for?    [Shevardnadze] Thank you and good morning. Let me remind you  that we did not enter Abkhazia for war. The war with the Abkhaz  is as meaningless and absurd as was the adventurist war against  the Ossetians which was started irresponsibly. The most  persuasive argument in favor of what I said is the fact that we  signed peace accords at the time when we still held positions on  the River Psou. That document was in full agreement with the  interests of both Georgia and the Abkhaz people.    Our further efforts were also aimed at a peaceful settlement  of the conflict. I said from the outset that a war between the  Georgians and Abkhaz was inadmissible. What happened? Why were  we punished so cruelly despite the fact that the entire world,  including the UN and other international organizations,  supported us?    Georgia's biggest mistake after the disintegration of the  Soviet Union was to pursue a reckless policy toward Russia.  This was not state diplomacy, but street diplomacy, if I may  put it so. It was impossible to change that policy in a short  period of time. It became the main reason for all our troubles.    A lot has changed since then. That defect in Georgian state  policy was eliminated. We are now building friendly and good-  neighborly relations with Russia which are based on mutual  trust. Apart from that, Georgia has become a member of the CIS  and the Collective Security Council. One of the main tasks of  these international regional organizations is to guarantee the  territorial integrity and inviolability of the borders of member  states. [passage omitted]    It should be taken into account that the Abkhaz side is an  active and fairly constructive participant in political  dialogue. There have already been several meetings in Geneva,  Moscow, Sochi, and elsewhere, and they have produced certain  results. War and instability are ruinous not only for Georgia  but also for the Abkhazes, and they know this full well.    If a Federation Council meeting to be addressed by [Russian  Defense Minister] Grachev does take place tomorrow, and if the  Federation Council supports President Yeltsin's edict on this  issue, then an operation should start in the next few days,  perhaps in two or three days.    The operation should have started on the 17th or 18th.  Orders were issued and everything was ready for that. However,  the heated debate and complications in our parliament became, to  a certain extent, an obstacle for the timely start of this  operation. At least, that is what I think.    The whole world will be a witness to this historic  operation.  I state without exaggerating that it will be a historic  operation, carried out primarily by Russia, which will determine  the future of Georgia and perhaps other countries as well.  Judging by its form, content, and objectives and by the scope  of the involvement of international organizations, I think that  this operation will be an original and ingenious solution to the  problem.    Since I briefly mentioned the Georgian-Ossetian conflict in  my answer to your question, I would like to speak a little more  about it.    The Georgian-Ossetian dialogue has resumed. Judging by this  dialogue and by what has happened in the region in recent  months, it can be said that we took the right decision as  regards the introduction of peace-keeping forces to the region,  which laid the foundation for a full-scale settlement. We took  the right decision when we signed the Dagomys Agreement with  President Yeltsin and the Ossetian side [on a tripartite  peace-keeping operation in South Osetia].    The agreement reached during the latest meeting attended by  members of our office, Vazha Khachapuridze, who is a deputy,  Nodar Lomauri, and others is a good start. Agreement was reached  on such issues as the need to combine efforts to achieve  stabilization in the entire region, to fight crime and drug  trafficking, to restore business ties - you know how extensive  these ties used to be - and to ensure the safety of travel,  which is very important. Agreement was also reached to restore  road and rail links with Tskhinvali and villages. This is  necessary and very important. Some other issues were also  agreed, which I believe is a good start.    Russia's mediation and active position is very useful for  this dialogue. The Russian unit which is now stationed in  Tskhinvali is playing a very active role in this. I would like  to say a few warm words about Mr. Pavlov, or, rather, General  Pavlov, who treats both sides' interests with much understanding  and is doing many other good things. The active position of CSCE  representatives is also very useful for this diologue, as is, of  course, the role of the leadership of North Ossetia, which  supports a fair and objective settlement of the conflict. There  have been some positive developments in this area and think this  process will become even more dynamic.    [Oniani] Georgia is a CIS member state, and we are all  interested in how this new organization is going to develop.  You have spoken more than once in your interviews about your  vision of the future of the CIS. I would like to ask you how  promising you think [Kazakh President] Nazarbayev's project is.    [Shevardnadze] First of all, I would like to say that I  believe that the CIS as an international and interstate  organization has ample resources for further development. As  for Mr. Nazarbayev's proposals and his project, which he sent to  me, I have examined it carefully and in detail. Some deputies  who have never set their eyes on this project or its author  vilified it in the parliament. Using such illegitimate methods  to criticize important documents does their dignity no good. If  the author agrees, I would like this document to be published in  our country and elsewhere.    The Russian president said it was necessary to think about  this initiative, which is understandable and right since the  document deals with such complex and important issues that it is  difficult to pass judgement on it after reading or looking  through it only once. Its name does not represent a problem at  all. The main thing is the essence. In my opinion, the essence  of this document is that it creates more guarantees for the  independence of states and calls for more integration among  states. This applies to the economic and even military sphere  and so on and so forth. It resembles the European Union model.  [passage omitted]    I think that we should examine in a calm and businesslike  manner any sensible idea concerning the future of new relations  among states. I believe that Nazarbayev's proposal is one such  interesting idea.    [Oniani] You had a meeting with bank representatives last  week, where you spoke about the necessity for reorganization and  reforms in the banking system. You have also mentioned that the  Georgian economy is now entering a stage of reforms. Our  country should become a country of bold experiments. Is the  section of the population that we call businessmen ready for  this? Or, how honest can Georgian business be? How much do you  think it is involved in political processes?    [Shevardnadze] Georgian business is now at a shape-up stage.  It requires help and assistance. That is why I spoke about a  reform in banking. Although banking is considered a difficult  area for launching experiments or entrepreneurship, I believe  that banking-- the financial sphere generally and the economy on  the whole--needs initiative, entrepreneurship, creative  approaches, and experiments, if anything.    Georgia should gain a reputation as a country of bold  experiments, and I am confident that foreign investors will take  a much stronger interest in Georgia, provided we succeed in  securing stability in the country and we are moving in this  direction.    An edict I signed that opens a new stage of privatization in  Georgia is also aimed at this reforms, at this task. I should  tell you that I had been working on this edict for seven or  eight months, back when there were seven or eight ideas on the  subject in the Cabinet of Ministers.    Businessmen need protection most of all. First steps have  been taken, and the country has entered a phase of a sort of  stability. Now we are contemplating bringing order to the  activities of controlling bodies. This is the most painful  issue for Georgian business--bankers and businessmen.    I am for the earliest possible creation of proprietors  within  the population, and I do want more and more people to become  proprietors. A proprietor's initiative, creative activity,  and--I would say--a proprietor's vigor and persistence should  save the country's economy. I am declaring with all  responsibility that the state is the first to care about  businessmen, about business with all its structures. We are  pursuing this aim with consistency and on a large-scale and are  considering our own mistakes as well as those of others.    In addition, I would like to raise the issue of law  drafting.  My address to the parliament was not incidental. A movement  has already begun and work has also begun. The parliament has  started to consider a very important draft law that was drafted  and presented by [Justice Minister] Tedo Ninidze, together with  others. This is a draft law on entrepreneurship. This will be  a foundation for the development of entrepreneurship in Georgia.    The meeting with bankers has also revealed that we are in  need of many laws, without which we will have no means to clear  the obstacles for Georgian business. If passing of laws in the  parliament is impeded, I will be forced to issue decrees on some  of the topics.    [Oniani] Last week you were present at a military exercise  in  Batumi involving units of Russian troops stationed in the  republic. You saw a lot of weapons there--for example, Grad  installations and others, which just a few months ago were used  to shell you and Georgian fighters in Sukhumi. Your next  encounter with Russian weaponry took place in the serene  atmosphere of a Batumi training ground. What happened in the  meantime? Was it Shevardnadze who changed or, perhaps, the  Russian military or, indeed, something else?    [Shevardnadze] Let us discuss who changed and who did not at  a different time. Now I would like to say a few words about  this joint exercise. This was indeed very important, and I  returned from it very satisfied. Moreover, I saw that the two  Batumi battalions that are to take part in the peace mission  were ready to be deployed.    With regard to the exercise.... [pauses] We are now creating  an army. We need an army today or tomorrow, not in the remote  future. Under such circumstances, one should make use of  something that is within their reach and something that is  realistic. It is within our reach to cooperate with the Russian  Armed Forces and, in doing this, to build a new army with their  assistance. That is why I went to Batumi. Of course, there  were other reasons for my visit as well--talking to Batoni Aslan  [Abashidze, Supreme Council chairman and prime minister of  Ajaria], sightseeing in Batumi, and so on.    I also urge other units to invite our young people who are  already in the Army or are about to start service as often as  possible. You know that the Russian Army has enormous  experience, and--if we want to build an army soon--we should  learn from this experience as quickly as possible. I will visit  other units in the future. You know that Russian units are in  Akhalkalaki and Vardzia. I am planning to visit these units too  and to do everything to ensure that their condition of life and  service are normal and that our people's attitude to them is  normal and dignified. I want them to feel that they are living  and serving in a friendly country.    At the same time, we should use this foundation to speed up  the building of a single, mobile, and efficient army. I believe  that this process is now starting to develop on a firm  foundation.    I must also say that the newly-appointed minister [Defense  Minister Varden Nadibaidze]--well, he is not that new any more  and his colleagues are now working in a rather active manner to  speed up the building of a single army.

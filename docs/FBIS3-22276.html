According the results obtained from satellite and land  inspection, Tibet has more than two billion sq m [square meters]  of timber forests, the biggest in all of China.    About 9.8 percent of the region, or an area of 7.17 million  ha [hectares], is covered by trees.    Across its 1.2 million sq km landspace, vast tracts of  forests spread across the east and south of the region, while in  the west and north is broad grassland.    In addition, the survey shows, most of the region's timber  storage is virgin forest.    The survey was conducted jointly by 180 experts from the  Ministry of Forestry and the Forestry Department of Tibet over a  period of half a year.    Experts say the survey is significant for helping the region  work out plans to utilize its rich resources and promote its  economy.    They also stressed that forests are "the lungs of the  Earth".  It is urgent for the local government to take measures to  preserve the region's forests, which are important to the  world's ecological environment, the experts noted.</p>

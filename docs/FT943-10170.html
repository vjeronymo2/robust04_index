			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Late-closing bourses ignore Dow's decline After a reaction earlier in the afternoon to the US jobless figures and the decline in the Dow, late-closing bourses seemed disinclined to follow Wall Street down, writes Our Markets Staff. ZURICH focused on the half-year report from UBS and the SMI index, steady for much of the day, gave up 14.5 to 2,600.8 as prices were marked down in the last hour of trading in response to a drop in US Treasuries. The index was little changed over the week. UBS gave up SFr34 or 2.9 per cent to SFr1,150. Its 28 per cent fall in net profits was within analysts' expectations after last year's exceptional performance. However, a 68 per cent drop in trading profits came as a surprise and, said one analyst, outweighed some very positive indications for the second half of the year. Baer Holding, which presented its own first half figures after the market closed on Wednesday, fell another SFr20 to SFr1,275, taking the two-day decline to 4.9 per cent. Roche certificates pushed SFr75 higher to SFr5,600 on speculation that US investment houses which had downgraded their recommendations on the stock in recent months might be about to reconsider. PARIS closed the week in subdued form with the CAC-40 index rising 10.62 to 2,107.07, up 1.6 per cent on the week. Turnover was FFr3.4bn. Bouygues, the construction group, rose FFr26 to FFr660 following a broker's upgrade. The group's shares remained well below the year's high of FFr752 seen at the start of the year, but interest has been renewed recently following its award of a number of construction projects. Carrefour, the country's biggest supermarket group, was helped by a 5 per cent rise in July sales, the shares gaining FFr29 to FFr2,082. AMSTERDAM was slightly weaker in a day dominated by economic news, as well as confident expectations of next week's batch of results. The AEX index slipped 0.12 to 419.67, 2.8 per cent higher on the week. Investors were encouraged by better than expected July inflation data, a CPI rise of 2.7 per cent comparing with analysts' forecasts of between 2.9 to 3.0 per cent. Among groups reporting next week, PolyGram rose Fl 2.00 to Fl 82.60 and Unilever Fl 1.10 to Fl 196.00. Those which had already reported were mixed: DSM lost Fl 2.90 to Fl 140.00, but Akzo Nobel put on Fl 1.50 to Fl 219.70. Hoogovens, the metals group which delivers second quarter figures next week, was also a favourite, rising Fl 1.30 to Fl 78.20. MILAN was lower on modest foreign selling. The Comit index fell 3.94 to 703.96, in very thin trading, down 0.8 per cent over the week. BCI dropped L119 or 2.5 per cent to L4,643 after Creditanstalt, the Austrian bank which holds a 1.7 per cent stake, confirmed that it would not subscribe to BCI's capital increase on August 18. Snia, Fiat's chemicals and synthetic fibres subsidiary, lost L34 to L2,428 in spite of a forecast from the chairman of much improved 1994 results after first half revenues rose by 19 per cent. MADRID closed higher on continued strength in construction shares. FCC gained Pta640 or 4.9 per cent to Pta14,900, Dragados Pta70 to Pta2,280 and Uralita Pta35 to Pta1,570 as the general index finished 1.97 higher at 322.00, 2.6 per cent better on the week. Mr Christopher Cooper at James Capel London said that the construction sector could rise further on the growth of housing starts and cement sales. 'Uralita is particularly recommendable, as they have been underrated in recent months,' said Mr Cooper. 'I believe that they will reach Pta1,750 to Pta1,800 in the short term.' FASA Renault gained Pta20 to Pta755, still reflecting the government's decision to continue subsiding new car sales. STOCKHOLM, closing at a time when bourses were most sensitive to the US jobless figures, saw the Affarsvarlden General index close 11.8 lower at 1,485.4, 1.4 per cent higher on the week. Astra B consolidated overnight losses in the London market after Germany's suspension of the intravenous use of its Losec anti-ulcer drug, falling SKr4 to SKr169.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lefkose, April 5 (A.A.) -- Turkish Republic of  Northern Cyprus (TRNC) President Rauf Denktas described the  report of UN secretary general on Cyprus as `realistic' on  Tuesday [6 April].    "The report is realistic in statements on the concerns of  the  Turkish side and on the continuation of negotiations," Denktas  said. "However, the finger is still pointing to the Turkish  side."    Denktas answered questions of the press on the report of  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, which evaluates the  shuttle talks held by his envoys with the Turkish and Greek  Cypriot leaders, on the confidence-building measures formulated  by the United Nations.    Denktas said that the original confidence-building measures  contained arrangements which safeguarded the rights of both  sides.    "The changes made on the measures, gives priority and rights  to Greek Cypriots and spoils the position of the Turkish Cypriot  side," he said.    Denktas added that the Turkish Cypriot side was ready to  resume talks, to resolve the Cyprus issue.    He stressed that Butrus-Ghali should not expect the Turkish  Cypriot side to accept the `non-document document' of March 21,  of Ghali, which modified the confidence-building measures  package.    "The promises which have been made to us, do not render our  gains concrete," he said.    "The second document is unacceptable to us in many points,"  he said. "If a message, which says, `I will put pressures on the  Turks' is given, then why should the Greek Cypriots change its  position?"    He added that if an agreement is reached between the sides,  the Greek Cypriots will be allowed to enter the currently  uninhabited section of TRNC within four months, while Turks will  be allowed in after 12 months.    "What if Greek Cypriots violate the agreement meanwhile?" he  asked.    The UN-formulated confidence-building measures originally  envisaged to place the Maras [Varosha] section of the TRNC under  UN control and open the Lefkose [Nicosia] Airport to  international traffic.    Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey conducted a  peace operation to the island following a Greek-backed coup  attempt to annex the island to Greece.    The TRNC came into existence in 1983.</p>

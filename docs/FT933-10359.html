			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / International Company News: Growth in assets bolsters result at Stanbic A SHARP increase in the asset base and a lower tax rate helped Standard Bank Investment Corporation (Stanbic), South Africa's leading banking group, to increase earnings per share 37 per cent, to 335 from 245 cents, in the six months to June. The group, however, stressed that this rate of growth did not accurately reflect the underlying operating environment. It would not continue in the second half. A 'satisfactory improvement' in earnings, however, was anticipated for the full year. Mr Eddie Theron, managing director, said the 23 per cent increase in the asset base, to R65.2bn (Dollars 19.4bn) from R53bn, had helped boost the results. South African assets increased by 16 per cent to R61.2bn (R52.5bn), coming almost entirely from growth in home loans. UK assets - Standard has established a branch in London - rose to R1.97bn from R551m, and other African assets increased to R1.4bn from nothing following the acquisition last year of ANZ Grindlays African operations. Rights issue proceeds of R650m boosted assets further. The reduction in the corporate tax rate, to 40 per cent from 48 per cent, added 27 cents per share to earnings. Mr Theron said the earnings figures also flattered because they came off a comparatively low base in 1992. Although net interest income rose 23.6 per cent, to R1.46bn from R1.18bn, Mr Theron noted this was insufficient to compensate for the 27.3 per cent increase in bad debt provisions to R220.2m, from R173m last time. On an annualised basis, this represents 0.68 per cent of total assets, up from 0.33 per cent in 1988. Other operating income rose to R845.4m from R702.9m. Attributable income rose 57 per cent to R398m from R253.1m. The dividend was increased to 62 cents from 53 cents per share.</p>

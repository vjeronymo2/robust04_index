			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH LEVEL OF ARSENIC FOUND IN EX-HOSTAGE REED  </P> <P> Tests performed on former hostage Frank H. Reed revealed an "inordinate" amount  of arsenic in his body, leaving him afraid for the safety of other Westerners  still held in Lebanon, his lawyer said Saturday.  </P> <P> Physicians at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, where Reed has been  undergoing treatment since his release April 30, did not say how or when Reed  may have ingested the poisonous substance.  </P> <P> The arsenic, detected when Reed was released after spending 44 months as a  hostage in Lebanon, has since been reduced to a nontoxic level, officials said.  </P> <P> Boston attorney Bob Woolf said Reed had known about the arsenic for "some  weeks." He had not spoken publicly about it because, while "we were in the  process of hoping it would be eliminated from his system, we weren't sure,"  Woolf said.  </P> <P> "It was an inordinate amount, which could have been very serious to his  health," Woolf said in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> Woolf said Reed was relieved that his health was no longer in jeopardy, but he  remains concerned for the other hostages, including six Americans, still held  by various groups in Lebanon.  </P> <P> Reed underwent tests for the arsenic as part of a standard procedure for former  prisoners, officials at Andrews Air Force Base said.  </P> <P> Citing the safety of the remaining hostages, Woolf declined to discuss how it  was believed Reed received the arsenic. The element has medicinal purposes when  combined with bromides, but is a potent poison in excessive doses.  </P> <P> Aside from a brief visit last month to family members in his native Malden,  Mass., the 57-year-old educator has been recuperating at the Malcolm Grow  Medical Center at Andrews since his return to the United States.  </P></p>

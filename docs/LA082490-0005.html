			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARION BARRY'S TRIAL AND BLACK LEADERSHIP  </P> <P> How refreshing to read the column by David Dante Troutt about the Marion Barry  decision ("Mayor Barry's Trial Raises Issues Unresolved in the Black 'Family,'  " Opinion, Aug. 19).  </P> <P> Instead of joyously celebrating a mixed decision and haranguing about racism,  Troutt thoughtfully stepped back and gave us an insight to the much larger  question of black leadership in Washington.  </P> <P> In contrast, instead of looking inward to see where his black leadership went  wrong in recent years, Barry boldly took to the pulpit, sounded off as if he  were royally acquitted and now has the audacity to run for another office  ("Barry Paves Way to Run for D.C. City Council," Aug. 14).  </P> <P> I wonder if Barry has seen or heard the calm, reasoned almost painful appeal  made by Troutt?  </P> <P> Blacks in Washington deserve far more than this kind of "leadership."  </P> <P> ROBERT B. WOLCOTT JR.  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

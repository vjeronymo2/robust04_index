			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Scramble for a licence to print money: Demand for banknotes The cluster of international companies supplying banknotes, paper and printing technology to central banks and governments faces one of the biggest upheavals since the birth of the paper currency business 250 years ago. In spite of falling inflation, central banks in the big industrialised countries are issuing many more banknotes, as they seek cleaner, better designed and higher-security notes for cash dispensers and other automatic banking operations. Heavy demand for 'parallel' currencies in politically and economically distressed countries is also increasing demand for the dollar and the D-Mark. The US Bureau of Engraving, which handles dollar printing, expanded banknote output by 25 per cent last year to 8.5bn notes, and is due to raise production to 18.2bn by the year 2000. Outside the industrialised west, a sizeable group of new customers - freshly independent republics of the former Soviet Union and former members of the communist bloc previously bound to the rouble zone - has entered the banknote market. Mr Philip Conway, managing director of the paper-making subsidiary of Portals, the world's largest supplier of banknote paper, says former eastern bloc countries 'have recognised that their currencies were old-fashioned and insecure against counterfeiting. To have within one or two years around 20 new countries (as potential customers) is something rare in our business.' Mr Tilmann Otto, managing director in charge of marketing at Giesecke &amp; Devrient, the big German banknote printer which supplies half the roughly 2bn D-Mark banknotes in circulation, sums up the new aggressiveness in the industry: 'We don't simply want to defend our market share, but also to maintain growth. Everywhere there is a chance for orders, we are present.' The company recently won an order to produce banknotes for Latvia. It has also printed new zloty notes to distribute when Poland's long-awaited currency reform takes effect. In another sign of scrambling for eastern contracts, Canadian Bank Note Company (CBNC), the Ottawa-based group which prints half of Canada's banknotes, last month agreed to produce new currency for the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan in central Asia. It has also clinched the largest eastern deal so far, a CDollars 36m (Pounds 15m) order to print the new Ukranian currency, the hryvnia, to be issued next year. De La Rue, the UK-based company which is the world's biggest security printer, will share the printing to increase stability of supply. 'Many former Soviet republics outside Russia are considering using their own currencies,' says Mr Jeremy Marshall, De La Rue's managing director. 'We are closely in contact with all the countries interested in doing this.' Uzbekistan, in central Asia, also appears to be pondering a break from the rouble. According to industry reports, Harrison and Sons, the High Wycombe-based security-printing company owned by the Lonrho trading group, is negotiating a joint security and currency printing venture with Uzbekistan. Another company which has been turning its attentions to the former communist lands is US Banknote, the biggest US security printer. Mr Stanley Kreitman, president, says: 'Banknotes normally wear out in 18 months, so you are always soliciting new business.' The main problem in wooing new eastern customers is arranging the financing. 'It is a huge potential market, but the only problem is that they have no money,' says Mr Peter Caithness, a market consultant for BA Banknote. The top corporate names pursuing such orders are nearly all old-established companies from Europe and North America with far-flung international activities. Many banknote makers have been pushed towards exports by the dominant position of state-owned banknote printing companies in their home territories. Of the top seven industrialised countries, only two - Germany and Canada - use private sector companies for large amounts of banknote printing. Of world banknote production of roughly 100bn notes a year, only around 10 per cent is supplied by commercial, as opposed to state-owned, printing works. With estimated annual production of around 5.5bn banknotes, De La Rue outstrips its competitors by a large margin. 'It is a world power, a war machine,' sighs Mr Michel Aime, managing director of the Paris-headquartered Francois-Charles Oberthur group, a fast-growing security printing company which produces 1bn banknotes a year. Oberthur relies for its staple customer base on about 13 or 14 Francophone African countries, whose banknote orders are channelled through the Banque de France. But Oberthur has also been active in picking up business elsewhere, aided by manufacturing in its French plants, which also make stamps, lottery tickets and identity documents. But De La Rue has set a tough pace. It has shifted production to low-cost plants in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malta and Sri Lanka. It is also building a Pounds 10m currency printing plant in Nairobi. Through its subsidiary De La Rue Giori, which accounts for an estimated 95 per cent of annual sales of banknote machinery, De La Rue is also a dominant force in printing presses. It supplies competitors such as G &amp; D and central banks with their own printing works. De La Rue Giori machines are being used to re-equip the Bank of England plant, which has produced its own notes since 1791. By contrast, when West Germany restarted its own banknote production after the Second World War, the Bundesbank allotted a 50 per cent share in banknote manufacturing to G &amp; D. The other half is taken by the Bundesdruckerei, the state printing works. The international jostling to sell paper money looks certain to increase. Harrison's Mr Stuart says competition is now coming increasingly from state banknote printers, under pressure from central banks to subsidise their own production with export orders. 'The thing that concerns us most is those subsidised, large printing works trying to get in on what was a market for privately owned companies. There are quite a number of them doing it,' he says. The bigger commercial banknote printers hope eventually to turn the tables. The Bank of England, for example, is taking seriously a behind-the-scenes campaign by De La Rue to try to win political approval for privatising Britain's banknote manufacturing. De La Rue claims that it could do the Bank of England's work more cheaply and with no loss of security. No one imagines De La Rue will have an easy job in breaking through the Bank's portals. Compared with the task of clinching a deal for English pounds, winning banknote orders from Ukraine and Uzbekistan may turn out to be child's play.

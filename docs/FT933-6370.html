			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Market price range 'close to equilibrium' A GOLD price range of between Dollars 370 and Dollars 400 a troy ounce 'is probably not far out of line with the prevailing equilibrium price,' suggests the Gold Fields Mineral Services consultancy group in a new report on the global gold market. Although there is a danger the same investment funds that helped to drive up the gold price earlier this year might become sellers instead, GFMS says it is also possible to see a number of developments that would lead to a further upward movement. These include a return of stronger physical demand as the market moves out of the present time of seasonal weakness and as dealer, fabricator and retail stocks return to normal from high levels built up by the end of the first quarter of 1992. Also, 'the lowering of European interest rates should offer support to the gold price in the medium-term by reducing the opportunity cost of holding gold as well as boosting consumption and possibly inflation in the longer term'. GFMS makes these comments in the first of a new series of interim reports that will update information contained it its annual survey, which is released in May each year. The latest report forecasts that higher prices will cut global gold demand from jewellery makers this year by about 7 per cent from the 1992 level to 2,492 tonnes. This would still be well above global mine production of gold, predicted to rise by 2 per cent to 2,274 tonnes. The biggest supply/demand component changes forecast by GFMS include an 87 per cent drop to only 20 tonnes in supply from forward sales by producers and a 37 per cent fall in sales by central banks and other official organisations to only 368 tonnes. The recent steep price rise has encouraged more investment in physical gold and GFMS predicts this will rise by 530 per cent to 63 tonnes - still comparatively low given that demand from this source was 213 tonnes in 1990. Bar hoarding, also feeling the impact of higher prices, is forecast to fall by 29.5 per cent to 203 tonnes. GFMS suggests that in the short term it will be developments in the gold market itself that will determine the price. If central banks sales and forward sales by producers stay low, there may be further investment interest in the metal. If physical gold sales pick up, this will reassure investors 'that the risks of a major down-side correction are low enough and the possibility of longer-term gain high enough to justify continued exposure to gold within diversified portfolios. 'On the other hand, if physical demand remains weak, then, in the absence of external factors such as renewed turmoil on foreign exchanges, additional liquidation of long positions, accompanied by a further period of price weakness, would seem likely.'

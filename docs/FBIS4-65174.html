			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- According to Social Democratic Party Deputy  Volker Neumann, three Bundestag deputies have interrupted an  inspection visit to the autonomous Kurdish regions in northern  Iraq because of heavy fighting between hostile Kurdish groups.  Neumann reported in Bonn on Monday [9 April] that several  hundred people have already been killed in the war between  Mas'ud Barzani's Democratic Party of Kurdistan (DPK) and Jalal  Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The two party  leaders cooperate in a coalition government of the autonomous  region, while their supporters attacked one another on their way  to negotiations.    The German delegation was led by the chairman of the  Bundestag Subcommittee for Humanitarian Issues, Friedrich Vogel  (Christian Democratic Union -- CDU). Heinrich Lummer (CDU) was  the third participant. Neumann reported that members of aid  organizations, including Eberhard Walde of the German liaison  office in the region, have left the region, because their  security can no longer be guaranteed. Representatives of the  two warring parties called this "the saddest day" since Saddam  Husayn's anti-Kurdish massacrers.    The deputies wanted to obtain some information on the extent  of reconstruction aid provided for the autonomous region in  Iraq, to which the Federal Government, and especially the  laender of Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia have  contributed. Germany's food aid could, however, be largely  discontinued due to good harvests in 1992 and 1993, Neumann  said. In these two years, Bonn provided almost 40 million marks  in humanitarian aid.</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Small rally in pound The pound rallied in early trading, but the market was unconvinced that gains against the D-Mark represented a shift in attitude towards the currency, writes Emma Tucker. Much of sterling's recovery reflected technical manoeuvrings as traders closed short positions ahead of an address by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to the Conservative Party conference today. Traders were not certain he would give a firm indication on the future shape of UK economic policy but in the absence of any other statements will be fixed to their television screens when he speaks today at noon. 'I don't think the strengthening of sterling is a sign that institutional investors are going to turn around and start buying gilts and UK shares,' said Mr Avinash Persaud, senior currency economist at UBS Phillips and Drew. Mr Ifty Islam, currency economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said: 'Sterling's move doesn't reflect any change in the fundamental view of the UK and that will continue until we get a slightly firmer policy statement.' The pound closed in London at DM2.4725, up two and half pfennigs on the day. Against the dollar it closed at Dollars 1.7170 marginally higher than the previous day's close. In European trading the dollar benefited from the Federal Reserve's decision not to announce a cut in the discount rate at its federal open markets committee meeting and from softer German money rates. German call money remained at 8.95 per cent after the Bundesbank injected more liquidity into the system than had been expected. Opinion was divided over whether this represented a signal from the German central bank that it was shifting its monetary stance, or whether the easing was temporary. The dollar rallied in late trading to close up a pfennig at DM1.4400. The lira also benefited from the slight weakening of the D-Mark across the foreign exchanges, and edged up against the German currency. Many traders felt the sharp movements in the lira on the previous day had been excessive. There were also fewer scares about the reintroduction of exchange controls flying around the markets. The lira closed at L905 against the D-Mark, up sharply on the previous day's close of L916.2. Like the pound, however, the outlook for the Italian currency remains uncertain. The market is particularly worried about the possible rejection of the budget package by the Italian parliament. The Swiss franc tumbled through chart support against the dollar to end sharply lower against the big currencies. Easier Swiss franc money market rates and news that big Swiss banks had cut rates on their cash bonds weakened the Swiss currency further. It closed against the dollar at SFr1.2585.</p>

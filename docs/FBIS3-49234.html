			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Alexandru Radocea, president of the National </F> Statistics Commission, by Ion Pavelescu; place and date not  given: "Romania's Economy Has Already Embarked on the Road of  Being Relaunched"]    [Text] Not long ago, the German daily FRANKFURTER  ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG known for its -- mildly put -- hardly  favorable position toward Romania and the commentaries by Viktor  Meier, who never missed an opportunity to attack us, amazed its  readers with the statement that, among the eastern countries,  our state has genuine possibilities to recover economically and  that this is already noticeable. Surprised, not to use a  stronger word, by this assessment, we approached Mr. Alexandru  Radocea, president of the National Statistics Commission, asking  him to comment on the article published by the aforementioned  daily and to review, in general terms, the year that has almost  come to an end.    I accept your invitation with pleasure, he said, especially  since, now that the Cassandras have multiplied, DIMINEATA is  among the few newspapers trying to inform its readers correctly  by abiding by the truth, which is not all that black as some  people, who are interested in an end-of-the-world atmosphere,  describe it.    [Pavelescu] Mr. Radocea, what is the situation of our  economy? Is the economy the beginning and the end of everything?    [Radocea] It would be premature to talk about abundance in  our country. Certainly, however, the main commitment assumed by  the Vacaroiu government when it was invested -- namely to halt  the decline of the production -- has been fulfilled. Here are  figures to prove this. Throughout the 11 months that have  elapsed in 1993, industrial production increased 0.4 percent, in  comparable prices, compared with the same period last year. In  agriculture, despite the unfavorable conditions that affected  four counties in the southern part of our country -- one of our  bread baskets -- where not a drop of rain fell for months on  end, this recovery process can be clearly noted because the  volume of grain production is 11 percent higher than in 1992,  and the animal breeding sector also shows signs of recovery.    [Pavelescu] Mr. Radocea, which industrial branches have made  the balance tip toward a positive direction?    [Radocea] These are the weighty and prevalently modern  branches. They include such branches as chemistry, certain  machine- building and mining branches, and the furniture  industry. As a conclusion that exceeds the competence of the  statistician but which should not be omitted, we have to mention  that the new economic mechanism has begun to function and that  branches and units recording positive results do so because of  the judicious blend between mature personnel and the dynamism of  young specialists.    [Pavelescu] There still are, however, areas in which  stagnation persists and in which things do not develop with the  necessary vigor....    [Radocea] That is correct. Metallurgy, the garment  industry, and the food industry, as well as the tobacco  processing industry, are not moving at all. There would be  explanations, but this is not the right time to dwell on them.    [Pavelescu] For this reason, for the time being, we have a  trade balance deficit in the sense that we import more than we  export.    [Radocea] This is a fact that we cannot ignore. But even in  this respect, one can note signs of recovery, albeit modest ones.    [Pavelescu] What is the employment situation of our labor  force?    [Radocea] Unemployment continues to grow. The current  unemployment rate is approximately 9.9 percent of the active  labor force. A comparison with the countries surrounding us or  with more distant ones could render false projections. We have  a smaller number of unemployed than Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria,  and even France. But can anyone be at peace when more than a  million people have no jobs?    [Pavelescu] In this context, would it seem ill-timed to ask  you about the standard of living?    [Radocea] Not in the least. The incomes of the population  have considerably increased. And conditions exist that in  December they may be even higher.    [Pavelescu] A key question: How will 1994 start off?    [Radocea] I am convinced that conditions are in place for  next year to mark the much-awaited relaunching of the economy.  The economic mechanism based on market laws has been broken in  and has been perfected. Numerous branches, including  metallurgy, have come up with promising anticrisis programs.  The contracts that have been concluded, including exports, seem  to be encouraging. Agriculture will unmistakably progress. In  the area of utilizing the labor force, the indicators will  improve along with the relaunching of the construction activity  in the spring. I believe that we have embarked on the right  road.    And since from the very beginning I talked to you about my  friendly feelings toward the paper for which you work, permit me  to conclude in the same vein by using this opportunity to convey  wishes for good health and work energy to the editorial team,  and best wishes for your readers in 1994, together with the  traditional Romanian wish of "Many Happy Returns!"</p>

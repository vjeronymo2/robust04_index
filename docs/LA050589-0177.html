			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EAST COAST POSTS FASTEST RISE IN INCOMES;  </P> <P> MOST CITIES WITH BIGGEST DECREASES ARE IN OIL-PRODUCING STATES  </P> <P> Personal income is growing at an uneven pace in America's cities, with the  fastest growth along the East Coast and the slowest in oil-producing states, a  new government report shows.  </P> <P> Twenty-three of the nation's 318 metropolitan areas in 1987 registered per  capita income growth at least 2 percentage points above the national average of  6%, the Commerce Department reported.  </P> <P> Seven of those cities were in New England; six were in the Middle Atlantic  region; five were in the Southeast.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Oil-Producing States  </P> <P> Income in 60 metropolitan areas, meanwhile, grew at a rate that was at least 2  percentage points below the national average. Forty-one of those areas were in  the oil-producing states of Alaska, Colorado, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and  Wyoming.  </P> <P> "A lot of growth in New England is driven by services and high-tech  industries," said Kathy Albetski of the department's Bureau of Economic  Analysis. "The slow growth was driven by the weakness in oil."  </P> <P> The fastest growth rate was recorded in the Visalia-Tulare-Porterville region  of California, but that was largely because incomes there were relatively low  to begin with. The area's per capita income rose 9.7% to $12,968, a level still  well below the national average.  </P> <P> At the other end of the scale, two regions registered declines in 1987: Per  capita income fell 1.4% in Flint, Mich., to $14,723, and dropped 0.6% in  Lafayette, La., to $12,363.  </P> <P> In a ranking of income levels, first place belonged to the  Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk-Danbury area of Connecticut, with per capita income  of $26,316.  </P> <P> Bringing up the rear was the McAllen-Edinburg-Mission area of Texas at $7,001.  </P> <P> For the nation as a whole, per capita income in 1987 was $15,484, up from  $14,609 a year earlier.  </P> <P> In addition to the Bridgeport region, here are the other metropolitan areas in  the top 10 for 1987 per capita personal income:  </P> <P> San Francisco, $24,593; Bergen-Passaic, N.J., $23,040;  Middlesex-Somerset-Hunterdon, N.J., $22,783; Nassau-Suffolk, N.Y., $22,001;  Washington, D.C.-Maryland-Virginia, $21,539; San Jose, $21,510; Anaheim-Santa  Ana, $21,444; Lake County, Ill., $21,432, and West Palm Beach-Boca Raton-Delray  Beach, Fla., $21,246.  </P> <P> In addition to the McAllen region, here are the other metropolitan areas in the  bottom 10 for 1987 per capita personal income:  </P> <P> Laredo, Tex., $7,035; Brownsville-Harlingen, Tex., $7,409; Provo-Orem, Utah,  $8,870; El Paso, Tex., $9,484; Las Cruces, N.M., $9,578; Pascagoula, Miss.,  $10,231; Houma-Thibodaux, La., $10,582; Jacksonville, N.C., $10,668, and  Bryan-College Station, Tex., $10,688.  </P></p>

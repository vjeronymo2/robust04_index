			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NORTH COUNTY CAN WEATHER LONG DROUGHT, OFFICIALS SAY;  </P> <P> RESOURCES: A VAST UNDERGROUND LAKE IS INSURANCE AGAINST THE METROPOLITAN WATER  DISTRICT'S PLANNED CUTBACK IN DELIVERIES, BUT SOUTH COUNTY COULD BE LEFT  THIRSTING, ACCORDING TO A SURVEY OF WATER COMPANIES.  </P> <P> Northern Orange County's abundant ground-water supply would leave it virtually  unaffected by a planned cutback in water deliveries, but some South County  consumers could be left dry if the drought continues, according to a survey of  water companies Wednesday.  </P> <P> Water officials said voluntary conservation programs implemented in parts of  the county over the past year have neared or met the 5% reduction in the  residential supply, based on last year's consumption levels, that the  Metropolitan Water District of Southern California plans to implement Feb. 1.  Further conservation and plentiful ground water should make up for any reduced  MWD flow, they said.  </P> <P> "We have a mandatory rationing plan that we could implement, but I anticipate  that the voluntary efforts will do it," said Karl Kemp, director of the Mesa  Consolidated Water District, which serves Costa Mesa and parts of Newport Beach  and derives 70% of its supply from ground water. "We just need to get the word  out to more people more often that this is not a drill. This is real."  </P> <P> Highly residential districts, such as Mesa Consolidated, will be able to rely  for years on ground water from a lake beneath the county that contains millions  of gallons accumulated from centuries of Santa Ana River runoff.  </P> <P> But South County cities and districts are already suffering from bone-dry  creeks and wells and can ill-afford a decrease in imported water from MWD,  which delivers water to 27 Southland agencies that retail it to the public.  Increased water needs for southern farmlands -- to which MWD plans to cut  supply by 20% -- and the area's booming population will only compound the  problem.  </P> <P> But even with those factors against them, South County water consumers still  are not likely to see mandatory rationing soon, water officials there said. So  far, voluntary cuts in water use have been enough to keep pipelines from drying  up.  </P> <P> "We do have a voluntary conservation program in effect now, which, if we  ensured the measures are carried out, can achieve our 5% cutback without any  drastic actions," said Jack Foley, general manager of the Moulton Niguel Water  District, which covers parts of Laguna Niguel, Dana Point, Laguna Hills and  Mission Viejo. Foley added that if the 5% reduction isn't met, an ordinance  allows the board to enforce it through penalties.  </P> <P> The Irvine Ranch Water District receives 70% of its supply from MWD and serves  large tracts of farmland. But a project in which water is recycled for gardens  and other industrial purposes, and a voluntary conservation program that cut  water use 6.4% from May to September, means that Irvine will be relatively  unaffected, said Joyce Gwidt, a spokeswoman for the water district.  </P> <P> "We have really planned for future needs, so we're in a little better place  that other cities that depend totally on imported water," Gwidt said. "We've  been actively teaching water conservation in the schools and working with our  customers (on conservation techniques) for a couple of years now."  </P> <P> Still, water district officials surveyed Wednesday were only cautiously  optimistic. While they were confident that mandatory rationing and rate hikes  can be avoided in the short term, nearly all of the cities and water companies  said they have contingency plans at the ready should the drought continue into  a fifth year.  </P> <P> In several districts, city councils have passed or are considering ordinances  that allow for gradual water cutbacks as the drought worsens. Nearly all cities  in Orange County have passed resolutions calling for voluntary cutbacks of  varying degrees.  </P> <P> Typical of such conservation programs is one implemented in May in the  Capistrano Valley Water District, where officials passed a four-stage  conservation ordinance, Administrative Services Manager Don Metzger said.  </P> <P> "In Stage One, which we are in, it's strictly a voluntary conservation,"  Metzger said. "It does provide the option to go to mandatory as the stages  progress." The second stage would continue voluntary conservation with some  mandatory measures, such as a ban on serving water in restaurants without a  specific request.  </P> <P> "In the third and fourth stages, reductions become mandatory, including  penalties that can disconnect service until a customer corrects the situation,"  Metzger said. "It means no irrigation during peak periods, no hosing down  driveways, fixing leaks right away. Now we just ask people to do these things."  </P> <P> More likely than strict conservation in the short term are tiered-rate systems  that charge customers based on the amount of water they use. Few districts or  cities have plans for rate hikes, but officials said the tiered system could be  an effective method of getting consumers to cut water use.  </P> <P> Foley, of the Moulton Niguel district, said consumers there have been under a  tiered-rate system since 1976, the only current tiered system in the county.  "It's made up in 30 units, each of 100 cubic feet (of water)," he said. "The  first 30 units are on a fixed rate, each 10 after that, the rate jumps up." He  added that the system has proven effective in conserving water.  </P> <P> "High rollers pay an incrementally higher amount," Foley said. "I figure that's  an incentive to save water."  </P> <P> Mary Helen Berg, Len Hall, Greg Hernandez, Lisa Mascaro, Laura Michaelis, Jon  Nalick, Lynda Natali, Wendy Paulson and John Penner contributed to this report.  </P></p>

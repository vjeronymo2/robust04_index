			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAYSINGER TACKLES NEW JOB AS HEAD COACH AT BEVERLY HILLS  </P> <P> This spring was a particularly tough time for the Beverly Hills High football  program. Memories remained from the bitter teachers' strike in the fall, which  resulted in the forfeiture of three games, the resignations of longtime  Co-Coaches Dick Billingsley and Bill Stansbury to accept jobs at other schools  and the cancellation of spring drills.  </P> <P> "All anyone could talk about was transferring out of here," junior Ziv Gottlieb  said. "I was looking into the possibility of either transferring to Crespi or  Loyola. I figured this program was going nowhere. We didn't even have a coach."  </P> <P> The traditionally powerful Normans seemed like a team on the decline. But  morale took an about-face in mid-June when Principal Ben Bushman promoted  veteran assistant Carter Paysinger to head coach. The selection was  overwhelmingly popular with the players.  </P> <P> "Naming Carter as head coach was a dream that I thought would never come true,"  said Gottlieb, who will start at quarterback this season. "I can't think of  anyone who would have been better. When we heard the news about Carter,  everybody in school was doing high-fives. He's always been a players' coach and  that's why we all like him."  </P> <P> Bushman's decision appears to have been a wise one. No one ended up  transferring and more players are expected to go out for the team this fall  than did last season.  </P> <P> Paysinger's appointment is unprecedented because he is the first alumnus and  part-time faculty member to coach football at Beverly Hills. He also is the  first black to head the football program.  </P> <P> "So far, it hasn't been a racial problem and frankly, I don't anticipate it to  be one," Paysinger said. "People here know me and know what I'm about."  </P> <P> Paysinger has been an assistant at Beverly Hills since 1980, but there are  several obstacles he must overcome.  </P> <P> Tensions remain from the teachers' strike and the subsequent failure of  Proposition B, which would have raised $4.5 million for the Beverly Hills  Unified School District.  </P> <P> Stansbury and Billingsley walked the picket line last fall, leaving the team  without any coaches for three Bay League games. The Normans had to forfeit  those games and ended the season at 3-7, failing to qualify for the playoffs. A  few months later, Billingsley was informed by the district that budget cuts  likely would result in the elimination of his teaching and coaching position.  He accepted a job at Oak Park High. Fearing further cutbacks, Stansbury also  jumped ship and took a job at Paso Robles High.  </P> <P> Paysinger, who played football and baseball at Beverly Hills from 1971-74, has  taught physical education at the school since 1985, but he was on a leave on  absence last year to devote more time to his financial brokerage business. He  remained a football assistant, coaching the quarterbacks and receivers and  helping put together the offensive game plan.  </P> <P> When Bushman called in June and offered Paysinger the job, he needed only a few  hours to make his decision.  </P> <P> "I had been an assistant so long, that I couldn't pass up an opportunity to  finally be in charge," said Paysinger, who will teach two classes at Beverly  Hills this fall and continue his job as a broker part time. "Despite my busy  schedule with my business, I am making time for this because I want to see how  I do when I'm calling the shots. I guess when you're an assistant for so many  years, you always wonder how you'll do when you become the head coach. It's  time to find out.  </P> <P> "As far as I'm concerned, though, the strike business is over and it's time for  a clean slate. I think that whole thing is finally behind us now."  </P> <P> Putting together a coaching staff was Paysinger's first task. Within days of  his promotion, his staff was intact. He rehired his brothers, Vonzie and Donald  Paysinger, as assistants. Vonzie, an assistant at Beverly Hills since 1983,  will be the offensive coordinator, and Donald, an assistant since '82, will be  the offensive line coach. He also hired Brian Cook, a former defensive back at  Carson High who went on to play at USC. Cook will be in charge of the defensive  backs.  </P> <P> "There was a time when I wasn't sure if I would return," Vonzie said. "It all  depended on who was going to be the head coach. If the school would have hired  a new guy from the outside, I wasn't too excited about starting the program all  over again.  </P> <P> "Of course, I wanted my brother to get his chance. When they selected Carter, I  knew I would be back. I'm excited about this year, and also my increased  duties. I was ready for a bigger role."  </P> <P> Stansbury praised his successor.  </P> <P> "Carter is very bright, personable, has excellent rapport with the athletes and  is a very knowledgeable football person," Stansbury said. "Hiring him was the  best thing for the program because there will be continuity."  </P> <P> Despite missing spring drills, the Normans have been back to a normal schedule  since Paysinger took over. Most of the returning players currently are enrolled  in a six-week physical education class at the school, which is taught by  Paysinger. Players spend two hours each morning on the practice field running  through plays and discussing strategies.  </P> <P> Paysinger appears comfortable in his new role and said few changes are planned.  </P> <P> "We will continue running a pro-style offense," he said. "The only change on  defense is that we will platoon. We will be more aggressive on defense and  force the action instead of waiting for it to come to us. But all of the  terminology will be the same."  </P> <P> Paysinger, 34, said the biggest difference his players will notice this season  is that they will be able to have open discussions with the coaching staff.  Although he said Stansbury and Billingsley had a good rapport with the team, he  said he is more low-key and less of a disciplinarian.  </P> <P> "I'm not much of a yeller," he said. "I just talk to the kids on a relaxed  level, and I want them to feel like they can do the same with me. All of  coaches are like that, so I think it will be a very positive atmosphere."  </P> <P> Paysinger isn't ready to make any predictions on his team's chances this  season, but like most coaches, he is optimistic. The Normans return five  starters on offense and four on defense. Seniors Darren Smith (wide receiver)  and Greg Holmes (running back) are considered college prospects.  </P> <P> "All you can do is give your players the best opportunity to perform,"  Paysinger said. "What happens on the field is up to the players. At this point,  I'm not nervous about wins and losses.  </P> <P> "But give me a little time."  </P></p>

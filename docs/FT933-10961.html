			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Finance &amp; the Family: Another blow for endowments? - Norma Cohen examines the implications of insurance tax changes proposed by the EC BRITAIN is re-examining some of the ways long-term insurance contracts are taxed - with some vexing implications for policyholders. The catalyst for the review is the European Commission which, in its voluminous Third Directive on Life Insurance, tries to set a level playing field in the way policies are taxed throughout the community. The Treasury has held discussions with the Association of British Insurers, the trade body, about possible tax changes - a move that has unnerved members of the industry, particularly those which sell long-term endowment policies. It is preparing to air some proposals this October and make final judgements by the year-end. The EC directive seeks to scrap the so-called 'qualifying' policy which exempts higher-rate taxpayers from having to pay tax on the difference between premium payments and final maturity value. Only policies longer than 10 years fall into this category, and only those in which the sum assured is at least 75 per cent of premiums paid. Thus, it is long-term endowments, a product already losing favour with the public, which would be most affected by the tax change. 'Life is getting more difficult for that sort of product, anyway,' says Mike Wadsworth, a partner at consulting actuary R. Watson and Co. The change would add to the difficulties in selling such products, however, because it would create greater uncertainty in predicting the final cash proceeds to policyholders upon maturity. Guessing the individual's tax status some 25 years into the future is almost impossible, and policyholders who wished to use such policies to pay off mortgages would face even more uncertainty about how much they would have to pay every month in order to meet their final liability. More broadly, though, the matter under discussion at the Treasury is whether to scrap the present system under which life insurance investment returns are taxed as they are earned but the final proceeds of any policy are not. In most of Europe, life insurers earn investment returns gross of tax, meaning they can actually show higher returns each year in some instances. 'I'd get better value from a French policy because, in France, I'd get tax-free roll-up,' said Nigel Silby, a partner at Watson specialising in insurance taxation. 'In some of these European countries, they actually tax them quite lightly at maturity. In France, there is almost no tax if you hold your policy for 15 years.' Of course, as Silby notes, investment returns on long-term UK policies tend to greatly outperform those of their European counterparts because of the emphasis on higher-yielding equities. Continentals prefer bonds, in short. But a shift could encourage British companies to set up European offshoots which then sell their products back into Britain. J. Rothschild Assurance has taken such a step already with its new, Dublin-based operation. Watson points out that should the Treasury decide to require higher-rate taxpayers to pay tax on final maturity values, it probably would offer simultaneously a tax credit for duties incurred on investment gains over the life of the policy. Failure to do so would amount to double taxation of investment returns. The Treasury has a dilemma, though. If it wants to move into line with other European states and abandon year-by-year taxation of investment returns in favour of taxation upon final maturity, it will have to face up to a further loss in revenue. And with a Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement for the present year, that option is unpalatable.</p>

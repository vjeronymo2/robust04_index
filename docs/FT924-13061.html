			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Yeltsin sets up council of leaders RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin yesterday proposed that the meeting of the full Russian parliament - the Congress of Peoples Deputies - be postponed from December to next spring. At the same time, he has created a new level of power, whose authority is unclear - a Council of Republican Leaders, bringing together the presidents of the autonomous republics and regions within Russia. The leaders, meeting in Moscow on Thursday, called for unity among the Russian peoples, and for decentralisation of powers to the republics. The president warned of attempts to create 'parallel structures of power', at regional and central level. He said: 'We will be able to strengthen the state, provide stability, ensure a transformation, only if we have a solid guarantee of the stability of the institutions of power.' The proposal to delay the Congress, backed by republican leaders, is an effort to avoid the crisis which would result from the likely vote of no confidence in the government from the Congress deputies, most of whom are against the economic reforms.</p>

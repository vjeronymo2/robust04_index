			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Chamberlain issue price set at 165p Chamberlain Phipps, the shoe components and footwear manufacturer which is about to float on the stock market has been forced to rein in its ambitions by a cautious market. The group said yesterday it would offer institutions and brokers shares at 165p, against expectations of between 230p and 240p. The price values the group at Pounds 73.6m, compared with expectations in May of more than Pounds 90m. Mr Dan Sullivan, chairman, said the placing had been substantially oversubscribed. The issue will raise Pounds 37.7m, of which Pounds 6.8m will go to existing shareholders. Chamberlain will receive Pounds 27.2m net of expenses to reduce debt and buy out Pounds 5.4m of preference shares owned by Mr Sullivan and Legal &amp; General Ventures. Mr Sullivan, an American investor, formed the group in 1992 by acquiring the footwear materials businesses of Evode Group for Pounds 12m, with the backing of Legal &amp; General Ventures. Mr Sullivan said the company would not be affected by the decision to come to the market at a sharply reduced price. Existing investors had decided to sell fewer shares, leaving the company with the planned amount of net proceeds. Dealings are expected to begin on August 15. After the flotation, debt will represent some 65 per cent of shareholders' funds. Mr Sullivan is selling 1m of his 12.5m shares, leaving him with a 25 per cent stake. Legal &amp; General is selling only about half the number of shares originally envisaged and will retain a 21 per cent holding. The group recorded operating profits of Pounds 11.6m on sales of Pounds 118.3m for the year to April 2. This compared with profits of Pounds 12.4m and sales of Pounds 186.9m for the previous 18 months. The notional net dividend for the year was 7.3p. Historic earnings per share were 10.1p. Of the 22.9m shares being placed with institutions, some 7.7m will be subject to clawback for applications from brokers.</p>

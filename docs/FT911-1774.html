			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Technology: Barriers to British innovation British companies are prevented from getting innovative products to market due to a lack of skilled managers, a lack of knowledge of the marketplace and an ignorance of what the customer wants, according to a new study by consultants Arthur D Little. The Product Innovation Survey paints a stark picture of Britain's innovative capacity. The greatest concern for companies, the study reports, is getting a new product to market on time - 80 per cent of respondents said this was of concern. By comparison only 40 per cent said that reducing the costs of developing new products was a priority. And only 56 per cent said that improving the appeal of new products was an area where they were applying more effort. Conducted as part of a worldwide research project on product innovation, which will be available in about two months, the Arthur D Little survey questioned 70 of Britain's most innovative organisations. Most were manufacturers and about 90 per cent of them had turnovers of more than Pounds 100m. The questionnaires were completed by the chief executive or the technical director of the company, which, says Peter Scott-Morgan, associate director of Arthur D Little, is one positive indicator from the survey. 'There is a growing belief that the way you cope is through innovation,' he says. More negative were the measures used by companies to assess whether they were meeting their product development objectives. Some 86 per cent said sales volumes were important while 83 per cent rated profitability. Product quality only scored 48 per cent on the product development objective scale. But perhaps the most telling indicator was when the companies were given a list of 32 potential obstacles to innovation. Those that hindered innovation most were the lack of skilled managers and lack of knowledge about the marketplace, customers' and rivals.</p>

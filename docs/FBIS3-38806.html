			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Pierre Lefevre and Andre Riche interview with Foreign </F> Minister Willy Claes; place and date not given: "Don't Let Our  European Social Model Explode"]    [Text] [LE SOIR] You have just left the fanfare of the EU  presidency. But you get the feeling that it has again fallen  into a period of lethargy.    [Claes] I have never properly understood why the Greek  presidency has been condemned before it has begun. I believe  that for internal political reasons, elections, change of  government, the Greeks were late in preparing their presidency.  But when you see the busy agenda for the meeting of the Council  of Ministers on Tuesday and Wednesday [7 and 8 February], the  Greeks seem to be on their way to surpassing the reputation of  the Belgians who were already moving forward at exceptionally  high speed. There is a lot to be done, but with one inevitable  priority: The enlargement of the Union. We have just under one  month to conclude the negotiations.    [LE SOIR] Do you believe it will be possible to respect the  1  March deadline? And if not, will it matter?    [CLaes] Everything depends on what you mean by "respect" the  deadline. If we over-run by a few weeks, it is not serious.  If, on the other hand, we don't manage to conclude within two  or three months, that will be a serious setback. We would then  have to wait for the new European Parliament to meet which has  to give its assent. But I still believe it is possible to  conclude the negotiations within the deadlines set.    [LE SOIR] Certain candidate countries, Norway and Sweden,  are  facing negative public opinions. Do these countries require  special treatment?    [Claes] For Sweden, the situation is less clear. The latest  opinion polls show a majority in favor of membership.  Essentially, it has been stated and restated that we must not  start the exceptions game all over again. Either candidates  accept Maastricht and Community progress to date, or it will not  work. There is room for periods of transition and specific  regulations for specific problems. But there is no room for  permanent structural exceptions. It is not the EU which is  asking Sweden and Norway, and so on to join. The populations in  question must know what they want.    [LE SOIR] You are president of the European Socialist Party  and you have elections in four months. How are you going to  present the image of a more human Europe to your voters?    [Claes] We must explain to Europeans that we are in the  depths of a structural crisis and that virtually all the  problems we are currently facing go beyond national borders,  that the problems are interconnected, and that we therefore need  a voluntarist policy at international level. That is the only  way to avoid the explosion of our social model.    [LE SOIR] But are we not doing precisely the opposite? Is  not Europe an excuse for doing nothing?    [Claes] In all honesty, I do not believe so. Governments  everywhere are trying to boost the competitiveness of companies,  encouraging employers and employees to find more imaginative  labor solutions, promoting flexibility. We cannot say that  Jacques Delors' White Paper has not been acted upon.  Governments everywhere are adopting the same approach. That is  a sign of the reality of Europe.    [LE SOIR] And at the social level, do you feel that Europe  is  acting?    [Claes] We must be honest: It is a great weakness for  Europe. Miet Smet, during the Belgian presidency, obtained some  results. I am the last person to underestimate his work, but we  must not exaggerate the results either. The Twelve have  legislated on working hours, but a 48-hour week remains  possible. We have also legislated on youth employment, but it  is still possible to work at the age of 13 in Europe. It is  time Mrs. Thatcher and her consorts stopped criticizing us for a  savage social policy!</p>

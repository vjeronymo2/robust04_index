			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / UBS offers gold bars with a money-back guarantee Here it is, a product for the gold bug who has become nervous about the tendency of his favourite metal to lose value - a gold bar with a money-back guarantee. Union Bank of Switzerland, one of the leading players in the world gold bullion market, yesterday launched the bars with a view to putting a bit of zing back in the retail gold market. The bars come in weights of 100 grams, 500 grams and one kilogram, and the rules are simple. The buyer pays today's market price for the gold - about Dollars 380 per ounce - plus a premium of about 2 per cent, giving a price of about Dollars 1,245 for the 100g bar, Dollars 6,230 for 500g and Dollars 12,460 for 1kg. UBS guarantees to repay buyers at least Dollars 360 per ounce at any time up to the year 2000. Meanwhile, the bar is always negotiable, perhaps at a higher price if the market moves in the right direction. The advantage to the bank is obvious. It can shift some non-interest bearing gold in its coffers and replace it with interest-bearing money. And even if the gold price does go down - as Mr Andy Smith, UBS gold analyst is predicting - a simple hedging operation should enable the bank to avoid losses. 'It is definitely not our intention to lose money,' said Mr Bernhard Schnellmann, UBS vice-president of precious metals marketing in Zurich. Who is likely to buy the bars? Mr Schnellmann believes 'there is a certain indefinable mood in the investor community in favour of buying physical gold'. He added: 'It is not the big institutions, but the ordinary man in the street and some wealthy individuals. It comes with certain fears that they have.' UBS research shows that these fears are strongest in western Europe, even Switzerland. 'People feel that the time is not too bad for buying gold, but they have all either been hurt or they know someone who has been hurt by the falls in the gold price in recent years,' he explained. These bars are designed to overcome that final hesitation. Gold prices, Page 10</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Classic T'breds pulled up An experiment in opening the racing world to stock market punters ended yesterday with the news that Classic Thoroughbreds, the Irish bloodstock company, was going into liquidation. The group, floated in 1987 at 30p, said investors would receive about 5.25p per share. This will represent a significant loss to the group's 4,500 investors and the four men behind the concept: renowned trainer Mr Vincent O'Brien, and wealthy backers Robert Sangster, Michael Smurfit and John Magnier.</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar gains The dollar yesterday gained strength across the board against major currencies with the market anticipating the release next week of favourable US economic data, writes Philip Gawith. The dollar fell earlier on fears that Japanese political turmoil might jeopardise implementation of an economic stimulus package and prompt US calls for a stronger Yen to narrow the trade gap between the two countries. London dealers reported frantic early European trading, mainly the result of position squaring among players who were long on dollars and short on yen. After closing at Y111.510 in London on Thursday, the dollar fell to Y109.75 in early trading before recovering robustly as US investors bought the currency at lower levels when they entered the market. It finished only slightly lower than Thursday at Y111.210. Commenting on the dollar's strength, Mr Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ International in London said: 'The focus next week will be on US growth prospects and the numbers that are in prospect look like they are going to be on the strong side.' Another view in the market was that with the outlook for a fiscal stimulus to the Japanese economy having been removed by the latest political setbacks, a monetary boost through a cut in interest rates had become more likely. The dollar was also supported by rumours that an important financier had bought large amounts of dollars for yen and D-Marks. Dealers were looking forward to tomorrow's meeting between US Treasury secretary Mr Lloyd Bentsen and Japanese prime minister Mr Morihiro Hosokawa and finance minister Mr Hirohisa Fujii for further clues as to the way the dollar and yen will move. The market yesterday appeared to reconsider the significance of the Bundesbank's Thursday announcement cutting the minimum reserve requirements of banks. After strengthening nearly a pfennig on Thursday against the dollar to close in London at DM1.7358, the German unit yesterday gave up its gains to close at DM1.7474. It also closed weaker in London against sterling, finishing at DM2.6122 compared to Thursday's close of DM2.6029. Analysts said that although the Bundesbank was clearly trying to ease monetary conditions without cutting rates, the market had taken the view that rate-cuts would not be delayed. Bundesbank president Mr Hans Tietmeyer said that it was right to hold Bundesbank policy steady for now, but that it would not hold rates at current levels for longer than necessary. Sterling struggled to make real headway yesterday despite an encouraging batch of UK economic data. Fourth quarter 1993 GDP rose 0.7 per cent to give a year-on-year rise of 2.5 per cent, slightly higher than forecast. December bank and building society lending rose a higher than expected Pounds 4.1bn while the M4 measure of broad money grew a provisional 5.5 per cent in the year to December. Although the pound closed stronger against the D-Mark, it weakened against the dollar in London to Dollars 1.495 from Thursday's close of Dollars 1.4996. Traders said its subdued performance was a natural correction following its recent appreciation. Dealers said it remains well underpinned by solid UK fundamentals and speculation that Germany will relax monetary policy in the coming weeks. The Bank of England provided the UK money market with late assistance of Pounds 80m after earlier providing Pounds 2.256bn liquidity to the system. The revised forecast of the liquidity shortage was Pounds 2.35bn.</p>

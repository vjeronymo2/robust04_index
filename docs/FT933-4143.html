			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Israel and Palestinians End Hostility: Letters of recognition Following is the text of three letters, released in Jerusalem late last night, which form the mutual recognition agreement between the PLO and Israel. The letters are separate from the Declaration of Principles between Israel and the PLO providing for Palestinian self-rule which is to be signed in Washington on Monday: From Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, to Mr Yitzhak Rabin: Mr Prime Minister, The signing of the Declaration of Principles marks a new era in the history of the Middle East. In firm conviction thereof I would like to confirm the following PLO commitments: The PLO recognises the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security. The PLO accepts United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The PLO commits itself to the Middle East peace process, and to a peaceful resolution of the conflict between the two sides and declares that all outstanding issues relating to permanent status will be resolved through negotiations. The PLO considers that the signing of the Declaration of Principles constitutes an historic event, inaugurating a new epoch of peaceful co-existence, free from violence and all other acts which endanger peace and stability. Accordingly, the PLO renounces the use of terrorism and other acts of violence and will assume responsibility over all PLO elements and personnel in order to assure their compliance, prevent violations and discipline violators. In view of the promise of a new era and the signing of the Declaration of Principles and based on Palestinian acceptance of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, the PLO affirms that those articles of the Palestinian Covenant which deny Israel's right to exist and the provisions of the Covenant which are inconsistent with the commitments of this letter are now inoperative and no longer valid. Consequently, the PLO undertakes to submit to the Palestinian National Council for formal approval the necessary changes in regard to the Palestinian Covenant. Sincerely, Yassir Arafat, chairman, Palestine Liberation Organisation. From Mr Rabin to Mr Arafat: Mr Chairman, In response to your letter of September 9th 1993 I wish to confirm to you that, in light of the PLO commitments included in your letter, the government of Israel has decided to recognise the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people and commence negotiations with the PLO within the Middle East peace process. Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister of Israel. From Mr Arafat to Mr Johan Joergen Holst, Norwegian foreign minister: I would like to confirm to you that, upon signing of the Declaration of Principles, I will include the following positions in my public statements: In light of the new era marked by the signing of the Declaration of Principles, the PLO encourages and calls upon the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to take part in the steps leading to the normalisation of life, rejecting violence and terrorism, contributing to peace and stability and participating actively in the shaping of reconstruction, economic development and co-operation. Sincerely, Yassir Arafat, Chairman, Palestine Liberation Organisation.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following are summaries of media  reports on economic developments in Hong Kong monitored by Hong  Kong Bureau between 28 October and 26 November 1993. Source  information is provided in parentheses at the end of each item  or in the body of the item.  <H5>  HONG KONG INVESTMENT IN PRC </H5> <H3>  FEATURE: Hong Kong Firms Fund Mainland Infrastructure  Projects </H3>   Hong Kong companies are moving to satisfy China's acute  requirement for improved transport infrastructure and increased  energy capacity. Hopewell Holdings, China Light and Power, and  the New World Group are some of the companies that have  announced plans or are already involved in building the  infrastructure China requires to sustain a high level of  economic growth.    The English-Language daily THE STANDARD on 3 November  reports  on page 17 that China Light and Power, one of Hong Kong's two  electricity supply companies, is to build a HK$3.12 billion  power plant in Zhangpu, Fujian. According to a local official,  the plant will have a total capacity of 1200 Megawatts on  completion. The official said that China Light was "negotiating  with Chinese partners regarding the equity breakdown of the  joint venture." On 20 November, THE STANDARD reports on page 21  that the Lippo Group, which is controlled by the Indonesian  Riady family, had entered into an agreement with the Fujian  provincial government to construct a 120-Megawatt coal-fired  power plant. The first phase of construction includes port  facilities with the capacity to accommodate bulk carriers of up  to 50,000 tonnes. The plant is expected to become operational  by 1997.    Beijing-based ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE in Chinese at 1040 GMT on  7  November views Hopewell Holdings's activities in China's energy  and infrastructure sector. The press agency states that  Hopewell was the first overseas enterprise to invest in China's  power sector and notes that the company has launched a  succession of large-scale infrastructure construction projects  in recent years. Hopewell's interests in China include the  "Guangdong-Zhuhai Superhighway" and several power plants, and  the company is thought to have invested around HK$3.4 billion in  China.    In the shipping sector, the 23 November edition of the SOUTH  CHINA MORNING POST reports on page one that Swire Pacific and  Britain's Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P  &amp;  O) have each taken a 25-percent stake in a HK$615 million joint  venture to operate a container terminal in Shekou, Guangdong.  Swire Chairman Peter Sutch said the deal was a significant one  for Swire as it marked the company's return to its traditional  business, shipping, and place of business, China. The other  joint venture partners are China Merchants (Holdings) and China  Ocean Shipping Company, which own 32.5 percent and 17.5 percent  respectively. The terminal will be managed by P &amp; O from 1  January 1994.    Meanwhile, the 3 November issue of the PRC-affiliated daily  TA KUNG PAO reports on page 3 that the Bank of China Group is  continuing to finance mainland infrastructure projects in the  energy, transport, telecommunications, and raw material sectors  as "supply shortages" in these areas were slowing economic  development. According to the group's general manager in Hong  Kong, the Bank of China is now directly involved in over 2,500  projects on the mainland and has advanced $7 billion in loans,  39 percent of which are directed to energy projects such as the  Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant.  <H5>  China Property Offered for Sale in Hong Kong </H5>   A large number of properties in China are being offered for  sale in Hong Kong.

Since 1992, the Swire Group's shipping companies  and trading companies have been doing business in Shanghai.  They are developing shipping and container services and act as  auto distributors in Shanghai and East China.    It has been reported that Swire Industries has expanded its  production in China and plans to set up several beverage and  paint plants in other regions. (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE in  Chinese 0914 GMT 19 Nov 1993)  <H5>  PRC INVESTMENT IN HONG KONG </H5> <H3>  China Resources Begins Using New Container Terminal in  Kowloon </H3>   A new container terminal with an annual capacity of 1.2  million tonnes has been completed in Cheung Sha Wan, Kowloon.  It is China Resources' Ruifa Terminal, Hong Kong's largest  multipurpose terminal. Wei Kuan, general manager of the Huaxia  Enterprise Company Limited, said that China Resources had  invested HK$180 million in building two 6,209-square-meter  warehouses and a large container storage lot. The new terminal  is equipped with a 480-meter berth which allows two 10,000-tonne  freighters to dock simultaneously. (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE  in Chinese 1314 GMT 19 Nov 93)  <H5>  CITIC Pacific Takes Stake in Swire Pacific Subsidiary </H5>   Swire Pacific has sold one-third of its subsidiary Swire  Aviation Services to CITIC Pacific. As Swire Aviation's  principal asset is a 30-percent holding in Hong Kong Air Cargo  Terminals (HACTL), the HK$120 million deal gives the mainland  investment vehicle exposure to the air cargo franchise at Kai  Tak International Airport. Swire's finance director Peter  Johansen said that it was "important to have another China  shareholder involved at HACTL."    HACTL is a leading contender for the air cargo franchise at  Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok.

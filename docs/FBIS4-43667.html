			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ross Tieman and Philip Bassett: "CBI Confirms </F> Recovery and Takes a Look at Labour"]    [Text] Britain's recovery is now firmly established, and  apparently at little risk from a runaway consumer boom, the CBI  [Confederation of British Industry] said yesterday. It added  that a changed Labour Party deserved to be taken seriously.    The economy is moving into a "new era" in which the main  priorities are to "structure and shape the recovery," said  Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general. He said business  must also adapt to the changing political scene, fundamental  shifts in Labour policy and the impending emergence of a new  Labour leader. The director-general spoke against the  background of a reassuring assessment of key economic trends  from the CBI's quarterly distributive trades survey.    The survey, published yesterday, showed the rate of sales  growth in UK shops slowed slightly in May, yet remained ahead  year on year. Subdued activity in the high street continued to  disappoint retailers who have been seeking a strong upsurge for  four years, but have yet to see their expectations fulfilled.    Activity in the wholesaling sector remains brisker, but  Nigel  Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said  there was no sign that stocks were being built up in expectation  of a surge in high street spending. Rather, retailers most  vigorous customers appeared to be industrial concerns.    Sales on garage forecourts, meantime, were weaker than  expected. Mr Whittaker said: "Overall, sales for the time of  year remain average, although there has been little change since  the start of the year." He said that tax rises which took  effect in April, "do not appear to have had any real impact on  high street recovery."    Mr Davies, speaking to the British Printing Industries  Federation, said it was now accepted that the UK was out of  recession, but in advance of official earnings increase figures,  to be published by the Government today, he stressed again the  danger to the recovery from wage inflation. At the same time,  Mr Davies insisted business must recognise a changed Labour  Party under a new leader.    While the CBI's statement is far short of any endorsement  for  Tony Blair, it is significant both in terms of business  attitudes and the ability of the frontrunner for the party  leadership to appeal successfully to areas beyond the Labour  Party. Mr Davies said it was likely that business would be  facing a Labour party unemcumbered by baggage from its periods  in government and with a set of economic policies very different  from those of the past.    He said there were aspects of the new Labour programme  business did not like, including its support for the social  chapter, the minimum wage and legislation on company board  structures. In spite of these, he said: "It would be churlish  not to recognise the Labour Party has changed in important ways,  and is offering a set of policies which at the very least  deserve our attention."</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Bowthorpe rises to Pounds 31.2m Bowthorpe, the international electronic and electrical components group that made a Pounds 64.4m rights issue last December, lifted interim pre-tax profits 16 per cent from Pounds 27m to Pounds 31.2m. Turnover for the six months to June 30 rose 24 per cent, from Pounds 163.6m to Pounds 202.2m. Mr John Westhead, chief executive, said the results showed 'a satisfactory improvement'. The group, which has 83 companies operating in 11 business sectors, was continuing to look for acquisitions in niche businesses following last month's Pounds 4.4m purchase of Bohlin Instruments. The group, ungeared since the rights issue, generated Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 6.3m) from continuing operations. Net liquid funds at 30 June totalled Pounds 100.5m (Pounds 23.6m at December 31 1993). Acquisitions were behind the improvement in the US, which reported operating profits of Pounds 11.6m (Pounds 9.2m) and accounted for 37 per cent of the group total. Turnover rose from Pounds 51.6m to Pounds 80.6m. A good exports performance was behind the Pounds 1.3m increase in UK operating profits to Pounds 8.2m, 26 per cent of the group total. There were signs of recovery in Europe, where operating profits edged ahead by Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 9.4m, or 30 per cent of the total. The group said that, while outlook for the rest of the year was satisfactory, there was evidence of a slower US growth rate and margins continued to be under pressure in Europe. The group maintained first half margins at 15.1 per cent. Earnings per share were ahead 3.7 per cent from 8.91p to 9.24p after dilution for the rights issue. The interim dividend rises from 1.88p to 1.96p.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Accountancy Column: Mid-size marriage of convenience may set trend A RATHER unusual volume sits among the untouched tomes on international tax treaties and accounting for leases on the Financial Times's bookshelves. In the last few days, with the announcement of a merger between Stoy Hayward and Finnie's, two mid-sized firms, its spine has lost the normal covering of dust. The casual reader is in for a surprise when browsing through the book for the first time. Inside the glossy red cover, emblazoned with favourable reviewers' comments, the contents leave something to be desired, being nothing but blank white pages. Only on re-reading the title, does it click: for this is 'The Stoy Hayward Guide to Mergers in the Accountancy Profession', published as a joke in 1989, when many rival firms were in the midst of intensive discussions on coming together. Stoy, in contrast, had remained resolutely independent and aloof from the trend since its previous 'merger' back in 1974. Even then, it only took in a two-partner practice. Over the next 15 years it resolutely refused to entertain any further such activity. For afficianados of the new Stoy merger now underway, there are several additional ironic twists to the firm's book beyond the title and its lack of content. Its authors are John Piper - one of the partners brought in with his practice in 1974 - and Adrian Martin, the current managing partner, who was central to the merger with Finnie this month. One of the comments from a 'reviewer' on the back page - who says, 'We are proud to have been involved as sponsors for the research material in this excellent book' - is by Douglas Llambias, a consultant and professional matchmaker among accountants, who helped bring the two firms together over the last few months. But what Finnie's and Stoy's partners might be more nervous about today is the description of the contents printed inside the dust jacket of the book. The 'guide', it says, tongue firmly in cheek, demonstrates how to reach the right decision 'without being confused by non-important factors such as money'. Mergers, it argues, are being driven by rising rents and an anticipated shortage of good partners. They allow successful firms to achieve key features of their strategic plans. But the pitfalls are usually only discovered once they are perpetrated. The two sets of partners might be slightly uneasy at that particular jibe, but they cannot disagree entirely with its analysis. It would be too easy to dismiss the Stoy-Finnie link-up as another merger on uncomfortable terms. So many others in the last few years have been driven - despite the rhetoric of 'strategic reasons' - by the inherent weaknesses of at least one of the two firms involved, saddled perhaps with expensive potential litigation, high debts or a declining practice area. Now, with the impact of the recession far deeper, and competition between firms for clients so intense, for Stoy to merge is surely a way to boost its income. Finnie has several tempting quoted clients it could take on board, including the Body Shop. Equally, as critics have not been slow to point out, Stoy gained a reputation as something of a whizz-kid firm during the 1980s, becoming auditors to several high-profile companies now in disgrace, such as the Levitt Group and Polly Peck International. Perhaps the merger gives the firm a chance to redeem itself with a broader portfolio of safer clients. Several factors veer away from such a purely negative spin on the merger, however. The most significant is the fact that Finnie approached Stoy, not the other way round. Stoy is believed to have turned down a number of merger approaches over the last decade. Finnie was the only one that ever got to an advanced stage of discussions, and it claims that Stoy was its first choice among three attractive candidates. That choice only came after a detailed scrutiny, under confidentiality agreements, of documents including the partnership accounts, information on litigation and the technical working papers surrounding some of the more controversial audits. Similarly, if Stoy only wanted to gain clients, it would have to swallow the extra overheads of additional Finnie professionals, since at least on paper the new, enlarged firm claims there will be no significant job losses. If senior staff are removed in the coming months, that could also jeopardise the relationship with existing clients and risk them moving elsewhere. In spite of these arguments, it is, of course, possible that Finnie rather than Stoy needed to merge in order to survive. As the twentieth largest firm by fee income, it is no doubt suffering a squeeze on business, partly generated by aggressive tendering by some of its larger competitors. All the two firms will say - ambiguously - is that their profits are at about the same level. They do not deny that a larger client base was among the most attractive aspects of the merger. They also state that the combined firm is profitable, with low gearing and a strong balance sheet. But Mr Adrian Martin also makes a point of stressing that Stoy was attracted by the fact the merger would have little impact on the firm's position as number eight by size. The two firms suggest that their cultures and approaches to the provision of professional services are compatible. Whatever the truth in these arguments, there does certainly appear to be some strategic logic behind the merger, which was not always so clear in previous examples. Stoy is a London-based partnership, with associates around the country. For several years it has been considering how to expand from its West End office into the south-east. Finnie is essentially a south-eastern practice, which has built up a network of 10 offices in the M25 region around London. Its local strength makes it very attractive as a way for Stoy to expand in the area. At the same time, Stoy recognised a number of strong aspects of Finnie's operations that tied in with its own strengths: in insolvency, property work and corporate finance including work on the government's Business Expansion Scheme. Finnie makes no secret of the fact that it was finding it difficult coping with clients with operations outside the south-east. Without the nationwide network it now has, it was forced to refer these clients to independent accountancy practices in other parts of the country. How well the merger will last over time, in terms of both client and staff retention, cannot yet be judged. There has already been modest fall-out: Mr Chris Benbow, former senior partner at Finnie and a man intimately involved in the early discussions, left 'to pursue other interests' a few weeks ago. Finnie's Beverley office also remains outside the new network of associates around the UK. What seems certain is that the shake-out of mid-size firms is far from over. While different types of clients have different needs, the number of firms of similar size offering comparable services is probably unsustainable in such a competitive environment. Whatever the reasons, the number of mergers and acquisitions does not seem likely to diminish. A recent survey by Michael Page, financial recruitment consultants, suggested that a growing proportion of small practices anticipate selling out or merging. Last month, Ernst &amp; Young announced the acquisition of a 12 per cent stake in Kalchas, a small strategic consultancy firm. Another merger involving mid-size firms is rumoured to be announced shortly. The reasons for this activity may all be different, but the trend is the same. In another year, partners in Stoy Hayward may still be evaluating the success of the merger. But the pages of a second edition of the Stoy guide in two years's time could be somewhat more detailed.</p>

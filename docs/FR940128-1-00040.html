			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Thirty-five percent documented lack of adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleaning or sanitizing of processing equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Twenty-one percent documented processing equipment that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was not constructed so that it could be easily cleaned and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanitized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Eighteen percent documented processing equipment that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was not made of suitable materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Fifteen percent documented hand sanitizers that were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not kept at proper sanitizing levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Eighteen percent documented failure to have hand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanitizers available in the processing area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Thirty percent documented processing areas that were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not maintained in a clean and sanitary manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Forty-two percent documented processing areas with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exterior openings that were not sealed/covered properly to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent the entrance of pests or insects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11) Sixteen percent documented waste material not being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collected/covered in suitable containers or not being disposed of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (12) Twenty-three percent documented handling of finished  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product in a manner that did not preclude contamination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (13) Twenty-two percent documented employees not taking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary precautions to avoid food contamination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During fiscal years 1991&hyph;92, FDA conducted abbreviated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections of nearly all domestic manufacturers in its seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishment inventory. These inspections provide data on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanitation practices and conditions that are generally consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the above findings (Ref. 62). Examples of these data are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Sixteen percent of firms had problems with the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanitation condition of their processing areas. (This percentage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is lower than for item 9 above because the universe is all firms,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not just firms with deficiencies.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Nineteen percent of firms did not clean and sanitize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their processing areas or equipment throughout the day's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production. (This matches most closely with item 4 above but is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lower, presumably for the reason stated in the previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numbered paragraph.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Twenty-eight percent of firms had employees that were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not following proper sanitation practices in processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities. (This figure does not precisely match any of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> items listed above because the EIR's break employee practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> down into specific categories, such as the wearing of hair nets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some categories involve relatively minor matters, others are more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant. Findings with respect to these employee practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were not listed above for the sake of brevity.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Twenty percent had employees that were not following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proper sanitation practices for packaging and finished product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage. (The parenthetical observations in the previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numbered paragraph apply here as well.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Thirty-six percent of firms either lacked hand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanitizers in their processing areas or had sanitizers that were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not kept at proper sanitizing levels. (This finding is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent to a combination of items 7 and 8 above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Surprisingly, this finding is roughly the same as 7 and 8 added  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> together, even though it includes all processors rather than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors with deficiencies.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sanitation problems found by NMFS during the operation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its fee-for-service inspection program for seafood manufacturers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as described earlier, are generally consistent with FDA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> findings. Entrants into the NMFS program undergo initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanitation surveys by NMFS and are checked for sanitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices thereafter. NMFS' data show significant sanitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies during the initial surveys (Ref. 35, p. 40). Some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the most common for 1989 include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Sixty-four percent of plants had discrepancies relating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to proper cleaning and sanitizing of product contact surfaces or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, containers, or utensils after use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Fifty-one percent of plants had discrepancies relating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to design, materials, or construction that prevented their being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained in a sanitary manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Forty-five percent of plants had discrepancies relating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to design of equipment, containers, and utensils so that they did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not provide protection from contaminants and could not be readily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleaned and effectively sanitized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Forty-three percent of plants had discrepancies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relating to improper storage of equipment, litter, waste, uncut  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weeds, and grass.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

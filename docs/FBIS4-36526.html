			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Brother Faysal al-Husayni, member of the  Palestinian National Authority, yesterday said that the  Palestinian leader, President Yasir 'Arafat, could arrive in  Jericho at the end of this month. Al-Husayni added that  'Arafat's arrival depends on the results of today's meeting  between Palestinian officials and officials representing donor  countries in Paris.    The donor countries have pledged over $2 billion to the  Palestinian self-ruled areas over a period of five years, but so  far only $5 million have come from the United States. The  latter had promised to give $500 million.    In a statement to the press, al-Husayni said that he could  not give a precise date for 'Arafat's arrival in Jericho, but  added: I hope that this will be in the second half of this month.    In reply to a question on whether the timing of 'Arafat's  arrival is linked to the conference of donor countries in Paris,  al-Husayni said: There is a link of this kind. [passage omitted]</p>

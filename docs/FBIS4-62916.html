			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Krinitskiy, expert of the State Duma </F> Committee for CIS Affairs and Ties With Compatriots, under  "Authority" rubric: "A New Parliament -- a New Course? What  Russian Parliamentarians Observing Conduct of Ukrainian  Elections Saw"]    [Text] The work of the first session of the new Ukrainian  Supreme Council, which has just been formed has started in Kiev.  Over 500 international observers monitored the conduct of the  early elections that took place. They represented the United  Nations, the CSCE Parliamentary Assembly, the Council of Europe,  the European Parliament, NATO, other organizations, and  individual countries. Our compatriots were also among them.    A Russian delegation of eight deputies from various factions  and the same number of State Duma experts observed the conduct  of the Ukrainian Supreme Council elections. It was headed by  Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the Committee for CIS Affairs  and Ties With Compatriots. The Russian parliamentarians worked  in Kiev, Donetsk, Kharkov, Simferopol, Odessa, Lvov, and  Uzhgorod.    Our observers did not discover any serious violations  capable  of influencing the outcome of the elections and about which the  Russian and world communities should have been warned. For them  it was not such an important task to keep an eye on the ballot  boxes. The Russian parliamentarians' aim was to get the feel of  the Ukrainian political situation and, based on the experience  gained, dealings with voters, and conversations with state and  political leaders with diverse views, to help the State Duma  establish a line of conduct and recommend a particular political  course in Russian-Ukrainian relations.    One of the Russian parliamentarians' main conclusions was  that the Ukrainian elections did not take place in conditions of  an acute socioeconomic crisis, which is so painfully familiar to  us. Accordingly, both the first and second rounds of voting were  won by candidates whose platforms were based on severe criticism  of the old nomenklatura-bureaucratic regime and on promises to  conduct a resolute struggle against social injustice and  corruption in power structures in order to improve the people's  lives and punish the guilty in the country's present grave  situation; on promises to get away from the extremes of the  epoch of fighting for sovereignty and absolute independence and  to restore and strengthen trade and economic relations with  Russia and the CIS as a whole.    A characteristic feature of the elections that were held was  that both rounds of voting, like the recent Russian elections,  showed the complete groundlessness of apparently irrefutable  predictions and easily destroyed the myths being persistently  inculcated into people's consciousness.    The main result and the first surprise to lovers of  predictions was that the first round of elections was valid  everywhere. While the second round provided the necessary  number of people's deputies (this is precisely what they are  still called in Ukraine). Of the 450 seats in parliament 338  have been filled, which by law enables it to start full-scale  work. The 112 vacant seats will be filled after repeat  elections, which are due to take place in two months.    Voters turned out and dispelled the myth of the Ukrainian  people's absolute passivity. To the surprise of many and even  to the confusion of some, three-fourths of the country's  citizens expressed their attitude to the candidates. As early  as the first round yet another prediction -- about the clear  domination of voters' centrist sentiments -- was dispelled.  Centrist reformers, as in Russia recently, definitely did not  achieve their expected success. Although Leonid Kuchma,  Vladimir Lanovoy, and Sergey Golovatyy, their leaders from the  interregional bloc for reforms, won convincingly in the first  round, this was exclusively through their very high personal  ratings. After all, even Stepan Khmara, the odious  national-radical and leader of the Ukrainian Conservative  Republican Party (he is being called the Ukrainian  Zhirinovskiy), also won easily in the first round. Petr  Simonenko and Aleksandr Moroz, leaders of the Communist Party  and the Socialist Party, also won outright.    In general, contrary to all forecasts (the analogy with our  elections again comes to mind) left-wing forces achieved  undoubted success. Moreover, their lead over the other parties  is very substantial. Thus, around half of the 338 elected  deputies consider themselves to be independent, that is to say  nonparty. Of the remainder, the Communists obtained 86 seats  and their allies -- the Socialist Party and the Peasant Party --  another 32 seats. Next comes the "Ukraina" bloc of  national-democratic parties, dominated by Rukh, and after that  the placemen of ruling structures or the "parties of power," as  they are called, and only then the centrists and  radical-nationalists. Yet another myth was shattered. Prior to  the start of the election race the local press marked down the  "government parties" (several of them under various names) as  supposed favorites and themselves maintained this myth. But  now, having suffered an obvious lack of success, their leaders  are stating that it is not a defeat but a retreat to previously  prepared positions. Observers believe that this is simply an  attempt to "make the best of a bad situation."    At the same time the definite successes of highly extreme  forces in the western oblasts are sounding the warning bells.  Thus, UNA-UNSD (Ukrainian National Assembly-Ukrainian National  Self-Defense) have gotten three of their leaders into  parliament. Generally the rivalry among among a multitude of  right-wing nationalist organizations and movement was won by the  Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists. It obtained a total of 23  seats.    Admittedly it is still premature to make a final count. The  percentage of "independent" deputies is too great. It cannot be  ruled out that many of them will change their political  orientation inside parliament. A more precise disposition of  political forces can be determined only some time after the  Supreme Council has started its work, when deputies' factions  will be formed finally. It should not be forgotten that in the  initial stages of the election campaign most candidates called  themselves "independent" and it was only later, sensing that  "one man does not make an army," that many of them took seats on  a party platform of some kind. Not for nothing do most  observers claim that, despite the absence of voting according to  party lists, what took place in Ukraine was a multiparty  election under a majority system. Incidentally, members of 39  registered parties and associations with an extremely diverse  spectrum of convictions and platforms started the election  marathon.    Still, our observers have no doubt that the vector of public  sentiments in Ukraine is obviously moving in a pro-Russian  direction. This is not a speculative claim; the fact was  confirmed beyond doubt by a Ukrainian national poll. Russia's  position must be aimed at strengthening ties with Ukraine, but  without harming its national and state dignity, on the basis of  mutual respect and advantage.</p>

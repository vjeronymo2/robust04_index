			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / UK Company News: On a second flight with the 146 - Profile of Bob Bauman, the new chairman of BAe One of the few black spots in the winning business career of Mr Bob Bauman, outgoing chief executive of SmithKline Beecham, the drugs company, was in his dealings a decade ago with British Aerospace. Mr Bauman was chairman and chief executive of Avco, the US aerospace company, which supplied engines to the BAe 146 regional jet aircraft. The relationship between the 146 and its engines was not a happy one. The engines were underpowered, overheated and unreliable. Both companies were the subject of at least one law suit in the US over the unreliability of the aircraft. Mr Bauman has since fared rather better than has the 146 aircraft, which is still struggling to live down the reputation it earned in the 1980s. When, in 1986, Mr Bauman was scooped up by Beecham, then a diversified health and personal care company care, his foray into defence looked like just another stepping stone in the career of a quintessential professional manager. Mr Bauman quickly became known in the drugs industry for his charm and capacity for hard work. He looks younger than his 62 years and has a penchant for 'feelgood' business-speak gathered, perhaps, from an MBA at Harvard in 1955 and 23 years climbing the ranks at General Foods, the New York-based consumer goods company. His stint there included selling Maxwell House coffee and Gaines dog foods. Now, 7 1/2 years working in London have left him with a reputation as the pharmaceuticals industry's Mr Restructuring. When he took over as chairman of Beecham in September 1986, he inherited a company which appeared to have lost its way. Once a byword for healthcare products, it had diversified with mixed fortunes into foods and cosmetics. These activities were eventually to be sold, but Mr Bauman's lasting great achievement was the successful merger of two sprawling business empires, Beecham and SmithKline Beckman of the US. At the time of the merger, SmithKline Beecham had annual sales of Pounds 3.7bn and pre-tax profits of Pounds 544m. Its 1993 results, scheduled to be presented on February 22, should show sales at Pounds 6.2bn for profits of Pounds 1.2bn, according to forecasts from James Capel, the stockbroker. Strong though that record is, taking over at the helm of British Aerospace will present Mr Bauman with an entirely different set of business problems. The company has already sold non-core businesses such as cars and executive jets. A merger with GEC has long been rumoured and remains a possibility. What is certain is that his personality and style are strikingly different from those of Mr John Cahill, the man he replaces as chairman. Mr Bauman, a year younger than Mr Cahill, is a veteran of three different industries. He is an American running an Anglo-US company from London. Mr Cahill spent his entire career before BAe at one company, conglomerate BTR. And during his two years at BAe he stirred some controversy by becoming known as the Briton who ran a UK company from a US base.</p>

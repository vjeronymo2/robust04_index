			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Observer: Out of the cold UK foreign secretary Douglas Hurd has muffed another chance to wave the flag for British industry on his state visit to Brazil this week. No sooner had his feet hit the tarmac, than he was whisked away to open a new plant making diesel engines under licence from a German-owned subsidiary of BMW. To be fair to Hurd, the deal to build Land Rover engines was clinched before the Germans took over. Even so, if he had been a couple of weeks earlier, he could have opened a proper British factory - TI Group's new plant in Curitiba which makes refrigeration parts.</p>

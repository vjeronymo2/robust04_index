			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 24 (CNS) -- There have so far been  175,000 three type foreign-funded enterprises registered in  China since the reform and opening to the outside world 14 years  ago. Nearly 75,000 such enterprises meanwhile had their licence  revoked with an average of 535 each year, according to a  national meeting on administration of registration of  foreign-funded enterprises which was being held in Hefei, Anhui  Province.    Among the foreign-funded enterprises registered in China,  Sino-foreign joint venture enterprises make up 107,000,  Sino-foreign cooperative enterprises 25,500, and solely  foreign-funded enterprises 34,000. The official in charge of  the State Administration for Industry and Commerce said that  there were a handful of the three types of foreign-funded  enterprises in poor condition. Problems facing these  enterprises included first, a false joint venture pattern in  which a foreign party was only responsible for handling the  necessary procedures without offering capital while in some  cases the Chinese party provided foreign exchange or the foreign  party offered renminbi as capital for joint venture.    Second, a few foreign businessmen made use of the  preferential policy on foreign investment to commit smuggling,  profiteering and capitalizing on the business licence for  swindling under the guise of undertaking foreign-funded  enterprises.    Third, some foreign investors made declaration of high  prices  which should have been lower while some others promoted the sale  of poor quality equipment at a higher price.    Fourth, there was still over 40 percent of capital not in  place while some investment existed in name only.    Fifth, some three types of foreign-funded enterprises ran  illegally while some others even undertook pornographic business  and gambling.    Enterprises in the red accounted for over 40 percent of the  total each year since 1990 with the number of enterprises  suffering a loss reaching 42.5 percent of the total in 1992.    Problems existing in foreign-funded enterprises were partly  attributed to the government, the administrative as well as law  enforcement departments, because they paid less attention to the  quality of foreign-funded enterprises. In some cases local  authorities worked out or adopted their own policy in violation  of the state policy on and regulations of the foreign-funded  enterprises.</p>

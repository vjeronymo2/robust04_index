			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Observer: Unsplit blood By happy coincidence a speech from the Governor of the Bank of England criticising companies that combine the jobs of chairman and chief executive was delivered on the very day that Barclays formally announced it will continue to do just that. Andrew Buxton, who takes over as Barclays' chief executive on Friday, will also become chairman at the end of the year. Robin Leigh-Pemberton told the IoD that companies should prevent the concentration and abuse of power, for example by separating 'as a general rule' the role of chief executive and chairman. 'No-one could seriously suggest that the current frameworks and arrangements are ideally suited to the complexities of our current corporate life,' said he. No-one, that is, except a bank where blood is not considered a disadvantage to management preferment.</p>

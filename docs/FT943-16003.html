			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Labatt to take stake in Mexican brewing unit John Labatt, the Canadian brewing and entertainment group, is expected to announce today that it is buying a stake in the brewing arm of Femsa, Mexico's biggest beverage company. The deal is understood to be valued at about CDollars 1bn (Dollars 714m). Labatt declined to comment yesterday after trading in its shares was halted on the Toronto Stock Exchange but the two companies have scheduled press conferences today. Labatt, best known in the UK for its Rolling Rock beer and in North America for its part-ownership of the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team, has restructured to focus on beer and broadcasting. It has been seeking another international investment to complement its brewing interests in the US, UK and Italy. Last month, Labatt unveiled plans to spin off its sport and live entertainment businesses. The Toronto branch of the Bronfman family held a controlling stake in Labatt until early last year, when its shares were sold to the public. Femsa's brewing arm, Cerveceria Cuauhtemoc Moctezuma, has just under half of Mexico's beer market, worth about USDollars 3bn a year. Philip Morris, the US consumer products group which controls Miller Brewing, acquired 8 per cent of Femsa's stock in 1992. Femsa held talks with Miller about an investment in the brewing division, but these have apparently been unsuccessful.</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> NEW KIDS PRESIDE AT RITE OF PASSAGE  </P> <P> Remember those stadium-filling weddings the Rev. Sun Myung Moon used to  perform? Something similar happened on Friday at the New Kids on the Block show  at Dodger Stadium. But it was more like a mass bas mitzvah or a confirmation,  as thousands of pre- and barely pubescent girls experienced a major modern rite  of passage: their first pop concert.  </P> <P> The shrieking, the staging, the lasers, the fireworks, the heavily pitched  souvenirs, what could be heard of the music and -- most importantly -- the  puppy-love sex-tease of the New Kids, bare-chested and wiggling their rears. .  . . It'll all be part of the conversations that Nychol Thornton, 13, and her  sister Jennifer, 12, said would fill the schoolyard at Sandberg Junior High in  Glendora today. (For the record, both said they like hard rockers Faith No More  better, but that their favorite New Kids are Jonathan and Joe, respectively.)  </P> <P> Of course, this was also a rite of passage for many accompanying parents. Some  marked the occasion by waiting glumly in the parking lot, others sitting  silently with their children, bemused and/or perturbed, with fingers in ears.  But Anthony and Anita Marco of Lomita beamed proudly as daughter Mandy, 10,  jumped and clapped and screamed.  </P> <P> "I've never seen her unwind like this," said her dad. He reminisced about his  first pop concert -- a late-'60s Santana show in Philadelphia -- and from his  parental perspective was glad that Mandy had this relatively innocent setting  for her initiation.  </P> <P> "The New Kids are leading them in a safe direction," he said. "These kids can  loosen up without all the cultural things we went through in the '60s and  '70s."  </P> <P> They also did it without the food fights of their older siblings that marred  concerts here by Depeche Mode last month and the Cure last summer. But just  wait until adolescence sets in. STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

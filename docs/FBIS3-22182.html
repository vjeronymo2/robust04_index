Aliou Salah: ``First International Conference </F> on Water: Sounding the Alarm''--first paragraph is LIBERTE  introduction]    [Text] A vital element, water is getting increasingly  scarce.    According to statistics, Algerian water consumption  increased  from 1,770 cubic meters [m[.sup]3[/]] per person per year in  1955 to 689 m[.sup]3[/] per person per year now.    For future years, the most optimistic forecasts count on  only  332 m[.sup]3[/] per person per year. The availability of this  precious resource, essential for economic and social  development, is therefore quite restricted and will become still  more so if part of it becomes unavailable because of the urban,  industrial, and agricultural population or again because of  constant daily waste. Add to this runaway demographic growth.  The mobilization, transportation, distribution of water, and the  preservation of its quality require considerable financial  resources, which the state cannot go on providing forever at the  expense of other economic activities. Mr. Zebarene, general  inspector at the Ministry of Equipment, told Channel 3 that if  we are to achieve savings, ``we cannot continue to manage our  resources as we are doing now.'' ``Economic tools that deter  aggression against the water environment and provide incentives  to save water and make the necessary investments,'' are  essential, he said, adding that ``everybody's good will alone is  not enough.'' To finance the water sector, the Ministry of  Equipment stated that it would be desirable to adopt rates  reflecting Algeria's economic realities. For instance, faced  with the increasing scarcity of what is considered as a source  of life, optimum management of our water resources remains a  must. To this end, a conference covering various themes will  take place today and tomorrow at the headquarters of the  National Data-Processing Systems Company [ENSI].    ``Water resources, the fragility of water, water as an  economic product, and the organization of the water sector,''  such are the four themes to be considered by the conference.  This first conference, chaired by Mr. Mokdad Sifi, minister of  equipment, and attended by the governors of the principal  Algerian towns, will consider the management of the public  service, the economics and organization of water production, and  water distribution.    In addition to these specific themes, the conference will  also consider questions having to do with pollution, storage,  the collection of underground and surface water, and the role of  water in the national economy.</p>

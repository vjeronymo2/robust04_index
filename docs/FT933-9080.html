			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / BSkyB predicts surge in satellite dish sales BRITISH Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television company, is privately claiming a significant boost in satellite dish sales in advance of the launch of its new subscription channel package at the start of next month. Internal estimates say satellite dish sales have been running at more than 15,000 a week since the start of July. If confirmed, this would be the first evidence that new subscribers, at least, are not being put off by the move to subscriptions on virtually all channels. A total of 14 channels, some of them new from the US, will be included in the subscription package. But this is a fundamental shift in the nature of satellite television and its economics. It will also mean that viewers will have to pay for channels that are at present free to those with satellite dishes. The package is being launched with a number of special deals - Pounds 3.99 a month for those subscribing before the end of December, Pounds 6.99 a month thereafter. A combined basic package plus sport will cost Pounds 11.99 although the new subscription channels will be available at no extra charge to those already paying for a movie channel. The cost of the entire BSkyB package will be Pounds 19.99 a month. Staff at BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times holds a significant stake, are happy with the initial response. What is less clear is how those who already have satellite television, but do not pay for a movie channel, will react to the new charges. A significant loss of viewers who do not want to pay could occur. BSkyB figures for dish sales last month run counter to official figures from Barb, the body which produces official viewing figures. Barb believes there were 2.477m satellite dishes in the UK on July 1 and by August 1 this had risen to 2.501m. GfK, the marketing research group, says that by June 26 total dish ownership, excluding Northern Ireland, stood at 2.228m - an increase of 27,000 on the previous month.</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Prospects for franc deteriorate THE FRENCH franc remained under considerable pressure against the D-Mark yesterday, as foreign exchange dealers took a more pessimistic view of the prospects of the currency avoiding devaluation, writes James Blitz. The currency markets were again the scene of the thin trading associated with the Christmas period. The dollar, for example, lost more than a pfennig against the D-Mark, finishing at DM1.5550, as a handful of players had a big impact on the leading exchange rates. The US unit improved a little in New York to end at DM1.5570. Trading in the D-Mark cross rates remained jittery. The yen, French franc and Italian lira were all sold at one time or another against the German currency, and dealers continued to take the view that the Bundesbank will not lower interest rates in a hurry. By far the biggest problems confronted the franc. Although trading was quiet in the European morning, the French currency came under renewed pressure after France's leading state-owned banks responded to recent rises in money market rates by lifting their base rates by 25 basis points. The currency was also besieged by rumours that the news conference to be held today by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, will be the stage for a dramatic announcement. Among the subjects rumoured to be on the agenda were the resignation of Mr Beregovoy, the resignation of Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, and a rise in French official rates. None of these rumours could be confirmed. The franc was unchanged at FFr3.4170 against the D-Mark at the end of European trading. But in US trading it fell further, to below FFr3.42. Another factor worrying dealers was that the franc fell to 77 percentage points on the ERM divergence indicator. Under the Basle-Nyborg agreement, it is presumed that a central bank must defend its currency either by inter-vention or by increasing int-erest rates if it falls below the 75 percentage-point level. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London, believes there has been a striking deterioration in sentiment over the French currency in recent days. He thinks that the currency remains strong on fundamental economic grounds. 'But it will be very difficult for the franc to survive without a devaluation, either in this calendar year or the next,' he said. Mr Christian Dunis, an economist at Chemical Bank in London, believes France must now tighten monetary policy to show its willingness to defend the currency. 'The lesson of sterling's devaluation is that if a central bank does not defend its currency promptly, devaluation is unavoidable,' he said. Yesterday's dollar fall was due to technical factors alone. US industrial production in November rose by 0.4 per cent, exactly in line with forecasts.</p>

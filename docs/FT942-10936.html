			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / The Nature of Things: Is the quark hunt over? Momentous news last week from the Fermilab atom smasher outside Chicago: physicists have discovered the top quark, the last of 12 subatomic building blocks believed to make up the whole material universe. Or have they? The nature of the top quark - it disintegrates into a shower of other particles less than one billion-billion-billionth of a second after its creation - makes it impossible to 'discover' in the traditional Eureka sense. Its existence has to be deduced by an extremely complicated mathematical analysis of millions of collisions in the Fermilab accelerator, looking for patterns that could only come from the creation and immediate disintegration of a top quark. The evidence, to be published as a 200-page scientific paper by a team of 440 physicists, shows that there is still some doubt. Statistical analysis gives 1-in-400 odds that the Fermilab patterns occurred by chance and had nothing to do with the top quark. Although 399-in-400 may seem good enough odds to claim the top quark's discovery, some scientists would like to see more convincing evidence for such a fundamental finding. They are well aware that Carlo Rubbia and colleagues at Cern, the European particle physics centre near Geneva, thought they had found the top quark 10 years ago - and then turned out to be victims of coincidence and wishful thinking. If the quark hunt has been successfully concluded, it is one of the most overdue discoveries in science. Physicists have been looking for the top quark since creating its companion, the bottom quark, at Fermilab in 1977. It will fill the last gap in the 12 fundamental particles - six quarks and six leptons - which, according to the 'standard model' theory, make up all matter that has existed in the universe. To appreciate the significance of the quark, think back to the 1860s when Dmitri Mendeleev drew up his periodic table of the 92 chemical elements from hydrogen to uranium, by systematically studying their properties. The underlying reasons for the patterns revealed in the periodic table remained a mystery until the discovery at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century of the particles that make up the atom: the electron, proton and neutron. Then scientists realised how the chemistry of each element - the way atoms join with other atoms to form molecules - depended on its atomic structure. The mid-20th century view of the atom, with negatively-charged electrons orbiting around a nucleus made up of positively-charged protons and uncharged neutrons, was correct, so far as it went. Scientists today still regard the electron as a fundamental indivisible particle - one of the six leptons. But protons and neutrons have their own internal structure. Each proton and neutron consist of three point-like particles which Murray Gell-Mann, the great Californian physicist, named quarks in 1964, after the line 'Three quarks for Muster Mark' in James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. The idea of quarks and leptons came from studying patterns among the myriad of short-lived particles detected in cosmic radiation from space and created on earth in atom smashers. Their properties could be explained if they derived from combinations of quarks and/or leptons, just as the periodic table had been explained in terms of protons, neutrons and electrons. According to the standard model, both the six quarks and the six leptons come in three sets of twins. The quarks bear the whimsical names 'up' and 'down', 'strange' and 'charm', 'top' and 'bottom'; the leptons are 'electron' and 'electron neutrino', 'muon' and 'muon neutrino', 'tau' and 'tau neutrino'. But the theory sheds no light on why there should be 12 building blocks nor on their peculiar distribution of masses. Whereas individual leptons can exist free, quarks are always bound together with other quarks in either pairs or triplets. The proton, for example, can be seen as a tiny bag in which two up quarks and one down quark can wander freely but from which they cannot escape. All ordinary matter familiar to us on earth is made up from the up and down quarks and electrons. Neutrinos are ghostly particles, which pervade the universe but are almost impossible to detect because they carry no electric charge or mass. The other, heavier quarks and leptons exist only for tiny fractions of a second under ordinary temperatures and pressures but they probably play an important role in much more extreme conditions - inside a neutron star, for instance, or in the early universe soon after the Big Bang. Although the discovery of the top quark completes the list of particles that can come together to create matter, it is far from the end of the story. The universe also contains non-matter particles performing other functions, such as transmitting forces. Best known is the photon which carries the electromagnetic force. Quarks are held together in the atomic nucleus by gluons which transmit the strong nuclear force. The most wanted particle of all, after the top quark, will be the Higgs boson, which is believed to play a role in giving all the other particles their mass - in non-technical terms, their weight or substance. Cern wants to spend Pounds 1bn building the world's most powerful atom smasher to find it. If further experiments at Fermilab this year confirm the almost-discovery of the top quark, supporters of the Standard Model will be highly relieved that a theory of matter built up over three decades has not collapsed. But it leaves them with many more mysteries to solve.</p>

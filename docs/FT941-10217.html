			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Triplex Lloyd in Pounds 6.5m disposal Triplex Lloyd, the industrial engineering group, is disposing of further building products subsidiaries in a deal worth Pounds 6.5m cash. JBS Industries is acquiring Hillaldam Coburn, Hillaldam Coburn (Ireland), Solair and Nico, which in the year to March 31 reported combined operating profit of Pounds 500,000 on sales of Pounds 11.3m. Net assets at completion are expected to be about Pounds 4.3m. The proceeds of the disposal will be used to develop its core activities - automotive and power - and reduce debt. Losses of Pounds 2.3m at its Hinchliffe subsidiary meant that in the six months to end-September group pre-tax profits were cut by 56 per cent to Pounds 1.45m.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRWINDALE AGAIN SUES DEVELOPMENT SPECIALIST  </P> <P> Despite some conciliatory talk by city officials last week, the city has filed  another lawsuit against Fred Lyte, its former redevelopment consultant.  </P> <P> In papers filed in Pomona Superior Court, the city contends that Lyte  "fraudulently (concealed) material facts about a development project . . .  which otherwise would have been rejected" in order to collect an extra fee  under his contract.  </P> <P> The suit also charged Lyte with trying to disrupt the city's negotiations with  the Los Angeles Raiders to build a $150 million football stadium in Irwindale  by spreading rumors and making false charges.  </P> <P> Lyte, part of the negotiating team that produced the initial accord with the  Raiders, characterized the suit this week as "pure baloney, tailored to harass  me."  </P> <P> </P> <P> City Blocks Payments  </P> <P> Since the City Council dismissed the consultant last December, the city has  widely accused him of creating discord in the city and blocked the payment of  more than $1 million in bills he has submitted to Irwindale. The city has also  filed a lawsuit seeking more than $2 million in damages, claiming that Lyte had  violated a provision in his contract forbidding him to recommend to the city  projects in which he had a financial interest.  </P> <P> In a bitter exchange with city officials last month, Lyte charged the first  suit "will be laughed out of court" because he was never a city employee. The  laws that define conflicts of interest may not apply to him, he suggested.  </P> <P> Lyte, who has called for an investigation of Mayor Patricio Miranda by the Los  Angeles County district attorney, charged that, since Miranda became the mayor  last year, the city has been "turned over to" a group of lawyers and  consultants who are concerned only about personal gain.  </P> <P> Charles Martin, who serves as city manager and city attorney, suggested at last  week's City Council meeting that the city would be willing to reach an  out-of-court settlement with Lyte, if the fired consultant would be  "reasonable" in his dealings with the city.  </P> <P> The new legal action centers on the creation of a strip mall two years ago at  the intersection of Irwindale Avenue and Arrow Highway, a block from City Hall.  </P> <P> According to the complaint against Lyte, the Hopkins Development Co. had agreed  to build a shopping center on a two-acre lot on Arrow Highway, but only if an  adjacent 7,000-square-foot lot at the southeast corner of the busy intersection  could be included in the package.  </P> <P> The smaller lot, with a 50-foot frontage on Irwindale Avenue, is owned by  Miranda.  </P> <P> According to the complaint against Lyte, Miranda had refused to lease the  property to Hopkins because his constituents would perceive such an arrangement  by a city official as a conflict of interest. Following the advice of Martin,  Miranda "would not lease or sell his land to any party who would be involved in  the shopping center development," the complaint says.  </P> <P> But principals of Hopkins, the development company, three years ago formed a  general partnership, and negotiated a lease with Miranda. The complaint says  Miranda did not know that he was dealing with a Hopkins subsidiary, and Lyte  withheld that information to collect a 3% fee for bringing a new development to  the city.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Restaurant Property  </P> <P> Miranda's property, once the site of Miranda's taco stand, called Pudgy's, now  holds a Jack-in-the-Box outlet that shares a parking lot with a 10-store strip  mall.  </P> <P> "The city did not discover the true facts relating to Lyte's fraudulent  concealment of information or breach of fiduciary duty until April, 1989," the  complaint says.  </P> <P> Lyte, who has accused Miranda of jeopardizing the Raiders deal and causing "a  virtual halt in the (Irwindale) industrial development program," scoffed at the  charges.  </P> <P> He said that he has seen copies of correspondence between Miranda and Hopkins  in early 1987, discussing the mayor's lease with Irwindale Associates. "They're  using city money to try to run me out of business, and that just isn't going to  work," Lyte said.  </P> <P> The Pudgy's property has also become an issue in a recall campaign initiated by  some Irwindale residents against Miranda and Councilman Salvador Hernandez.  According to a petition drawn up by resident Brenda Marin, Miranda tried to  "extort additional rent for the Pudgy's property through use of governmental  pressure."  </P> <P> Miranda did not respond to telephone messages. Marin would not comment on her  recall petition.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Ken Reich contributed to this story.  </P></p>

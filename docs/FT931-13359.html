			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Colour your thinking - Computing / Robin Brooker looks at innovative software designed to help managers sift data IN THE pre-computer age it was often said that the business manager's problems were aggravated by lack of data. Now the reverse is true. Managers suffer from an overload of data. This plethora of data has reached such proportions that often the managers have difficulty seeing the wood for the trees. When it comes to decision making or problem solving it is not raw data but information that is needed. Information and data are not synonymous. Data is merely the building blocks of information: it is the interpretation of data that provides information. Only when we bring together these pieces of information are we able to distinguish a recognisable pattern. There are many software packages that support the organisation of our ideas and thoughts. Most computer programs of this type allow the collection of pieces of information as well as rapid and easy restructuring of the individual ideas. Packages such as PC Outline adopt a sequential and linear approach, Brainstorm is more hierarchical; the opening screen shows just the trunk of your thoughts while lower screens gradually reveal more and more branches and detail. CK Modeller takes a new and innovative approach much closer to gestalt methodology. CK Modeller is described by its originators - Idon Software - as a package for management thinking. It moves from the six elements of Edward De Bono's perceptions on lateral-thinking to a ten-colour map of ideas, thoughts, issues and assumptions which can be manipulated on the computer screen. A reasonable analogy is the jigsaw puzzle. Most people when attempting a new puzzle tip all the pieces on to a flat surface. Using the reference illustration as a guide, they gather together the pieces which appear to relate to particular parts of the picture. CK Modeller uses much the same method. But, instead of prepared pieces, coloured hexagons are marked with your thoughts. The hexagon allows more relationships to be formed than the simple list of linear, or hierarchical based software. When you have exhausted this initial thinking task you form clusters of those ideas that seem to fit together. As these separate clusters form you may recognise how particular clusters link together. Other clusters, at this stage, may have no links. It is CK Modeller's ability to show these missing links of the problem that makes it unique. You have to make up pieces, using new ideas, that will actually tie the different clusters together. These, initially, may be quite tenuous links: they may be merely annotated arrows. But, as your thoughts progress the separate clusters become more part of the whole and you will gradually build a complete model of your problem or extended idea. The use of colour within CK Modeller is psychological, and a further step towards understanding of the issue at hand. Psychologically, red is the colour of danger, green is for growth, freshness and the new. By encapsulating this evocation within the structure of the problem we are able to pick out parts which signal danger, or require action, from areas that merely convey information. The completed model will be an icon of the overall thought process and will convey all the nuances of ideas brought forward. The system of thinking in hexagons is not new - though its use with computer has only recently been made generally available. The computer version offers considerable advantages over its manual counterpart. First, it offers the ability to construct larger models than would be possible with hexagons and whiteboard. The model might be part of a network of sub-models and by using objects called activators CK Modeller can launch other models or even other computer applications that contain the raw data on which the ideas are based. These ideas of cognitive kinetics may be new to you. Initially, because of my previous experiences and the way I use outliners, I had some learning to do before I could grasp the concepts - though when I explained the principles to my 20-year-old daughter she immediately recognised its potential. What I had struggled to understand, she grasped within minutes. Operating the software is simplicity itself. There is no intensive keyboard input as most operations are carried out on a graphics window using a mouse. CK Modeller is unlike most other computer applications. When the appropriate formulae and data requests have been put into a spreadsheet or database the computer takes over the work. CK Modeller requires effort. While it supports your thinking and allows you to restructure your thoughts in a matter of minutes you remain in complete control. In the user manual that accompanies the software there is a suggestion that once you have encapsulated all your ideas in a model the next step is to build a new lattice using the same set of hexagons. Only, this time, take a hexagon from the periphery of the original cluster and regard it as the central theme of your new model. As it will form a different perspective of the problem it will also reveal new relationships and dependencies between individual items. But that, as they say, is another story. CK Modeller, with manual, a book 'Thinking with Hexagons' and a magnetic travel kit for hexagon planning without a computer, is Pounds 395 plus VAT and Pounds 5 shipping from Idon Software, Edradour House, Pitlochry, Perthshire, PH16 5JW. 0796 473709</p>

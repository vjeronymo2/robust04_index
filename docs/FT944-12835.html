			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Female boost for family earnings The average male contribution to household budgets has fallen to 60 per cent from 75 per cent in the early 1980s, says research published today by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Families headed by a single male breadwinner are now outnumbered nearly three to one by homes where both partners work. Married or cohabiting women with part-time jobs now typically contribute 20 per cent of family income. This rises to 40 per cent for those who work full-time. Other findings of the research - by Ms Susan Harkness, Mr Stephen Machin, and Ms Jane Waldfogel - include: Average family income grew by 48 per cent between 1979 and 1991. However, a big increase in the number of women taking paid work meant that women's average earnings grew four times faster (90 per cent) than those of men (23 per cent). The pay gap between women and men in families headed by a married or cohabiting couple has narrowed. Women's wages were 65 per cent of men's in 1991 compared with 57 per cent in 1979. The proportion of married or cohabiting women with jobs who work full-time rose from 43 per cent in 1979 to 50 per cent in 1991. But the increase in living standards among dual-earner households is not matched among one-parent families where the full-time employment rate fell from 53 per cent to 37 per cent. Ms Harkness said: 'Our analysis demonstrates that without the increase in women's work and earnings in the 1980s, inequalities between the richest and poorest families would be even greater than they are today.'

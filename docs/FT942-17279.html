			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / CBI recommends debt ombudsman The Confederation of British Industry yesterday called on the government to tackle the problem of late payment of trade debts, but said legislation for a statutory right to interest would not work. The government should instead consider establishing a 'commercial debt ombudsman' with powers to investigate complaints against the government and businesses and to publicise its findings. Government organisations should be required to pay promptly and a system should be devised to ensure that suppliers to the government pay their own suppliers promptly. The CBI made the submissions to the Department of Trade and Industry in response to a consultative document produced after the last Budget called for a solution for late payment. The CBI said quoted companies should be required to specify their payment policies in annual reports and whether they support the CBI code of practice on prompt payment. The government should consider a British Standard on prompt payment. Mr John Parsons, chairman of the CBI's Smaller Firms Council, said: 'If a law could be devised to solve the problem of late payment, the CBI would be the first to support it. 'But our smaller-firm members do not think legislation for a statutory right to interest would work. Dominant customers who have paid late in the past will have few qualms about insisting on longer payment terms.'</p>

			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Pollution rights go to auction: A new move to curb SO2 emissions THE US Environmental Protection Agency today announces the results of its first public auction of pollution rights, a benchmark in its novel market-based strategy to reduce acid rain. The agency has doled out emissions permits to 110 of the largest sulphur dioxide (SO) polluters, most of them coal-burning electric utilities, and will allow the companies to trade any permits, or 'allowances', they hold in excess of their own requirements to meet pollution standards. A utility that has, for example, reduced its harmful emissions by installing smokestack 'scrubbers', or has switched to low-sulphur coal or natural gas, might recover costs by selling excess SO allowances. The 1990 Clean Air Act requires US electric utilities to halve their emissions of sulphur dioxide, the harmful element in acid rain, by the year 2000. The EPA plans to phase in its tougher standards, and the pollution allowance programme, in two phases. The first phase will involve an annual issue of permits from 1995 to 1999. The second phase, starting in 2000, will require all SO polluters, not just the dirtiest utilities, to meet compliance standards, and SO allowances will be limited to 8.9m tons annually, well below the 20m tons currently generated each year in the US. The programme has been endorsed by both political parties and by environmental groups such as the Environmental Defence Fund, because it provides a cost-effective alternative to 'command and control' regulation. Its proponents, including Vice-President Al Gore, believe the SO experiment will lead to other market-based ways to control environmental disruption. Only a small percentage of allocated emissions allowances will be priced and traded at this month's auction, which is being conducted by the Chicago Board of Trade. The CBoT won the right to administer the auction in a three-way bidding war with the New York Mercantile Exchange and the New York-based financial broker-dealer Cantor Fitzgerald. All three hope to develop lucrative markets in environmental rights, though regulatory hurdles have so far limited trading in the SO allowances. Cantor Fitzgerald has set up a special division, Environmental Brokerage Services, to create screen-traded forward markets for pollution rights. The SO allowances will be its first product. 'We see a great opportunity here,' says Mr Carlton Bartels, director of the division. 'There are two important trends emerging in this country. First, people are demanding a cleaner environment, and second, the government doesn't have any money to waste. There is great potential in market-based allocation systems.' The CBoT hopes to develop an electronic spot market in pollution allowances, and later, a futures market. The Nymex, which expects to launch electricity futures some time next year, believes its energy-market constituency will give it a way into the pollution market. Despite the enthusiasm, utilities are wary of the market and trading has been spotty. Most are nervous about how their main overseers, state public utility commissions, will treat a pollution trade. The state agencies so far have not formulated policies on how SO allowances will be accounted for, and if cost savings or profits would pass to shareholders or utility customers. The utilities are also sensitive to environmental activists. When Long Island Lighting (Lilco), a New York utility whose emissions generally blow out to sea, sold its SO allowances to Amax Energy, a coal producer which intends to market the permits with its high-sulphur coal to midwestern utilities, New York State and an Adirondack mountains environmental group cried foul. They fear acid rain in New York will worsen under the programme, because it could allow tall midwestern smokestacks upwind to increase SO emissions. Their objections are not expected to block the programme. However, the case generated unwelcome publicity for Lilco. Utilities participating in EPA's auction this week can sidestep that problem by remaining anonymous and using CBoT clearing firms to execute their bids. EPA has set aside 50,000 phase one permits, and 100,000 phase two permits to sell at the auction. These will be sold to the highest bidder until all are allocated. Each permit represents one ton of sulphur dioxide emissions. In addition, the CBoT has been commissioned by utility companies to sell 95,000 phase one and 30,000 phase two permits. Those permits will be subject to minimum prices. The results will provide the first public price discovery for the programme. 'Cash trades in allowances have been extremely rare because of the difficulting in establishing a market price for them,' says Mr Kenneth Rosenzweig, a partner in the Chicago law firm of Schiff, Hardin and Waite who is advising clients on the emerging market. Presumably, the permits will be priced below the cost of installing scrubbers, and well below the Dollars 2,000-a-ton fine the EPA plans to levy on polluters who do not comply with the programme's emissions standards.</p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEARCH FOR EXTRATERRESTRIALS  </P> <P> I must take issue with Konner's specious reasoning. He comes to the conclusion  that "the likely result of contact is the most grotesque disaster that has ever  befallen our species," the disaster being something on the order of what we  humans have perpetrated upon animals within the melee of evolution.  </P> <P> Konner assumes, therefore, that if we were to send messages to the stars, the  likely consequence would be that the listeners would dispatch ships to come to  Earth and enslave us or kill us all.  </P> <P> His conclusion is derived from the assumptions that: Aliens have evolved  exactly as we have; we represent a threat to their evolutional integrity, and  they will conclude that the logical response is to come trillions of miles  across space to deal with this threat. I hope people see this commentary for  what it is -- misleading and ludicrous.  </P> <P> JEFF SWANSON  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

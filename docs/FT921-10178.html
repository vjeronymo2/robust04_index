			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Economic ills weigh down Polish coalition POLAND'S recently formed centre-right coalition government is becoming increasingly frustrated at its inability to honour pre-election promises and ease the burdens of a transition to a market system. After fiercely criticising Poland's first two post-communist governments for ignoring the social costs of the IMF-backed stabilisation programme, the incoming government was obliged to spend its first weeks shepherding an inherited cost-cutting interim budget through parliament. The need to trim a first quarter budget deficit that was heading for a Dollars 7bn-Dollars 8bn deficit on an annualised basis forced the government to lower unemployment pay and energy subsidies. The cuts sparked strikes and anger from voters who earlier supported calls for greater state intervention to prop up loss-making state companies. The parlous state of public finances reflects the depth of the structural decline and the difficulty of reforming the state administration quickly enough to levy new taxes on the fast-growing, and sometimes high-spending private sector. More than 85 per cent of government revenue came from so-called 'profits taxes' levied on state enterprises under the primitive tax and administrative structures inherited from four decades of communist rule. But a 35 per cent fall in state sector industrial output in the past two years has pushed nearly half the 8,400 enterprises into the red. Unable or unwilling to pay taxes, they have sold assets, sacked workers and built up debt with other state enterprises and state banks. Unemployment nearly doubled last year to 2.1m, 11.4 per cent of the workforce. The budget also had to fund a 800,000 increase to 8.3m in the number of pensioners. The government's problem is that higher social spending has further reduced its ability to fund a more interventionist industrial policy, as advocated by Mr Jerzy Eysymontt, minister in charge of economic policy.</p>

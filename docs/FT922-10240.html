			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: UAL blames Dollars 92.3m loss on weak domestic market UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, yesterday revealed it lost Dollars 92.3m after tax in the first three months of 1992. Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman, described the result 'woefully unsatisfactory'. The net loss compared with an after-tax deficit of Dollars 157m in the same period a year ago. However, this was when the Gulf war lead to a sharp decline in traffic levels. United is one of three US 'mega-carriers', and its first-quarter deficit follows a modest Dollars 20m profit from American Airlines and a Dollars 151.6m deficit at Delta Air Lines, its two big rivals. At the operating level, UAL saw even larger losses, totalling Dollars 146.3m in the first three months of 1992, compared with a Dollars 268.1m deficit a year ago. Operating revenues were up from Dollars 2.56bn to Dollars 2.97bn, but costs rose from Dollars 2.83bn to Dollars 3.12bn, despite a reduction in fuel expenses to Dollars 363.4m from Dollars 448.1m. United, which recently acquired the former Pan Am routes in Latin America, blamed the results on the domestic market. 'The anaemic economic recovery in the US, where United has about two-thirds of its capacity, coupled with the pricing actions of certain carriers, had a very significant impact on first-quarter revenue,' said Mr Wolf. Some analysts have been sceptical about the speed and ease with which the Pan Am business could be integrated. However, Mr Wolf stressed the airline's primary focus was 'on further development' of the international route system. Here, he said, first-quarter capacity was up by 39 per cent, and traffic by 55 per cent. United's yield - passenger revenue per mile flown - rose by 2.8 per cent, to 13.60 cents, while its load factor was 61 per cent, up 2.1 percentage points from the 58.9 per cent seen a year ago. Its shares were up by Dollars  3/4 , at Dollars 124 3/4 . Amid a series of management appointments, United Airlines yesterday named Mr John Pope, formerly vice-chairman and chief financial officer, to be the carrier's chief operating officer. Mr Pope becomes responsible for day-to-day matters such as operations, marketing, planning and customer service. Mr Stephen Wolf, who remains chairman and chief executive, will concentrate on strategy, and government and market relationships. The company is also establishing an international division, which will be headed by Mr James Goodwin, previously senior vice-president for maintainance operations.</p>

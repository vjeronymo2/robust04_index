			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Malaysia widens markets MALAYSIAN investment in China totalled about MDollars 2bn (Pounds 526m) last year as industry sought to broaden its markets and reduce dependence on the US, Europe and Japan, Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's finance minister, said at the weekend. He said in London he was not concerned that a substantial flow of investment into China might undermine investment in Malaysia's development. Falling domestic investment was the result of a strategy to expand into new markets, including China, Vietnam and Africa. Mr Anwar hoped to bring down Malaysia's inflation this year to 4 per cent from 4.7 per cent last; he would be comfortable with 7 per cent economic growth as this would help to contain inflation. But spending on infrastructure could push growth nearer to recent levels of 8-9 per cent, he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Nizhniy Novgorod Mayor Dmitriy Bednyakov, by </F> Yuriy Kozlov, under "Face to Face" rubric: "In Nizhniy Novgorod  Every Other Person Belongs to the Third Estate"; date and place  not given]    [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod is, with good reason,  regarded as the proving grounds of economic reforms in Russia.  However, there is only one political figure in the limelight:  Oblast Governor Boris Nemtsov. Yet there is another, no less  prominent, person there, city mayor Dmitriy Bednyakov. The far  from complete list of accomplishments of the city administration  includes its privatization program, Russia's first city charter,  development of unified banking principles, targeted social  assistance, reorganization of residential housing, medical  insurance. Today Nizhniy Novgorod is one of the few places in  Russia where life is indeed getting better.    [Kozlov] Dmitriy Ivanovich, it is no secret that Russia's  economy is the aggregate of its regional economies. Since the  resignation of Gaydar and Fyodorov all one hears is that the  government is, allegedly, veering away from the course of  reforms. What is your assessment of what's going on in Moscow  from the vantage point of Nizhniy Novgorod?    [Bednyakov] As I see it, the changes in the government will  least of all affect the state of affairs in Nizhniy Novgorod.  Although one cannot say, of course, that they will have no  effect at all. If the government goes back to its previous  credit policy and starts using the budget to "pump up"  enterprises and entire branches of industry, this, doubtlessly,  will cause a new surge of inflation, creating headaches for  everyone. But all in all, today the regional economy depends on  the economic policies pursued by the local authorities.    [Kozlov] What, specifically, are the policies of the Nizhniy  Novgorod authorities?    [Bednyakov] I would note two basic elements. Firstly, there  is full support of private enterprise and business expansion. If  a person wants to earn money, and can, he should do so, and no  one has the right to interfere. Provided, of course, that he  doesn't break the law or avoid paying taxes. The second element  is sufficiently effective social protection of those segments of  the population which need this. These are young people,  pensioners, large families, invalids, in short, all those for  whom today's life is especially difficult. Balancing these two  elements in the framework of a unified economic policy is the  main concern of the regional authorities.    [Kozlov] Many people say this, but so far successes are  rather few. Privatization and joint stock programs are making  some progress, but social programs are almost universally  failing. Incidentally, Nizhniy Novgorod is known more as a  "market beacon," but not a "social beacon."    [Bednyakov] Indeed, we were the first in Russia to free  bread  and milk prices and eliminate coupons for virtually all goods  and services. But these moves were invariably accompanied by  measures for social protection of the population. Last September  we--again the first in Russia--introduced low-income benefits.  Last year the maximum subsidy was R23,000. This year it has more  than doubled. And that is not counting aid for children, school  lunches, etc. I think reforms in Russia will be successful if  they have two sufficiently strong "wings": support for  entrepreneurship and social protection of the poor.    [Kozlov] That is so, but where will the money for this come  from?    [Bednyakov] There was a time when huge sums were taken daily  from the city budget to subsidize milk and bread producers. When  we freed the prices of these products considerable sums were  made available, which, incidentally, we immediately began to pay  out to those who were unable to buy milk and bread at the free  prices. And this proved to be fairer. Formerly both rich and  poor households received subsidies. Now they are addressed only  to those who are unable to make ends meet, that is, the really  poor. Incidentally, this helped to "correct" people's mentality  noticeably. Now people are concerned not so much with getting  low-income benefits for themselves as with the availability of  goods on store shelves. I can state confidently that Nizhniy  Novgorod already has a mixed economy. The picture is determined  not so much by state enterprises as by private and joint  ventures.    [Kozlov] But Nizhniy Novgorod is also known for former  "flagships" of socialist industry, GAZ [Gorkiy Automobile Plant]  in the first place. Incidentally, how are things there?    [Bednyakov] As of today, a closed sale of shares has been  completed, an inter-regional check auction of GAZ shares has  been held, and the plant is preparing for its first  shareholders' meeting. Now GAZ is an open type joint-stock  company. Of course, GAZ, like other large enterprises, is in a  very difficult situation. It has to think of new types of  products and how to market them. But in my view the situation at  GAZ gives no grounds to fear that the plant may come to a halt  soon and more than 110,000 workers will be left in the street.  Although, of course, the GAZ management could be better. It  seems to me that the conflict over GAZ, which has been so widely  publicized in the press, is essentially a problem of management  and of attracting foreign investment. Of course, Western  businessmen do not want to see GAZ as a serious competitor on  the market, hence their attitude towards the plant. We shouldn't  fool ourselves. One could, of course, replace executives and  improve the management, but that is no guarantee that Western  monies will start flowing to us. They won't. Although GAZ, of  course, definitely needs reforming on both the technological and  managerial levels.    [Kozlov] Dmitriy Ivanovich, what has the city gained from  the  once widely advertized privatization program? Do revenues from  privatized enterprises contribute significantly to the budget?    [Bednyakov] The state has finally given up doing things it  wasn't meant to do and stopped controlling everything under the  sun. The budget has indeed begun to receive real money, and in  significant quantities. Local authorities have finally begun to  deal with things all local authorities should: public amenities,  roads, public safety, transportation, housing. We began the  program with privatization of retail enterprises. Although there  was an opposing point of view: to privatize large enterprises  first. I think we took the right road. Now there already is a  competitive atmosphere in the city. As of today, up to 70  percent of Nizhniy Novgorod's retail enterprises have been  privatized. We are operating according to a somewhat unusual  scheme: we sell not enterprises, but the assets of liquidated  enterprises. The new owner is, thus, not required to rehire  former workers. However, if people lose their jobs he must pay  benefits. Neither is the new owner responsible for the acquired  enterprise's debts. We view privatization like this: The idea is  not to sell for the highest possible price, but to sell so that  the new owner could start operating efficiently as quickly as  possible.    [Kozlov] But still, how are things with the privatization of  large enterprises?    [Bednyakov] In my view, this has not yet taken place. What  has been called stock distribution [aktsionirovaniye] is  essentially the commercialization of large enterprises. They  appear to change the form of ownership, but they still remain  state-owned.    It seems to me that the country lacks a mechanism for  privatizing large enterprises. There is no way to buy and sell  large packets of shares of such enterprises quickly. Russia has  no normally operating stock market, it still has to be set up.  Once there is no way to operate with large packets of shares  they fall into the hands of enterprise directors, who use them  in their own interests. Real privatization will begin only when  a potential large investor will be able to buy a large packet of  shares of the enterprise he wants on the stock market. We are  currently actively dealing with this problem. I head the oblast  commission for organizing a stock market. A new influx of  investment into the oblast's economy can come only through the  stock market. All other possibilities have, as I see it, been  exhausted.    [Kozlov] What do you see as the main areas of work this  year?    [Bednyakov] Questions connected with reorganizing the  housing  sphere and public utilities. For over a year we have been  working on problems of housing subsidies. Because, if monthly  payments for housing exceed a certain percentage of a family's  total income we must pay people a housing subsidy. From the  purely technical point of view we have not yet resolved this  question. How to ensure that a person getting this money will  spend it solely to pay for housing? It is necessary, thus, to  have special "housing" funds. The main task this year is to find  a mechanism for reorganizing the housing market that would be  fair, effective, and socially protect the majority of the  population. We have already developed a special program spanning  several years.    [Kozlov] And how are matters with insured health care?    [Bednyakov] Last year we began an experiment in financing  health institutions according to the number of cured patients.  It was tried out in several hospitals. It showed that doctors  are morally prepared to work more efficiently. The main  stumbling block is that as yet there are no political decisions  on this score that would be associated with changing budget  flows. So far they pass through the health care system, but they  should be handled by hospital insurance funds, insurance  companies, and so forth. An entire institution of medical  insurance agents has to be created. Today it is impossible to  approach this problem seriously. But we are moving in the right  direction. We are planning to try introducing insured health  care on the basis of the GAZ medical department. Doctors will  receive budgeted pay, with everything over that coming from the  enterprise, depending on the quality of their work. I think the  move from free to insured health care should be very careful,  without undue haste, but not too slowly, either.    [Kozlov] What do you expect in the near future from the  government, the president, and the federal assembly?    [Bednyakov] The main issues that have to be clarified are  taxes and the budget. The revenues of local budgets, in fact the  very existence of territories, depend in many ways on the  resolution of these questions. There is some apprehension that  the new government will pursue a less reformist policy than one  would like. Most of all I fear growing inflation, although  inflation in itself is not as bad as the fact that the society  gets used to it and people blend into the inflationary  mechanism. This, doubtlessly, adversely affects all types of  economic activity. We are not indifferent to the policies of the  government, the president and the federal assembly. But, I  repeat, since the reforms began, Russia's regions and  territories have grown strong enough to handle many issues  independently. Like we do in Nizhniy Novgorod. In that sense I  am an optimist. According to the latest polls, 40 to 50 percent  of Nizhniy Novgorod inhabitants list themselves as middle class.  This gives hope that the reforms in Russia have become  irreversible.</p>

			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> HEARING TONIGHT ON COYOTE HILLS PROJECT  </P> <P> The City Council will hold a public hearing at 7:30 tonight to consider  allowing 220 homes to be built in the East Coyote Hills.  </P> <P> Newport Beach developer J.M. Peters Co. Inc. will appeal a Planning Commission  vote in February to reject the company's plans for 110 houses and 110  condominium units to be built at State College Boulevard and Bastanchury Road.  </P> <P> Some of the commissioners said plans for the gated housing community pack too  many units into the hilly area and require too much of the hill to be  flattened. The master plan for the area requires buildings to follow the  contour of the hill as much as possible.  </P> <P> The plans call for condominiums to be built on graded land near the  intersection. The houses would wrap around north, east and south of the  condominiums on a lower portion of the land bordering Craig Regional Park. TOM  McQUEENEY  </P></p>

He said: Our province's CPPCC work mounted a new plane in  1993. The provincial party committee and the people of the whole  province are satisfied with that. The tasks in 1994 for all  work in the province are honorable as well as arduous, and this  requires us to concentrate forces from all sides, including the  CPPCC at various levels as well as broad CPPCC members, and give  play to all positive factors to shape a mighty combined force to  grasp reform, development, and stability.    Comrade Wang Maolin indicated: The central leadership has on  several occasions stressed that CPPCC work during the new  historical stage must not be weakened but augmented, completed,  and perfected. The CPPCC comprises representative figures from  various social circles: representatives from various democratic  parties are just part of them. This being the case, we should  not believe that without democratic parties, the CPPCC  organization would be dispensable. Comrade Wang Maolin stressed  that party committees at various levels strengthening leadership  in a down-to-earth way and all-out support from governments at  various levels are the crux of giving full play to the CPPCC's  role. To achieve this, party committees at all levels are  required to include the improvement and strengthening work of  the CPPCC on the agenda. They should make arrangements to hear  reports on the work of the CPPCC twice a year; at the same time,  they should present topics for research and assign tasks to the  CPPCC. Party committees and governments at all levels should  solicit opinions from CPPCC organizations before important  decisions are presented. This should be shaped into the  institution.    In addition, Comrade Wang Maolin stressed that to give full  play to the CPPCC's role, CPPCC organizations at all levels must  work hard to improve their own work, especially augmenting the  work of various ad hoc committees through reform and giving play  to the function of CPPCC members in its entirety. In  particular, he mentioned that CPPCC members who still take  responsible office in party and government departments should  take an active part in CPPCC activities which participate in  government and discuss state affairs while doing a good job of  their own work. They should not be absent from these activities  arbitrarily and be members of the CPPCC in name alone.</p>

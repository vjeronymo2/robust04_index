			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 30 (AFP) -- The Chinese economy is  likely to grow at a sightly slower rate this year, but its real  GDP could still expand faster than the official target of 9.0  percent, the OECD said Thursday [30 June].    This would follow two years of growth at a very fast pace of  13 percent annually, the Organization for Economic Cooperation  and Development (OECD) said.    Inflation in China is also likely to exceed the target level  of 10 percent, but should come down from the high level of 20  percent recorded at the end of the first quarter, it said in its  semi-annual Economic Outlook.    But, in this respect, China is faced with a "particular  risk"  this year, the OECD report said.    For policies implemented at the beginning of this year as  part of a programme of structural reforms "are likely to  heighten inflationary pressures in the short term."    It cited exchange rate reform and various tax reform  measures, but noted a number of factors that might reduce the  risk.    The overhaul of the exchange rate system, aimed at  establishing yuan convertibility, was followed by a 45 percent  devaluation of the "official" yuan exchange rate, the OECD noted.    But since only one-third of imports were at the "official"  yuan rate, it said, the mechanical effect of this may be to add  only around 15 percent to the total value of imports, so  reducing the domestic price impact.    The government also introduced a value-added tax to boost  central government revenue from this year, the report said.    It added that while price freezes on some basic consumer  goods had "little impact" on inflation, the strict controls  imposed recently on non-infrastrucutre investment, especially  construction, "may prove more efficient in reining back  inflation pressures emanating from the demand side."    The brisk expansion in China over the past two years was  fuelled by "very strong domestic demand growth," as investment  doubled between 1991 and 1993, OECD economists noted.    They said this placed constraints on resources available for  exports and triggered "a surge" in imports, the value of which  grew by nearly 30 percent.    Both growth and inflation were immediately reined in when  authorities imposed an economic austerity programme last July.    But it also dried up liquidity in state enterprises and in  the agricultural sector. So austerity measures were eased from  last October, and growth and inflation quickened again.    Against the background of developments on the price front  and  the recent upturn in activity, "it is likely that although  slowing somewhat in 1994, GDP growth and inflation will remain  above the official targets of 9.0 and 10 percent respectively,"  the OECD said.    The report also noted that inflows into China of foreign  direct investment remain "substantial," and contribute to  boosting the already steep growth in investment.    China notably benefitted from appreciation of the Japanese  yen, which encouraged transfers by Japanese investors, although  on a smaller scale than in 1987-89.    The OECD said China was among the key targets of investment  flows from Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which were concentrated  on the countries with the lowest labour costs.</p>

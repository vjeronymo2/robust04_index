			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILDLIFE  </P> <P> Your editorial "Pets in the Wild?" (Feb. 23) about the problems wildlife in  Yellowstone National Park are experiencing is right on.  </P> <P> The area of the park boundaries enclose is not a complete ecosystem, and  therein lies the problem. Until Congress acts to buy up and take over the  surrounding private holdings and national forest lands the rancher-hunters will  "harvest" every animal that moves over the park borders; nor will a natural  balance of park wildlife be reestablished unless the predatory wolf is restored  to Yellowstone.  </P> <P> These days, we know that the wolf is not the big bad beast of the fairy tales  and it is time Congress stopped believing these fairy tales.  </P> <P> NORMAN JOHNSON  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUTO COUNT  </P> <P> Referring to the editorial "California Here They Come" and counting (Dec. 11),  what gives me concern is that even now there are more registered motor vehicles  in California than there are people in Alaska, Hawaii, Arizona, New Mexico,  Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Oregon, Idaho, Washington, Wyoming and Montana  combined. There are 21.3 million autos in California and 19.5 million people in  those 12 states according to the 1990 World Almanac.  </P> <P> Let us hope that when those who are coming, do come, that they arrive by train  or jet and when they get here they will make use of taxis or public  transportation.  </P> <P> Subway construction workers -- go! go! go! Get the job done! We are behind you  100%.  </P> <P> DICK CURRY  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P></p>

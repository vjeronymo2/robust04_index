			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union/Italy: Labor </F> Eurodeputies on `Neofascist Commissioners'"]    [Text] (ANSA) Brussels, May 22 -- Labor deputies in the  European Parliament Sunday [22 May] threatened to spark an  institutional crisis within the European Union [EU] should any  Italian neofascists be named to the European Commission which is  to be renewed in January 1995.    A communique released here by the Socialist group in the  European Parliament said that the threat was contained in a  letter that Labor leader Pauline Green had sent to British  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. In the letter, Green claimed  that the Labor deputies would refuse to vote for the investiture  of a new Commission as called for by the Maastricht Treaty, if  Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi were to name a neofascist to  the European Commission. The threatened move is backed by  Labor's allies in the largest political group in the European  Parliament, she said, and if carried out would plunge the EU  immediately into "an unprecedented crisis."    The document went on to say that the Commission would be  politically paralyzed if it did not obtain the approval of the  only institution within the European Union which was directly  elected.    Green concluded by announcing that Labor deputies and their  Socialist allies in the European Parliament would refuse to  cooperate with any fascist minister and would veto any attempt  to name a neofascist as a Commission member.</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> South Korean prosecutors indicted a dissident priest for breaching national  security laws by making a 10-day unauthorized visit to Communist North Korea.  The Rev. Moon Ik Hwan is charged with entering a region controlled by an  "anti-state group" and supporting North Korea's aggressive policies against the  south. Moon's alleged offenses could theoretically incur the death penalty. The  71-year-old Presbyterian pastor publicly backed North Korean leader Kim Il  Sung's proposal for a confederation of the two states pending total  reunification. Seoul says it is committed to detente with the north, but that  all contacts must occur through official channels.  </P></p>

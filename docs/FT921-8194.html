			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Trade negotiators push to complete Nafta draft TRADE negotiators are this week pushing in secret sessions in Dallas to complete large sections of the draft of the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), Nancy Dunne writes from Washington. The talks, scheduled for February 17-21, are seen as critical if a completed pact is to be introduced to the US Congress this year. It is thought the pact must reach Congress in some form by the end of next month if it is to pass this year. The legislation, to be introduced this week by Congressman Jim Jontz (Democrat, Indiana), would remove the deadlines set out in the Nafta 'fast-track' approval process. Instead of the five-month procedure approved by Congress last year, members would have an unlimited amount of time to consider a Nafta. The Jontz bill will allow amendments to the Nafta pact in five areas: labour and environment standards, worker adjustment assistance, rules of origin and dispute resolution. Broad support is expected because of the way the economy has recently deteriorated.</p>

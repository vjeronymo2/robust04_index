			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Raymond Whitaker: "Defiant North Korea </F> Completes Cover-up"]    [Text] Defying international agreements, North Korea has  almost completed the removal of 8,000 fuel rods from an  experimental nuclear reactor, leaving the rest of the world  divided on how to respond.    David Kyd, a spokesman for the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA), said the spent fuel is in a cooling tank  monitored by two agency inspectors. There was no sign that the  North Koreans had any immediate plans to take away the material,  but he added: "Weeks or months -- that is a different matter."  It is estimated that after reprocessing, the spent fuel could  yield enough plutonium for three or four nuclear weapons.    Of more immediate concern, however, is that the inspectors  have been prevented from taking samples to determine how much  plutonium has been diverted in the past. The North Koreans  admit to having produced a small amount, but the IAEA has  evidence that more is being concealed -- enough, it is believed,  for one or two nuclear devices.    "That historical record is now lost," a Western diplomat  said  yesterday. "There is no way of reconstructing it. North Korea  has violated the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the only  question now is how we react."    Apart from extinguishing any hope that Kim Il Sung's  unpredictable Stalinist regime might finally comply with the  treaty to the satisfaction of the IAEA, the unsupervised  discharge of the reactor has made it clear that Pyongyang will  proceed with its nuclear programme whatever the inducements on  offer. Last year the United States held two rounds of direct  talks with North Korea in which it offered help to rescue the  country's collapsing economy and held out the possibility of  diplomatic recognition if the North would stop trying to develop  nuclear weapons.    "They were offered a perfectly decent fall-back," said the  diplomat, "but they chose to sacrifice a third round of talks  which was virtually within their grasp. The US was prepared to  meet nearly all their conditions, but instead they chose to  de-fuel." Some American analysts have argued that North Korea  sees its nuclear programme as a cheap form of insurance against  reunification with South Korea, which will remain effective no  matter how far it falls behind the South in terms of economic or  military strength.    Pyongyang's open defiance of the IAEA, making it impossible  to check what it has done in the past, means there is no  specific deadline for action. Disagreement among the five  permanent members of the United Nations Security Council means  it may not discuss the matter for several more days.    China, North Korea's closest ally, has prevented its  Security  Council partners from passing any resolution on the last couple  of occasions the question has been debated. All it has been  prepared to allow is a statement by the president of the  council, urging the North Koreans to comply with the  Non-Proliferation Treaty. "It would be a jump for the Chinese  to agree to a resolution, and a further jump to agree to  sanctions," said the Western diplomat.    Peking has given next to no sign of dropping its traditional  opposition to sanctions in almost any circumstances, but the US,  Britain and France are pressing ahead with drawing up proposals  for their staged imposition on North Korea. The first round  might include action to curb Pyongyang's exports of conventional  weapons and cutting air links. Preventing imports of oil and  food, which nearly all go through China, would not be proposed  until later. Nor is it clear when Japan would be asked to stop  all remittances from North Korean residents, worth about $600m  (400m pounds) a year.    Nobody was under any illusions that sanctions would be very  effective, said the diplomat, "but it is a question of  credibility. The Western members have reached the conclusion  that the Security Council cannot take this lying down."</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / UK Company News: New chief executive is sought by Shanks Shanks &amp; McEwan, the UK waste contractor which recently issued a profits warning, yesterday sought to improve its internal controls with the appointment of a chief operating officer to replace Mr Roger Hewitt, the chief executive who resigned abruptly last month. It is understood that the group still intends to appoint a chief executive. Mr Gordon Waddell, the chairman, is acting as chief executive until a replacement is found. Shanks said Mr Michael Averill, former managing director of the group's environmental division, would take responsibility for all but the commercial, construction and financial operations. He will report directly to Mr Waddell. Mr Hewitt is understood to have left the group last month following pressure from institutional investors over Shanks's performance and a lack of confidence in its management. The company also announced the closure of its office in Aylesbury as part of its cost-cutting programme. Shanks announced at the interim stage that some Pounds 5m was to be cut out of costs. While there have already been a number of redundancies, it is expected that there will be further rationalisation.</p>

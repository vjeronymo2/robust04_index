			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENIOR YEARS  </P> <P> Thanks for your articles and separate section ("The Special Years, 50 and  Beyond: The Time of Your Life," May 4) that highlighted the 50-plus age group  -- I'm one of them.  </P> <P> I really feel it is a neglected group of people, and the marketing people, if  no one else, are missing a lot by not noticing us or mentioning our existence.  I also felt your statistics about growing older were heartening and less  negative and frightening than many I've seen. We can all use that good  information.  </P> <P> MRS. D. BARKER  </P> <P> Escondido  </P></p>

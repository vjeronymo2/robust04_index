			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RANCHO SANTIAGO WILL TRY TO RECOVER AGAINST GOLDEN WEST  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago College is hoping to rebound and Golden West is looking for an  upset in a Mission Conference Central Division football game at 7 tonight at  Orange Coast College.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago opened the season with five victories but was defeated by  Riverside, 34-24, last Saturday. The Dons are 5-1 overall, 4-1 in conference  play and 0-1 in the division.  </P> <P> The Dons were ranked sixth in the national J.C. Grid-Wire poll before the loss,  but now are 19th.  </P> <P> Golden West (3-2, 2-2, 0-1) is going for its third Friday night victory of the  season. Games are normally played on Saturday, but due to scheduling conflicts  created because Golden West shares a field with Orange Coast, the Rustlers  already have played -- and won -- twice on Friday this season.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Milan Hulik, a member of the Democratic </F> Union (DEU) preparatory committee, by Pavel Verner; place and  date not given: "The Democratic Union Is To Draft More Detailed  Statutes"]    [Text] Milan Hulik is a member of the preparatory  committee of the DEU, a right-wing party that is aiming to  emerge on the Czech political scene. Following the failed  attempt to register the party with the Czech Interior Ministry,  he indicated in the press his suspicion of deliberate  obstruction on the part of the ministry.    [Verner] Do you really believe that it is someone's  deliberate wish not to register your party?    [Hulik] I do not expect a direct intention in this sense.  The registration has probably failed because of the character  of our statutes that are extraordinary, creative, and not copied  from other political entities. In particular, it is our way of  election and appointment. The ministry asked for more details.  We will comply.    [Verner] As far as I know, you also had applications that  were not completely filled out and that does not correspond to  the registration rules....    [Hulik] We gathered 1,000 signatures in two days. After our  appeal, the people came again to add the missing data; so, that  is all in order.    [Verner] Are the secrets regarding the program objectives of  the DEU necessary?    [Hulik] We have published them in outline. Regarding  detailed information, certain individual actions--for instance,  our forged statutes are circulating in Prague--force us to be  careful.    [Verner] Whose individual actions?    [Hulik] Messrs. Kulhavy for the Conservative Party and Samek  for the Entrepreneurs and Tradesmen's Party, for example, who  expected that they would join the DEU in some official capacity.  They were bringing radicalism into our program; they founded a  shadow government, and, when they did not meet with  understanding, they began to set up the so-called New Right Wing.    [Verner] What about the relationship between the DEU and the  KAN [Club of Nonaligned Activists]?    [Hulik] If you have the leadership of the KAN in mind, their  relations toward us are based on sad envy. They reproach us for  stealing the program, the principles of which existed long  before KAN; they are general and cannot be the property of a  single political party.</p>

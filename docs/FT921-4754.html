			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Avoiding tax bills THERE ARE a number of tax shelters available which can avoid CGT. The most prominent are the Business Expansion Scheme and the Personal Equity Plan. Investors can place Pounds 40,000 in a tax year in a BES (see Page V) but for the CGT exemption to apply the investment must be held for five years. There is no time limit on a Pep but an investor can invest only a maximum Pounds 9,000 (via a Pounds 6,000 general and a Pounds 3,000 single company Pep) in any one tax year. The snag with both is that there is no guarantee of a profit. Investors may choose inappropriate investments, and face hefty losses, if they pick the wrong schemes. Losses in these shelters cannot be offset against gains elsewhere. Married couples One way of lessening your CGT bill in any single tax year if you are married and living together, is to transfer assets to your spouse. There are two instances in which this makes sense: to use up your spouse's Pounds 5,500 allowance or to ensure that gains are taxed on the spouse with the lower tax rate. Since April 6 1990 (when independent taxation was introduced), it has not been possible to offset your losses against your spouse's gains or vice versa in order to pay less tax. The transfer will be considered a gift and it must be made unconditionally. Assets will still be taxed for CGT purposes as if your spouse had acquired them at the same time that you had. Suppose you bought shares in 1987 and transferred them to your spouse in 1991. When they sell the shares, they will, broadly speaking, pay CGT as if they had acquired the shares in 1987. The method of transfer depends on the gift. To transfer shares, you must fill in a share transfer form (claiming exemption from stamp duty). For an object such as a painting, you might need to ask a solicitor to draw up a deed of gift, although an exchange of letters might suffice. Bed-and-breakfast deals The annual CGT allowance cannot be carried forward to subsequent tax years, and this opens up the scope for the bed and breakfast deal. In essence, this involves selling an asset and buying it back shortly afterwards. Through such a deal, an investor can use up his annual allowance and avoid a hefty tax bill in future years. This may be particularly attractive this year, with the prospect of lower CGT thresholds under Labour. One problem is that a bed and breakfast deal involves costs, such as commission, and the risk that prices might move while the investor is out of the market. Further snags are detailed by Ralph Newns in the accompanying article.</p>

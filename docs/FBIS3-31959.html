			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes" newscast] </F>   [Text] Quito -- At least three policemen were injured and  an undisclosed number of students were arrested in the wake of  protests staged here today in the face of announced economic  adjustment measures. The demonstrators, mostly students from the  Central University of Ecuador and some from certain secondary  schools, were repelled with tear gas and a water cannon known as  Trucutu.    Security measures were tightened at the Government Palace.  Nearby roads were blocked with Army armored vehicles. The  students are throwing rocks and making obscene gestures at the  policemen, and they are shouting slogans against the government  and the IMF.    We do not want more increases, and we say no to gasoline  price increases were among the slogans shouted as the  demonstrators threw rocks and other hard objects at the public  forces.    As we reported earlier, the government will announce fuel  price increases to cover the large fiscal deficit, which is  growing by the day given a drop in revenues due to lower  petroleum prices. Petroleum is Ecuador's main revenue source.    The police were forced to close the access roads near the  university in downtown Quito as well as other streets in the  southern part of Quito. This has created a huge traffic jam.  There are long lines at gas stations.    It is not yet known whether there are disturbances in  Guayaquil, the second most important city in our country. Radio  reports state that more public demonstrations against gasoline  price increases are expected next week as secondary school  students join the demonstrations.</p>

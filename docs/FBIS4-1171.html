			<p>BFN     [Text] Fighting continued in Kigali today. The Arusha  meeting between Rwandan Armed Forces and the Rwandan Patriotic  Front [RPF] has not yet started. The RPF has declared a  unilateral cease-fire, which is to begin at 2100 on Monday [25  April]. The RPF is setting certain conditions. The second RPF  Vice President Denis Polisi was interviewed by Muriel Pomponne:    [Begin recording] [Polisi] This cease-fire can only begin  when Rwandan soldiers and the militias of the MRND [Republican  National Movement for Democracy and Development] and the CDR  [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic] stop the killing of  civilians. Either these soldiers and these militias stop the  massacres themselves, or if they do not, I believe that the RPF,  having a moral obligation to defend the Rwandans, will defend  them.    [Pomponne] Are you telling us that the announcement of this  cease-fire is not certain?    [Polisi] The cease-fire? We declared it in all sincerity.  The other party must now accept the condition. [end recording]</p>

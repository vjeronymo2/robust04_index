			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / S Africa plans action on privatisation The South African government intends to press ahead with privatisation as quickly as possible in an effort to raise new funds for its centrepiece Reconstruction and Development Programme. At the same time it plans to cut the size of the civil service and the salaries of top government officials, writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg. The speedy implementation of the first two proposals is regarded as crucial if the government is to meet its goals of cutting the size of budget deficit, currently at 6.6 per cent of gross domestic product. The third is a largely symbolic action designed to improve the administration's public image. The government has come under increasing pressure in recent months over top officials' high salaries at a time when the country is being asked to accept austerity programmes. Making the announcement over the weekend, deputy president Thabo Mbeki, standing in for President Nelson Mandela, said the plan represented a 'bold and imaginative shift' in policy. Under the plan the president and his two deputies will each take a 20 per cent salary cut while national ministers, regional premiers and the heads of the Senate and National Assembly will accept 10 per cent cuts. Further increases will be limited to 5 per cent a year. The proposals also call for the 1.2m-strong civil service to be cut to less than 1m.</p>

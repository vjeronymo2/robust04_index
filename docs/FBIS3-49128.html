			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, January 4 (BTA) -- Mr. Rumen Avramov, deputy  chairman of the Agency for Economic Coordination and  Development, an independent institution making annual and  monthly analyses of the state of Bulgaria's economy, has  predicted several price shocks in Bulgaria in 1994. He deems  them imminent because they will release the piled-up but  deferred inflationary potential in the fixed prices of electric  power and fuels. Mr. Avramov does not expect hyperinflation.  "I am hopeful the main levers of the economic policy will not  defeat each other as was the case in 1993," he says.    In an interview in today's DUMA, Mr. Avramov attaches  particular importance to income indexing. "Automatic indexing  was the main culprit for tying the cabinet's hands in the field  of budgetary policies and for the high deficit," he comments.    Mr. Avramov thinks possible outside funding will be of prime  importance throughout the year as the country was placed in  total economic isolation. He also points to other important  events, like the entry into force in April of the VAT  [value-added tax] Act, which is expected to entail a single  price rise and will restructure the tax base of the budget.    Asked whether the monetarist model will have to be  corrected,  Mr. Avramov says the Bulgarian model is not a monetarist one  "either as an ideology or least as real policies." "State-run  enterprises are still functioning without fixed budget  restrictions, though a great number of them have practically  gone bankrupt," the deputy chairman of the Agency for Economic  Coordination and Development explains.</p>

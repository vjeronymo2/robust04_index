			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (14): From mainstay to minor industry - The decline and fall of the tomato does not mean, however, that horticulture has disappeared from Guernsey altogether / Horticulture DRIVING around Guernsey, it seems as if there are more derelict glasshouses than any other kind of building. With their peeling white paintwork, smashed windows and weeds growing all around, they are testimony to a horticultural industry which flourished for a while then went into steep decline. As recently as the 1960s, horticulture was the mainstay of the Guernsey economy. In 1973, horticulture accounted for 36 per cent of the Bailiwick's gross national product. Today, it accounts for 5 per cent of the export sectors of the economy and just over 6 per cent of gross national product. Dessert grapes were the first leading crop to be grown. The first exports, to the mainland, were recorded as 3,474lb in 1830. This increased to 2,541 tons in 1915, only to decline from 1920 as competitors in other countries emerged with lower prices. The extensive grape growing in earlier times is the reason why holdings on the islands are always called vineries even though most of them have long since ceased to grow grapes. By the 1960s, tomatoes were the largest export crop and 1,000 acres were devoted to tomato cultivation. Mr Peter Falla, development quality control officer at the Horticulture Advisory Service (HAS), reckons that in the late 1960s about 10m trays weighing 12lb each - and worth a total of about Pounds 32m in those days - were being exported. At today's current values that would mean exports of Pounds 150m. In 1991, however, tomato exports including sundry other fruit and vegetables were worth just Pounds 5.4m and tomatoes by volume amounted to just 750,000 boxes. Less than 200 acres is used for growing tomatoes. What went wrong? In the 1970s foreign competitors, particularly the Dutch, subsidised their industries with cheap energy. The Dutch used cheap North Sea gas to help their growers. This was at a time when oil prices rocketed. Guernsey is dependent on imported oil. With the oil price rises of the 1970s came high interest rates. Anyone who had borrowed to invest and expand was caught in a vice of sharply rising costs and falling prices as the Dutch and others flooded Guernsey's main market, the UK mainland. Many went out of business. The decline and fall of the tomato, however, does not mean that horticulture has disappeared from Guernsey altogether. There was a short-lived kiwi fruit industry in the 1980s which faded because of cheap competition. And tomatoes are still grown, albeit on a smaller scale and usually on large (for Guernsey) holdings with high-technology production. Mr Graham Greene at the Sandpiper Nursery owns 8 acres and grows mostly tomatoes on 5 acres. He was making money until a year ago when prices suddenly dropped by 25 per cent and he went into loss. He has not been helped by debts of nearly Pounds 400,000. Mr Greene says: 'You have to make the investment. You need to put in metal glass instead of wood glass to contain heat loss. Everything is computer-controlled, from the feed, to the water, to the lighting. In this way you can keep costs, particularly labour costs, under control and increase productivity.' Mr Greene believes there will continue to be a horticulture industry. He sees consolidation and size, whether it is in tomatoes or flowers, as the way forward. At the moment there are 600 growers in Guernsey and an average holding of about half an acre. Mr John Ogier, an advisory assistant at the HAS, agrees that horticulture will continue to be an important minor industry. He says: 'Okay, the industry has contracted. But it still accounts for over 6 per cent of GNP and about 10 per cent of employment. In England, agriculture accounts for less than 2 per cent of GNP and employs hardly anyone.' The main emphasis of the reduced industry is on cut flowers. Guernsey has about 10 per cent of the total cut flower market and 90 per cent of freesias. In all, the horticulture industry exports Pounds 33.7m by value. Freesias amount to Pounds 8.1m, with roses coming a close second at Pounds 7.6m. A further Pounds 14m in the island's economy can be directly linked to horticulture through Guernsey companies in products, transport, glasshouse building, fuel supply, analysis and advice. Besides the growers there are a further 1,800 people employed in the industry with 200 in associated industries. Mr Peter Falla says: 'We do not accept that the industry is bound to decline further. The per capita purchase of cut flowers in Britain is only about 40 per cent of some European countries. We sell only through wholesalers at the moment, so there is scope for adding value to the product through dealing directly with retailers.' He does not think that consolidation into bigger units is inevitable. He says: 'The investment needed now is great and this militates against the small growers. But through co-operatives and better marketing there is a lot that can be done.' There is a small agriculture sector on the island, with a herd of 2,500 protected Guernsey cows on 65 farms. They are used mainly to keep the island self sufficient in dairy products.</p>

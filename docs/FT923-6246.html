			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian output forecast to fall by 8% CANADA'S GOLD production will fall by about 8 per cent this year from the record level in 1991, the first drop in output for six years, suggests Metals Economics Group, the Halifax, Nova Scotia-based think-tank. It says production reached 4.981m troy ounces last year, very slightly ahead of the 4.957m ounces in 1990. Canada's gold output had previously been rising very strongly since 1985, at which time it was only 2.1m ounces. The number of Canadian gold mines fell from 73 in 1990 to 70 last year and MEG says the total will be down to 55 this year. The most productive three mines are all in the Hemlo area of Ontario: International Corona/Teck's Williams mine (518,703 ounces); Hemlo's Golden Giant (443,438 ounces); and Teck/International Corona's David Bell (283,128 ounces). Together they contributed about 25 per cent of 1991 Canadian production but their total output fell by about 100,000 ounces from 1990. MEG estimates that production from these three mines will fall by another 100,000 ounces this year. Ontario produced 2.4m ounces of gold last year, down from 2.6m ounces and its output is forecast to be 2.3m this year. Quebec, Canada's second-largest producer, saw production up from 1.25m ounces to 1.46m ounces last year but it is predicted to slip to 1.4m in 1992.

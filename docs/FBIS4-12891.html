			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Who Is To Blame For The  Disappointment?" the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: Any careful  examination of the peace process since its inception makes it  clear that the peace process is virtually stalemated. This  gives rise to questions on who is to blame for this  disappointment over a process on which great hopes were pinned,  and for which enormous and matchless international efforts were  mobilized. The paper replies, saying that the Israeli rulers  are to blame for the current stalemate in the peace talks. For  the Israeli rulers have always been opposed to the peace process  since its inception. They have always sought to render it void  of any meaningful content during all stages of the negotiations.    The paper also holds the United States, the major cosponsor  of the peace process, responsible for this stalemate in the  talks, particularly since the United States has undertaken to  perform the role of full partner. The paper adds that this  partner has failed to use its influence and means of persuasion  with the Israeli rulers. Neither has it defended the terms of  reference agreed upon for the peace process.    The paper disapproves of the U.S. position that the solution  should not be imposed on the negotiators, as if adherence to  international legitimacy and its resolutions and the terms of  reference agreed on for the peace process were tantamount to an  imposition of a solution. The paper notes that the party that  is not complying with international legitimacy is the one that  seeks to impose its views, conditions, and wishes on all  parties, including the international community.    The paper asserts that peace cannot be achieved in cellars,  nor can it be achieved by noncompliance with international  legitimacy and its resolutions. The peace process cannot make  headway away from the agreed terms of reference.    The paper believes that those who are conspiring against the  peace process by dragging one another to alleged agreements  cannot inspire trust and promote confidence in their good  intentions. These parties cannot respect their undertakings,  pledges, and deadlines, which they daily describe as not sacred.  For the only thing that is sacred to them is the perpetuation  of the occupation and the usurpation of rights.    The paper adds: Given all this, Israel is to blame for the  disappointment over the peace process, the disappointment that  could destroy and kill the current opportunity for peace. For,  the Arabs, headed by Syria, have demonstrated an unwavering  commitment to just and comprehensive peace.    The paper concludes by saying: The tactics of maneuvering  aimed to exhaust adversaries are doomed to failure, for there is  no room for accepting Israeli dictates once the other sides are  exhausted; that is, on the basis of consecrating the premise of  negotiating from a position of superiority and arrogance. This  game is exposed, and will always remain unacceptable.    Under the headline "Who Is To Blame?" the newspaper  AL-THAWRAH says: Israel has managed to dilute all the momentum  created during the various phases of the peace process,  particularly after Syria submitted its well-known working paper  to the Israeli negotiators, and made it clear, through  diplomatic channels, in the bilateral talks, and via all  possible media and political means, that its practical concept  of peace is based on the principle of trading land for peace. A  subscription by Israel to this concept must result in complete  Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, including  the occupied Golan Heights and southern Lebanon, and also in a  recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian Arab  people.    AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: The entire world community has  welcomed the outcome of the Geneva summit between Presidents  al-Asad and Clinton, and deemed it a breakthrough toward the  achievement of just and comprehensive in the region. But, since  then, Israel has done its utmost, using all possible means of  pressure, misrepresentation of facts, and blackmail on the U.S.  scene, to neutralize the outcome of the Geneva summit so as to  preclude the attainment by the United States of a broad-minded  and proper understanding of the regional conflict. This  endeavor on Israel's part was also meant to enable Israel to set  loose from the United States' commitment to activate its role as  an honest partner in the peace talks. This is because Israel  does not want to comply with international legitimacy, and to  meet the requirements of peace.    The paper says: Regrettably, the Israeli efforts on the U.S.  scene have borne fruit. They have managed to portray the U.S.  Administration in a way that is different from what it was in  the immediate aftermath of the Geneva summit. For, truths have  begun to disappear, leaving room for Israeli deception and  Israeli propaganda to manage the U.S. foreign policy with regard  to the Middle East and peace efforts. Perhaps, this is the most  serious impasse that has faced the peace process.    The paper adds: The Arabs, who have demonstrated their good  faith toward the cause of just and comprehensive peace, counted  on a vigorous and active U.S. role to ensure compliance with the  terms of reference agreed on for the peace process and the  Madrid conference per the U.S. commitments President Clinton  reiterated in Geneva. But, for now, the Arabs are shocked by the  U.S. submission to the Israeli argument in contravention of all  pledges and commitments.    AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: Unless the U.S. position is  freed of the Israeli attempts at containment, and unless  Washington acts in line with its international commitments and  responsibilities, all efforts will end in failure. For current  indications do not auger well for the future if Israel fails to  withdraw its troops from the Arab territories, and if just and  comprehensive peace remains elusive.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special Inspection of Japan's All Nuclear Facilities </F> Urged"--KCNA headline"]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- Pak Yong-nam, director  of the General Department of the Atomic Energy of the DPRK, in a  letter to Hans Blix, general director of the International  Atomic Energy Agency, on May 23 said it is necessary for the  IAEA Secretariat to raise Japan's plutonium concealment case for  discussion at an extraordinary meeting of the board of governors  of the agency without delay and probe the truth behind it and  promptly take a measure for a more overall and thoroughgoing  special inspection of all the nuclear facilities in Japan.    Recalling that as much as 70 kg of unaccounted-for plutonium  had been concealed for five years at a factory of Japan where  agency's groups of inspectors are said to have been stationed  for inspection, the letter said:    "The international community expresses deep concern over the  fact that the IAEA invented a 'nuclear suspicion' with regard to  the DPRK's fledgling peaceful nuclear activities and thereby  created complexity, while failing to call in question the  concealment of plutonium in Japan and its dangerous nuclear  activities, which is obviously a double-standard policy".    "This case cannot be overlooked today when Japan's nuclear  armament which has reached the danger line in actuality poses a  threat to peace and security in Asia, in the Korean peninsula in  particular," the letter said, expressing the hope that the IAEA  will discharge its original mission in compliance with its  statute and with the requirements of the safeguards agreement it  signed with the relevant country.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 8 WORLD CUP BERTHS SETTLED TODAY  </P> <P> Eight berths in soccer's World Cup finals will be at stake today, when 14  European nations end 18 months of qualifying matches with their final games.  </P> <P> The various possibilities are mind-boggling in Groups 1 and 4, where four of  Europe's strongest soccer nations are vying for three places.  </P> <P> Denmark, one point ahead of Romania in Group 1, travels to Bucharest for a  deciding match. In Group 4, the Netherlands, one point ahead of West Germany,  plays host to Finland, while the West Germans face Wales.  </P> <P> As in all groups, the leaders in Groups 1 and 4 automatically go to the final  round. But only one of the runners-up will advance.  </P> <P> Group 3 provides the most fascinating scenario. Four of the five nations in the  group are making one last effort to grab two berths.  </P> <P> If the Soviets beat or tie Turkey in the Ukraine, they will win the group title  and advance. The Turks also will advance with a tie if Austria and East Germany  tie in a game in Vienna. A victory by either of those two would eliminate  Turkey.  </P> <P> In Group 5, a tie for the Scots at home against Norway would send them to the  finals along with group winner Yugoslavia. But defeat for the Scots in Glasgow  would let in France, provided it beats Cyprus.  </P> <P> Portugal can join Group 7 champion Belgium in the finals only if it beats  Czechoslovakia by four goals in Lisbon. Otherwise, Czechoslovakia will be the  qualifying runner-up.  </P> <P> Ireland has possibly the easiest task of all as it bids for a place in the  finals for the first time. The Irish travel to Malta needing just a tie to join  Group 6 champion Spain.  </P></p>

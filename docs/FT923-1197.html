			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Fixed-rate home loan at 8.25% A BUILDING society mortgage which is probably the first at a five-year fixed rate of 8.25 per cent was offered yesterday by National &amp; Provincial, the seventh-largest society, as more medium-sized mortgage lenders broke ranks and cut interest rates. National &amp; Provincial cut its variable mortgage rate for new borrowers to 9.99 per cent. Northern Rock, one of the two societies that reduced rates on Tuesday, came into the market with a mortgage with interest fixed at 8.99 per cent for two years. The new norm for variable-interest-rate mortgages is emerging at around 9.99 per cent. Societies have kept some of the benefit of the base rate cut and are likely to widen the margin between lending rates and rates to investors. Royal Bank of Scotland cut its mortgage rate for new borrowers from 10.7 per cent to 9.95 per cent. Existing customers do not benefit yet. Skipton, which raised its mortgage interest rate for existing customers to 11.25 per cent in August, said it was cutting it to 10.25 per cent. The same rate will apply to new borrowers from October 19. Midland Bank cut its mortgage rate for new borrowers from 10.7 per cent to 9.95 per cent. Rates for existing borrowers will change on October 23.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Mexico and Bolivia to sign free trade accord Mexico and Bolivia are to sign a free trade agreement at this weekend's meeting of the Rio group of Latin American nations. The agreement will be Mexico's fifth with a Latin American country, following similar accords with Colombia and Venezuela, Chile and Costa Rica. It will come into effect on January 1. Mexico's free trade agreement with the US and Canada took effect on January 1 this year. Mexican President Carlos Salinas said on Wednesday that it was 'very encouraging' that negotiations over the treaty were concluded. He provided no details of the agreement, nor would he say when the treaty would come into effect. Bolivia's ambassador to Mexico has previously said the accord would be signed by the country's two presidents at the Rio meeting. The agreement is largely symbolic, with bilateral trade some Dollars 33m last year, a fraction of Mexico's total trade of Dollars 117bn. According to earlier press reports, the accord will remove tariff and most non-tariff barriers over a 10-year period. The eight member countries of the Rio Group are expected to discuss in the two day meeting the possibility of further economic integration, and their response to the problems in Haiti and Cuba.</p>

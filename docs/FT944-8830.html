			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Chile to enter Nafta 'sooner or later' Chilean President Eduardo Frei said Chile would enter the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) 'sooner or later,' Reuter reports from Tokyo. He also said the summit of the Americas in Florida next month would raise trade issues including Nafta. Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said he was 'very optimistic' about talks aimed at bringing Chile into Nafta, but did not expect any significant advances until next year. Chilean officials have been in contact with Clinton administration officials about how and when to bring Chile, next in line to join Nafta, into the free-trade pact. But Chile's move into the agreement was put on hold in September when the Clinton administration withdrew from Congress clauses which would give US negotiators 'fast-track' powers to implement bills without amendment. Chile became the 18th member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) in Indonesia this week. President Frei and US President Bill Clinton met for talks including trade issues at the Apec forum. 'The Apec includes the members of the Nafta, such as the US, Canada and Mexico. This means that Nafta is a part of the Apec at the same time,' Mr Frei said. See Feature: Different aims, common cause</p>

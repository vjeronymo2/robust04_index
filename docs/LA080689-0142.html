			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GANGS, DRUGS REAPPEAR ON BLYTHE STREET;  </P> <P> OLD ENEMIES RETURN AFTER POLICE DISBAND TASK FORCE  </P> <P> The group of seven young men stood on the curb on Blythe Street in Panorama  City, taking friendly jabs at one another, striking tough-guy poses and just  waiting. One teen-ager even brought a kitchen chair, set it at the curb and sat  back in the afternoon sun.  </P> <P> A new station wagon slowly made its way along the graffiti-marred block and  stopped in front of the gathering. Two of the youths rushed to the car's  windows and leaned in. Words were passed, then money. Change was handed back to  the driver, along with a small bag of what appeared to be marijuana.  </P> <P> The station wagon headed off, and the young men went back to the curb.  </P> <P> It has been less than four months since a Los Angeles Police Department task  force that targeted the half-mile stretch of Blythe Street was disbanded, but  police and residents say drug dealers and gangs are beginning to make a  comeback in the neighborhood.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Police Target  </P> <P> From July, 1987, until May of this year, Blythe, from Van Nuys Boulevard to  Brimfield Avenue, was the target of the 13-officer Narcotics Enforcement  Detail, as well as a variety of neighborhood-improvement efforts by the city  and apartment owners and residents.  </P> <P> And by all accounts, the campaign was successful. The task force officers made  more than 500 arrests. Drug dealers and gang members were forced off the curbs  of the apartment-lined street, and the neighborhood lost its distinction as a  drive-through drug market.  </P> <P> "Blythe Street was pretty clean when we left," said Sgt. John Preston, one of  the task force's supervisors.  </P> <P> But like weeds cut down but not uprooted, drug peddlers once again await  customers on the curbs along Blythe. The neighborhood is again marked with  graffiti. And residents, who a year ago saw vast improvements, now say the  neighborhood is sliding back.  </P> <P> "Things got good here; now I think they are getting worse again," said a  longtime resident who last year allowed the officers to use her apartment to  secretly watch drug dealers. She asked not to be identified because she fears  reprisals from gang members and drug peddlers.  </P> <P> "I get up two, three times a night when I hear things, shots," she said. "In  the day I see the boys on bikes, looking out for the drug dealers. I call the  police so much they must know my voice. Soon it will be like there was no  difference."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Graffiti Removed  </P> <P> While the NED unit was around, curbside parking was eliminated so police would  have a clear view of the street, and most of the graffiti were removed by  resident groups.  </P> <P> Police gang and narcotics squads have increased patrols on Blythe since the  task force was disbanded. But police concede that crime is on the increase in  the neighborhood of mostly low-income families and new immigrants, many of whom  live in crowded apartments and are unemployed.  </P> <P> "It is getting kind of rough there again," said Sgt. Jim Flavin, in charge of  an anti-gang unit that patrols Blythe. "When the NED guys pulled out, the gang  guys pulled back in."  </P> <P> David Combs, a manager of a Blythe Street apartment building, said gangs and  drug dealers have boldly stepped forward in recent months to reclaim the  street. He said gang members attempt to intimidate residents who want to clean  up the neighborhood.  </P> <P> "The gang members run this street," he said. "A lot of people are scared, and  you can't blame them. It's a constant battle on Blythe Street. The Police  Department does what it can, but the drug dealing and the gangs are all still  here. The task force isn't."  </P> <P> A visitor to the neighborhood is greeted by symbols of local gang members:  8-foot-high letters -- BST -- are painted on the side wall of a furniture store  at Blythe and Van Nuys Boulevard. The monogram, short for Blythe Street, is  shared by two gangs that coexist in the neighborhood, the Dukes and the  Cyclones. Graffiti -- slogans, nicknames, caricatures -- cover neighborhood  walls and fences. Almost nothing is spared.  </P> <P> Police could not provide crime statistics for the neighborhood -- departmental  statistics are kept for a wider area. But there are other indications that  crime is up.  </P> <P> "They are still dealing on Blythe," said Sgt. Mario Mascolo, a supervisor of a  Valley narcotics unit. "We go by there all the time."  </P> <P> Residents' complaints about crime routinely are called to Councilman Ernani  Bernardi's office, said Irene Slater, a deputy for the councilman, whose  district includes the neighborhood.  </P> <P> "We constantly receive complaints about dope and gangs," she said. "You clean  up the place, and they come right back in."  </P> <P> Slater said she regularly visits Blythe Street to check on complaints and talk  to residents and apartment managers about problems. She said young drug dealers  often approach her car asking if she wants to buy marijuana. She keeps her car  doors locked.  </P> <P> In May, there was an attempted murder on Blythe, which police believe occurred  when a motorist tried to "take the dime" from two drug dealers. Police said the  motorist grabbed drugs from the dealers and sped off without paying. He drove  to Willis Avenue but could not escape because of a concrete roadblock placed  across Blythe by the city two years ago to discourage drive-through drug  dealing.  </P> <P> When the drug thief turned his car around and tried to drive past the dealers,  police said, a steel pipe was hurled into the car. The driver was seriously  injured but survived. Police see the incident as further evidence of the  neighborhood's problems.  </P> <P> Authorities are puzzled about what, if anything, can be done to stop the  neighborhood's decline.  </P> <P> While the task force was a successful operation, the unit was only a temporary  solution to the neighborhood's problems, said Deputy Police Chief Ronald A.  Frankle. Its members, who were borrowed from police divisions throughout the  Valley, worked full time on Blythe for nine months and then split time between  the neighborhood and other drug hot spots in the Valley for another year, he  said. The unit was disbanded in April.  </P> <P> It is unlikely that another unit will be formed, Frankle said, since police  administrators have decided that manpower cannot be spared.  </P> <P> Authorities said law enforcement is only part of a solution to Blythe Street's  problems. Alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment, poverty and crowded housing  also must be addressed, they say.  </P> <P> Bernardi's office has scheduled a meeting of owners, managers, police and city  officials Thursday to again discuss solutions to neighborhood woes. "I don't  think there are any magic answers," Slater said. "But we have to get as many  people involved as possible. It will take perseverance."  </P> <P> Some on Blythe already have shown they can persevere.  </P> <P> Combs, the apartment manager, said it has been an uphill battle in the past  year to clean up the 40-unit complex he manages. He said he has evicted dozens  of suspected gang members and drug dealers who were crowded into apartments in  the building.  </P> <P> A year ago, he said, syringes littered the building's stairwells and gang  members hung around outside. Now the building is clean, and there is no  loitering near the front gate, he said.  </P> <P> Combs' building, which he said was at the eye of the storm a year ago, is one  of the few on the block without graffiti-covered exterior walls.  </P> <P> During his tenure, Combs said, the windows of his apartment have been shot out  or broken with rocks six times after threats by gang members.  </P> <P> "My philosophy is that I will outlast them," he said. "If somebody puts  graffiti on my walls, I'll paint over it. We can do it over and over, but I  won't stop. I won't let them get a foothold here. Because then this place would  get like the rest of the street."  </P></p>

The heads of the foreign policy departments of  the two states examined a package of Russian-American documents  to be signed in the course of the visit to Moscow by the U.S.  President.    Galina Sidorova, the Russian minister's political adviser,  told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that three agreements have been  made ready for signing: Air traffic; health and biomedical  research cooperation; and cooperation in the area of studying  the effects of radiation on people's health and on the  environment. A memorandum of intentions and cooperation in the  sphere of export controls is also ready for signing. A joint  Russian-American statement on the Near East will also be adopted.    Galina Sidorova said that the Russian and the U.S.  Presidents  will sign the main document -- the Moscow Declaration. They  will also issue a statement on human rights and a statement on  nonproliferation of nuclear weapons.    Andrey Kozyrev and Warren Christopher focused especially on  the examination of the results of the NATO summit meeting in  Brussels, the range of issues concerning mutual relations with  Ukraine, and the position of the two sides on the eve of the  trilateral Russian- American-Ukrainian summit meeting on 14  January, Galina Sidorova noted. The heads of the Russian and  U.S. foreign policy departments discussed in detail the problems  of achieving a settlement in Bosnia.    Andrey Kozyrev emphasized in the course of the conversation  that "approval of the Partnership for Peace program was the key  result of the NATO session in Brussels." The formula is  completely to Russia's liking. Andrey Kozyrev stressed: "We  understand it to mean a broad and equal cooperation among all  the interested sides."</p>

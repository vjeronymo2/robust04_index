			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Distance helps to put rhetoric in perspective  -View from: Wall Street THE possibility of an outright Labour victory may have rattled the London stock market last week, but Wall Street seems to be taking a more sanguine, though not completely untroubled, view. Some US fund managers argue that if British share prices fall much further, the market may even present interesting buying opportunities. 'We are reaching the kind of risk/reward levels where it might reward one to be slightly more in than slightly more out,' says Mr John Hickling, who runs a fund specialising in Europe at Fidelity, a US investment management group. Why such sang-froid? It is partly because any US fund manager with a degree of foresight is likely to have lightened his UK position many months ago in anticipation of political uncertainty. Mr Hickling, for example, has been 'underweight' in the UK for the past six months - in other words, he has reduced his British holdings relative to those in continental countries. But it also stems from the perspective on British affairs granted by a distance of 3,000 miles: US fund managers tend to view Europe as a single entity, and having lived for years with socialist government in France, the possibility of one in Britain does not hold too many horrors. Indeed, the bulk of analysts' reports sent home from the London offices of Wall Street houses over recent weeks have stressed how much Tory and Labour economic policies have in common, notably in the areas of exchange rates and the fiscal deficit. 'Despite the rhetoric, there is little difference between the macro-economic policies of the two main parties,' said a Merrill Lynch circular. 'Evidence of the past 25 years suggests there is little to choose between Labour and Conservatives either in terms of their economic record or of their impact on the equity market.' Similarly, Salomon Brothers maintained that: 'A change of government, either to a Labour majority or to a minority administration, would not significantly change near-term economic growth prospects, because neither the Conservatives nor the Labour party is offering a break from the tight monetary and moderately loose fiscal policies of the past year.' That is not to say that US fund managers would not prefer a Tory victory. In the short-term, many expect a further sharp drop in share prices, possibly accompanied by a sterling crisis, if Labour wins or there is a hung parliament. Many are also suspicious about how much Labour really has modified its socialist agenda, and - a crucial issue for foreign investors  - the party's commitment to maintaining sterling at its present level within the European monetary system. 'At this point I think we can only assume Mr Kinnock will stick to his word,' says Fidelity's Mr Hickling. 'But I could envision him getting in and saying 'now we've looked at the books and it's different'.' However, relatively few on Wall Street have a keen interest in the outcome of the election, because few of them have a sizeable direct financial stake in the country. For most Americans, investing abroad remains slightly exotic, and they are far more concerned about prospects for US recovery and the Democratic party primary election in New York state. Elsewhere, their anxieties are focused on the slide of the Tokyo stock market and its possible repercussions at home. At the same time, some Wall Streeters wonder whether the British election might be providing straws in the wind to some broader political and financial forces. Mr Donald Coxe, chief economist at institutional trader Gordon Capital, says his clients have been wondering whether Labour's new strength is indicative of a general swing to the left which could be reflected in this year's US presidential election. He also notes that there has been an 'almost mystic convergence' between the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index of leading US stocks and the FT-SE 100 index over the past two years. However, London's sharp drop during the past few weeks has broken this parallel movement. Does this represent a parting of the ways, possibly temporary, or just might the British election be sending advance warning of bearish times ahead on Wall Street?</p>

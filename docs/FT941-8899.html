			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / BMW and Rover seek Honda talks Teams from BMW and Rover Group, the German and UK carmakers, are understood to be flying to Tokyo this weekend for talks with Rover's long-standing partner, Honda. The teams are expected to be led by Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW chairman, and Mr John Towers, Rover chief executive. Honda has a 20 per cent stake in Rover and has made plain its anger at British Aerospace's Pounds 800m sale of its 80 per cent stake to BMW. The Japanese manufacturer has worked closely with Rover for 15 years. However, Honda has indicated that its quarrel is not with Rover or BMW but with BAe. It regards Rover as powerless to have prevented the sale and is understood not to blame BMW for taking the opportunity to buy Rover. Both parties are going to Tokyo to persuade Honda not to withdraw from its collaboration with Rover and point to benefits in long-term tripartite co-operation. Mr Pischetsrieder yesterday vigorously denied rumours that BMW planned to reduce the Rover product range. He also repeated pledges that the British business would be run as an independent operation, adding that aggregate sales of DM40bn (Pounds 15.7bn) and the expected profits would offer job security to employees of both companies. Earlier this week, he promised 'considerably higher' investment in Rover than had been planned by BAe. BMW also said yesterday that it expected to boost profits by 20-30 per cent this year, recovering much of the ground lost in 1993 when net profits slumped almost 30 per cent, from DM726m to about DM510m. The group forecast a 5 per cent increase in deliveries of BMW models, and said income from the British business could increase earnings further. Mr Pischetsrieder based his optimism on new models due on the market this year, economic recovery in Europe and accelerating demand in the US. A compact, two-door version of the successful 3-Series was expected to bolster turnover, although production bottlenecks were currently limiting delivery prospects, Mr Pischetsrieder said. Further impetus would come from a revamped version of the 7-Series, which, contrary to some analysts' forecasts, would arrive on the market during the second half of this year. Mr Pischetsrieder said that the greatest uncertainty for BMW stemmed from unforeseeable exchange rate variations. But the board was 'well satisfied' with the situation.

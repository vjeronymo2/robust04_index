			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 10,000 ANSWER KABC-AM CALL FOR CANCER VOLUNTEERS  </P> <P> Responding to a novel use of the radio airwaves, more than 10,000 people called  talk-radio station KABC-AM (790) Tuesday morning volunteering to serve as  subjects for an experimental cancer detection test.  </P> <P> KABC General Manager George Green said he was stunned not only by the size but  also by the immediacy of the response. "I didn't expect to get that many people  that quick. . . . We got 5,000 in a half hour," he said.  </P> <P> Medical experts from UCLA's John Wayne Cancer Clinic said they took their  request for research subjects to the radio because they wanted a large sampling  of people on whom they could administer their detection procedure.  </P> <P> They stressed that the test is not yet considered definitive.  </P> <P> "There are many aspects of this that we can only really determine from such a  large sample," said Dr. Donald Morton, who has been working on the procedure  for 15 years with Dr. Rishab Gupta.  </P> <P> He and other doctors hope that early detection of cancer could provide victims  with earlier treatment and, ultimately, longer lives.  </P> <P> "Our goal with this test is simple: To be able to detect cancer at its earliest  stage and at a stage where 90% of people can be cured," Morton said.  </P> <P> KABC's Green said the station's day-long focus on cancer Tuesday had been in  the works for three months, since he first heard about the experiments at UCLA.  </P> <P> "We're trying to demonstrate that radio is more than just controversial b.s.,"  Green said. "There's some good that we can do for the community."  </P> <P> This will be the first widespread testing of the detection procedure, which  isolates antigen -- a chemical found in cancer patients -- in the urine of  patients. The only previous tests have been conducted on cancer patients, in  whom antigen was found in higher quantities, according to the John Wayne Cancer  Clinic. In all kinds of cancers, antigen is manufactured on the surface of  cells.  </P> <P> "If antigens are detected in urine, therefore, it is a virtually certain  indicator that cancer is present in the system -- even if that cancer is so  small that it is still undetectable through conventional diagnostic means," the  clinic said in a press release.  </P> <P> The UCLA clinic said that if the test lives up to its promise, "a routine urine  test for cancer could be a standard part of every physical -- and the cancer  death rate could drop dramatically."  </P> <P> The test will be conducted by obtaining urine samples from experimental  subjects.  </P> <P> Those who test positive for the presence of antigen will be contacted by  researchers and informed "in a very tactful manner," said Gerri Farnell, a  spokeswoman for the project. They will be encouraged to contact their own  physicians and will undergo further testing by the UCLA researchers.  </P> <P> In an on-air editorial during the Michael Jackson talk show, Green said that  "KABC believes this project promises to be one of the most exciting  developments in the process to cure cancer." But in a telephone interview  later, he acknowledged that "the test itself is not a sure-fire test for  whether you have cancer or not. It's part of a research experiment."  </P> <P> UCLA and KABC are seeking a total of 15,000 people to volunteer for testing --  with the expectation that many may drop out. To that end, experiment  coordinators will go to three shopping malls this week to recruit more  subjects. Test kits will be handed out today at Northridge Fashion Center, at  Westminster Mall on Thursday and Friday and at the Westside Pavilion on  Saturday and Sunday.  </P></p>

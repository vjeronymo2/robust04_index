			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by diplomatic </F> correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy  Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] Even limited NATO air strikes on positions of the  Bosnian Serbs would mean qualitative changes in the  military-political situation not only in Bosnia but all over  Europe, a Russian senior diplomat told Interfax Wednesday.    He said the strikes would negatively influence a plan for a  peaceful settlement because they would make the Bosnian Serbs  more hostile and the Moslems more irreconcilable.    The diplomat said that the special envoy of the Russian  President, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, currently in  the Balkan countries, left Zagreb Wednesday for Belgrade to  again meet with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. The  diplomat preferred not to provide the details of the trip. He  only said that it was dictated by "supreme interests."    He confirmed that recently the command of the UN protection  force in the former Yugoslavia attempted, ignoring Moscow, to  send part of the Russian servicemen from the battalion stationed  in Slavonia (Croatia), to Sarajevo. "We reacted with a  demarche, after which the command of the UN Protection Force  apologized and said that in the future the decision on the  location of the Russian servicemen will be taken after  preliminary consultations with Moscow, said the diplomat.    He, however, did not deny that the Russian "blue helmets"  may  be deployed near the Bosnian capital. He said, however, that  this would only happen if the conflicting sides agree to such a  measure, in which case the question of the NATO bombing would be  crossed out from the agenda and reinforcements will be needed to  back up the UN troops deployed around Sarajevo. But even in  such a case, the last word would be Moscow's, he concluded.    Sources in the State Duma told Interfax that members of the  parliamentary committee for geopolitics, which on Tuesday  considered the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, decided, after  the consultations with Russian Foreign Ministry experts, to give  up the appeal to restore the former Yugoslavia.    According to one deputy, the new wording of the committee's  resolution will contain an appeal to all Bosnian factions to  halt, as early as possible, bloodshed and to forgive the  offences of the past.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Speech by O. Shenin at Kalininskiy Rayon Conference in </F> Moscow: "United for Victory!"]    [Text] I think that our goals are clear and understandable.  They are reestablishment of the unified state--the Soviet Union,  restoration of government by the people--the soviets of people's  deputies, and, without any question, a return to the socialist  pattern of development.    What should we do at this exceptionally complex time? Should  we adapt to present circumstances or strive to take charge of  them and direct them? I feel that the second option is more  important for communists and the communist movement. For this  reason, I do not always accept hasty decisions that have not  been preceded by thorough consideration. We should recall the  events in October, when some comrades believed that power was  within our grasp. This was an absolutely groundless opinion, and  it led to groundless actions.    Even today many people are saying that we should simply take  charge of the government and then decide what kind of society we  want to build. This is also a colossal mistake. Some people even  plan to avoid all "isms" for the time being. We must begin, they  say, by restoring order in the country and stabilizing the  situation, and then we can decide whether we want to build  capitalism or socialism. I think a communist has no right to  take this stance.    We must take the same approach to the issue of national  accord and civic peace. There are many questions in this area.  When we talk about national accord and civic peace, we have to  invest this term with a specific meaning. We have to stipulate  the exact terms on which we would agree to this, because some of  the people who are now appealing to us for accord and peace are  those who recently destroyed them with their own hands. They  include the president and the head of the Cabinet of Ministers.  Are they hoping to perpetuate the pervasive chaos and  degradation?    There is no question that our tactics might change. There  could be a variety of opinions and actions, but the main thing  is that our tactics must not get in the way of our strategy or  obstruct its essential purpose.    In spite of all of the present turmoil, the communist  movement in our country is gaining in strength and numbers. We  can see this in Russia and Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], in Belorussia  [Belarus] and Tajikistan, in Southern Ossetia and Tataria.  Furthermore, we can already attest to the united action of many  of our communist detachments. The chief aim of the absolute  majority of communists is the formation of a single party within  the territory of the Soviet Union. Our meetings with  representatives of various communist organizations in Russia  have provided us with further evidence of this.    Today virtually everyone realizes that disaster can only be  avoided and this tragedy can only be endured on one  condition--the creation of a unified state. Without this, no  economic, political, social, or interethnic problems will be  solved. That is why all people who cherish these goals must  strive for organizational unification.    Can the communist movement and the communist parties  accomplish this? I believe that they can. This is the primary  goal of the work of the UCP-CPSU. Our union was formed in  accordance with a decision of the 29th CPSU Congress. The  declaration adopted at that congress said that the CPSU would be  turned into an international voluntary union of communist  parties in response to the current situation in the Soviet Union.    The program and charter of the UCP-CPSU are in force.  Specific goals corresponding to the level of our work have been  defined. Various Union structures are still functioning. It is  our job to interact with them and organize them, beginning with  the Union structures of the communist movement.    The communist parties of 10 republics are now full-fledged  members of the UCP-CPSU. We are pleased to report that we  recently acquired several new associate members and, what is  particularly important, that they include the Communist Party of  the Russian Federation and the Russian Communist Workers Party.  All the parties, including the associate members of the  UCP-CPSU, have their own programs (with the exception of the  CPRF). It gives me pleasure to report that a serious step toward  the resolution of this problem was taken at the March (1994)  Plenum of the CPRF Central Executive Committee: There was a  discussion of a draft CPRF program, which will be published  after the text has been finalized. It is still being discussed  in party organizations. I think the All-Russian (April) CPRF  Conference could adopt a document defining the political image  of the largest organization in Russia and the entire territory  of the Soviet Union.    As you know, a joint statement by the leadership of the  UCP-CPSU Council and the CPRF Central Executive Committee,  containing several important provisions with regard to the  consolidation of Russia's communists, was signed on 3 February  1994. It specifically stresses that the question of the CPRF's  full-fledged membership in the UCP-CPSU will be discussed at the  All-Russian (April) CPRF Conference.    I feel that too much time is being spent on discussion of  membership in the UCP-CPSU. There are frequent unproductive  debates, and the issue itself is spurious. Could anyone deny  that all the newly emerging communist organizations were  established on the basis of the CPSU?    I hope that the issue of membership in the UCP-CPSU will  finally be settled at the upcoming CPRF conference. This will  pave the way for the unification of other parties in the  fraternal republics.    There is another equally difficult problem: the unity of the  communist movement in Russia. Should we consider convening an  all-Russian congress of communists after the April CPRF  conference? This objective is just as important as the  establishment of the Union organization. Both could be attained  at the same time. One would not interfere with the other. In  fact, it would only have a stimulating effect.    There are so many people who want to split the communist  movement. Some are working specifically toward this goal in  accordance with the appropriate programs. Others are doing it  unconsciously, not even realizing that they are actually adding  grist to the mill of our political opponents. That is why the  overwhelming majority of members of the Political Executive  Committee of the UCP-CPSU Council, and I personally, oppose all  types of parallel party structures, conferences, and organizing  committees. The problems of unification have to be addressed  within our own party. However much we may respect our  administrative bodies, it is time for everyone to realize that  the party is an organization in which the communist individual  and the primary party unit are the foundation, and that they  will make the final decisions on the party's role in society,  its political image, and its future.    I feel that we have every opportunity for organizational  unification. It must be organizational, because we could have  ideological differences of opinion in the present situation.  This is completely understandable. Organizational unification,  however, would allow us to hold the 30th UCP-CPSU Congress and  approve all the basic policy-planning documents. They would then  lay an ideological foundation for the unification of all of the  communists of the Soviet Union. I am certain that this approach,  with consideration for the organizational and political autonomy  of each republic party, will bring us much closer to our present  goal. Our main concern, however unattainable the objective might  seem, is the issue of power. Yes, we must acknowledge that we  are in a stage of transition. I support the views of the  comrades here who said that we are living through a "second NEP  [New Economic Policy (1921-1936)]," but who will gain advantages  from this? Will the anti-people regime benefit from it or will  we? Under present conditions, it will be the regime. If the  question of power is settled in the interest of the majority,  then we can reap the benefits of this NEP, as V.I. Lenin once  did.    That is why I feel that it is time to do some serious work  on  the party program and formulate a state ideology that would pave  the way for an effective struggle against the anti-people  regime. It must be removed from the political stage. Then the  communist movement could begin working on its own rise to power  and on the full-scale move from the transition period to  socialism. That would be followed by the work of building a  socialist society and restoring the USSR.</p>

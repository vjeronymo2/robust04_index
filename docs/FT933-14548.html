			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / North sees domestic sales increase as exports decline THE NORTH of England's economy is continuing to pull out of recession, a survey published yesterday shows. It reported increasing levels of domestic sales and orders, profitability and investment. In spite of this the Business Survey North, which covers the second quarter this year, records a dip in export markets. Export orders fell by a third and the export sales balance - the number of companies reporting improvement rather than decline - was slightly down. The Northern Development Company produces the quarterly report with the Tyne and Wear and Teesside chambers of commerce. The research, based on responses from 795 companies in north-east England and Cumbria, shows a tripling in the positive balance on domestic sales. The balance was the highest for more than three years, with 47.1 per cent of companies reporting domestic sales up from the previous three months, compared with 22.4 per cent reporting a fall. The first-quarter figures were 39.5 per cent and 31.4 per cent respectively. Domestic orders also rose sharply, recording the best performance since the survey started in 1990. The positive balance for service companies doubled and half the manufacturers reported higher orders, giving a positive balance of 27. Company profits, very depressed since the middle of last year, showed their highest positive balance for nearly three years, although expectations of higher profits in the next 12 months barely rose. Prospects for turnover growth in the coming year were the brightest for three years, with a positive balance of 47. Manufacturers were more optimistic than service companies. Business Survey North.

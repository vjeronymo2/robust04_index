			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION VOLLEYBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> LAGUNA BEACH ROLLS TO SEMIFINALS WITH EASY VICTORY  </P> <P> Laguna Beach High School swept to a surprisingly easy 15-4, 15-7, 15-9 victory  over Capistrano Valley Tuesday night to advance to the semifinals of the  Southern Section 5-A girls' volleyball tournament.  </P> <P> The Artists' (19-1) superior serving game and balanced attack was more than a  match for the Cougars (17-4), who were coming off their first South Coast  League championship. The victory sets up Thursday's semifinal match with Mira  Costa.  </P> <P> Mira Costa is the tournament's No. 1 seed and is rated the top high school  girls' volleyball team in the nation by USA Today. The Artists are the  tournament's No. 4 seed.  </P> <P> "I thought we had the capability to win three straight," Artists Coach Lance  Stewart said. "When we're on top of our game, we can do it, and this was our  night."  </P> <P> Senior outside hitter Kit Spath's ace serve gave the Artists a 10-3 advantage  en route to their 15-4 first-set victory, and the Cougars could never recover  after that. "The girls seemed to get frustrated," Cougar Coach John Gipe said.  "We were our own worst enemies."  </P> <P> Outside hitters Sara Nelson and Spath led the balanced Laguna scoring with nine  kills apiece. Kealy Clark had eight. Setter Angie Rush contributed 12 assists.  Becky Linhart (12 kills, five blocks, six assists) and Christina Grady (10  kills) led Capistrano Valley's scoring.  </P> <P> In Southern Section 5-A girls' volleyball quarterfinals:  </P> <P> Corona del Mar 3, St. Joseph 0 -- Krista Hartling had 10 kills and seven digs  and Lara Carlsen had 11 kills and eight blocks as the Sea Kings (23-1) advanced  to the semifinals with a 15-10, 15-8, 15-13 victory at home. Setter Prentice  Perkins had 27 assists for the Sea Kings, who will play Santa Barbara Thursday  in the semifinals.  </P> <P> In 4-A girls' volleyball quarterfinals:  </P> <P> Esperanza 3, Edison 1 -- Sharman Grant had 18 kills and Jonnie Jung had 10 to  lead the Aztecs (16-1), 15-12, 15-9, 12-15, 15-10, at Esperanza. Esperanza will  play Arcadia in the semifinals Thursday.  </P> <P> In 1-A girls' volleyball quarterfinals:  </P> <P> Santa Margarita 3, LA Baptist 2 -- Adine Powloski had 17 kills and Megan Morse  had 12 kills and four blocks as Santa Margarita (19-2) won, 15-12, 13-15,  15-12, 9-15, 15-9, at home. Santa Margarita will play St. Anthony in the  semifinals Thursday. TOM BIRSCHBACH  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEMPORARY LOCATION PICKED FOR CULVER CITY HALL OFFICES  </P> <P> The Culver City Council has decided to move into temporary offices on a  residential lot at Culver Boulevard and Overland Avenue while the city's  72-year-old City Hall is being replaced.  </P> <P> Three people spoke Monday night against the council's plans to set up temporary  trailers on the three-acre corner lot owned by the Redevelopment Agency.  </P> <P> The lot is the same area the council had selected in February, 1987, for the  new City Hall, but public outcry for a downtown site forced the council to find  another location.  </P> <P> The city plans to raze the old City Hall at Culver Boulevard and Duquesne  Street and replace it with a 30,000-square-foot, L-shaped building.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Abuts Residential Area  </P> <P> City officials had expected more opposition to the temporary offices because  the site abuts a residential area.  </P> <P> "I was expecting at least a dozen people to speak, so yes, the fact that there  were only three people did surprise me," Councilwoman Jozelle Smith said.  </P> <P> The three people who spoke expressed concern about traffic, parking and whether  homes could later be built on the site.  </P> <P> Council members said that although the trailers will be in place for about four  years during demolition and construction of City Hall, preparations for private  development of the agency site will proceed after the city vacates it.  </P> <P> Jody Hall-Esser, assistant executive director of the Redevelopment Agency, said  city employees are expected to move into the trailers in June. The cost of  moving and maintaining the temporary facilities, about 2,800 square feet in  12-foot-by-60-foot trailers, is expected to be about $1.5 million over the four  years.  </P> <P> In a related matter, the City Council postponed a decision on the relocation of  Fire Station No. 1, which is next to City Hall, but agreed to build the new  station twice the size of the existing one to accommodate future growth.  </P> <P> The city staff had recommended that the new station be built on the back half  of Redevelopment Agency-owned property at Culver Boulevard and Irving Place  about a block away from City Hall.  </P> <P> But the council asked the staff to provide a financial analysis of a plan to  build the station on the police station parking lot behind City Hall. Staff had  opposed that plan because it would involve buying five or six residential lots  on Lafayette Place and Braddock Drive.  </P> <P> Hall-Esser said that the Redevelopment Agency could not afford to buy those  lots unless other projects were postponed and that the time involved could  delay construction of the fire station and City Hall.  </P> <P> The financial analysis is expected to come back to council within 30 days,  Hall-Esser said.  </P></p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Books: Polish interlude at the Holy See GOD'S POLITICIAN: JOHN PAUL AT THE VATICAN by David Willey Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 14.99, 258 pages IF ANY single individual can claim to have done most to undermine the Soviet Communist Empire, that person is Karol Wojtyla, better known as Pope John Paul II. Unbelievers may scoff at the notion that the Holy Spirit guided the cardinals to choose the relatively unknown Archbishop of Krakow to be successor to Peter and John Paul I; if not, it was surely an act of devilish political cunning by the princes of the Roman Church to choose a Polish Pope. His determination to revisit his homeland, his support for Lech Walesa and Solidarity - apart from one tactical retreat in 1983 - helped bring down Jaruzelski and install Walesa as Poland's president. Indeed, David Willey reports that at a 1983 mass at Warsaw football stadium John Paul behaved 'more like the King of Poland than the Vicar of Christ and Bishop of Rome.' Poland was the key example to the rest of the erstwhile Soviet empire. In the Soviet Union itself, there were manifold pressures on Mikhail Gorbachev. The pope, with no battalions and only a small minority of followers, used his moral authority and the diplomatic clout of the Holy See to good effect to appeal to the better nature of the Soviet leader in the constant crises of the 1980s. Through his travels to every continent and to more than 80 countries, John Paul II has made the church more visible than ever before. Through his encyclical letters, notably the 1988 Sollicitudo Rei Socialis, dealing with capitalism and communism, he has reminded the world that, though capitalism today seems triumphant, our civilisation still has to demonstrate that it can provide for the poor of the world. Not everyone applauds. Inside the Catholic Church itself the pope's critics are legion, accusing him of an autocratic style of rule that has destroyed the hopes of collegiality of the Second Vatican Council and has imposed a narrow Slav view of the world on a global church of 900m believers. Willey himself admits his doubts: 'My faith in God is intact, but my allegiance to the Roman Church has been suspended while I examine this brief Polish interlude in its long history.' The author's knowledge of Rome, as the BBC correspondent there, and of the often devious and Machiavellian ways of the Vatican give him a good vantage point. He has supplemented this by observations collected in accompanying the pope on his travels. The book is packed with fascinating facts from the 'Trivial Pursuit' type - like when a pope first started to wear white garments - to more substantial points, like the decline in recruitment to the priesthood. His chapters on the population explosion and on the poor state of the church's finances raise important awkward questions which the pope, sheltered from the grubby real world by his bullet-proof Popemobile, has refused to face squarely and honestly. But the size and very variety of the Catholic world means that Willey treats many issues, notably the church in the Third World and the church and Islam, skimpily. The book is also spoilt by its poor organisation. It bears the marks of being edited by too many pairs of hands, so that it is heavy-going through the Soviet pages, which should have been its keynote. All this means that, when the definitive biography of John Paul II is written, Willey's work will be an important reference source; it falls a long way short of being the seminal work on the pope.</p>

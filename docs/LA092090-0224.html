			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CAPISTRANO BEACH;  </P> <P> CHARGES SOUGHT AGAINST DEVELOPER  </P> <P> California State Police said Wednesday that they will seek a vandalism charge  against a builder who allegedly hired a tree cutter to fell a 75-year-old  Bishop pine so he could have an unobstructed view of the ocean.  </P> <P> On Monday, Dennis Michael Hall, the owner of Mission Tree Service in San  Clemente, was arraigned in South County Municipal Court in Laguna Niguel on a  misdemeanor vandalism charge. Hall, 35, is being held at the Theo Lacy Jail in  Orange, where he is serving a four-month sentence for possession of narcotics,  violation of probation and indecent exposure.  </P> <P> Detective Aaron Tassin of the California State Police declined to identify the  builder but said Hall's arraignment "in no way signaled" the end of the state's  investigation.  </P> <P> "He (Hall) had no other motivation to cut down the tree other than to get  paid," Tassin said. "This is a high-dollar crime that eventually comes out of  the pockets of taxpayers . . . and we want the payer (of the cutter) to be  financially liable."  </P> <P> Officials of the California Department of Transportation said the 45-foot  conifer, which was a landmark on the Camino de Estrella on-ramp of north  Interstate 5, was leveled on May 12, two days after Caltrans maintenance  supervisor Alan Kato intervened to prevent Hall and his crew from chopping it  down.  </P> <P> Neighbors said Wednesday that they were saddened by the felling of the tree.  </P> <P> "The kids played on it, it was a noise barrier, and it provided us with lots of  privacy," said Estelle Peters, whose house was partially shaded by the pine's  boughs. "When I came home and saw it gone, I felt as if I had lost a close  friend."  </P> <P> Kato said the tree's size and age made it "irreplaceable."  </P> <P> If convicted, Hall could receive a year in jail and be ordered to pay  restitution for his alleged involvement.  </P></p>

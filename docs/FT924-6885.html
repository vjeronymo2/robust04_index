			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Accusations in Tube dispute THE RMT rail union yesterday accused London Underground of 'reckless disregard' for passengers' safety as plans were drawn up for next week's all-out Tube strike. The action is in protest against the most radical pay and conditions shake-up on London Underground in 40 years. London Underground dismissed the accusation as 'absolute and utter nonsense'. The company, which has said it has enough staff willing to run a strike-breaking service, said it would not operate outside safety rules. The conciliation service Acas said it remained in touch with both parties.</p>

			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Israel has ordered its soldiers in the occupied Gaza Strip to shoot any masked  Arabs attempting to flee whether or not they have sought to attack soldiers,  political sources said in Jerusalem. They said army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan  Shomron disclosed the order to members of Parliament's Foreign Affairs and  Defense Committee. Shomron said that if the new rules prove a success in the  Gaza Strip, they could be extended to the occupied West Bank, the sources said.  Palestinian youths who hurl stones at Israeli troops in the territories and  enforce orders of the Arab uprising's leadership swathe their faces in  checkered headdresses to hamper identification by security forces.  </P></p>

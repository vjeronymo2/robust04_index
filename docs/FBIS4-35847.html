			<p>BFN     [Text] Describing his visit to the United States as  satisfactory, the president [Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari] said it  was timely and significant. The president, who returned to  Islamabad today after this two-week visit to the United States  and France was addressing a news conference at the Aiwan-i-Sadar  [President House] this evening.    [Begin Leghari recording] I would like to reiterate my  satisfaction with the outcome of the visit which was timely and  significant. At this stage of flux in international political  and economic relations, the U.S. Administration and corporate  America are considering the future directions of their policies  toward our region. My visit was a crucial opportunity to  present our viewpoints, try, and influence these decisions. It  must be recognized, however, that building a new relationship  with the U.S. in the post cold war era will be a poser. It  cannot be realized in one visit or at one time. My visit to the  U.S., I hope, will be judged by history as having promoted  Pakistan's security and prosperity and as forming a bridge  between our post cold war ties with the U.S. and the new  relationship which is responsive to the challenges and  opportunities of the emerging era in international affairs.  [end recording]    President Farooq Leghari said during his stay in the United  States, he met with the Vice President Al Gore. The U.S.  Secretary of State, Mr. Warren Christopher, and Deputy Secretary  of State Mr. Talbott called on him and he held a series of  meetings with other American officials and legislators as well  as IMF and World Bank leaders and heads of various financial  institutions. He said in his talks with the U.S. leaders it was  agreed that the two countries would try to overcome the hurdle  posed by the Pressler Amendment through a process of diplomatic  consultation. The first round of such consultations was held in  Washington by Pakistan and American officials on 26th and 27th  May. These discussions were constructive and will continue.  The president said Pakistan was also assured that the United  States will remain fully engaged in promoting security in South  Asia. Washington, he added, is well aware of the danger of the  missile race, if India continues the development of its missile  program and in particular, if it goes ahead with the deployment  of the short range Prithvi. The president said he pointed out  that the Agni with a range of 2400 km will pose a threat to a  number of countries in our region. President Leghari said the  United States acknowledged that Kashmir remains a threat to  regional and international peace. Pakistan, he added, has  conveyed its willingness to resume talks with India on Kashmir  and other subjects once New Delhi takes some steps to create  propitious conditions for such talks.    Pakistan and the United States also agreed to promote  conventional arms control and more effective confidence-building  measures by India and Pakistan. The president said the most  exciting possibilities for future relations between Pakistan and  the United States lie in areas of investment and business  collaboration. In his meeting, he said there was clear  recognition that Pakistan has now achieved both political and  macroeconomic stability. The coming of age of democracy in  Pakistan accompanied by the steps of the present government in  reducing the budget deficit, in lowering inflation, and in  deepening the economic reforms program has created a most  propitious climate for both domestic and foreign investment in  Pakistan's economy. The president said the IMF, the World Bank,  and IFC [International Finance Corporation] have indicated  clearly that Pakistan's economic environment is appropriate for  investment, particularly in the energy sector. He said, in his  opinion, Pakistan is likely to attract investment of over $2  billion annually in the coming years.    The president said on his way back, he made a stopover in  Paris where he met President Mitterrand. During the course of  the meeting, various steps to promote bilateral relations  between the two countries were discussed.    Replying to a number of questions about the allegations  leveled by the leader of the opposition implicating Mr. Leghari  in the Mehran Bank scandal, the president rejected all the  charges as preposterous and without an iota of truth. His  political life is like an open book and the question of his  involvement in any scandal does not arise at all. I have never  been associated with any of the scandals, he asserted. The  president said he will initiate legal proceedings against all  those who are resorting to a campaign of character assassination  against him. He said the fact of the matter is that he and  other members of his family have sold 531 acres of ancestral  land to six individuals belonging to Karachi. The payment of  this land was made through Mehran Bank. He said those who are  hurling allegations against him may not be aware of the fact.  Mr. Farooq Ahmad Leghari said it cannot be justified to level  baseless charges against the president of Pakistan.    Replying to another question, the president said there is a  consensus on issues like Kashmir, nuclear program, security of  the country and basic economic policies. However, he said, it  is unfortunate that certain elements are out to tell the world  that no consensus exists on these issues.</p>

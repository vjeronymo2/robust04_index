			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Each Series will terminate after a stated period of years, initially expected to be approximately 10 to 15 years. At the termination of a Series, unitholders will have a choice of receiving (1) their pro rata share of the underlying Fund shares in kind and the cash proceeds from the zero coupon obligations, (2) their pro rata share of cash upon the liquidation of the Fund shares and zero coupon obligations or (3) their pro rata share of the underlying Fund shares in kind and investing the amount of cash proceeds from the zero coupon obligations in additional Fund shares without paying a FESL or CDSC, if any. After termination of a Series, unitholders electing the first or last option will become shareholders of the particular Fund and will be subject to their pro rata share of any rule 12b&hyph;1 fees charged by the Fund, as are all other shareholders of the Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Conclusions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 14(a) of the Act requires that investment companies have $100,000 of net worth prior to making a public offering. As the Sponsor intends to sell all of the Trust Series' units to the public, thereby withdrawing certificates representing the entire beneficial ownership of the Trust, applicants request exemptive relief from the net worth requirement of section 14(a). Applicants will comply in all respects with rule 14a&hyph;3, which provides an exemption from section 14(a), except that the Trust will not restrict its portfolio investments to ``eligible trust securities.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Section 19(b) and rule 19b&hyph;1 thereunder make it unlawful for a registered investment company to distribute long-term capital gains more often than once every twelve months. Applicants request an exemption from section 19(b) and rule 19b&hyph;1 to the extent necessary to permit any capital gains resulting from the redemption of Fund shares to be distributed to unitholders along with the Trust's regular quarterly distributions. In all other respects, applicants intend to comply with rule 19b&hyph;1 under the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Section 11(a) makes it unlawful for any registered open-end investment company or principal underwriter for such company to make or cause to be made certain offers of exchange on any basis other than the relative net asset values of the securities to be exchanged, unless the terms of the exchange offer have first been approved by the SEC. Section 11(c) provides that section 11(a) will be applicable to any type of exchange offer involving securities of a registered unit investment trust, irrespective of the basis of exchange. Upon termination of the Trust, unitholders will have the option, which could be viewed as an exchange offer, to receive their pro rata share of the underlying Fund shares in kind and invest the amount of cash proceeds from the zero coupon obligations in additional Fund shares without the imposition of a FESL or CDSC (although rule 12b&hyph;1 fees will be imposed on the Fund shares ultimately held by the unitholder) (the ``Exchange Option''). The ``exchange'' of Series' unit proceeds for Fund shares will be at relative net asset value since the Fund will waive any FESL or CDSC that it might otherwise impose if a unitholder selects the Exchange Option. As such, aside from a rule 12b&hyph;1 fee, if any, that would be imposed on unitholders once they became shareholders of a Fund that imposed such a fee, there will be no economic incentive for a broker to encourage a unitholder to select the Exchange Option at the termination of the Series. Applicants believe that the terms of the Exchange Option are fair and reasonable to the unitholders and consistent with the policy and purpose of section 11. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1 under the Act make it unlawful for any affiliated person or principal underwriter for a registered investment company, and any affiliated person of such persons, acting as principal, to effect any transaction in which such registered company is a joint or a joint and several participant with such person, unless the SEC has granted an order approving of the transaction. Applicants believe that the conditions imposed in any order granted will ensure that the proposed arrangement is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and that neither the Trust nor the Fund will participate in the arrangement on a different or less disadvantageous basis than other participants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Also, the official said, Clinton wanted to keep the trade  dispute with Japan under White House control and settle their  differences through discussion, and not confrontation.    Bowman Cutter, deputy presidential assistant for economic  policy, said that was the message Clinton wanted to give to  Tokyo when he called Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa before the  White House announced Clinton's decision to reinstate Super 301,  a move strongly opposed by Japan.    "The President felt extremely strongly that even though we  were doing something that the Government of Japan would disagree  with, that it was important that he personally called and talked  with the prime minister," cutter said in an interview with KYODO  NEWS SERVICE.    Clinton "wanted the prime minister to understand that there  was domestic pressure here, political pressure, that he had  carried out the executive order rather than simply allow  legislation in Congress to occur," Cutter said.    There have been several legislative moves in Congress since  the trade talks between Washington and Tokyo collapsed February  11.    Trade bills submitted include a tougher version of "Super  301" sponsored by Sen. Max Baucus calling for reinstating the  trade legislation on a permanent basis.    The "Super 301" measure authorized by Clinton requires the  U.S. Government to identify unfair trade practices in 1994 and  1995.    Cutter said Clinton had also give instructions to his aides  in an executive order that "was more discretionary and allowed  more control" by the White House.    The President hoped that Hosokawa and senior officials in  the  Government of Japan would understand and would read the language  of executive order carefully, Cutter said.    Clinton believes that he has established a strong sense of  personal trust with Hosokawa and that in"working together" the  two of them "can keep control of events," Cutter said.    "What he wanted was to be able to solve these (trade)  problems in discussion," Cutter said of Clinton's intentions in  calling and talking directly to the Japanese prime minister.    Cutter acknowledged that there is "a great deal of distrust"  on both sides over trade issues but he did not think there was  any distrust between the two leaders.    Despite the failure of their meeting on February 11 to agree  on a new bilateral trade framework, Cutter said the two leaders  "hit it off extremely well" the next morning when Clinton  invited Hosokawa and his wife, Kayoko, for breakfast at the  White House.</p>

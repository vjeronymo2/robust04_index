			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / World Trade News: France offers oilseeds card FRANCE is prepared to consider separately the oilseed part of the US-EC farm trade accord, a spokesman for Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris. 'We can find a separate arrangement (on oilseeds) from the rest of the accord. That doesn't mean we will simply give in,' he said after a meeting between Mr Balladur and French farm union leaders. But he said the French government remained firmly opposed to the global Blair House farm trade agreement struck in Washington last November. 'We are not giving in on the global farm deal,' he said. Mr Balladur asked farm leaders to see him again on May 7, ahead of a meeting of EC foreign affairs ministers scheduled for May 10. After the meeting French farm leaders said they were reassured by the new government's willingness to tackle farm issues seriously, although there was no mention during the meeting of a veto of the deal. 'I am convinced of the new government's seriousness but I am not capable of judging its decisions,' said Mr Pierre Cormoreche, president of the permanent assembly of agricultural chambers (APCA). Before France's elections at the end of March, the then opposition leader Mr Jacques Chirac declared that he would take a firm line on Gatt even if it meant sparking a crisis in the EC. The US-EC farm deal is seen as one of the keys to a Gatt Uruguay Round agreement. France's former Socialist government had threatened to veto the oilseed deal as well as the global farm trade accord. If accepted by EC states, the accord would limit the EC's oilseed area to 5.13m hectares and cut by 21 per cent the volume of its subsidised farm exports.</p>

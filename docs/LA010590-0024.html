			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROBIN ELSON MURDER ACQUITTAL  </P> <P> The court is to be commended for its wisdom. Robin Elson is to be praised for  the courage she finally found to end the life of Jack Elson.  </P> <P> For her three precious children, let us pray that their tortured lives can  heal. My advice to Robin Elson would be to quickly sell the rights to this  shocking story, in order to raise a great deal of money. Money will allow her  to provide the many years of therapy and care she and these children must now  have.  </P> <P> BRIDGET MARVIN  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 11 (XINHUA) -- South Korea, the United  States and Japan have agreed to work for phased sanctions on the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) over the nuclear  standoff, the Foreign Ministry said.    The agreement was reached at a meeting among South Korean  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, visiting U.S. Under-Secretary of  State for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff and Japanese Foreign  Minister Koji Kakizawa here today.    The three diplomats said that sanctions against Pyongyang  were inevitable now since the opportunity for measurements from  DPRK's 5-megawatt nuclear reactor is damaged, ministry spokesman  Chang Ki-ho said.    Earlier, the DPRK refuted the allegation that the  measurements had become impossible, saying discharging fuel rods  at the reactor was always under IAEA camera screening.    The three sides agreed that close Seoul-Washington-Tokyo  cooperation is necessary in dealing with DPRK's nuclear issue,  the spokesman said.    However, there was no report on any statement by Tarnoff and  Kakizawa themselves after the meeting.    The spokesman quoted Kakizawa as saying that Japan will take  responsible actions "within the limits of the Japanese  Constitution" when the U.N. Security Council decides to act.    Tarnoff and Kakizawa arrived here over the weekend for key  talks with South Korean officials on the nuclear controversy.    Strongly opposing sanctions, DPRK has stated that its  nuclear  program is peaceful. It warned that imposition of sanctions  will be an act of war.</p>

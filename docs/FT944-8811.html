			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Tory quits cash for questions committee A senior Conservative MP is stepping down from the powerful Commons committee investigating the 'cash for questions' affair because of his past links with House of Fraser, the one-time owner of Harrods. Sir Peter Hordern, MP for Horsham, is set to be replaced by Sir Donald Thompson, Tory MP for Calder Valley, a former junior agriculture minister. Sir Peter, who acted as a consultant to House of Fraser for most of the 1980s, said yesterday he had no connection with Mr Mohamed Fayed, the present owner of Harrods, whose allegations about payments to MPs have damaged the government. Sir Donald lists a range of paid adviserships and consultancies in the most recent register of MPs' interests. These include: adviser to the National Federation of Meat Traders, adviser to the British Agrochemicals Association, adviser to the National Caravan Council, and adviser to Catering Equipment Manufacturers and Suppliers. The cash for questions investigation has been thrown into confusion by Mr Tony Benn, the veteran Labour leftwinger. Earlier this month he defied parliamentary rules by publishing details of its private deliberations. Calls for Mr Benn's expulsion from the committee may be discussed when it next meets on November 21. The committee is also to look into The Guardian's use of a fake fax to investigate a stay by Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief Treasury secretary, at the Paris Ritz hotel. Mr Peter Preston, The Guardian's editor, has admitted using the House of Commons logo on a letter sent to the Ritz, in which details of Mr Aitken's bill were requested.</p>

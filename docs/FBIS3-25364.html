ANC Southern Natal Regional Secretary Sbu  Ndebele said Monday was "a sad day for the Zulu-speaking people  of South Africa", because it saw the Zulu monarch taking a  "radical decision" which had not been tested by popular vote.    He said King Zwelithini had singled out IFP President  Mangosuthu Buthelezi as "God's gift to the Zulu people", which  was an "inconceivable position" since royalty was not supposed  to be politically aligned. "The majority of the king's subjects  do not belong to the IFP. The Zulu nation is not a single,  monolithic bloc united in its support for a partisan political  policy," he said.    The ANC was currently drafting its own proposals for the  Natal provincial constitution and the monarchy would "take pride  of place" in that constitution.    The ANC charged that Mr Buthelezi had used the king for  party  political purposes, adding that the ANC would entrench the  king's independence in a provincial constitution "so that his  place doesn't depend on the whim of the governing party and the  king will be enabled to play a unifying role to all the people".    On Monday King Zwelithini told State President F W de Klerk  at a meeting in Durban that acceptance of the Zulu nation, as it  existed in the 1800s, was not negotiable. He said the Zulu  nation was a sovereign one and could not be overruled by the  interim constitution. Mr de Klerk said he did not regard the  king's claims as secession and said the government would  officially respond to them on Thursday.</p>

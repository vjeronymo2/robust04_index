			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Shevardnadze wins over crowds in crisis MR Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader and former Soviet foreign minister, last night appeared to have pulled back from the brink of resignation, which he had announced earlier in the day after parliament refused to grant him sweeping powers to tackle ethnic conflicts. At an emotional public meeting in the centre of the capital Tbilisi, where huge crowds chanted his name and Georgia's Orthodox Christian leader pleaded with him to stay on, Mr Shevardnadze set two conditions for continuing as head of the former Soviet republic. He first demanded that parliament should convene today and declare emergency measures and then stated that if he were to remain as head of state parliament would have to go into recess for three months. Deputies immediately met Mr Shevardnadze's first condition by unanimously approving a state of emergency throughout the country for two months from September 20. They were due to meet again today to consider his second demand, aimed at freeing his hand to take tough crisis measures without interference from the hostile legislature. The drama of the public meeting appeared to confirm the view of Georgian political commentators that Mr Shevardnadze's earlier walk-out was a shock tactic to bring parliament to its senses. With the crowds in Tbilisi refusing to disperse until they had word of the president's future, the head of the Orthodox church in Georgia, Ilya II, took the podium and gave Mr Shevardnadze his blessing to continue as leader. 'Shevardnadze remains at his post of head of state,' the churchman told the crowd. Although Mr Shevardnadze did not confirm his words, it appeared unlikely the Georgian leader could resign after such a strong endorsement. The episode brought back memories of Mr Shevardnadze's dramatic exit from the Soviet political stage in December 1990, when he caused consternation by resigning as Soviet foreign minister and issuing dire warnings of an impending coup. His recent problems in Georgia have included attempts by Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the former nationalist president, to fight his way back to power with military force, separatism in Abkhazia and a collapsing economy. Unlike the present leader of neighbouring Azerbaijan, Mr Geidar Aliyev, another former communist who returned to power by overthrowing an inexperienced nationalist, Mr Shevardnadze prides himself on being a genuine convert to democracy. 'When they slander me by saying I want to work with communist methods and by the laws of the communist regime, I will not bear it,' he said yesterday.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Clinton may hit at China state business The US is considering targeting trade sanctions at Chinese state-owned businesses if China does not move far enough to meet US human rights concerns, a senior State Department official said yesterday. Mr Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state for Asia, said the US could leave private enterprises untouched and withdraw Most Favoured Nation trading privileges only from state-owned businesses if China did not make enough progress by the June 3 deadline to justify an across-the-board renewal of its MFN status. Mr Lord said China had made progress in some areas, but would need to do more. 'It is still possible to reach a credible outcome between now and June 3,' he said. A partial withdrawal of MFN could pose 'definitional problems'. But that solution could reduce the damage trade sanctions might cause to US businesses involved in trade with China, as well as to Hong Kong and Taiwan. Mr Lord acknowledged the US had not spoken with one voice over China: 'Mixed signals had been coming out of Washington. I don't think they've stopped.' This, he suggested, happened partly because the end of the cold war had removed the overriding importance given to security issues in assessing foreign policy priorities. In the past, top national security officials would tell the Commerce Department or the Treasury 'to get lost' when they raised concerns about a trade or investment dispute. 'You know, don't bother us with these secondary issues. We're in a global struggle with the Soviet Union and we can't jeopardise our alliance with Japan over some silly trade dispute. Well, those days are over and they should be over,' Mr Lord said. In the short term, this absence of a clear hierarchy of priorities often led to difficult trade-offs.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Amharic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Meles Zenawi on the occasion of the </F> 98th anniversary of victory in the Battle of Adwa; place and  date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The main objective of the  transitional period is to draft and approve the country's  constitution with the full participation of the people and,  based on this, to hand over power to a constitutionally elected  government. The government is committed to this objective.  Because of the government's efforts to ensure that the people  take part in drafting the future constitution, more than 16  million people have debated the draft constitution. [passage  omitted]    I want to confirm that the transitional government will take  all the necessary steps to ensure that the transitional period  is democratic and successful and that it will create a conducive  atmosphere for parties to participate in the constitutional  congress. Although it is clear that the government's and  peace-loving people's desire and efforts are to make sure that  the constitutional process is a success, there are people who  are still opposed to it. These people, who are living abroad  and within the country, are struggling to halt or change the  direction of the transitional path. There is a basic issue  which we want to confirm to these people once and for all. The  programs and structures set up to end the transitional period  victoriously will not be changed under any circumstances.    The transitional period will end in accordance with the time  and direction determined. The struggle to change this is  nothing but a daydream, so I call on these dreamers to change  their ideas and to declare publicly that they want to pursue  their objectives in a peaceful way, and participate in the May  elections and other programs of the transitional period. The  democratic path embarked on in our country does not seek to  isolate others. The legal and democratic participation of all  will rather strengthen the transitional process. [passage  omitted]    It must be clear that although the government is ready to  help dreamers if they publicly declare their readiness to pursue  their objectives peacefully and to participate in the elections,  it will not accept any kind of attempt to halt the transition  programs or structures, whether directly or indirectly.    Concerning the economy, it is no secret for the Ethiopian  people that our economy has problems because of mismanagement by  the previous regime and civil war. However, because of the  steps taken by the transitional government and the people's  efforts, the economic situation has improved in the past two  years.    It may be recalled that last year alone the economy grew by  7.6 percent. This progress was achieved because of the progress  made in the agricultural and other economic sectors, especially  the increase in production in the industrial sector. The  various economic policies of the government also played a major  role in development. This year, although the government had  planned that the economy would grow by 5.6 percent, according to  the prevailing situation the expected growth will not exceed 3.5  percent. The main reason for this is because of the prevailing  drought which has seriously affected agricultural production.  [passage omitted]    As a result of the government's efforts it has been possible  to limit the displacement and death of our people. However, it  is very difficult to contain the situation by the efforts of the  government and the people alone. It requires the assistance of  the donor (?agencies). In this regard, on behalf of the victims  and the Ethiopian people in general, I would like to extend my  appreciation to the donor countries and agencies for the  assistance they have rendered so far, however, the extent of the  assistance and the (?means) of delivery are not helping us to  contain the situation. We call on the donor countries to extend  their assistance, bearing in mind the dangerous consequences at  stake.    The other issue which should be raised in connection with  our  economic activities is the ongoing restructuring process in the  civil service. It may be recalled that after the formation of  regional administrations, these regional administrations had  problems regarding expertise. As a result of this, and the huge  number of civil servants in the (?cities), it was necessary to  carry out a restructuring in the central government's offices.  [passage omitted]    The objective of the restructuring process is not to suspend  employees, but to transfer employees from the central  government's offices to regional administrations. However, some  people are being dismissed because they refused to work in  regional administrative offices. So conscientious employees  should not fear that they will be affected by the restructuring  process.    Dear Ethiopians, the remaining tasks for the fulfillment of  the transitional process are no greater than those we have  achieved so far. We have managed to overcome the difficult ones  in a proper and positive way. The major remaining task is the  adoption of the draft constitution which will enable us to form  a people's government. So far, the process is going smoothly  and I am sure that it will be concluded successfully. The  transitional government is, more than ever before, on the side  of the people concerning the above key issue, and concerning the  improvement of the economy and combating the problem of drought  and, in general, maintaining the prevailing peace and further  strengthening the democratic system. Thank you.</p>

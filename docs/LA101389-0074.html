			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> GEORGIA;  </P> <P> COURT RULING CAUSES CONCERN OVER BUSING  </P> <P> Blacks and whites flooded the offices of Georgia's largest school system with  panic calls in response to a federal appeals court ruling that may require  forced busing. "There has certainly been a number of calls expressing grave  concern both from the black and white communities," said Andy Olsen, a  spokesman for the De Kalb County school system. The U.S. 11th Circuit Court of  Appeals Wednesday ordered the school system to consider redrawing district  lines and busing to achieve more desegregation. Olsen said administrators were  meeting with school system attorneys to go over the order.  </P></p>

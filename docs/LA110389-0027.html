			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEFORE GOING TO SUMMIT, APPLY A BIT OF PRUDENCE;  </P> <P> SUMMIT: THE WEST URGENTLY NEEDS A VISION OF A NEW EUROPE. THE RISK IS CREATING  ONE WITHOUT AN ALLIED BLUEPRINT.  </P> <P> The forthcoming "saltwater summit" between George Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev  is being billed as unremarkable -- but that gives it importance.  </P> <P> When the American and Soviet presidents can begin to meet routinely, the Cold  War is surely being consigned to the ash heap of history. Yet this friendly  get-together also has risks. And it dramatizes the urgent need for the West to  create a vision of Europe's future and to set goals for achieving it.  </P> <P> At first glance, everyone benefits. Gorbachev gains added legitimacy for  reforming his domestic economy and lowering global tensions. He also gains  another symbol of equality with the U.S. President, which provides political  value home at a time when economic reform is faltering.  </P> <P> Just by showing up, Bush confounds domestic critics who charge him with being  timid. He also tells European allies that he is in the East-West game and he  builds a case against being faulted for "losing" Gorbachev if the Soviet leader  is either deposed or forced to retrench. Most important, the world benefits  from the steady transformation of U.S.-Soviet relations from episodic  confrontation to a halting but significant search for common ground.  </P> <P> But the very fact that Bush foresees an agenda-free meeting points to an area  of possible misunderstanding. In his announcement, he stressed "the rapidity of  change in Eastern Europe." Indeed, given what has been happening, the summit  will no doubt be widely judged on the basis of what the two leaders either say,  or refrain from saying, about the extraordinary unraveling of the Soviet  empire.  </P> <P> In Western Europe, the allies should not complain. After all, the American  President is responding to their plea to seize the initiative, and they have  not developed their own design for a new structure of European security and  East-West political relations. Yet complaints there will surely be if conduct  at the summit gives even a hint of U.S.-Soviet coordination on East European  matters. In particular, the West German government has been stung by U.S. media  criticism that it has been overly zealous in its dealings with the East and  that it cannot be trusted with the explosive subject of reunification. A  Bush-Gorbachev meeting that centers on East European issues will clearly  stiffen West German resistance to any cavilling about its own behavior.  </P> <P> There would be little concern, however, if the casual approach to the summit  did not highlight the continued lack of a context for judging what the West  must do to respond constructively to change, rather than simply watching in  wonder. It does not imply failure to acknowledge that there is no clear  blueprint for the future: Too many imponderables must be dealt with before it  is clear what new institutions and practices are needed for a new all-European  security system.  </P> <P> Bush is, of course, no Ronald Reagan. He is unlikely to engage in the sort of  freewheeling discussions that stunned the allies following the December, 1986,  Reykjavik summit. Nor does this meeting in the Mediterranean have the makings  of another Yalta, whereby the superpowers alone decide the fate of the  Continent. Yet if only for the sake of prudence, Bush would be wise to make a  quick round of allied capitals -- London, Paris and Bonn -- before going to sea  with Gorbachev.  </P> <P> More important, the American President must finally come to grips with what he  styles "the vision thing." In process, that means expanding the Atlantic  alliance's mandate, persuading the European Community to talk with the United  States about political issues affecting Europe's future, and proposing an  all-European forum to vet ideas about common security. In substance, it means  presenting criteria for a new security system: What must happen in East  European states, the nature of Soviet security interests, the long-term role  the United States should play as a "European power" and how current  arms-control efforts could, in time, transform NATO and the Warsaw Pact from  military alliances to political instruments for change backed by residual  military guarantees.  </P> <P> Both to spur the process and to give it focus, Bush should go further and gain  allied agreement on a timetable for transforming the two military blocs. Given  the pace of events and evolution in attitudes, the year 2000 would be an  appropriate deadline. By then, the truth will be known about the Gorbachev  revolution. If it continues, much will be possible; if it does not, at least  Bush will have set a standard for Western actions. Either a new world will be  emerge, or the alliance will have a solid political basis for preserving the  one we have.  </P></p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Greek interest rates fall as pressures ease Greek interbank interest rates fell sharply yesterday as financial markets stabilised after almost three weeks of turbulence. The overnight borrowing rate dropped to 35 per cent, while the three-month interbank rate came down to 40 per cent. Dealers said a squeeze on liquidity in the banking system, which kept short-term interest rates at over 100 per cent last week, had eased. The government succeeded in raising Dr450bn (Pounds 1.2bn) needed this month to finance the public debt through sales of treasury bills at interest of up to 27 per cent and Ecu- and US dollar-linked bonds. But interest rates on government bonds are expected to remain at record levels as next month's borrowing requirement will also be higher than usual. The drachma declined yesterday against the D-Mark, closing at Dr149.45, down from Dr149.15 on Wednesday. Mr Yannos Papantoniou, economy minister, said the currency was no longer threatened with devaluation. Economists said it would depreciate at a faster rate against other EU currencies over the next few weeks.</p>

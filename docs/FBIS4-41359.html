			<p>BFN     [Text] Sumy [no date as received] -- An unprecedented  incident has taken place here: five days before the elections  Vasyl Spivak, head of the district electoral committee for the  election of chairmen and deputies to the oblast council,  informed Viktor Kazban, chairman of the oblast's "Prosvita"  organization, that he is cancelling a decision by the  [electoral] commission to register 30 candidates from this  organization as deputies to the oblast council.    The formal reason for this is a letter from Konotop in which  the author, indignant that "Prosvita" is supporting a Jew by  nationality as a candidate in the elections to the oblast  council, demanded that the district commission check the  accuracy of the nomination of all the candidates in general.  Having demanding all the documents in general from "Prosvita",  not only those concerning the nomination of candidates but those  dating back to the time when the organization was founded, Vasyl  Spivak found some violations, in particular that some adopted  changes had not been written in the organization's statute. On  this basis, he issued an instruction to the polling station  commissions to delete the "Prosvita" candidates from the ballot  forms.    The oblast "Prosvita" organization and all national  democratic parties sent letters of protest to the oblast  procuracy and demanded that Vasyl Spivak annul the illegal  instruction. The statement from the national democratic forces  in Sumy oblast reads that if he refuses, they will reserve the  right to turn for help to all national democratic forces in  Ukraine as well as to resort to actions of civil disobedience.

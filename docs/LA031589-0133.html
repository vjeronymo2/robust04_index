			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> ALEX TREBEK TO HOST GEOGRAPHY BEE  </P> <P> Alex Trebek, the television game show host of "Jeopardy!" fame, will serve as  host and moderator for the first National Geography Bee, the National  Geographic Society announced today.  </P> <P> Fifty-six students, representing all 50 states as well as the District of  Columbia and several territories, will compete in the nation's capital May 19  for the top prize of a $25,000 college scholarship.  </P> <P> The society, reacting to a recent study of international geographic knowledge  in which American children ranked at the bottom, initiated the event -- similar  to a spelling bee -- on a local level in January.  </P> <P> Trebek said geography is a popular category on "Jeopardy!" because "we believe  knowledge of today's world is essential. I'm extremely distressed that many  young people in America know so little about this subject. I hope the geography  bee will help change that."  </P></p>

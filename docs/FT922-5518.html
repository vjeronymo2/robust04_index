			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities end week with strong gains UK SHARE prices were in fine form as the long three-week trading account drew to a close, with another record breaking performance by Wall Street the driving force behind the London market. The FT-SE 100 share index ended comfortably above the 2,700 level, closing a net 13.4 higher at 2,707.6. The buoyant showing by Wall Street, said to have reflected expectations that the Federal Reserve may consider easing its monetary stance, countered a series of setbacks for London over the week. These included exceptionally poor trade figures for April, showing the UK's worst deficit since 1990. Among other bearish developments were disappointing company statements and news that receivers had been called into Mountleigh, one of the Britain's biggest property groups. The week's most devastating news was that Canary Wharf is being put into administration. Much of the early trading in was dominated by technical factors, notably the expiry of the the May FT-SE option. The Footsie future also played a big part during initial trading when the future moved to a good premium to fair value. The Footsie opened strongly, up almost 10 points, on the back of buying stimulated by Wall Street's record close overnight and a firm performance by Tokyo. However, early buying quickly ran out of steam and the index dipped off as index arbitrageurs moved in to sell the underlying stocks. Thereafter selective buying interest took the Footsie progressively higher with the firm opening of Wall Street the trigger for a late flourish of support for UK equities. One of the features of trading was the continued switching out of cyclical stocks, such as building materials and engineering, into the safer more defensive areas of the market, such as the pharmaceuticals and utilities sectors. The retailing sector was viewed by many as possibly running ahead of the growth in consumer spending. Cadbury-Schweppes and Allied Lyons were busy as the market began to focus on news that the proposed buy-back of stock by Philip Morris, the US tobacco group, sharply reduced the chances of it bidding for either company. The best performance among the Footsie constituents came from Arjo Wiggins, said to have been oversold in recent weeks, while Pilkington took the wooden spoon as the worst performer, followed by Blue Circle. Customer, or retail business, picked up after a poor start to the week, stimulated by a large programme trade and a share placing.</p>

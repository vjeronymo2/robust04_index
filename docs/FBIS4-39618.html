			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Boris Krivoshey] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 9 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Russia is taking steps  aimed at unblocking the situation around the DPRK by political  methods. This was stated at a briefing today by Grigoriy  Karasin, director of the department of information and press of  the Russian federation Foreign Ministry in connection with the  recent deterioration of the DPRK's nuclear problem.    "This approach," he noted, "envisions the need for Pyongyang  to ensure the IAEA has access to the relevant facilities and  information by the agreed deadlines and the convening of an  International conference for a comprehensive examination of the  problems of security on the Korean peninsula. If these  diplomatic efforts are not successful the sanctions proposal  will have to be examined."    Replying to a question regarding relations and economic  cooperation between Russia and North Korea, Grigoriy Karasin  said that "relations with the DPRK are developing in a normal  way, cooperation is continuing, including on the question of the  work of the lumberjacks on Russian territory." During the talks  which were held between representatives of the Russian and DPRK  Foreign Ministries it proved possible to settle a number of  questions, he added.</p>

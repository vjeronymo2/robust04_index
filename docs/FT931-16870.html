			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Fjord escorts through to fiestas  -Travelling through Europe Jimmy Burns encounters the idiosyncrasies of cross-border shopping THESE days the vikings invade Newcastle not to loot and pillage but to drink and shop. More than 100,000 Norwegians, Danes, and Swedes brave the North Sea crossing every year. After an overnight stay at the local County Hotel, John Martinsen, a catering manager from Stavanger, his wife Wenche, and a friend carry out an early morning raid on a costume jewellery store and a women's lingerie shop. They buy a pair of imitation crystal rings at Pounds 6.50 each, and several pairs of pink satin bras and panties. The Martinsen group plans to spend at least Pounds 1,800, including drink, during the three-day stay in north-east England. They believe everything is a bargain - at least half the price they would pay in Norway. PORN BROKER Sunday trading has a special meaning for Heiga Holmsteen. While the majority of retailers in Copenhagen take the day off, Mr Holmsteen is open for business as usual from an early hour. His clientele includes Danes, but is mostly Japanese, English and German. Visiting Swedes, even on a Sunday, concentrate on drinking. Mr Holmsteen works as an accountant for a leading Danish company three days a week. But for the remaining four his Dana-Expo does a brisk trade in hardcore pornography of a kind that is not freely available elsewhere in Europe. 'My clients take things away in suitcases or else I send selective items by mail order,' says Mr Holmsteen. The magazines he sells are mainly produced in Denmark where VAT is high. But he keeps his costs down by exporting the magazines to Germany and then re-importing them - after having paid a lower German duty. DRUG STORE COWBOY Soft drugs in Amsterdam have relatively the same status as beer. In cafes and coffee houses they are listed on menus and can be consumed on the premises as long as customers do not buy above a certain limit. As borders come down, therefore, police forces will need to be on the ball. Driving from Germany into Holland the frontier post is empty. When a clerk in a bank nearby is asked 'Where's the border?' she replies: 'It's 1993 already. Don't you realise we are all in Europe now. Perhaps in England you feel differently.' Well, maybe the Germans feel differently too. Returning across the same border from Amsterdam, and crossing the same frontier post from Holland into Germany, the German border guard barks: 'You come from Amsterdam, you smoke hash, you bring shit no?' He then orders a complete search of the hired Volkswagen Golf GTI. FILL 'ER UP In a petrol station on the French A-7 autoroute a Spanish long-distance lorry driver fills up on fuel and then asks for four receipts. Who's counting? DOUBLE TROUBLE Robert Blasco, the owner and cook of a fine restaurant in the spectacular fortress town of Carcassone in southern France, is pinning his hopes on a Europe sans frontieres and modern police computers. Robert has often been detained at the Franco-Spanish border because he shares the same age, name and surname as one of the most wanted Basque terrorists. 'All they had to do was check on my stomach. It was full of good food, much fatter than my alleged double,' he says. SNOOZE AND BOOZE Across the border in Spain he has a great chance of getting a good drink too. Latest statistics show the land of the siesta and fiesta boasts 133,000 tapas bars, giving it more watering holes per capita than any other country in Europe.</p>

While early reports said that it might be cholera, it now  appears that it may in fact be food poisoning contracted from  eating fish that had washed ashore during the floods and had  affected this area.    The director-in-chief, Dr Eileen Thakur, who had a  telephonic  conversation with the civil surgeon of Motihari this afternoon,  told TOINS that people of these villages had fallen ill after  consuming the small dead fish. Dr Thakur said the seven persons  of Khairi Ajgarwa had, in fact, died of food poisoning and not  of cholera. She said in Khairi Ajgarwa alone 500 people had  fallen ill complaining of diarrhea and vomiting.    The civil surgeon of Motihari has informed the government  that a medical team has been camping at Khairi Ajgarwa village  to ascertain whether the disease which had been raging in these  villages was cholera vibrio non zero or not.    The director-in-chief, Dr Thakur today directed the civil  surgeon to send a detailed report about the disease within two  days.</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: Aerolneas Argentinas sale enters final phase THE privatisation of Aerolneas Argentinas, the Argentine national airline, entered its final phase yesterday, six months after the government and an international consortium exchanged contracts. The consortium, led by Spain's Iberia, delivered Dollars 810m-worth of foreign debt certificates to the government as part of an agreement reached between the two sides in April. The privatisation stalled earlier this year after the government and consortium members squabbled over the terms of the contract. The buyers refused to pay, while the government refused to deliver the 85 per cent of Aerolineas shares on sale. Under the new agreement, the consortium agreed to deliver Dollars 1.61bn in foreign debt paper in two tranches. It has also provided satisfactory guarantees from international banks underpinning its Dollars 540m investment plan in Aerolneas, as required by the original contract. Earlier, the buyers paid Dollars 142m in government dollar-denominated bonds worth 68 per cent of face value on the local market, replacing Dollars 130m in deferred payments due under the original contract.</p>

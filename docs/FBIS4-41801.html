			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 27 Jun -- "The conclusions by some political  analysts and journalists that the `left-wing' forces were  victorious is an exaggeration," Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil  stated at a news conference. "In the presidential elections the  communists suffered a crushing defeat. According to preliminary  results, Oleksandr Moroz received up to 10 percent of the vote,"  Vyacheslav Chornovil stressed at the news conference.    Vyacheslav Chornovil noted the vigorous activity of voters  in  western regions. In his words, less activity was observed in  eastern and south-eastern oblasts.    In his assessment of the elections of local council  chairmen,  V. Chornovil, in particular, said: "In a whole number of oblasts  voters favored representatives of Rukh and only in Chernigov,  Dnepropetrovsk, and in several other oblasts will the posts of  oblast council leaders be taken up by communists and  representatives of `left-wing' forces. However, in the majority  of oblasts the leaders of oblast councils are centrist-oriented."    The Rukh leader said that in Kiev Volodymyr Chernyak got  through to the second round and was slightly behind the present  town council leader, Leonid Kosakivskyy. Volodymyr Chernyak,  who was present at the news conference, noted in particular that  "the passivity of Kiev residents could have been due to their  indifference to the city's fate. I testify that the elections  of 1994 are less democratic than the elections of 1989-90."</p>

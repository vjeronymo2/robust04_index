			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Leading Article: National Savings FRIDAY'S decision by Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the UK's sixth largest building society, to raise its mortgage interest rate from 10 3/4 to 10.99 per cent was a shock. But this modest increase was not really so surprising. Nor can it be blamed simply on mistaken policies towards National Savings. While the Treasury may have made a tactical error, it is its strategic problems - the fiscal deficit and the rates of interest set by Germany - that matter most. The official forecast for the public sector borrowing requirement this financial year is Pounds 28bn. With little, if any, economic growth in prospect this year, the PSBR is likely to be larger, perhaps as much as Pounds 35bn, or 5-6 per cent of gross domestic product. To put this sum in context, the Treasury expects to collect only Pounds 40bn from value added tax in 1992-93. How can the government avoid crowding out other borrowers, when its own needs are so large? It cannot. It can only choose whom it crowds out and how. The government can, and should, underfund the PSBR. In other words, it should finance as much as possible by selling bills to banks rather than gilts to the public. This policy would have three merits, apart from disposing of the arbitrary full-funding rule: first, it would expand broad money, which has been growing too slowly; second, it would tend to raise short-term rates of interest, so strengthening sterling, relative to long-term rates of interest, so facilitating corporate borrowing; and third, it would reduce the amount of long-term borrowing at nominal rates of over 9 per cent. A government that believes inflation will soon be 2 per cent should either borrow short term or via index-linked securities. Yet by raising short-term rates of interest, underfunding would exacerbate the consequences for mortgage interest of the Treasury's desire to fund part of its deficit via direct sales to the public. From the point of view of the building societies, the government is succeeding too well. In the first quarter of this financial year, National Savings raised Pounds 1.5bn, as against Pounds 3.1bn in the whole of last year. Last month's net outflows from the building societies, at Pounds 315m, were the second biggest ever. The launch of First Option, a one year investment at a gross interest rate of 10.34 per cent, is making things worse. This rate of interest is higher than that offered by most building societies, but it is not out of line with the markets. Nor would borrowing equivalent sums in the wholesale market preclude pressure on the building societies via the interest that could then be offered by banks. Not using National Savings so aggressively would certainly be more tactful. But an upward drift in mortgage rates relative to money market rates, was probably inevitable, in any case. A mortgage interest rate of 10 3/4 per cent only makes sense if the risk is impeccable. But mortgages are no longer impeccable risks. With the government an aggressive competitor of the home-purchaser as well and sterling's credibility now in doubt, mortgage interest rates are bound to be under pressure. Underfunding, though desirable, would make this pressure still greater. The government should minimise the extent to which it is identified as a direct competitor of the house buyer. But there is not much it can do about the fact that it is.</p>

In an interview for the left-leaning Czech daily, Weiss is  referring to former Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar who, along  with the rest of his government, had to quit after the  parliament voted no confidence on him last Friday.    Asked what led the SDL, then the strongest opposition party,  to push for the removal of Meciar, Weiss stresses that it was  not due to any personal controversy between Meciar and himself.  "What happened in the parliament on Friday [11 March] was purely  a rejection of his manner of rule, his way of exerting power  based on the creation of the idea of an enemy, on the feeling of  the exclusivity of a single movement (the Meciar-led Movement  for a Democratic Slovakia, HZDS), and on his unwillingness to  cooperate with other political subjects soberly, seriously and  on principles of partnership. These are the methods perfectly  mastered by Meciar, who used them to create conditions for  strengthening HZDS's power in the state administration and  economy. In implementing these methods, Meciar also  considerably damaged Slovakia's good image abroad," Weiss  emphasizes.    He says the main priority of the SDL is early elections. He  dismisses speculation that through removing Meciar, the  opposition ensured more votes for him in the planned elections.  The present situation in Slovakia differs from that of three  years ago, when Meciar was dismissed as premier and then gained  38 per cent in the June 1992 elections, Weiss states. "People  now have certain experience from the two-year HZDS rule,  including great dissatisfaction over its economic policy," he  explains.    Weiss confirms that the SDL is for maintenance of a  "reasonable continuity" between the outgoing and new cabinets,  mainly in key spheres such as the ministries of defense,  interior, foreign affairs, justice, economy and finance. "The  continuity can also be preserved by -- let us say -- by  appointing present state secretaries, who well know the  situation in the sphere controlled by relevant ministries, as  ministers...so that they do not have to start from scratch in  acquainting themselves with the work of the ministry," Weiss  says.    He notes that Roman Kovac, the former deputy premier  expelled  from the HZDS in February as the co-founder of the HZDS faction  the Alternative of Political Realism, was considered by the  opposition as the future Slovak premier a month ago "under  certain circumstances. However, these circumstances have  changed. It is necessary to continue negotiations," Weiss  states. He says that the SDL is ready to present its own  candidate for the presidential post "if developments necessitate  it".    Weiss also comments on Meciar's efforts to re-gain a  majority  in the 150-seat parliament. He points out that the referendum  on early elections and the removal from the parliament of the  deputies who quit their parties, "lacks logic: if the  referendum sets June as the date of early elections (as  requested by Meciar) and also agrees with stripping the  defectors of their deputy mandates, the early elections will  take place and there will be no need to expel anybody from the  parliament. However, [Meciar's] political game would probably  aim at persuading citizens that it is only necessary to oust the  disobedient deputies from the parliament, without calling early  elections," Weiss says. He adds that if Meciar succeeds, he  will re-gain a majority in the parliament and "probably also  solve the conflict between himself and President (Michal  Kovac)". Moreover, the SDL finds the retroactive effect of the  Meciar- considered provision that the deputies who quit their  parties have to leave the parliament incompatible with the law.    The economic experts of the opposition agreed that  immediately after its inauguration, the new government would  push for the amendment of the law on the state budget for 1994.  Another goal of the opposition is "depolitisation of the  privatization process and its oversight. However, not by a  single movement as it has been practiced so far," Weiss says in  RUDE PRAVO.</p>

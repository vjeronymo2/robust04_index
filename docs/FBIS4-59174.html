			<p>BFN     [Text] Iraqi mujahidin sources in southern Iraq said that  90 percent of the marshlands in the south have been dried up and  that these areas have no water in them except for some parts of  the marshlands of al-Basrah and al-'Amarah. In an attempt to  describe the bad conditions the marshland dwellers are living  in, the sources said that drying up the marshlands has pushed  most of the people there to migrate to other areas. The  terrorist regime in Baghdad has also transferred some of the  marshland dwellers to unknown districts.    In another report, an Iraqi mujahid said that the surprise  attack the mujahidin forces carried out recently on the  headquarters of the 10th Battalion in the north al-Qurnah led to  the elimination of two platoons and the killing of the commander  of the battalion. In these operations, the mujahidin seized a  number of mortars, some communications equipment, and some  military documents.</p>

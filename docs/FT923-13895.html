			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Japan to fight on in dumping row with EC - Cassette dispute set for Gatt panel JAPAN is expected to ask a Gatt disputes panel to rule on its complaint that the European Community has unfairly imposed anti-dumping duties on Japanese audio cassette tapes, after an unsuccessful attempt at conciliation by Gatt's anti-dumping committee yesterday. Dumping is the sale of goods at less than the price charged in the home market, or less than the cost of production. Under Gatt's anti-dumping rules Japan must wait until next October, three months after the conciliation failure, to request a panel. If it does so, it will be only the second time Japan has taken a trade dispute to Gatt since it joined the world trade body in 1955. In 1990 Japan secured a panel ruling against EC anti-dumping duties on mainly electronic goods assembled in the Community by Japanese 'screwdriver' assembly plants. The present case involves duties of between 15 and 25 per cent on audio tapes imposed by the EC last May. Japan claims that the duties are excessive and that the EC broke Gatt anti-dumping rules by failing to prove that its tapes were hurting the domestic industry. Although EC imports of audio cassette tapes from Japan rose slightly between 1986 and 1988, their share of the EC market fell from 41 to 35 per cent, according to Tokyo. The European Commission found 'injury' to home producers in only one member state but the duties were being applied Community-wide. Japan also argues that its cassettes are in a higher price bracket and so do not compete directly with cheaper EC tapes. Brussels maintains that the Japanese complaint is a back-door attempt to re-open the wrangle over anti-dumping rules in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, ostensibly closed by publication of a draft accord last December. The EC says the four Japanese companies involved dominate a closed domestic market and use profits from high prices at home to subsidise exports and establish plants abroad. It claims the market share of EC producers in the Community has fallen to 15 per cent because of dumping, while Japan's imports of cassettes were 0.05 per cent of consumption last year. Separately, yesterday's meeting of Gatt's anti-dumping committee agreed to a US request for a disputes panel on anti-dumping duties imposed by Canada on imports of US beer. This is the third Gatt panel on beer involving the two countries. Earlier panels have ruled against Canadian restrictions on imported beer and against US rules that discriminate against beer imports.</p>

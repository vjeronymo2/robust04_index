			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of "Address of the Supreme Council of Ukraine 12th </F> convocation to the newly-elected deputies and citizens of  Ukraine" adopted at the parliament's final session in Kiev on 22  April; read by Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch]    [Text] Esteemed colleagues and countrymen! The present  Supreme Council of Ukraine is resigning. Fate has allowed us to  play a truly historic role in consolidating Ukrainian statehood.  We lived through a moment of unity when adopting the  declaration of Ukraine's state sovereignty and the act of its  independence. In the past four years we have laid a legislative  foundation for the development of a democratic, law-governed  state. Today, we have all of its integral features. Ukraine  has been recognized by 145 states. It has been accepted as a  rightful member of the European and world community.    The Supreme Council of Ukraine 12th convocation, with all  its  shortcomings, was a stabilizing factor in society and helped  prevent interethnic discord. The laws it passed on the issues  of nationality, interethnic relations, and protection of the  rights of ethnic minorities received high appraisal from the  world community. Calling on the newly elected deputies to  preserve the positive heritage of the present Supreme Council,  we would like to warn them against the miscalculations and  mistakes we made. We failed to ensure a proper attitude to the  Constitution and the laws in the society, as well as  coordination between the branches of power, the center, and the  regions. The practice of transferring legislative functions to  executive structures proved unjustified.    The effective work of Ukraine's Supreme Council was often  hindered by political confrontation. We call on the new members  of parliament, political parties and movements, and their  leaders to refrain from settling scores in the Supreme Council,  and especially from involving their supporters in doing so.  Such actions usually lead to destructive consequences for  society as a whole.    We appeal to the deputies who are replacing us to  (?preserve)  Ukraine's statehood, its independence and territorial integrity,  and the inviolability of our borders. Whatever political  movements or religious denominations we are part of, whatever  our ethnic background, we are all citizens of Ukraine, and there  is only one Ukraine for all of us.    Adopting the new Constitution of Ukraine as soon as possible  would assist in solving these problems. The most important  thing today is to speed up the overcoming of the economic  crisis, to stabilize and develop the national economy, and to  strengthen its social orientation. This can be achieved on the  road of economic reform by ensuring the equality of all forms of  ownership and economic management. The financial, monetary, and  credit policy and taxation require serious and essential  changes. A further improved legal foundation is needed for an  effective campaign against crime, first of all, organized crime  and corruption, to strengthen law enforcement and ensure  reliable protection of citizens' constitutional rights and  freedoms.    We hope that the Supreme Council of Ukraine of the new  convocation will continue to work on strengthening Ukraine's  authority as a large European nation, its economic integration  with the countries of the CIS and other states of the world. We  call on the people's deputies and all citizens to join efforts  in the development of Ukraine, to do their best to preserve  peace and concord in society. This is the only way we can  survive the difficulties and improve people's lives. We have  faith in your power and wisdom. We wish you honest and  constructive work for the good of the Ukrainian people.    [signed] The Supreme Council of Ukraine, 12th convocation,  Kiev, 22 April 1994.</p>

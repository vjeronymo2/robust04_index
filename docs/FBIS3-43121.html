			<p>This     Foreign Media Note summarizes recent political events as  reported by Sudanese expatriate oppositionists in the 12 December  1993 AL-ASHIQQA' (Brothers), a weekly page devoted to developments  in Sudan that appears in Egypt's liberal opposition daily newspaper  AL-WAFD.      Extremist Groups Hold Secret Meeting in Khartoum      Unnamed extremist organizations reportedly held a secret  conference in the northern Khartoum suburb of Kafuri while the  Popular Arab and Islamic Conference was in session at Khartoum's  Friendship Hall on 2-4 December.  According to AL-ASHIQQA' sources,  attendees decided:      To "support the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in Algeria as well  as the FIS's recent decisions to escalate terrorist activities  against foreigners in Algeria."      "To totally support" Shaykh Rached al-Ghannouchi, leader of the  Tunisian Islamic Movement.      "To coordinate activity with Arab Maghreb organizations."      "To prepare for the 'Islamic alternative' which will remove the  ruling regime in Libya."      "To support General Muhammad Farah 'Aidid in Somalia in  overturning the Somali Reconciliation Accord held in Addis Ababa."      "To support the holy struggle (al-jihad) in Eritrea and the Oromo  Liberation Front."      Sudanese attendees offered to support the conference resolutions  "with weapons" and asked Iran "to increase and continue its  petroleum aid."      Some of the "traditional leadership" was said to have "arrived  secretly and unannounced to participate only in the secret  conference and not in the meetings at Friendship Hall" and that "for  secrecy's sake their passport series were replaced at the airport  with the series belonging to the National Islamic Front (NIF) so  that news of the arrival of some of the names, whose passports have  not been stamped for entry, would not leak out."      DUP Leader on Civil Unrest, Secession of the South      Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Secretary Muhammad 'Uthman  'Abdallah, describing a recent strike by merchants in the city of  Wad al-Madani, said that "for the first time in the history of  Sudan, businessmen and vendors are opposing and rebelling against  government authority.  This degree of confrontation, in our  estimation, was inevitable and encompasses every sector of Sudanese  society."  'Abdallah went on to say that "the recent bloody  conflicts in al-'Abyad and Madani where the public announced in the  capital of al-Jazirah its civil rebellion, merchants closed their  stores and distributed leaflets declaring a political strike, and  government security forces randomly arrested a number of citizens  and merchants, as they (previously) did students at al-Jazirah  University and the higher secondary schools, all of these uprisings  are small in size but large in significance.  They are without a  doubt consolidating even as we speak and flaring up throughout Sudan  with an aim to finally get rid of the despotic regime."      'Abdallah also addressed the issue of southern self-  determination, equating it with secession which he said is "no  solution to the problem but rather more complication."  He said, "A  large degree of sensitivity related to higher national interests has  surrounded the issue of self-determination.  Therefore, discussion  of self-determination must be completely responsible, frank, with a  sense of national awareness and be done in moderation with both its  opponents and supporters in the context of one Sudan, one people."  Concurring with Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) Leader John  Garang on conditions under which a united Sudan could be achieved,  'Abdallah stressed that the DUP is "not satisfied with simply  realizing equality.  We demand compensation for the south and its  people for the oppression and losses they have suf fered over the  past years.  Balanced economic, social, and geographic development  must include all of Sudan which has become mostly marginalized."  He  added that the DUP has "laid down laws and plans guaranteeing this  balance and fairness, without which there will be no united Sudan."      Retired Colonel Under Detention at Biological Weapons Camp      "Informed Sudanese sources" reported that NIF security forces  "are still detaining retired Col. Hasan Sayyid Ahmad at the  biological weapons camp in Umm Durman."  The colonel was arrested  more than three months ago without being charged" despite his poor  health.  After leaving the service, the colonel opened a commercial  office "joined by a number of currently retired officers whose  source of income was cut off when they separated from the service  because they refused to join the NIF's party."      Government Raises Airport Departure Tax by 200 Pounds      The government has decided to raise country departure fees from  300 to 500 Sudanese pounds.  The Civil Aviation Authority is sending  an announcement of this to "all domestic and international airline  companies to apply this increase immediately."  Since November, the  authority has raised air travel fees "by 75 percent."

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Citicorp moves to lift capital ratios with swap offer CITICORP yesterday offered to swap two types of preferred stock for up to 21.1m common shares, in a move aimed at strengthening its common equity-to-assets capital ratio. The effect of the stock swap would be to strengthen Citicorp's common equity base on paper by as much as Dollars 537m, increasing the common equity-to-assets ratio from a 3.42 per cent to 3.67 per cent. The proposal is part of the bank's drive to bolster capital ratios, which are among the weakest of the big US commercial banks. The bank has been raising cash by way of asset disposals and private and public offers of debentures. The last preferred stock issue was a Dollars 175m public offer in March, which carried a 9 per cent coupon. Last year the bank placed Dollars 1.2bn of preferred stock privately, half of it with a Saudi prince. The rates on last year's two placings were 11 per cent and 10 3/4 per cent. Ms Nancy Newcomb, Citicorp's senior executive in charge of funding, said the stock swap proposal would offer investors a tax-free and commission-free exchange of preferred stock into the more widely held and actively traded common shares. The bank, in turn, would improve its equity base by issuing common shares representing up to 5.7 per cent of total common stock outstanding. Mr Tom Hanley, senior banking analyst at First Boston, the investment bank, praised the stock swap offer as 'a positive step aimed at getting capital ratios up.' The offer provides for 3.72 common shares to be exchanged for each of 3.9m shares of second series preferred stock, and 4.40 common shares for each of the bank's 1.5m shares of third series preferred stock.</p>

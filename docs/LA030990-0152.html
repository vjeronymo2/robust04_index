			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AT THE GALLERIES: WORKS THAT GIVE BEAUTIFUL SHAPE TO SOUND;  </P> <P> ART: MIRIAM SIEVERS' INTERPRETATIONS OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS EVOKE BOTH THE  SKELETON AND SOUL OF MUSIC THROUGH THE BAREST OF MEANS.  </P> <P> "Through extended, long, drawn-out, somewhat expressionless, unsympathetic  tones of a bassoon, resounding in the empty depths, everything became green,"  wrote Wassily Kandinsky, probing the affinity between music and art, between  intangible sounds and abstract forms, colors and shapes.  </P> <P> Miriam Sievers, a San Diego artist, gracefully extends this dialogue between  sister tongues. In her current show at Palomar College's Boehm Gallery (1140 W.  Mission Road, San Marcos), she gives sculptural shape to sound and to its  source. Filled with her free-standing, hanging and wall-mounted works, the  gallery becomes a workshop where instruments lie in wait, their raw wood bones  and gray felt skins exposed to the air's caress. At the same time, these forms  for making music evoke sounds themselves -- notes suspended in space, measured  beats, wavelike rhythms.  </P> <P> Literal, intuitive and sensual responses to music coalesce with subtle beauty  in Sievers' work. Her interpretation of the bassoon builds on Kandinsky's: A  dark wood post stands staidly upon a geometric base, while a thin steel rod  meanders northward beside it -- a prolonged wail. The counterpoint of tones and  that of forms become one here, and the architecture of the base doubles as the  structural foundation of the freely floating sounds.  </P> <P> Sievers' is an art of omission and implication. Both the skeleton and the soul  of music are evoked through the barest of means -- delicate planes of wood,  brass fittings, felt, steel and air. In "Call," another thick dark rod of wood,  ending in a metal horn, rests horizontally on a wood shelf. Inches above, a  slender steel rod hangs in a slight arc, embodying the horn's persistent call.  </P> <P> Sievers' work visualizes the invisible in plainly but carefully crafted forms.  Time asserts a viable presence as one follows the slow, dipping curves and  staccato geometries of the work. Understated and highly accomplished, Sievers'  work bridges the worlds of sight and sound with a profound respect for the  idioms of each.  </P> <P> The delicate spell of Sievers' work is broken with a dull and muddy thud by a  group of paintings in the adjoining gallery space.  </P> <P> The "Game Series," by local painter Gail Roberts, aspires to critique our  wasteful, detritus-producing society, according to the artist's statement. She  pairs painted scenes of unsullied landscapes with checkerboards, rubber balls,  marbles and other plastic toys. Occasionally she melds these objects to the  surface of the canvas, painting rocks or other undefined landscape elements  directly over them.  </P> <P> Does our regard for the earth resemble children's play, with its simple, stated  rules, its carefree appeal, its irrelevant consequences? In the worst of cases,  perhaps yes, but Roberts fails to elucidate the relationship between the  landscape and the game in a convincing manner. Her view is dark and critical  but vague.  </P> <P> Two smaller works deviate from the rest and show more promise. In both "Wings"  and "Signing," latex-cast hands with clenched fists, splayed fingers or cupped  palms are embedded in the painted surface. Though they gesture and signal,  their confinement there paralyzes them and renders them mute. Thwarted  communication works effectively here as a theme; in Roberts' other works,  however, it's an unintended result.  </P> <P> Both shows continue through March 14.  </P></p>

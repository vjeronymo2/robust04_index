			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Arts: Domingo's Walkure Placido qua, Placido la. Not content with virtually every leading Italian and French tenor role, Domingo conducts, sings pop and broadcasts multilingual New Year messages. Now comes Domingo as Siegmund in a new production of Die Walkure at the Vienna State Opera (broadcast by Radio 3 on January 2). For once, Domingo's famed professionalism was not enough. His German diction was poor. He looked uncharacteristically old and clod-footed, standing out awkwardly in a cast of experienced, authentic Wagnerians. His Italianate delivery - which stood him in good stead in previous Heldentenor roles such as Lohengrin - was inappropriate to Siegmund. No-one can blame Domingo for wanting to take on the part: as a popular tenor with a beautiful voice, he can virtually dictate terms to managements (and record companies) grateful for commercial success. He has the vocal stamina and technique - and as he nears 60 (whatever the dictionaries may say), he must seize the remaining challenges while still in good health. Also, how many acceptable alternative Siegmunds are there today? But this was Domingo's Siegmund, not Wagner's. His thick southern European accent discounts him as a credible Wagner tenor. Where the composer's deeply Teutonic text demands understanding and clarion despatch, the words came out as a string of indistinguishable vowel sounds. Where Wagner's music corresponds to the sharp consonants and forward sonority of the German language, Domingo softened the tonal contours. Pre-occupied with an alien text, he seemed unsure how to respond to Wagner's musical spaces, vacuously splaying his arms, his Calaf-like pony-tail adding to the out-of-context appearance. One is forced to ask - just how much does Domingo re-think his stage persona for each character he portrays? The performance began to settle only after Siegmund's demise. Even then, it was uninvolving. Conducted by Christoph von Dohnanyi and produced by Adolf Dresen, this Walkure (part of a new Ring to be completed in May) is a feeble successor to the 1957 Karajan-Preetorius staging. The imbalance in the cast is the least of its problems. Herbert Kapplmuller's poorly-lit sets - a fur-lined igloo in Act one, a black field-tent for Act two, a risible mini-volcano for the magic fire circle - offer a flimsy platform for repertory-style acting. Dresen offers not a single original idea. Dohnanyi conducted efficiently: but it all sounded too calculated. Robert Hale, now the favoured Wotan in Vienna, Berlin and Munich, was handsome in voice and appearance, but lacked personality. Kurt Rydl made a powerful Hunding, his battle with Siegmund providing a lone moment of dramatic veracity. Ute Priew's Fricka was a big, busty bossyboots, not unlike some of the Viennese matriarchs in the audience. Waltraud Meier's first Sieglinde was subdued: she needs a more suitable partner. Hildegard Behrens's Brunnhilde struggled valiantly to bring some life to the proceedings. Was there ever a greater indictment of 'international opera' than this?</p>

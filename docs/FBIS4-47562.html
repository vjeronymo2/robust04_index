The  environment of the Far North is extremely sensitive and is  easily damaged during development. The researchers here used  microbiological techniques in 1988-1991 to study the effect  produced on micromycetes by industrial releases of pollutants  such as SO[.sub]2[/], Ni, Cu, and Co, which accumulate in the  surface layer of soil near the Severonikel Nonferrous Metallurgy  Combine near Monchegorsk, on the Kola Peninsula, in the subzone  of the northern taiga. Illuvial-humus podzolic soils were the  targets of the study, and research plots were selected on the  basis of the prevailing winds of the region. Soil samples were  taken at distances of 3 km, 15 km, 30 km and 75 km from the  combine. The data obtained by the researchers support the  conclusions of G. A. Yevdokimova et al. (``Biological Activity  of Soils Exposed to Agrotechnical Pollution in the Far North,''  Leningrad, Nauka, 1984, 120 pp.). The population of micromycetes  in the soil near the combine was one-fourth that of the control  region (75 km from the combine. Not surprisingly, heavy metal  content in the soil grew as the researchers neared the combine.  Several micromycetes -- Paecilomyces farinosus, Penicillum  notatus, and Aspergillus niger -- accumulate  copper and nickel, affixing them to their biomass, thereby  preventing the development of soil toxicosis.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Indonesia has urged Malaysia to respond to its  statement on the status of Sipadan and Ligitan in order to  accelerate the settlement of the dispute over ownership of these  islands. This came up during additional talks between the  Indonesian and Malaysian delegations in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.  Indonesia had hoped that the two countries would agree on some  principles to serve as a basis for the next round of talks.  According to Indonesian chief delegate Izhar Ibrahim, the  Indonesian Government reiterated its position on the ownership  of Sipadan and Ligitan in 1992 through a memorandum and  supporting documents, such as a territorial map. Malaysia has  yet to respond, however. Meanwhile, Malaysian chief delegate  Ahmad Kamil Jaafar said the two countries would be able to  settle the matter amicably.</p>

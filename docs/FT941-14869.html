			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard to launch new desk-top range Hewlett-Packard, which last year overtook Digital Equipment to become the second-largest US computer company behind IBM, will today launch two product lines to expand in the corporate computing market. HP will announce an enterprise desktop computer combining the high performance of a scientific workstation with the lower cost and software standards of personal computers. The company will introduce a line of network servers, priced to compete with PC servers but offering performance that competes with mini-computers. The new computers, based on a low-cost version of HP's PA-Risc microprocessor chip, are aggressively priced. The desktop machines, which start at Dollars 3,995, will compete with high-end PCs. The new HP servers, which range in price from Dollars 7,569 to Dollars 14,919, outperform PC servers while undercutting the price of mini-computers, such as the IBM AS/400. HP's new computers are aimed at companies adopting the client server networked computing model. 'These are the machines needed by companies that are re-engineering their businesses,' says Mr Willem Roelants, general manager of HP's computer systems operations. 'The fundamental idea of re-engineering is to give employees tools so that one person can complete a job, such as a customer transaction, without having to pass it on to several different people in different departments.' Sales of enterprise workstations are rising sharply according to a market report issued last week by Frost and Sullivan, the US market research group. World sales were expected to reach Dollars 25bn per year by 1999, the researchers predicted. HP's challenge in the enterprise workstation market is to displace high-end PCs. To do so, it will offer software compatibility with programs designed for the Microsoft Windows environment as well as UNIX applications. HP will introduce multi-media programs for video and voice applications. HP has designed its new desktop and server computers so that they can run Microsoft's new Windows NT operating system. Lotus Development, Applix and Clarity have developed programs for the new HP desktop machines. The new HP desktop computers will run standard PC programs and UNIX application programs.</p>

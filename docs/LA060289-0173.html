			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> KEMP COY ABOUT TOP NFL POST  </P> <P> Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp has refused to take himself  out of the running for the job of National Football League commissioner,  according to a published report today.  </P> <P> In an interview with the Washington Times, Kemp said he spoke Sunday with  retiring NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle, who asked him if he was interested in  the job. Kemp told the newspaper that the conversation was not a concrete  offer, but he refused several times to respond directly when asked if he would  reject the job if offered.  </P> <P> Kemp, the former quarterback for the Buffalo Bills and San Diego Chargers, said  he turned down an interview with Rozelle's "headhunters," referring to the  executive search company the league hired to help find a replacement.  </P> <P> Asked if he would reject the job if offered, Kemp replied, "Are you trying to  stick a pencil in my ear?" Asked to elaborate, he said, "It means I'm thrilled  to be doing what I'm doing and to be in the Bush Administration."  </P></p>

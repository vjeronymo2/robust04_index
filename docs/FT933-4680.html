			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Smaller companies in leasing firing line A PROPOSAL to extend consumer credit protection legislation to small companies could lead to a sharp decline in the amount of hire purchase and leasing finance available to small businesses, the Finance &amp; Leasing Association warned yesterday, Charles Batchelor writes. If at the same time the limit of financing agreements covered by the Consumer Credit Act were to be doubled to Pounds 30,000, an estimated Pounds 830m could be lost to small businesses, the association said. The warning comes as the Office of Fair Trading is due to publish a consultation paper on whether the act should be extended to incorporated businesses. At present it applies only to individuals and unincorporated businesses. The Department of Trade and Industry is also considering plans to double the size of financings covered by the act.</p>

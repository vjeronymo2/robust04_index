			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Travel: Odyssey through a winter wilderness - Off-piste / Arnold Wilson takes risks high in the Dauphine AS WE traversed the debris of avalanches beneath the frozen walls of La Meije, blocks of ice the size of a giant fist glistened at our feet. They had broken off from the myriad seracs (ice pinnacles) above us, falling hundreds of feet down the sheer north face. I picked up one of these diamonds. It was as pure as the wind-blown virgin snow we had skied to reach this desolate, beautiful 'vallon' (narrow valley). I wanted to take it home as a trophy of one of the most astonishing day's skiing of my life. Our small, exhausted but triumphant party skied the final mile of the rock-strewn path down to the Col du Lautaret. Our skis were trashed but our spirits soared when the sight we had been waiting for finally appeared: way beneath us on a shelf was the medieval-looking village of La Grave, lights twinkling in the twilight, church bells ringing hauntingly, and with the peaks high above the village still bathed in evening light. La Grave, a heady 6,500 vertical descent on tough, unpisted terrain, is only one of many classic, off-piste, ski-mountaineering adventures (reaching long, off-piste descents by walking, either carrying skis or walking on them with the help of skins) to be savoured in this part of the French alps: the Dauphine area around Alpe d'Huez and Les Deux Alpes. The best base for exploring them is the quaint Hotel Rissiou where Nigel Purkhardt bases his Ski Peak operation in the picturesque Oisans village of Vaujany (1,250 metres) - a more pleasant back door to Alpe d'Huez than the architecturally uninspiring resort itself. Although it is almost an hour's drive to reach Les Deux Alpes (a mere five minutes by helicopter), it is not necessary to travel further to find off-piste itineraries of almost equal quality. There are endless permutations starting outside your door in Vaujany itself. Due to a windfall earned from a huge dam and hydro-electric station lower down the valley, Vaujany has one of the world's biggest cable cars linking it with Alpe d'Huez. At night it is tethered, like a huge spacecraft, in the middle of the village, an incongruous sight in such a rustic setting. Vaujany is not a village you would necessarily seek out while exploring the local slopes. Visiting it, and some of the other mountain village satellites that often remain unseen while skiers concentrate on 'motorway' cruising, is rather like getting off the real motorways in France and experiencing the joys of the countryside. We skied to two other such villages - St Christophe en Oisans and then Venosc, locked in an almost claustrophobically beautiful valley - via the most spectacular off-piste run I can remember skiing anywhere in Europe: the Vallon de la Selle. That we did it on the same day as La Grave (the starting point for both is the Col de la Loze, reached after a 20-minute hike from the top of the Les Deux Alpes ski area) made it an epic day. While piste skiers were clocking up endless runs no more than a mile away, our small group, accompanied by Olivier Laborie, our guide, set off on an off-piste odyssey. Olivier's rucksack was weighed down with ice-axe, shovel, rope, titanium ice screws, and karabiner and pulley for possible crevasse rescue. Throughout the weekend, we were to ski just four descents. But they were descents of such quality that on the rare occasions that we happened to cross a piste in transit, it seemed almost hum-drum. What is so spectacular about such runs is not necessarily the excellence of the snow - which can change from good to bad to ugly and back again within a couple of dozen turns - but the near-mystical experience of being allowed into the literally and spiritually rarified atmosphere of a desolate mountain wilderness. The Vallon de la Selle is a prime example. From the Col de la Loze, Olivier skied gently over the shoulder to reveal a seemingly endless, steep snowfield. A rocky outcrop dominated our route on the left. The steep, wide chute of the actual run was bathed in sunshine that in an hour or two would make the snow too difficult to enjoy. Our route disappeared into the shadow of the narrow valley below. Skiing a valley like this without a guide would be foolish. Were there any crevasses lurking beneath the snow? If you fell at the top would the snow hold you, or was there a cliff lurking beneath? And, on a more positive note, where was the best snow likely to be? Usually, falling on such terrain is harmless, if disconcerting. But during our afternoon descent of La Grave, Olivier had us doing a climbing traverse to keep above what looked like an innocent slope. It turned out that not only was there a rimaye (a long snaky crevasse usually found where rock and glacier meet) lurking below us, but the slope had all the characteristics of being prone to a slab avalanche. During a thrilling descent of the Col de la Pyramide, of the Pic Blanc, high above the Alpe d'Huez/Vaujany ski area, we were warned not to fall because there were cliffs which were not obvious from above. A skier falling here could risk serious injury. Indeed, a skier in our party had been saved by Olivier on an earlier occasion when he 'caught' her, cow-catcher style, at his third attempt. One must not exaggerate the dangers, but being aware of them is important. For those interested in pistes rather than off-piste, the Alpe d'Huez skiing domaine offers 107 of them (220 km) almost 90 lifts and 325 snow cannon. My visit to Vaujany was arranged by Ski Peak, Hangerfield, Witley, Surrey, GU8 5PR. 0428-682272. I stayed at the Rissiou Hotel. Ski Peak also has chalet and apartment accommodation. Prices for a week (half board) range from Pounds 300 in January to Pounds 450 in February, including scheduled Air France flight from Heathrow to Lyon and transfer. Ski weekends (four nights half board), usually only available in January and April, from Pounds 349.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Zaza Tsuladze article: "The Ice Has Begun To Break"] </F>   [Text] On 13 June, at the headquarters of the  Georgian Popular Front, three of the country's solid political  organizations -- the Popular Front, "Charter-91," and the  Republican Party -- signed an agreement on the creation of one  political organization -- the United Republican Party of Georgia.    With the signing of this agreement an important process has  begun: The amalgamation of political parties in Georgia,  something that was unavoidable but has been long delayed in  Georgia. In accordance with the agreement, until the  constituent congress is convened, the party's provisional  leading body is to be the Political Council (composed of 13  members) that will be run by mutual agreement prior to the  adoption of the party's rules. The Political Council is  empowered to adopt a decision on any issue relating to the  party's activities provided it has the support of more than half  of the members. The work of the Political Council is to be  presided over by three cochairmen, all of whom have equal  rights: Nodar Natadze (Popular Front), Tedo Paatashvili  ("Charter- 91"), and Vakhtang Dzabiradze (Republican Party).  The party will operate as one faction in the Republic of  Georgia Parliament.    At the meeting, the cochairmen of the United Republican  Party  of Georgia signed the party's political declaration that  stipulates the speediest resolution of the following problems  during this fateful time for Georgia:    1. To restore the united national consciousness of the  Georgian nation and reattach the nation's dismembered limbs.    2. To determine correctly Georgia's historical and  state function in the Caucasian region at the border between  Asia and Europe and elaborate a nation-state doctrine as the  basis for the state's official strategic political course.    3. To restore Georgia's territorial integrity and  extend the Georgian state's jurisdiction throughout its entire  territory.    4. To restore and elaborate in reality the sovereignty  of the Georgian state and steadfastly defend the trend toward  its growth and consolidation.    5. To transform real and not imaginary parliamentary  government into the primary guarantee of the country's  democratic development.    6. To conduct without delay structural and legislative  reform pertaining to the political and economic management of  the state.    7. The state is to ensure that the minimum social  needs of citizens are satisfied in a just manner and their  lives, dignity, and rights are legally protected.    In the near future, the United Republican Party of Georgia  plans to present a concrete program covering all the  aforementioned problems to Parliament and society. The party  believes that Georgia has the spiritual, cultural and  historical, intellectual, political, and natural or human  potential to enable the country to avoid a complete nation-state  catastrophe. At the same time, the party views the use of force  to resolve problems as the most serious crime against the  country's integrity.    Those present at the meeting observed a minute's silence in  memory of those Georgian guardsmen who were slaughtered in Gori  on 13 June 1992.    The crowded meeting ended with a dinner.</p>

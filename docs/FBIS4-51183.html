			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Dongbo (1728 2639 3134)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 25 May (XINHUA) -- Speaking today at a  rotating training class in Volume 3 of the Selected Works  of Deng Xiaoping, attended by division-level leading cadres  of the General Logistics Department, Fu Quanyou, member of the  Central Military Commission and director of the General  Logistics Department, emphatically said: In studying Volume 3  of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, it is  imperative to make unremitting efforts and persevere in  integrating theory with practice and in putting what one has  learned to good use, to achieve results in pushing forward the  reform and construction of the Army's logistic work.    Fu Quanyou pointed out: Since the beginning of this year,  the party committee of the General Logistics Department has paid  attention to its central group's study programs. It has  sponsored two rotating training classes for division-level  leading cadres. Meanwhile, various units have sponsored more  than 70 rotating training classes for regiment-level cadres.  The overall result of these training classes is good. But we  should have a sober understanding that such an effort is just a  beginning. Only by studying continuously can we adapt to the  new situation and meet the requirements of our tasks. We must  persist in carrying out Chairman Jiang Zemin's important  instruction: "Constantly and repeatedly study Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and put it on top of  the agenda."    Fu Quanyou said: The most outstanding feature of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics is the high degree of integration of its  scientific nature with its practical nature. In studying Volume  3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, we must  achieve results in solving practical problems. First of all, in  the light of the overall situation of the party's work, we must  have a profound understanding of the relations between "reform,  development, and stability"; strengthen our  self-conscientiousness in carrying out the general goal; and  resolutely follow the instructions of the CPC Central Committee  and Central Military Commission with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the  core so as to better ensure the reform, opening up, and  modernization drive. Secondly, in the light of realities in the  market and on the battlefield, it is necessary to apply Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the ideology of Army-building in the new  period to guide practical logistics work. It is imperative to  emancipate the mind, blaze new trails, and work hard to meet the  requirements of modern war and the market economy so as to  achieve the goal of "being assured of adequate logistical  support." Third, in the light of ideological realities, it is  necessary to guide the broad masses of officers and soldiers to  self-conscientiously improve their world outlook; resist the  corrosion of various corruptive thoughts; firmly keep in mind  the ideal of serving the people wholeheartedly; maintain the  glorious tradition of the old revolutionary Army; carry forward  the "five kinds of revolutionary spirits" [wu zhong ge ming jing  shen 0063 4429 7245 0730 4737 4377] advocated by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping; the "64-character pioneering spirit" [emancipate the  mind, seek truth from facts, actively explore new ways, dare to  innovate, work hard, press forward in the face of difficulties,  learn from foreign countries, constantly improve ourselves, be  modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impatience, work  together as one, have national interest in mind, be diligent and  frugal, be upright and honest, work vigorously to make the  country prosperous, and serve selflessly] advocated by Comrade  Jiang Zemin; and strive to carry out a socialist new moral and  work style.    Fu Quanyou urged leading cadres at all levels to take the  lead in studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping and, through studying, to strengthen their  dedication to the work and their sense of responsibility,  maintain integrity, foster a good image, and strive to enhance  their leading skills and ability to have the situation well in  mind.    Zhou Keyu, political commissar of the General Logistics  Department, also spoke at the meeting on how to study Volume 3  of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping.</p>

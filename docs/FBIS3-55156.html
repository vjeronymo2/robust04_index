			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [First article in a series by Virginijus Gaivenis: "Who </F> Armed National Defense? (1)"]    [Excerpts] RESPUBLIKA mentioned the name of Kaunas  inhabitant Vladas Laurinavicius for the first time in the  article "In the Tangle of the Kaunas Mafia" published in the  fall of 1991. We described the cruise of the Kaunas Mafia  "celebrities" around the Mediterranean. It seems that gathered  on the ship "Gruzia," the leaders of the Lithuanian-Hong Kong  enterprise "Grand Queen," who had caused suspicion among law  enforcement officials for a long time, and their assistants were  not just resting. The list of holiday-makers surprised the  officials most of all because it included not only V.  Laurinavicius, but also Andrius Jankevicius, nicknamed Psidze,  who is one of the best known persons in the Kaunas criminal  world, S. Ciapas, president of the closed stock company "Deka,"  and other well-known "businessmen." [passage omitted]    The Lithuanian state and its government leaders authorized  [former] Defense Minister A. Butkevicius to conclude an  agreement on the purchase of 5,000 machine guns from the Kaunas  association "Selma" headed by no one else but V. Laurinavicius,  a person who has been sentenced thrice, like Psidze himself.  [passage omitted] Today, our law enforcement officials have  become interested in the activities of this association and its  ties with the former leaders of the National Defense Ministry  [KAM]. Maybe, because aircraft and machine guns, as they  suspect, were bought from Russia for a "nickel," while they were  "pushed into" the KAM for hundreds of millions [currency  unspecified]. Prosecutors are trying to assess material losses.  They are also trying to find out who proposed the Kaunas  company "Selma" with its president V. Laurinavicius as arms  suppliers to the government.    We will try to base the study of KAM former agreements on  definite and documented facts in the current publication.  <H5>  Ship Traders Under Pirates' Siege </H5>   KAM leaders established the first contacts with "Selma" last  spring. On 11 May, they concluded an agreement on the  acquisition of six armed war ships with equipment and  ammunition. "Selma" President V. Laurinavicius pledged to  observe it. The KAM leaders made a deal with "Selma" without  delay. The then Deputy Defense Minister A. Pauzuolis was  authorized by Minister A. Butkevicius himself to sign the  agreement. However, when employees of the State Inspection  Department began to analyze the conditions for concluding and  implementing this agreement, the KAM leaders refused strictly to  provide copies of the documents. By the way, as it turned out  later, the agreement with "Selma" had been concluded without  permission from the Lithuanian Government. A relevant  government resolution appeared only on 1 July of last year.    However, under the 11 May agreement, the KAM did not receive  a single ship, as it is. Therefore, a new government resolution  (24 September) was adopted which served as the basis for signing  another agreement between the KAM and "Selma." True, the latter  bears no concrete date, only the year 1992. It provides for the  acquisition of one war ship at a price of 120 million rubles  [R]. Although the 24 September resolution did not permit paying  cash, R60 million were taken from the Vilnius branch of the  Lithuanian Bank and handed to V. Laurinavicius the next day.  The money was paid to the "Selma" president without the  minister's signature, because the KAM allegedly owed him this  money according to the former unfulfilled 11 May agreement. A  week later on 6 October, following the government resolution,  the KAM leaders took 117 million talonai [provisional currency  before the litas] from the Lithuanian Bank and gave it to V.  Laurinavicius. The money for one war ship. The KAM had no  agreement with the association "Selma" for this purpose. It had  only Minister A. Butkevicius' resolution (without a date and a  number) on additional payment for one war ship.    At the same time, the National Defense Ministry [KAM]  launched another agreement with "Selma" (indicating only the  year 1992) on the acquisition of a second frigate for 240  million talonai designed to combat submarines. Despite all  Lithuanian laws, this agreement allowed that the "Selma"  president be paid in cash. Another 240 million talonai were  taken from the bank and handed over to V. Laurinavicius on 17  November.    Thus, V. Laurinavicius received 417 million rubles [R] for  two ships in cash. The statement of transfer of two small  ships, built in 1980 and 1981, was signed by R. Baltuska,  commander of the coast guard unit, and Baltic Fleet Deputy  Commander N. Kachanovich. On 21 October 1992, this statement  was confirmed by Baltic Fleet Commander Y. Yegorov and Minister  A. Butkevicius. However, none of the documents indicated the  actual price of the ships. Maybe, this is why officers often  hold their heads when hearing the sum that the government paid  for the two ships. One could buy newer and much better ships  for the millions that went to "Selma." When the State  Inspection Department tried to retrieve the documents from the  KAM confirming the prices of the acquired ships, the ministry  refused to provide them. As it turned out, the KAM was  overzealous -- it paid to "Selma" 78.8 million litai more than  it had in Finance Ministry allotments.  <H5>  "Selma" Takes Care of Arms </H5>   A government resolution of 19 August 1992 authorized Defense  Minister A. Butkevicius to conclude an agreement with the  "Selma" association, so that the latter assisted in supplying  the KAM with light firearms. According to the plan, "Selma" had  to provide 5,000 AKM-74 machine guns for R198,770,000. This  government document served as a basis for the agreement between  the KAM and "Selma." The agreement (bearing only the year 1992)  was signed by "Selma" Managing Director V. Laurinavicius and  Minister A. Butkevicius. Although without a date, the document  has a stamp. Under this agreement, "Selma" had to supply 5,000  AKM-74 machine guns. The KAM had to pay $220 for each of them  at an exchange rate of $1 to R180.70. For some reason the  minister again promised to pay this sum in cash, although  Lithuanian law forbids this.    Judging from the documents that RESPUBLIKA possesses today,  between 20 August and 7 September 1992, KAM officials took out  R198,770,000 from the ministry's account in the Vilnius branch  of the Lithuanian Bank. All the money was handed over to  "Selma" President V. Laurinavicius.    V. Drupas, chief of the KAM Armament Department, received  the  machine guns from "Selma" on 15 August 1992. True, "Selma"  supplied AK-74 machine guns instead of the AKM-74 indicated in  the government resolution and the agreement. The arms were  transferred without a ministry's commission. The bills of  lading were issued the same day. However, there is not a single  word about the price of these arms and the total sum paid for  them. How much did the ministry actually pay for these  machine-guns? (To be continued).</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Warning over Indonesian banks INDONESIA'S listed banks have mostly announced an increase in pre-tax profits for 1992, although bankers warn the sector remains poorly regulated and burdened by non-performing debt. Of the six largest listed banks, five improved on their 1991 performance. Pre-tax profits at Bank Internasional Indonesia (BII) rose 62.4 per cent to Rp122.1bn (Dollars 59m), while Lippobank's increased to Rp53.6bn from Rp24.6bn a year earlier. Bank Danamon's pre-tax profits rose from 11 per cent to Rp51bn, Bank Bali's increased from 17.6 per cent to Rp84.1bn, and Bank Niaga's grew 12 per cent to Rp36.5bn. Bank Duta was alone in seeing a pre-tax profit fall from Rp35.9bn in 1991 to Rp26.2bn last year. In a year of general consolidation in the Indonesian banking sector, which remains dominated by five state-owned banks, the growth in the listed banks' outstanding loans either slowed or, in two instances, was reversed. Bank Danamon's loan portfolio grew most rapidly to Rp3,600bn from Rp2,950bn in 1991, while Lippobank's loans rose 17.5 per cent to Rp2,150bn. Bank Bali and Bank Duta posted a marginal fall in outstanding loans, down 7 per cent to Rp1,960bn and 4.5 per cent to Rp1,700bn respectively. Brokers say the banks are more bullish for growth next year. BII forecast a 50 per cent loan growth this year, after an 8 per cent rise to Rp3,680bn in 1992. Lippobank and Bank Bali are forecasting loan growth in excess of 20 per cent, while Bank Niaga is anticipating a more modest 15 per cent rise. The government has forecast a 17 per cent rise in banking sector credit this year. Brokers, however, warn that higher net profits and an increase in credit may flatter the banks' actual performance. The results need to be accompanied by a now-perennial warning that banks may be under-provisioning for non-performing assets, they say. Banks should be providing a minimum of 2.3 per cent of productive assets for non-performing assets, brokers say, but they believe that none of the listed banks reaches this figure. In the worst case, brokers estimate that one of the six is providing less than 1 per cent of its productive assets. An increase in provisions to 2.3 per cent would wipe out twice-over the bank's 1992 net profits. Banks anticipating high credit growth this year will also need to watch their capital adequacy ratios. Brokers estimate all the six listed banks to have capital adequacy ratios in excess of 7 per cent of risk weighted assets, a level set by the central bank for the end of this month. But if the banks meet their targets for credit growth, most will need to raise new capital by the end of the year. Brokers say this could lead to a call on shareholders for new finance or restricted dividend payments to allow banks to retain profits and boost their capital base.</p>

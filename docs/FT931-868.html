			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / International Company News: First Spanish Trust in move to reduce discount to net assets THE FIRST Spanish Investment Trust has put forward proposals designed to reduce the discount to net assets at which its shares trade. The complex plan involves replacing four-fifths of the share capital with convertible loan stock. Investors will then be entitled to tender their convertible stock; the trust is likely to repurchase the stock at a price which will probably be equal to 95 per cent of the fully diluted net asset value. This will enable some investors to realise their holdings for cash. At the same time, the net asset value of the remaining shares will be enhanced. Investors will be able to tender all their holdings in the initial offer. In subsequent tenders, investors will be able to tender a proportion of their holdings, based on the discount to net asset value at which the loan stock is trading. The wider the discount, the more stock investors will be able to tender. Any convertible stock not tendered will be repaid in 1997. The manager, Lloyds Bank Fund Management, is cutting its fee from 1.25 per cent to 1 per cent of gross assets, but adding an incentive if it outperforms the Spanish index. First Spanish was trading at a 19 per cent discount to net assets in November, when the trust announced it was considering restructuring proposals. The discount has narrowed to 11 per cent. The plan needs 75 per cent approval of shareholders and warrantholders at an extraordinary general meeting. Investors holding 28.4 per cent of the equity have already undertaken to vote in favour.</p>

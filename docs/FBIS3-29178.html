			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  held a conference in Geneva on Monday to discuss the  international aid program for the repatriation of Vietnamese  refugees. The conference was attended by representatives from 31  countries. We now provide you with a report on international  assistance for Vietnamese repatriated as well our government's  stance on this issue:    About 55,000 Vietnamese people who illegally emigrated to  other countries have in recent years been repatriated to this  country -- Vietnam -- and have received assistance for  reintegration.    Programs funded by the European Community are the vivid  example of the effective assistance in this field, which also  come from many agencies and other countries.    The European Community Integration Program or the  Reintegration of Vietnamese Refugees or ECIP has been deployed  in Vietnam on the basis of an agreement signed between the  European Community and the Vietnamese government. This is the  first program of cooperation between Vietnam and the European  Community. It started in June 1992 and will last 30 months with  the total estimated cost of $130 million. The purpose of the  program is to provide jobs and vocational training as well as to  create opportunities to find jobs for Vietnamese returnees, thus  helping them quickly stabilize their lives and reintegrate into  the community. It also aims to contributing to consolidating  and improving the lives of other people in Vietnam, especially  in those places where the repatriation program is under way.    In the past phase, the ECIP's granted loans were $14 million  and have been reimbursed $13.5 million. Programs have created  34,000 jobs, 16,000 of these jobs for returnees. About 72  vocational centers throughout the country have received  financial assistance from the ECIP. At these centers, more than  50,000 people received training for 44 different jobs and skills.    In addition, the ECIP funded 57 small-size projects with a  total cost of $2.9 million in order to build and rehabilitate  the infrastructure, thus contributing to socioeconomic  development of Vietnamese people generally.    A number of healthcare projects have been carried out in  many  provinces in the central and southern Vietnam. The progressive  efficiency of the ECIP have meant the number of people who  illegally fled Vietnam has been reduced. And the program has  also encouraged Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong and some  Southeast Asian countries to return home.    The Vietnamese Government is ready to negotiate bilaterally  with countries concerned and to cooperate with the High  Commissioner for Refugees. This will be done on the framework of  the comprehensive program of action in order to receive those  who cannot seek asylum in the third countries under the  principle of respecting human dignity and insuring security,  law, and order and the international financial assistance to  help the returnees resettle in their homeland if necessary.    Any repatriation of Vietnamese refugees that runs counter to  these principles will not receive support from the world  community nor from Vietnam.</p>

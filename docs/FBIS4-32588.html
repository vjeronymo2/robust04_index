			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Agron T.: Happy Retirement, Mr. Ryerson! </F> Welcome Mr. Lake!]    [Text] President Clinton's announcement about his  intention to appoint Mr. Joseph Edward Lake as new U.S.  ambassador to Albania arrived at a time when political analysts  had already come across signs of change in the U.S. stance  toward the Albanian opposition and particularly its largest  force, the PS [Socialist Party]. Such signs were contacts  established in our country by representatives of the Republican  and National Democratic Institute, and several interviews,  comments, and analyses of the "Voice of America," which, in  stark contrast with the past, began mirroring our reality, with  our political developments, the course of our  government-opposition relations, and the State Department's  report on the situation of human rights and political freedom of  the opposition in Albania in 1993.    However, the basic arguments in support of this belief were  the thaw, after a long winter, in relations between the U.S.  Embassy in Tirana and the opposition parties, several meetings  between its staffers and PS leaders, and Mr. Ryerson's presence  at a news conference on the Nano affair. In fact, it was not  the first time that Mr. Ryerson's presence or absence, and a  number of other public activities in his capacity as U.S.  ambassador, had become the topic of discussion and  interpretation, ranging from truth to conjecture, from naivete  to presumption.    None of the analysts or observers denied that his role in  Albanian political developments over the last three years had  been obvious, and this had been possible not only because he was  the top diplomatic representative of the U.S. superstate, but  also because of the intimacy that he created with certain  circles. However, when it came to evaluate his influence,  assessments varied to the extreme opposites. Though these  factors only acted like yeast in giving shape to opinions,  today, for certain purposes, they are decisive, reaching even to  a point of vesting Mr. Ryerson's personality with powers that  nobody could possibly possess alone, even in his important  position, for the following reasons:    1. Whatever Mr. Ryerson's origins as a U.S. citizen, U.S.  interests are sacred to him, since, as a U.S. Administration  employee, he is legally obliged to defend them whereever they  exist, and as an official in foreign service, he has the  responsibility to maintain the system of meeting these interests  when the system is working, or build one and put it into  operation wherever it is lacking. After a gap of 45 years, Mr.  Ryerson as the number one U.S. diplomat in Tirana, had the task  of installing in Albania a system that could enable the  implementation of U.S. policy toward or regarding our country.  Within this framework, not only did his past undertakings in  Albania become clearer, but it can also be explained why, in  certain cases, he had to break with the usual conventions of his  rank.    Today there is no need to speak of U.S. interests in  eradicating communism, even in Albania. Nor is it worth  repeating our politicians' conclusions, explaining why the PDSH  [Democratic Party] was the only Albanian political force that  could accomplish such a task. Albeit transcending the limits of  his diplomat's status, Mr. Ryerson's busy activities in the  run-up to the parliamentary elections of 1992 in actual fact  reflected the truth regarding trust toward such political forces  that could simultaneously carry out the "eradication of  communism," and pave the way for the furthering of U.S. policy  in Albania. Thus, Mr. Ryerson "helped the PDSH to conquer  Albania," while individuals or groupings within this party  guaranteed the implementation of the U.S. strategy in our  country. In a nutshell, the extremely natural functioning of  the official scheme of Albanian-U.S. relations, to which Mr.  Ryerson made his own contribution, is expressed in President  Berisha's words: "The United States and the U.S. institutions  and Government, directly or through their missions in Tirana,  have been very close to us from the very first moments of the  democratic movement, and have supported us unequivocally ever  since." This is also expressed in the conclusions drawn by  foreign analysts and observers, who, apart from branding  Berisha's regime as pro-United States, also emphasize Albania's  absolute dependence on Washington.    Along the same lines is Mr. Ryerson's participation in  various rehabilitation ceremonies, particularly in reburials, or  in activities to honor former pupils of the Harry Fultz  Technical School, and so on. In essence it expresses also the  U.S. commitment morally to reward various Albanian citizens not  only for their anti-communist activities, but also for the  services that they have previously rendered for the United  States.    In Albanian Canon Law, without referring to history, the  roles of Host and Guest are closely related to each other. The  guest is greatly honoured and respected; he has pride of place  in the house, but the host is responsible for every  transgression or harm that the guest might commit while under  the host's hospitality. Nevertheless, as masters of Albania  until the next elections, the Albanian people have chosen those  politicians to whom they gave their votes on 22 March 1992.    2. At a election meeting in March 1992, in the city of  Korca, Mr. Ryerson is supposed to have said: "If the PD wins,  all the Communists will be out of a job." If his actions and  presence were the epicenter of analyses of the U.S. stance  toward Albania's political forces, these words were used as a  refrain by the majority of those who had certain reservations  about Mr. Ryerson. If you analyze the words in detail, you find  concentrated in them the dilemma between the man and the  official, between duty and reason, and how it was properly  solved. It is another thing that the Albanians swallowed this  warning message only when the PDSH, after gaining an absolute  majority of votes, approved Law 24/1, which sanctioned the newly  commenced administrative reform.    It is not that "the great U.S. policy has understood its  preposterous interference in Albanian politics"; this shuffling  of U.S. ambassadors in Albania follows the natural course of  U.S. diplomatic procedures. The time that it was announced is  yet another argument in favor of the analysts' views. Within  the framework of U.S. pragmatism, it shows that the policy is  actually at the stage of working out tactics in accordance with  the constant strategic purposes. They are enriched with new  elements, or new tactics are being prepared to effect the  "metamorphosis of Albanian opinion on the United States," and to  be adequately prepared for future developments inside or  engulfing Albania from without. Every biographical study of the  new ambassador to Albania would lead you to these same  conclusions.    The news about Mr. Lake's appointment, who gained his  doctorate at Texas Christian University, reached Albania (a  member of the Conference of Islamic Countries, whose Christian  population, catholic and orthodox, and their religious  institutions enjoy a "special care" evinced by the churches of  neighboring countries) at the same time as the U.S. media  announced the establishment of the International Protestant  Church as the newest international church, based in Tirana. The  new ambassador will certainly be welcomed by his fellow  countrymen, who for some time have been engaged in activities in  Albania as representatives of various religious sects.    Who is Mr. Lake? Mr. Lake is a former director of the U.S.  State Department's Operations Center, where he worked closely  with the White House and other departments in the same year when  the collapse of the communist system in Eastern Europe was  projected and actually took place. He is a highly qualified  specialist with a "successful career" and "great experience" in  East Asia and the Pacific in general, and on China in  particular. Mr. Lake is preparing to take up his position in  Tirana at a time when analysts foresee that the left wing is  likely to come to power, when they observe that China's  interests in Albania have remained constant, and when our  present decision-makers have by necessity already understood the  philosophical importance of the saying "Make as many new friends  as you like, but do not forget the old ones!" and are, albeit  with certain reluctance, trying to act accordingly.    The former Number Two of the U.S. Embassy in Sofia is  waiting  for the Senate's approval to take up his new post in Albania,  where, according to observers and politicians, a "Bulgarian  scenario" is being implemented. At the same time analysts  insist that the "Albania-Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia -- FYROM]-Bulgaria corridor," as a "programmed  policy," is part and parcel of the U.S. strategy in the Balkans.  While waiting to settle himself on the western edge of this  segment, Mr. Lake is learning Albanian, as he learned Chinese  and Bulgarian.    Ambassadors come and go. Although acclaimed as the  mastermind of their respective embassies, they are nothing more  than tiny particles in the huge mechanism that sets in motion  the open policies worked out in state chancelleries. It is the  Albanians themselves who have made Albania in the past and will  make it in the future. With the help also of the United States,  Europe and.... Enough of "enemies from East to West," but not to  the point of, say, turning your back on Europe for the sake of  the United States, or flying off toward the Islamic region, or  overturning obsolete chests to obtain outdated schemes of  ethnic-religious rows with neighbors, or brushing aside  China.... In Western policy, the principle of "more relations,  fewer problems" has gained the status of an axiom, and therefore  Albania will survive only by giving everyone his due place.    Ambassadors come and go, and even if they speak Albanian, it  is not their mother-tongue.    A happy old age and retirement, Mr. Ryerson! Welcome Mr.  Lake! [previous sentence in English]</p>

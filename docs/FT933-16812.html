			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Senators try to protect fast-track authority THE US Senate's Democratic leaders were preparing yesterday to fight off an attempt to amend the 'fast-track' negotiating authority the president has to complete the Uruguay Round of international trade negotiations by December 15. Senator Fritz Hollings, a Democrat supporter of the textile industry, said he would try to attach an aggressive provision - called Super 301  - to the fast-track authorisation. Super 301 has loopholes which let the administration avoid imposing sanctions but is disliked by US trading partners, who see its listing of 'unfair traders' as US unilateralism. The US administration, hoping to avoid a battle, has asked for a 'clean' fast-track, free of measures which would offend US trading partners. Lobbyists yesterday were asking senators not to 'embarrass' the president by encumbering him when he discusses trade at the Tokyo summit next week. In the hope of harmony at the summit, the administration yesterday delayed announcing sanctions in its dispute with Japan over access to the construction market. But the administration's entire trade agenda looks fragile. A US federal judge yesterday ruled that the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada violates the National Environmental Policy Act. Meanwhile, the 'quad' talks - the US, Japan, the EC and Canada, meeting in Toronto - are stuck over a US retreat from the Bush administration's position on reduction of textile tariffs. Ms Jennifer Hillman, chief textile negotiator, has accepted US industry insistence that the quota phase-out be tied to 'substantial market access commitments, especially from the developing countries'.</p>

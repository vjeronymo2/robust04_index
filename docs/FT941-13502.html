			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Harsh realities behind the China obsession - Investment funds can show good returns, but there are pitfalls Even by the standards of the faddish fund management industry, the obsession with China funds has been extreme. Last week saw the start of the London roadshow for the Guangdong Development Fund, which adds at least USDollars 100m to the more than USDollars 3bn that has been pumped into China funds in the past two years. China was arguably the investment buzz-word of 1993, as another year of double-digit economic growth helped fuel a 115 per cent rise in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index over the year. But shrewd investors who read the signs early and invested in China funds have not been particularly well rewarded for their prescience. Most equity-orientated China funds had a strong performance last year. Of 25 funds tracked by the fund research company Micropal, the average increase in net asset value was 68 per cent - but this compared with an average 118 per cent increase for Hong Kong equity funds, and Hong Kong made up the majority of all China fund portfolios. The GT Shenzhen &amp; China fund, the first to feed on demand for equities linked to the economic revolution in the Pearl River delta, rose 45 per cent in 1993 - but on a longer-term view, it has increased by only 2 per cent from July 1992 up to the end of last year. Direct investment funds, most of which allow a small percentage to be invested in equities, have generally fared worse. Their time horizons are clearly longer, but the results must have tested the most patient of fund managers. China Assets, the first fund entirely oriented towards direct investment, languished last night at a 44 per cent discount to the USDollars 1.10 price of its pre-listing placement in early 1992. It is these direct investment funds which have caught the imagination of the institutions, and the past six months have seen offerings from corporations ranging from Hong Kong listed China investor New World Development, to massive mainland corporations such as China Merchants and China's aerospace ministry. The allure is undeniable. China has been the most dynamic of the emerging markets over the past decade, and direct investment funds enable investors to buy on p/e ratios of 4 or 5 into companies which can be listed in China and Hong Kong on double-digit p/e's. In addition, the China investments become foreign joint ventures and gain immediate and substantial tax advantages, and access to bank funding (which has become almost impossible for mainland companies). The realities, however, may be harsher. Mr John Bolsover, chief executive of Baring Asset Management, said: 'It is impossible to underestimate what is happening in China, but it is going to remain very tough for direct investment.' Baring manages the UK-listed China &amp; Eastern Fund, which was launched in 1985 and had a mandate to invest up to 25 per cent of its assets in China-related venture capital situations. Eighteen months ago it gave up direct investment because failures significantly out-numbered successes. Baring decided the fledgling Chinese equity markets offered a more viable alternative. One London-based fund manager said: 'In China, they didn't really understand what we wanted to do, the infrastructure was bad, and the country had its fair share of crooks. It just wasn't worth it.' Even with mainland connections, it can be difficult. China Assets, managed primarily by one of China's leading investment groups, China Venturetech, got off to a troubled start. One of its first investments, a USDollars 6m stake in Chinese computer manufacturer Evertech Holdings, was entirely written off within a year of purchase. With many economists predicting a return to austerity in China, it could get tougher. At the other end of the scale, the large Chinese corporations can undoubtedly offer deals, but there are question marks over their ability to evaluate investments objectively. There is the further complexity of how to exit from the deal. There are stock markets in China, but listing queues are growing and precedence is based less on quality than on the whims of the authorities. It is likely that some direct investment funds will be highly successful. Guangdong Development Fund has got around two standard problems of other funds - lack of deals and the lag between raising cash and investing it - by lining up an influential partner (the Guangdong provincial government) and a number of deals ready to be injected into the fund. These range from a toll bridge to a malting plant and power station. But the risks remain. One Hong Kong-based fund manager related how a fund bought a stake in a pate de foie gras farm in southern China. After purchasing the business, the investors discovered that there were no facilities for producing pate, and they were left with no more than a gaggle of geese. For every winner, there will be many more investments that fail to produce golden eggs.</p>

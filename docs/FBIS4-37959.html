			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, 27 Jun (MENA) -- A Yemeni military source in  Aden has stated that the northern forces resumed their attempts  early this morning to advance toward Aden using every kind of  weapon, including aircraft, and backed by fresh reinforcements  brought to the various fronts. This large-scale attack on Aden  took place a few hours after Sanaa made the sixth false  cease-fire declaration and was accompanied by fierce rocket,  artillery, and air bombardment against residential areas and  vital economic installations in Aden. Yesterday's bombardment,  which extended to schools, mosques, and kindergartens, left at  least 75 civilians dead, most of them children and women, and  over 150 others wounded.    The ADEN NEWS AGENCY said the armed forces defending Aden  repulsed the attack and inflicted heavy losses on the forces of  the ruling military regime in Sanaa. But this regime cares  about nothing. It does not care about the losses its forces are  suffering daily. It does not care about the hundreds, even  thousands, of innocent civilian victims who fall as a result of  its forces' indiscriminate shelling of Aden. It does not care  about the appeals made by the local, Arab, and international  public and the resolutions, appeals, and warnings of  international legitimacy and the leaders of the fraternal and  friendly countries, including the latest strong warning to the  Sanaa regime by the U.S. State Department.</p>

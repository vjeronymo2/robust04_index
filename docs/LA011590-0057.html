			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY VOICES SOCIAL SERVICES;  </P> <P> IF NOT IN YOUR BACK YARD OR MINE, WHOSE?;  </P> <P> CHARITY: THE NIMBY SYNDROME PERVADING OUR CITIES SERVES NO ONE. HUMAN RIGHTS  MUST SUPERSEDE PROPERTY RIGHTS.  </P> <P> When President Bush spoke eloquently about "a thousand points of light," he  credited private voluntary agencies with brightening our nation with their  commitment and service. And rightly so.  </P> <P> However, what he failed to mention, or perhaps is not aware of, is that today  many of the brightest, most needed and most effective of those points of light  often are not wanted in any community. The NIMBY (Not in My Back Yard) syndrome  is diminishing, if not destroying, the delivery of social services all over our  country.  </P> <P> Almost every city in Orange County has experienced an outcry from neighbors  when a social service agency has applied for the needed permit to open in their  neighborhood. Just a few recent examples:  </P> <P> * Fullerton has continued to deny the Orange County Department of Social  Services permission to open a welfare office branch, citing incompatible use.  </P> <P> * The Mental Health Assn. received a large grant from the state to open a  drop-in center for the mentally ill homeless. They looked all over the county  for more than a year to find a place that would accept them and found none.  They finally were welcomed at the YMCA in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> * Outcry from Costa Mesa residents caused a man and his son who wanted to open  a residential facility for recovering alcoholics to withdraw their request.  </P> <P> * The Assistance League was prevented from enlarging its day-care center  because of neighbors' concerns.  </P> <P> * Orangetree neighbors in Irvine came out in force against a proposed shelter's  opening near their tract, even saying they feared the homeless would come into  their yards and use their barbecue pits.  </P> <P> * Huntington Beach citizens stormed City Hall protesting the opening of a small  drug counseling center.  </P> <P> * La Habra residents objected to a low-income day-care center, saying they  didn't want those children in their neighborhood.  </P> <P> * Costa Mesa severed a warm 20-year relationship with Share Our Selves and will  be forcing it out of Rea Center because of neighbors' complaints.  </P> <P> * Episcopal Service Alliance received a bomb threat when it opened a small  drop-in center for the homeless in a South County shopping center.  </P> <P> * Santa Ana is attempting to curtail feeding the homeless by proposing  ordinances to make it almost impossible for private agencies to comply.  </P> <P> The most publicized recent example of the NIMBY syndrome destroying a needed  project was Nancy Reagan's withdrawal of her sponsorship of Phoenix House for  youthful drug abusers when the neighbors just said no. More than $1 million had  already been raised.  </P> <P> NIMBY is a most formidable opponent because unless you live near an SOS or a  Phoenix, those who do live there taunt you with, "Would you want it in your  neighborhood?" Unless we can at least say, "I don't want it, but I will accept  it," we really can't point fingers at anyone else.  </P> <P> And the sad thing is that most agree that these programs are desperately needed  and that the services are provided much more effectively by private agencies --  as long as they are not here, near me. We've got to ask ourselves, "If not  here, where?"  </P> <P> Homeowners say not in a residential area; business owners say not in a  commercial or industrial area. Churches have been the most welcoming as a haven  for social service programs, but their facilities usually are very limited and  are already strained with their normal activities. So what is the solution'?  First of all, we need a change of heart and a change of values. We need to be  willing to try to know and understand others who are different from us so we  won't fear them and see them as "undesirables." And human rights need to be on  a par with property rights in our value system.  </P> <P> We can dream of this utopia where everyone is welcome and there are no  undesirables and agencies are given wholehearted support. And we can exhort  with Elizabeth Ann Seton to "live more simply so that others may simply live."  But reality creeps in, and we know, as imperfect as we are, this will probably  rarely happen unless there is a forcing function.  </P> <P> It has been suggested that what is needed is a state requirement that every  city or local jurisdiction set aside areas with a special social service  zoning, so that not only is there required space in every city, but de facto  acceptance of these needed programs without a divisive public hearing and  approval process.  </P> <P> It would be nice to believe that we would all be willing to have these programs  in our back yard, and with the right political leadership and moral climate, it  could well happen. But until that time, we may need a state law requiring us to  do so.  </P> <P> Social service agencies have been accused of being magnets drawing  "undesirables" into neighborhoods. Eliminating the helping agencies will not  make the poor, the homeless, the immigrant, the mentally ill, the alcoholic,  the developmentally disabled and the brain-damaged disappear. It will only make  them suffer more.  </P></p>

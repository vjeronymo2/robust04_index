			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Government of UK is out of the loop Sir, Your article, 'France ponders superhighway gamble' (October 27), raises important issues which need to be addressed in this country. France Telecom's reluctance to accept the central financial role recommended in Mr Thery's report is in direct contrast to the position of British Telecom, which is one of the leading players in the information superhighway dialogue in the UK and has already made a commitment to a Pounds 15bn investment in the infra-structure. The technology, the financial means and, crucially, the vision to develop a UK plc information superhighway exist, but our main obstacle is the government's lack of a strategic policy. As stated in the trade and industry committee's report on optical fibre networks, published in July: 'There appears to be little sense of urgency and a lack of a clear sense of vision about what broadband communications could do for the UK and its people.' We need urgent action to address the implications of the developing global information infrastructure and the role of the private sector in this process. Removal of the asymmetry principle is one example of what is needed. The telecommunications industry waits for no person. Labour recognises that government has a crucial responsibility in propelling UK plc into the lead in the development of a European and global information infrastructure. At the moment it's on everyone's agenda except this government's. Judith Church, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

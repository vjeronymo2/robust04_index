			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Ulster TV plans move into cable Ulster Television is planning to apply for a licence to cable Belfast and its surrounding area 10 years after the ITV company first became interested in cable television. Then UTV was in a consortium that included British Telecom and STC but nothing came of the venture. Mr Desmond Smyth, chief executive, said yesterday he believed the time was now right for cable and the company was in preliminary talks with Mercury Communications. The Independent Television Commission is expected to advertise a local delivery licence (cable) for Belfast later this year. Mr Smyth said he was convinced that investing in a cable and telephony consortium was a far better investment than taking over another small ITV company. He was speaking as the company announced a record pre-tax profit of Pounds 5.07m for 1993, its first year of the new ITV licences. The figure compared with Pounds 4.18m last time. Mr John McGuckian, chairman, described the result as outstanding although the figure was made up of operating profit of Pounds 3.47m (Pounds 2.85m) and investment income of Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.33m). Direct comparison is difficult, however, because of the changes, including the cash bid of Pounds 1.03m a year for the licence and a new basis payment for network programmes. Turnover was lower at Pounds 27.9m (Pounds 28.8m). Earnings per share were 31.78p (24.2p) and a higher proposed final dividend of 8.75p (5.75p) making an increased total for the year up from 10p to 15p. Mr McGuckian said that in the first quarter of this year the share of ITV advertising has continued to rise although it was too early to say whether this would be sustained throughout the year. The shares rose 6p on the day to close at 667p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Representatives of the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) visited Burmese refugee camps  in Tak yesterday as part of a plan to repatriate 60,000 Burmese  nationals from 13 refugee camps.    The vice chairman of the Karen Refugee Committee guided  UNHCR's Ruprecht Arnim and three other representatives on a tour  of two refugee camps at Ban Huai Kralok in Mae Sot and Maokoe in  Ban Phopphra.    At the Huai Kralok camp, Mr Arnim told the refugees the  UNHCR  was considering a repatriation programme for the 60,000 Burmese  nationals living in Thailand.    He said his visit was to study the living conditions of the  refugees, conditions he described as abnormal.    "The UNHCR is trying to work out a coordinated plan with  Thai  and Burmese officials to facilitate this `homecoming' and in  seeking a permanent solution to the refugees' problems," he said.    Mr Arnim also said a central committee to supervise the  repatriation would have to be created to guarantee the returning  Burmese would not be harmed or come under undue pressure from  the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC).    This group of UNHCR representatives has been in Thailand on  a  National Security Command-approved mission since June 12. They  are to visit refugees camps in Chiang Mai, Mae Hong Son and Tak.    The group will meet with Third Army officials in Phitsanulok  today.    The Third Army Task Force 34 Coordinator in Mae Sot, Col  Phongsak Suksawat, said both Thailand and Burma had already  started repatriation talks at the Thai-Burmese Border Committee  level last month. The talks were headed by First Army commander  Lt-Gen Chettha Thanacharo and Burmese South Eastern Force  commander Maj-Gen Khet Sein.    Col Phongsak said the committee assigned local Thai and  Burmese officials to consider the repatriation of the 60,000  Burmese refugees from the 13 camps along the border.    The majority of the refugees are Karen who escaped Burma  from  the area under Karen National Union [KNU] control during the May  16 SLORC drive against the KNU.    The Task Force coordinator said there was no longer fighting  along the Tak border.    "SLORC and the KNU have agreed to formal peace talks," he  said.    He also said 3,000 Karens had been repatriated safely and  had  been living without disturbance from SLORC for over a month.</p>

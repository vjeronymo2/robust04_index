			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Observer: Handbag carriers As Lady Thatcher's victims bite back, former minister Alan Clark duly pitches in with his own review of that book. But his contribution, in the Sunday Telegraph, is informed with a degree of bile that derives from another source. Laying into this 'global package . . . that is gonna be marketed', he senses an act of 'literary and historic vandalism', before concluding that 'the book is incomplete: and somewhat polluted by the attentions of hacks'. This particular Thatcher-worshipper's frustrations are not entirely what they might seem, for turning to his own Diaries, one finds that Clark himself auditioned for the part of biographer. In an audience with the Lady, he is told first of all she wants him to do the book 'because you are a believer'. He makes a play not for memoirs, scripted by a ghost, but for the Official Biography by himself. Quickly realising that he has queered his pitch, he goes on to console himself with the fact that she is, wrongheadedly in his view, anyway sold on the 'autobiographical' approach to tell her story. And what does New Republic editor John O'Sullivan, one of the chosen ghosts, think of Clark's verdict? 'No valet is a hero, especially to another valet,' he snapped, far from inanimately, out of New York yesterday.</p>

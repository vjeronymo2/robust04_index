			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Serco set to acquire BT's Aeradio offshoot SERCO, the fast-growing facilities management group, appears to be close to acquiring International Aeradio Limited (IAL), British Telecommunications' airport and hospital maintenance subsidiary. Mr David Perkins, Serco's finance director, said yesterday the situation 'still is an investigation at this stage and by no means final'. He described suggestions that Serco would pay between Pounds 10m and Pounds 15m for IAL as a 'market rumour'. Earlier this week BT said that nothing active was happening with IAL. But the telecommunications group admitted that the subsidiary, acquired in 1986, did not fit its corporate strategy of running telecommunications networks. IAL staff were originally told that a sale would be completed by the end of January. They now understand that it could be finalised later this month. Serco raised Pounds 9.7m in a rights issue last November. One of its stated reasons for the issue was 'to develop through suitable acquisitions', specifically mentioning aviation services as a possibility. BT bought IAL from STC, the electronics group, as part of its original post-privatisation strategy. It is understood that BT was originally hoping to sell IAL for Pounds 30m, but had to lower the price because bidders apart from Serco dropped out. At one stage Thomson CSF, the French defence group, looked like the front runner. IAL's turnover is thought to be about Pounds 50m following BT's decision to integrate some of its activities with its main business. At its peak, IAL was thought to have had turnover of about Pounds 100m.</p>

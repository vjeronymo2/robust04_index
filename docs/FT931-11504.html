			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: YRM incurs deficit of Pounds 498,000 YRM, the architectural group, yesterday announced a pre-tax loss and a cut in the interim dividend in line with its warning in November. For the six months to October 31 the pre-tax deficit was Pounds 498,000 on turnover of Pounds 7.89m, compared with a profit of Pounds 534,000 on sales of Pounds 10.2m. The interim dividend is 0.5p (1.65p) - the directors, who control 47 per cent of the shares, have waived their entitlement reducing the cost to Pounds 35,000 (Pounds 218,000). Losses per share worked through at 2.78p (earnings 2.54p). Mr Tim Poulson, chief executive, blamed fierce competition in a much reduced construction market for the setback. This had led to a sharp reduction in the level of architects fees, damaging margins. Losses included redundancy costs of Pounds 282,000 (Pounds 337,000); the labour force during the past three years has been halved to 300. Mr Poulson said the savings in overheads, together with rents from surplus office space which had been sub-let, should put the group back in profit in the second half. Even so, analysts expect losses for the year to be about Pounds 400,000. Mr Poulson said the group still hoped to pay a final dividend but would not make a decision until nearer the time. Last year the final was cut from 3.35p to 2.35p, reducing the total from 5p to 4p. The group saw little prospect of an improvement in the UK during the next 12 months. It said British clients had been slow to commission work in the first half. A number of projects which were expected to start had been delayed although some were now proceeding. Reduction in UK commissions had been offset partially by a rise in overseas work. International commissions during the first half were almost equivalent to those won during the whole of the previous 12 months. The Paris office, opened only two years ago, had won commissions from Air France and the French government. The Berlin office, started last year, had secured its first substantial commission for the refurbishment of 13 hotels in eastern Germany. Net debt at the end of October was Pounds 1.4m, equivalent to 15 per cent of shareholders funds. Gearing was expected to remain at that level at the year-end, said Mr Poulson.</p>

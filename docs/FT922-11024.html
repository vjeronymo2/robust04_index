			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / ILO fears 10m jobless in Russia this year UNEMPLOYMENT in Russia is likely to rise to 10m-11m by the end of this year, according to the first results of a study of Russian manufacturing industries by the International Labour Organisation, one of the arms of the UN. Other foreign experts in Moscow think the ILO estimates too high although they see unemployment rising sharply, to as high as 6m by the end of December. They believe enterprises will lay off workers less rapidly than the ILO thinks, and that the government will continue to subsidise enterprises in various ways to avoid unemployment. Officially, more than 100,000 are unemployed in Russia, although Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, has also talked of about 6m by the end of the year. The study covers more than 500 plants in all manufacturing sectors in Moscow and St Petersburg and their surrounding regions. The ILO team has been researching changes on the shopfloor since December. Mr Guy Standing, leader of the team, said that in spite of strenuous government efforts, unemployment provision, social security benefits, training programmes and labour market policies were rudimentary - hampered by lack of cash, expertise and data. Enterprises have preferred to pile up debts to each other and to banks rather than lay off workers. Even defence plants, seen as among the most vulnerable because of the sharp cut in allocations to defence equipment, have continued to produce, even when uncertain of being paid. However, Mr Standing said the ILO survey showed that: Unemployment in the survey group had risen by about 9 per cent in 1991. Many workers had not registered as unemployed partly because they were guaranteed three months severance pay and partly because well below 20 per cent actually received the small amount of unemployment benefit available. Unemployment had already hit the most vulnerable and lowly paid, such as women (who make up 40 per cent of the manufacturing labour force) and the handicapped. Managers were laying off clerical white-collar staff, and technicians and specialists - many with higher education - while skilled manual workers were still in demand. Wages had risen strongly in the manufacturing sector, though, in many instances, managers and workers colluded in avoiding the high wages tax of last year (since reduced) by paying workers wages in kind - usually in food supplies. Though there are signs of more market-orientated behaviour, there was still no clear relation between falling sales and reductions in staff. Rouble fund, Page 6</p>

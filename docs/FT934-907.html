			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Gaidar's Russia - the dangers inherent in 'shock therapy' Sir, We note with interest your description of Yegor Gaidar's 'Russia's Choice' party as 'the voice of reason' ('Gaidar calls for anti-fascist front', December 14). In the aftermath of the elections Gaidar is certainly correct to draw a parallel between the strong showing of neo-fascists and developments in Weimar Germany. Many Russians believe, however, that Gaidar's draconian reforms represent an 'economic Versailles'. Under strong pressure from the west, the Yeltsin government has made deep cuts in the state budget and in subsidies to heavy industry as well as to consumers. These cuts have contributed to the impoverishment of millions, and the crippling of the welfare state, including the virtual collapse of health services. Some of the consequences of these policies were cited in a recent report, The Distributional Consequences of Russia's Transition, by Dr Chris Doyle, reported by the FT ('Pay gaps threaten to split Russia', October 14). Between 1985 and 1991-92, real household wealth declined by 86 per cent and incomes plunged by up to one-half. Many pensioners have seen their incomes reduced to half of the official 'physiological minimum'. Privatisation is not leading to a dispersion of income or wealth, but rather to the 'concentration of ownership into a few powerful institutions', such as pension funds and conglomerates. The message widely disseminated in the media and by influential economists is that although these policies are regrettable, no other strategy can secure a democratic transition from state planning to markets. Yet this assumption runs counter to historical experience. After the second world war, the economies of western Europe and Japan were gradually opened up thanks to generous aid, state controls designed to maintain production and employment; protectionism; and redistributive measures. These policies were rightly seen not as impediments to fledgling market democracies, but as essential components of them. The losers of the cold war have been subject to harsher treatment. Economic reform is surely a prerequisite of democracy, but only if it is acceptable to the Russian people. The resort to 'shock therapy' as a means of social engineering is no less dogmatic, and no less antithetical to democracy, than the blind faith of Soviet commissars in the state to which it bears more than a passing resemblance. The election results should encourage the west to reconsider its policies towards the east as well as to the institutional realities of economic success in the west.

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Stonehenge 'a national disgrace' THE government's stewardship of Britain's historic buildings and monuments was last night slammed by an influential committee of MPs which warned that up to 2,400 of the finest examples were at risk. The MPs of the Commons public accounts committee said that the position at Stonehenge, a site of national and international significance, could only be described as a 'disgrace'. The committee's report directs its fire at the National Heritage Department and English Heritage, the main government-sponsored body responsible for preserving listed buildings and national monuments. It acknowledges that both have announced plans to greatly improve their stewardship. But it adds: 'We are concerned that the physical condition of up to 2,400 properties in the highest Grade I and Grade II categories could be at risk.' In a blunt warning the MPs add: 'We expect the department and English Heritage to establish the full extent of the risk to such properties and the priorities for repair and preservation as the basis for an action plan to remedy the position as soon as possible.' Turning to the 'national disgrace' of Stonehenge, the report says that English Heritage had acknowledged all the public criticism of the condition of the site. It was seeking more money from the government to implement improvements. More generally it talks of 'protracted delay and indecision' in the improvement of heritage records, a seven-year slippage in the target date for the listing of all monuments, and the absence of any clear action plan to preserve the heritage they represent. The MPs say that the National Heritage Department must ensure that individual properties are only transferred into public ownership if sufficient funds are guaranteed for their future care. At the same time local authorities and government needed to be much more vigorous in enforcing repairs on listed buildings in private ownership.</p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Exxon in Nigeria deal EXXON said yesterday its affiliate, Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria, had signed a production-sharing and exploratory rights agreement with Nigerian National Petroleum, Reuter reports from Irving, Texas. The US oil giant said it has the right to explore and operate Block 209, a 500,000-acre tract 47 miles off the Nigerian coast. It planned to open an office in Nigeria. On Tuesday Nigeria signed an oil exploration and production-sharing contract with the alliance between BP and Statoil of Norway. It was the third agreement in a month with a foreign oil group to take all the risks in developing new fields since shortage of cash forced the government to stop taking majority stakes in exploration joint ventures.</p>

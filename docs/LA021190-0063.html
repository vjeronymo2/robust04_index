			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALATHION CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> Why the need to protect the agricultural business of Southern California with  malathion spraying? The land developers of Southern California have already  launched their own Medfly assault, and it is clean and profitable.  </P> <P> They simply bulldoze thousands of acres of producing orchards for future  transportation corridors and housing developments. You don't need an MBA degree  to figure out that the law of supply and demand will raise fruit prices, not  the Medfly. The less fruit produced per capita in California will result in  increased imports. So why the fuss?  </P> <P> MARY SCHWARTZ  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

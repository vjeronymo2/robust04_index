			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Life insurance Yesterday's new business figures from Prudential seemed scant justification for shaving 2p off the shares. The tone of the stock market, after all, was generally firm and the pattern of healthy single premium sales and static annual premium growth from the Pru was much as expected. A more plausible explanation is that investors remain bothered by the possibility of a Labour government, a factor which has already contributed to the life sector's underperformance this year. There are several concerns here, notably that the lucrative personal pension contracts which account for 45 per cent of the Pru's new UK business, and more than 50 per cent of Legal and General's, will be badly hit. Labour is clearly committed to beefing up the state earnings related pensions scheme (serps), and to limiting the tax relief on pension contributions (presumably to the basic rate). It is also likely to require better guarantees for those opting out, something which is unlikely to appeal to pension providers. The market's reaction is nevertheless curious because most of this has been known for months and the polls are still inconclusive. There would also be some pluses with Mr Kinnock at Number 10. A Labour government would probably introduce a more complex tax system - thereby creating opportunities to sell some sophisticated new products - while a wider spread of disposable income might spur sales of standard policies. In the short term, however, the sector may find it hard to shake off the tag of political risk.</p>

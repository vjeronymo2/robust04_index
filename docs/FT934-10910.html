			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / On opposite sides of the great divide Marcy Kaptur from Ohio and Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma might seem prototypical Clinton new Democrats, write Nancy Dunne and Jurek Martin. She is 47, the same age as the president, a House member since 1982, while he is 43, and from the class of 1980; like the president both studied at British universities, she doing town planning at Manchester, he economics at Edinburgh; she is from a union district, he from a union family; and both are ambitious: she has her eye on the Senate next year, while he has already considered running for the presidency and last year promoted himself for a post in the Clinton cabinet. Yet Nafta divides them absolutely. Ms Kaptur, a leader of the opposition, regrets having to fight Mr Clinton. 'It would have been nice after 10 years here to have had a Democratic president who agreed with me on the most important issue in my district. Nafta, though, is a life and death issue to us,' she says, citing the job losses in her Toledo constituency. She is proud of being a liberal and resents being called a protectionist. 'Trade can bring freedom,' she argues, 'but it can also bring exploitation. If people do not have fair wages, free elections, rights of assembly, a judicial system with fair trials, you have exploitation - and we will be a party to it.' She sees nothing wrong with hemispheric free trade, so long as it is linked to democratic reforms. Her criticism of Mexico goes far beyond its democratic shortcomings. On two recent visits she was shocked by what she saw. 'They have no running water, no heat in winter, no electricity unless they have batteries.' Once, she says, Mexican government agents trailed a delegation of congresswomen on a tour south of the border and nearly ran one of them down. To Dave McCurdy, a border state moderate like Mr Clinton, the Nafta debate is all about the past (ageing, uncompetitive industries) versus the future (a high-skilled, high-wage economy). 'The problem is that the protectionists, isolationists and xenophobes who are building the case against it are really basing it on fear of change and the unknown.' Combative by nature, he was sufficiently unafraid in September to raid the home turf of the Nafta opposition - a local General Motors plant - to hand out leaflets. 'The management loved it. I'm not sure the workers did, but they'd been getting their information only from one side.' Ross Perot ran strongly in his district last year. He has travelled a lot to South America, where he sees democracy taking roots, 'though some of the sprouts are fragile'. He is impressed by changes in Mexico. 'Ten years ago it was an anti-US command economy, socialist in nature.' President Carlos Salinas 'has taken on the old system with a great deal of courage. He deserves to be rewarded for that.' He understands why some fellow Democrats find it hard to support Nafta, especially after the great budget battle this summer. 'Some caught a lot of grief back home and they're tired of explaining tough votes. But there are a few of us who are committed to these free trade principles.'</p>

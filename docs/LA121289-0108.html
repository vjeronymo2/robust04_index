			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TROUBLE BLOWS IN ON 100-M.P.H. SANTA ANAS  </P> <P> Chill, dry Santa Ana winds howled down Southern California's mountain passes  and canyons at speeds of up to 100 m.p.h. Monday, toppling trucks, shredding  Christmas decorations and kicking up dust storms that triggered traffic  accidents and forced the temporary closure of three freeways.  </P> <P> In addition, power was knocked out to thousands of residential and business  customers in widely scattered areas, and arcing power lines, downed by the  hurricane-force gusts, ignited several small brush fires.  </P> <P> The flames were quickly extinguished, but officials said the winds, generated  by a vast complex of weather systems over the Rockies, were parching the  already dry Los Angeles Basin, increasing the danger of additional fires.  </P> <P> The powerful winds prompted the Orange County Fire Department to call a "red  flag alert," an extra high state of readiness to protect against the threat of  wind-whipped fires. But department spokeswoman Kathleen Cha said that  firefighters handled only a few brush fires. At nightfall, firefighters had  contained most of a four-acre blaze that had started Monday afternoon on Bonita  Canyon Drive in Sunny Hills.  </P> <P> While most of the wind damage was confined to San Bernardino, Riverside and  Orange counties Monday morning, forecasters said the Santa Anas should begin  moving into the Los Angeles area before dawn today.  </P> <P> The winds are threatening the second Medfly pesticide spraying in Orange County  history, scheduled for tonight at 9 p.m. over an 11-square-mile area that  includes parts of La Habra, Brea and Fullerton. State agriculture officials  said they may not be able to spray if the winds exceed 5 m.p.h., for fear of  spreading the pesticide mix beyond the target area.  </P> <P> But meteorologists were optimistic that the winds wouldn't interfere with the  aerial spraying. Sunny skies and temperatures ranging from the mid-60s to  mid-70s have been forecast for today.  </P> <P> The strongest winds reported Monday were gusts of 100 m.p.h. near the Grapevine  in southern Kern County, 85 m.p.h near Devore at the base of Cajon Pass, and 80  m.p.h. on the hilltops above Point Mugu in Ventura County.  </P> <P> As is often the case with Santa Anas, communities below the Cajon Pass in the  San Bernardino area were among the hardest hit Monday, with portions of three  freeways there closed by opaque clouds of wind-whipped dust and sand.  </P> <P> "The traffic is heavy; the visibility is poor and down to zero in some  stretches," California Highway Patrol Officer Marty Bell reported Monday  morning from San Bernardino. "It's best to just stay out of the area altogether  if possible."  </P> <P> The winds prevented about 60 sixth-graders at Trabuco Elementary School from  venturing on a weeklong trip to the Arbolado Science Camp in the San Bernardino  Mountains. School officials canceled the trip after CHP officers warned that it  would be dangerous to travel in buses to the camp, which is located at the  6,500-foot level. The 6th-grade class will try again today.  </P> <P> By noon, at least four big rigs, a number of travel trailers and several  motorcycles had been blown over by the heavy winds, most of them on California  60 and Interstate 15, east of Ontario.  </P> <P> No serious injuries were reported, but one unidentified driver was scraped and  bruised when the winds toppled his truck.  </P> <P> A CHP officer said the back window of his patrol car was blown out by a strong  gust. Several motorists took refuge on the lee side of embankments and  overpasses to wait out the fiercest of the winds.  </P> <P> "It was blowing like mad," said John Anderson, a CHP spokesman in Riverside.  "And the dust. Whew! What a mess. A lot of people were just waiting out the  storm."  </P> <P> Anderson said one travel trailer was ripped from the pickup truck towing it and  tossed over the guardrail of an overpass above California 60, east of Ontario.  He said the driver "probably got to Indio, looked in his rear-view mirror and  then wondered where that son of a gun was."  </P> <P> A section of Interstate 10 near Ontario International Airport also was closed  for a time, but the airport was able to maintain normal flight operations.  </P> <P> At John Wayne Airport, gusts were clocked at up to 35 m.p.h., forcing aircraft  to take off in an inland direction rather than over the ocean.  </P> <P> The CHP reported no wind-related troubles on most Orange County highways. Dust  storms, however, limited visibility to about a mile on the Riverside Freeway in  Anaheim.  </P> <P> Outdoor Christmas decorations took a beating, especially in western San  Bernardino County, and trees blew over at Christmas tree lots throughout the  Southland.  </P> <P> The gusts churned up waves during some unusually high tides along the coast.  Several stretches of Pacific Coast Highway in Orange County were sporadically  awash with seawater Monday morning. Forecasters said similar conditions could  occur today.  </P> <P> Power lines were downed across a broad swath of the Southland, knocking out  service to at least 16,000 homes and businesses in Orange County and causing  scattered outages in other areas.  </P> <P> Southern California Edison Co. crews were kept busy restoring electrical  service during the morning. Edison spokesman Steve Nelson said most of the  outages were momentary, although some areas were without power for considerably  longer periods.  </P> <P> Downed lines started several small brush fires that were quickly brought under  control in the Glen Avon area of Riverside County.  </P> <P> But fire officials said the low humidity that accompanied the arid Santa Ana  winds was drying out the already-parched chaparral in the foothills and was  threatening to whip any blazes that started into major fires.  </P> <P> Rick Dittmann, a meteorologist with WeatherData, said the strong winds resulted  from the interaction of two major weather systems over the Rockies.  </P> <P> The first system, a cold and vigorous high-level storm system, pulled a strong  and arid high-pressure system in behind it, Dittmann said, generating a chilly  stream of dry, down-slope winds that rapidly invaded Southern California.  </P> <P> Orange County escaped the hurricane-force winds because "the surface low  pressure area was not far enough south and west," he explained.  </P> <P> Temperatures and humidity dropped as the winds rattled into the Southland.  </P> <P> Thermometer readings in the chilly mid-40s were common Monday morning, with a  low at the Los Angeles Civic Center of 47 degrees. The humidity in downtown Los  Angeles dropped from a high of 86% to a low of just 16%.  </P> <P> National Weather Service meteorologists said they expect the high-pressure  system to stay in place long enough for a resumption of strong winds before  dawn that will not ease until sometime this afternoon.  </P> <P> WeatherData meteorologists said they expect the high pressure to begin moving  east a little sooner, with lesser winds diminishing earlier.  </P> <P> Forecasters agreed that today's high temperatures should be mostly in the 70s.  </P> <P> Warren reported from the Riverside-San Bernardino area; Malnic reported from  Los Angeles. Times staff writers Davan Maharaj, Chris Woodyard and Ted Johnson  contributed from Orange County and Carol McGraw from Los Angeles.  </P></p>

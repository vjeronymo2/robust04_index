			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S. AFRICA GIVEN ANC ULTIMATUM;  </P> <P> APARTHEID: GUERRILLA WAR COULD BE RESUMED IF ALL OBSTACLES TO NEGOTIATIONS ARE  NOT REMOVED, THE DELEGATES WARN. MANDELA'S DEALINGS WITH THE REGIME ARE  CRITICIZED.  </P> <P> The African National Congress' first consultative conference in 31 years  concluded Sunday with a militant ultimatum to the government: remove all  obstacles to negotiations by the end of April or the ANC will consider  suspending talks and resuming its guerrilla war.  </P> <P> The hard-line ANC attitude was further reflected in the revelation that Deputy  President Nelson Mandela and other ANC leaders had been sharply criticized  during closed sessions of the three-day meeting for their conduct during talks  with the government thus far.  </P> <P> Mandela himself mentioned the criticism in his closing address to the 1,600  delegates, many of whom are clearly uneasy talking to a government that, in  their view, wants to maintain white domination of the black majority.  </P> <P> Mandela told delegates he welcomed the frank evaluation of the ANC leaders'  failings, but he also strongly defended his confidential discussions with the  government, his reference to President Frederik W. de Klerk as "a man of  integrity" and his contacts with leaders of the nominally independent black  homelands.  </P> <P> However, Mandela added, the ANC's ability to raise its complaints with the  leadership had been a healthy step for the once-revolutionary movement, which  has been legal in South Africa for only 10 months.  </P> <P> "We have emerged from this congress stronger than we were before," Mandela said  to loud applause.  </P> <P> For several months, militant ANC members have expressed private concern that  the 72-year-old Mandela, the leader of talks with the government, has been  unaware of the growing distrust of the Pretoria government among rank-and-file  members.  </P> <P> Several resolutions passed by the conference over the weekend contained  specific demands that the ANC's 37-member national executive committee consult  more closely with members nationwide. And the conference resolutions indicated  a militancy that surprised many political analysts.  </P> <P> On Saturday, the ANC flatly rejected a proposal, advanced by the influential  foreign affairs chief, Thabo Mbeki, that it draw up a plan for a phased removal  of sanctions against Pretoria, even as worldwide sanctions are beginning to  crumble. Mbeki said Sunday that the proposal is still being studied, however.  </P> <P> Although the ANC decided to proceed with "talks about talks" with the  government, it expressed dissatisfaction with the government's pace of reform  and said the government must clear away several obstacles before formal  constitutional negotiations can begin. The government has said it hopes to  launch those negotiations early next year.  </P> <P> Among the obstacles cited by the ANC were the release of all political  prisoners, the return of exiles, the repeal of repressive legislation and the  end of political trials. The government agreed in August to begin granting  amnesty for prisoners and exiles, but the process has been slowed by delays and  administrative difficulties on both sides.  </P> <P> "It was the clear view of the conference that in order to get the negotiation  process going, much, much more has to be done (by the government)," said Joe  Slovo, a leading figure on the ANC executive. "Until those steps are taken, we  don't see a prospect of beginning proper negotiations."  </P> <P> The ANC also decided to launch a campaign of protests, marches and other forms  of mass action to pressure De Klerk to remove those obstacles and end black  factional fighting, which has claimed more than 3,000 lives in South African  townships this year. The ANC claims the township violence is being orchestrated  by government agencies, including the security forces, in an attempt to  undermine support for the ANC.  </P> <P> "Our patience with this regime is running out," the conference said in its  closing declaration. "The regime has its own agenda, that of retaining white  domination in a new form. It is violating and distorting all its undertakings  to the ANC and the people."  </P> <P> The conference added that the ANC's military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of  the Nation), "must play a facilitative role in the defense of our people."  </P> <P> "Our people are being butchered in their homes," said Joe Modise, the Umkhonto  we Sizwe commander. "And it is the legitimate right of the people to defend  themselves."  </P> <P> The ANC agreed in August to suspend its armed struggle against Pretoria, but  the two sides have yet to agree on terms of dismantling of the ANC's  underground guerrilla forces.  </P> <P> In a rare public assessment of the ANC's internal difficulties, Mandela  admitted that the organization has been slow to establish links of  communication between the leaders and its 300,000 members across the country.  However, he added that "we are really now at the stage that we feel confident  we are in physical contact with our people."  </P> <P> Mandela also responded in detail to delegates' criticisms of his handling of  talks with the government. He said suggestions that the ANC halt all  confidential discussions with the government "are totally unreasonable."  </P> <P> "There would have been no . . . future prospect of negotiations if there were  no confidential meetings between the ANC and the government," he said. He added  that having confidential talks "does not mean we are compromising our  position."  </P> <P> Mandela rejected a suggestion that ANC leaders take no actions without  consulting the members, saying such a proposal could "only be made by people  who have no idea of the problems that face the leadership on the ground." And  he cited half a dozen instances in which his personal calls to President De  Klerk or Cabinet members had resolved urgent problems facing ANC members.  </P> <P> Mandela also responded to criticism that he was wrong to refer to De Klerk, as  he often has, as "a man of integrity."  </P> <P> "The strategies of our organization are not determined by the integrity or  honesty of any particular individual," Mandela said. "Our strategy is guided by  the fact that De Klerk represents apartheid."  </P> <P> Some delegates had criticized ANC leaders for inviting chiefs of the black  homelands to join negotiations. Mandela defended that decision, saying that one  of the ways of isolating the government was "to get at people upon whom they  (the government) have relied for support of apartheid."  </P> <P> And Mandela noted that many African countries have been racked by civil wars  because the black governments refused to enter discussions with their enemies.  </P> <P> "I hope our (ANC) comrades would take account of such experiences and ensure  such tragedies don't befall us," Mandela said.  </P></p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / People (Names in the news): Abdul's golden investment The biggest golden handshake in Malaysian corporate history is being given to Abdul Khalid Ibrahim, the head of Permodalan Nasional (PNB), the national investment agency, writes Kieran Cooke. Abdul is leaving his post as head of PNB to become group chief executive of Kumpulan Guthrie, the plantations and property company which is 90 per cent PNB-owned. As a parting gift, Khalid has been allowed to buy 50m shares in Guthrie at the heavily discounted price of MDollars 2.50 (Dollars 0.97) compared with the present market price of around MDollars 4. The transaction gives the Khalid, 47, a 5 per cent stake in Guthrie and an immediate gain on paper of around MDollars 73m. He has also been given a three-year option to buy a further 15 per cent of Guthrie at a price to be determined. The deal has been given the thumbs-up by both Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, and Anwar Ibrahim, the finance minister. Market analysts are seeing it as a somewhat lavish reward for Khalid's achievements during his 16 years at PNB. In 1981 Khalid organised a MDollars 1bn 'dawn raid' on the London Stock Exchange, wresting control of Guthrie from its British shareholders. Khalid says he views his shareholding in Guthrie as a long-term investment and plans to turn the company into a corporation 'that will challenge multinationals in Malaysia and elsewhere'.</p>

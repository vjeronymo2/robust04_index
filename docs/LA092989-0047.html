			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NRA, ABORTION FOES PLAN LAST-DITCH SMEAR OPERATION, SAYS HUNTER  </P> <P> The Republican nominee in next week's 76th Assembly District election charged  Thursday that she was being targeted by a last-minute smear campaign funded by  the National Right to Life Committee and the National Rifle Assn.  </P> <P> Tricia Hunter said her office anonymously received a schedule of planned  last-minute hit pieces indicating the two national groups are spending a  combined total of $163,000 to send out 11 campaign pieces that would benefit  write-in candidate Dick Lyles, a more conservative Republican who placed second  to Hunter in October's primary. The election is Tuesday.  </P> <P> The purported schedule -- which listed the dates, nature and costs of the  mailings -- was typed beneath the letterhead of the National Right to Life  Committee. It listed 11 mailings scheduled to arrive in mailboxes in the  district beginning Wednesday and running through Monday. Beside a brief  description of the material was, in parentheses, the notation of either "NRA"  or "NRTL."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Heston Telegram Listed  </P> <P> Among the listings were a "(Charlton) Heston Telegram -- (NRTL)" scheduled to  be mailed today for delivery on Saturday.  </P> <P> Hunter's campaign staff said the first possible such piece arrived Thursday --  a letter from Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado). The purported schedule called  for a "Duncan Hunter Letter -- (NRA)." But there was no indication in the  letter that it came from, or was financed by, the NRA.  </P> <P> The letter chastised Republicans for nominating a "liberal" to represent the  party in the runoff. But it did not appear to be a political hit piece. Its  most stinging line, for instance, read: "By electing liberal candidates in  solidly conservative Republican districts, we are sending Republicans to the  Assembly who will side with groups like NOW (National Organization for Women)  and ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) in supporting predominantly Democrat  positions."  </P> <P> Lyles' campaign staff said it had no knowledge of that letter, which apparently  was addressed to (Republican) "Central Committee member." Duncan Hunter's  office could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Lyles, unlike Tricia Hunter, opposes abortion and gun control and already has  received some assistance from the two organizations. But Lyles said Thursday he  knows of no last-minute campaigning by the NRA and the National Right to Life  Committee on his behalf, and said he would be stunned if it materialized.  </P> <P> "This campaign has gotten its source of energy from people's prayers," Lyles  said. "If $163,000 were to be spent for me on the last weekend, I'd be the  first to proclaim that a miracle occurred. I can't imagine that it would  happen, but, if it does, we'll start planning the victory party right now."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Groups Deny Campaign  </P> <P> Political action advisers for both organizations, however, vehemently denied  any such last-minute campaign activity.  </P> <P> Richard Gardner, director of state and local affairs for the NRA in Washington,  said the powerful lobbying group, although already having contributed $10,000  to Lyles' candidacy, "absolutely is not involved" in any last-minute  campaigning on behalf of Lyles.  </P> <P> "We have sent letters to our members in the district endorsing Lyles, and  that's all we've done," Gardner said of a previous effort. "We have engaged in  no independent expenditure campaign and don't intend to and will not do so. We  have not, and will not -- and any decision would have been made by me and no  one else."  </P> <P> Spokesmen for the National Right to Life Committee said the organization  already spent $5,000 for a mailing that was sent out earlier this week to  selected voters, but planned no other action other than to ask supporters to  volunteer on Lyles' behalf.  </P> <P> "It sounds like a joke to me," said Janet Carroll, associate Western director  of the organization, after seeing the schedule. "It's our letterhead, all  right, but we'd never do anything in conjunction with another group, unless it  was another right-to-life organization. Someone has taken our letterhead and  put these mailings on it.  </P> <P> "If whoever put this out is claiming it came out of our office, that is the  smear. We'll send this to our attorneys."  </P> <P> Brad Mattes, assistant for political action for the organization, added:  </P> <P> "We don't have the kind of money to make those kinds of expenditures."  </P> <P> Hunter campaign aide Rob Lapsley said Thursday that his staff members first  "got a whiff" of the expected mailings Tuesday and confirmed it to their  satisfaction Wednesday when they received the purported schedule of the  mailings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hoping Groups Will 'Back Off'  </P> <P> "We're hoping that now that we know about it, they'll back off," he said.  </P> <P> Asked why opponents would deny -- or cancel -- a campaign mailing just because  the target of it learned of it beforehand, Lapsley said: "We don't know. We're  watching the mail very closely, though. The answer will be in the mail. But, if  you were doing a smear campaign, won't you deny it first and deal with it after  the election, rather than admit it beforehand?"  </P> <P> Hunter, citing the purported schedule, said, "It is obvious that these two  extremist groups are setting up a very expensive last-minute smear campaign  based entirely on personal attacks against me . . . not allowing me enough time  to provide the voters with a fair response."  </P> <P> October's primary election attracted national interest because it pitted  competing Republicans who were on different sides of the fence on the abortion  issue -- a critical matter, given the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in July that  gave states new powers to regulate abortions.  </P> <P> In that primary, Hunter defeated Lyles by a scant 197-vote margin, putting her  on the runoff ballot against Democrat Jeannine Correia, who, like Hunter, holds  a pro-choice stance on abortion.  </P> <P> Lyles, stung by the defeat when he had openly predicted victory, has since  mounted his write-in campaign to the consternation of Republicans who fear he  will take some of the Republican votes from Hunter and allow a Democrat to win  in the heavily Republican district, which runs from the South Bay into the  desert communities of Riverside County.  </P> <P> The election will fill the vacancy created by the death of Assemblyman Bill  Bradley (R-Escondido) last June.  </P></p>

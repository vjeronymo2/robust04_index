			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India signs palm oil deal with Malaysia INDIA HAS signed a memorandum of understanding with Malaysia covering the purchase of 300,000 tonnes of palm oil over the next two years. Last year it imported 160,000 tonnes, down from 1m tonnes five years ago. Malaysia fears a further fall this year with Indonesia emerging as a potential palm oil exporter and India trying to narrow the gap between production and consumption of edible oils. Good monsoon rains over the past fortnight brightened groundnut crop prospects in the western state of Gujarat, where output is estimated at 1.7m tonnes, more than treble last year's 500,000 tonnes. Dr Lim Keng Yaik, Malaysian minister of primary industries, who has been in India to promote palm oil exports, said India should barter its expensive edible oils for cheaper palm oil to boost exports and meet the edible oil needs of its poorer consumers. Malaysia's interest in India, despite falling exports, stems from the vastness of its market and the low level of edible oil consumption - 7 kg per head a year, half that in Malaysia.</p>

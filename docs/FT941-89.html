			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Acquisitions help Waterford Waterford Foods, Ireland's largest milk processor, has reported a 31 per cent increase in 1993 pre-tax profits to IPounds 24.5m (Pounds 23.7m) on turnover up 26 per cent to IPounds 694m. A significant part of the growth came from a full year's contribution - five months in 1992 - from the Express Foods Ireland and Premier Dairies acquisitions made in August 1992, and which have given the group a 35 per cent share of Ireland's liquid milk market. Mr Stephen O'Connor, group managing director, pointed out that there had also been an overall improvement in operating margins from 5.3 to 5.8 per cent, operating profits having grown 37 per cent to IPounds 39.9m. Interest charges rose to IPounds 12.6m (IPounds 9.7m), tax doubled to IPounds 2.1m (IPounds 900,000) and goodwill increased to IPounds 3.4m (Pounds 1.9m). About 39 per cent of the group's sales are in Ireland, 35 per cent in the UK, and 17 per cent in the US. The consumer products division - consisting of liquid milk, fresh dairy products and fruit juices - grew by 19 per cent to IPounds 281m. The dairy products division, which manufactures cheeses, butters, milk powders and food ingredients, grew by 37 per cent to IPounds 341m, accounting for 49 per cent of group sales. Animal feeds accounted for the remaining 10 per cent. Earnings per share advanced by 11 per cent to 11.1p (10.04p) and a final dividend of 1.64p is being recommended for a total of 2.83p (2.73p). COMMENT Waterford has positioned itself well for further rationalisation in the dairy industry on both sides of the Irish Sea. It has not diversified to the same extent as its peers in the Irish food sector though, making it more vulnerable to growing price pressures in the dairy products sector and in competing for its milk supplies. Pre-tax profits of IPounds 28m are realisable for 1994, giving an eps of 12p and a prospective p/e ratio of around 8. The market thus appears to have priced in the downside factors.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of Center Accord, </F> by Janina Paradowska and Mariusz Janicki; place and date not  given: "A Soft System"]    [Text] [POLITYKA] You are the author of one of the most  famous sayings in postcommunist Poland, that the shortest road  to the de-Christianization of Poland runs through the Christian  National Union [ZChN]. The Center Accord [PC] itself you built  up as rather an opposition to the ZChN. Today, the PC and the  ZChN are the core of a new confederation of the right, the  Alliance for Poland. How should one treat that alliance: as your  success, your defeat, or the closing of some chapter?    [Kaczynski] Before 19 September [date of most recent  parliamentary elections], I knew that, without an accord, the  right would meet defeat. I expected an even better result for  the left--that it would have two-thirds of the Sejm. Today, I  regard the alliance with the ZChN as a success, though too late.    [POLITYKA] Do you expect a rise in popularity as a result of  the joining of these two banners?    [Kaczynski] It is the joining not only of banners, but also  of organizations, including at the local level. The Alliance for  Poland will find its own legal and organizational formula. In  Poland, it is not possible to register parties that are made up  of other parties, so we will have to think about this matter.    [POLITYKA] But what new political quality will emerge upon  the joining of too separate groupings that nevertheless retain  their separateness?    [Kaczynski] On the one hand, organizational rapprochement;  on  the other, a programmatic compromise as well. There were fierce  negotiations and occasionally crises over the program, but, in  the end, we worked out the outline of a program.    [POLITYKA] You speak about unification and success, but  there  were several divisions before that unification was reached. The  Movement for the Republic and Aleksander Hall's party  disassociated, and strong tendencies against the alliance with  the PC in the ZChN itself. Is such a unification through  division really a step forward?    [Kaczynski] One can look at the right from two points of  view. One can exaggerate phenomena we consider the scraps, or  one can look at what is essential. I understand that there are  forces and groups that are hindered or even threatened by the  united right. We are simply uniting in a rational way; it is not  possible, after all, that everyone should unite.    [POLITYKA] Do you mean to say, then, that the fundamentalist  wing within the ZChN, represented by Jan Lopuszanski or Marek  Jurek, is a meaningless scrap?    [Kaczynski] I would not unite the names of Lopuszanski and  Jurek; they are completely different politicians. I do not  regard Marek Jurek as a scrap. I hope he stays in the ZChN. The  essence of the present arguments in that party are not entirely  clear to me. But the fact that we will differ in many matters  seems to me completely natural. An example is the Bavarian CSU,  where there is room for both clerics, or let us say "church  people," and liberals. To use Polish terms, in such a right-wing  party there is room for both Marek Jurek and Jan Krzysztof  Bielecki. Perhaps not for Donald Tusk, because he is surely an  unreconstructed liberal.    [POLITYKA] So you have hope for the right?    [Kaczynski] It should stabilize the political order, which  is  now so unsteady. There emerges a chance for a quadripartite  system: the postcommunists, the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], the  Freedom Union, and the united right. There could also be room  for the Union of Labor, which might take the place of the  postcommunists. This is not out of the question.    [POLITYKA] You would then be the party furthest to the  right?    [Kaczynski] The furthest of the significant parties, meaning  those that are capable of gaining at least 15-20 percent of the  votes in an election--because it is characteristic of Poland  that 15-20 percent is entirely sufficient to rule the country,  as shown by the PSL.    [POLITYKA] What would a united right have to offer, in the  sense of a program or idea? Whatever you might say, the Polish  right calls to mind a kind of Catholic fundamentalism, radical  decommunization slogans, or just inscrutability.    [Kaczynski] You have presented the propaganda version of the  right--the leftist version. We really have had and do have a  program in all the important areas of life, but they have not  drawn the interest of the media, which have only played up the  decommunization. It is true that these programs must be worked  on.    [POLITYKA] After its unification congress, the Freedom Union  is often perceived as a right-wing party; clear anticommunist  accents have appeared, along with signs of reconciliation with  the church. Please tell us what really makes the Alliance for  Poland's program different from that of the Freedom Union?    [Kaczynski] I am glad that our positions, which at one time  were roundly condemned, are now adopted by part of the Freedom  Union. But let us be clear: I am only moderately convinced by  those declarations. The Union is made up of people who have  certain resumes, views, and sympathies. I do not really see  Jacek Kuron, for example, as a liberal conservative, though that  is how I would describe Bronislaw Komorowski, for example--or  Bielecki. But many others have views that are liberal,  socioliberal, or even libertine. I am talking here about values.  Of course, if the Union moves right, that would be a positive  process. Every move to the right is desirable because only the  right can reform Poland. Nothing will change my conviction on  this.    [POLITYKA] Values are one thing, but what else divides the  Union's "right" from yours?    [Kaczynski] Essentially, attitude toward the present social  and political order is most important. We have demanded and  continued to demand the fundamental reconstruction of that  structure, which must include the very painful humbling of some  groups.    [POLITYKA] How do you imagine this might happen, inasmuch as  you said two years ago that it was already too late for many  things?    [Kaczynski] It is true; some things cannot be reversed. The  huge sums stolen by the so-called nomenklatura  corporations can not be recovered. That money has now gone  through so many owners that it would be impossible to recreate  the path it has taken.    [POLITYKA] There would have to be another theft of that  which, in your opinion, has already been stolen?    [Kaczynski] I would use another term, perhaps: One would  simply have to call into question in a radical way the certainty  of law and of business transactions, and that is just not worth  it. Not that I would have any moral objections to doing that,  but, for certain reasons, it just is not worth the effort. There  are, however, moves that can be easily made without threatening  the system in any way--for example, changing the management of  state banks.    [POLITYKA] Can a one-time change of people restore the  system's health?    [Kaczynski] Yes, because until now the  nomenklatura has been giving out money to its own  people.    [POLITYKA] You often offer three slogans as a shorthand for  the program of the PC: Christian values, national traditions,  and acceptance of the free market economy. I would think that  millions of Poles would be prepared to declare themselves for  such a program. Yet the PC has neither millions of members nor,  what is worse, millions of voters.    [Kaczynski] Those are higher goals and values and, thus,  general; they must be achieved. But today immediate goals are  also important. One must answer the question of who is to be in  charge in our country, what the new class of owners should look  like. This is the essence. We have taken up the struggle with  the strongest. That we are right is shown by the fact that they  are trying to destroy us. They have begun a fierce campaign.    [POLITYKA] How many members does the Center Accord have  today?    [Kaczynski] Approximately 7,000.    [POLITYKA] What, above all, must be done today in Poland?    [Kaczynski] The foundations for a change in power must be  created. One of these foundations is the unification of the  right. I am not a fan of going out into the streets, of great  strikes, and of other such revolutionary methods.    [POLITYKA] Then what is your position on the latest wave of  strikes in our country?    [Kaczynski] I regard it as a justified reaction to this  gigantic swindle that took place in Poland before the election.  The promises of the left could be calculated at some 300  trillion zlotys, which of course excluded the fulfillment of  such promises. Actually, it is good that they have not tried to  fulfill them because that would mean the end of our economy. The  political order we have today is bad not only because it is  contrary to our values and views but also because it has a  confrontational character. The enemy has reappeared, and that  fosters revolutionary situations. Things were not always as they  should have been over the previous four years, but there were  never huge upheavals because that enemy was not there. It is  true that there were shouts of "thief" during demonstrations  every week in front of the Office of the Council of Ministers,  but, despite everything, there was not a confrontation. However,  for many people who still identify with Solidarity, the present  government is unacceptable. The strikes that occurred recently  would not have been possible at all during the so-called  Solidarity governments.    [POLITYKA] It seems as if a miners' strike is scheduled on  our political calendar more or less twice a year.    [Kaczynski] I am not suffering from loss of memory, and I  remember those strikes, too. But please note that the present  government went to unheard-of lengths to make concessions, and,  despite this, the strike continues to smolder. I do not know  that it can be easily extinguished because we have a new  situation: a strike when communists are ruling, yet there are no  repressions like in the old regime. There is no element of fear,  but there is the element of political confrontation. This is a  new quality, and the effects of this cannot clearly be seen.    [POLITYKA] Do you see a locus for the united right in  Solidarity? Will you be trying for the union's support?    [Kaczynski] Using trade unions--and I'm thinking here of  Solidarity--for directly political goals is the action of  politicians who have lost their own political means. There is an  error in thinking here because Solidarity is internally quite  varied. What, after all, links Ewa Lewicka from the Mazowsze  region, who is a supporter of the Union of Labor, to Slawomir  Siwek, who has always declared himself a right Christian  Democrat?    [POLITYKA] So Solidarity does not interest the right as a  partner?    [Kaczynski] I repeat: We do not support the direct use of  the  union. Nonetheless, we count on rational thinking winning out in  Solidarity and the union placing its support with those  political forces that are really able to change Poland within  the limits of economic reason.    [POLITYKA] What scenario do you envision for the unified  right?    [Kaczynski] A deepening of internal integration and the  building of a common program. And also political activity, which  will be particularly evident this fall.    [POLITYKA] Will the local government elections be a test for  the new right, or don't you treat them that way?    [Kaczynski] In a direct sense no, because we have entered  various coalitions in different localities--including with the  Freedom Union. We want to hold back the ruling coalition in  order to lessen the dimensions of its victory. This will be  difficult because the countryside is dominated, without  exaggeration, by a PSL political monoculture. The structures of  the United Peasant Party were not dissolved when the time was  right, and now we have the result of this.    [POLITYKA] In an interview for GAZETA WYBORCZA after the  election, you spoke about the need to rethink, reevaluate  attitudes toward the Alliance of the Democratic Left [SLD],  which is an enduring element of the Polish political scene.  There is no evidence of such rethinking and reevaluation in what  you say. The rhetoric has changed, but the essence has remained  the same.    [Kaczynski] I have reevaluated. At first I assessed their  political qualifications higher, and now I consider them to be  close to zero. To win the election and have really almost no  power--that is almost impossible to imagine. Walesa took some of  the power, Pawlak took the rest, and Kwasniewski managed to  believe in what the press wrote about some kind of super prime  ministership. He completely forgot that institutional positions  and not a series of awards or titles are important. The SLD is  like officers who look good on the parade ground but do not  count for much when it comes to a real battle. This, of course,  creates the hope that the results of the last election will not  be repeated. And, besides the tactical defeat, there are the  policies they pursue, which I consider to be destructive.    [POLITYKA] You said that they do not have power, so how  could  they conduct a destructive policy?    [Kaczynski] Well, they are not overthrowing the government;  they are not leaving the coalition. They thus give permission  for that policy. This does not encourage one to see them as  someone who might in the future be a lasting partner in a  general political endeavor.    [POLITYKA] You envision, therefore, an unending  confrontation, along the lines of: In one election they do us  in, and in the next we do them in. And once again we will  reckon, decommunize, lustrate. This method of acting does not  seem to enjoy much popularity in public opinion.    [Kaczynski] If we were to win the election by ourselves,  which does not seem to be in the cards, someone who was in the  security apparatus could with certainty count on only the lowest  pension. In addition, he would have to thank us because even  more drastic methods would be considered just. But, because we  live in soft times, those lowest pensions would have to do. As  far as immediate public opinion is concerned...    [POLITYKA] ...not only: the election verdict as well.    [Kaczynski] Public opinion is changeable. I assure you that  if, in 1989, the PRL [Polish People's Republic] was clearly  separated from the new era and decommunization had been  conducted with a series of trials, that opinion would be  radically different.    [POLITYKA] Thank you.</p>

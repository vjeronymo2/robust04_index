			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Tarkett sets its sights on flotation Tarkett, Europe's largest manufacturer of hard flooring, yesterday announced plans for a stock market flotation valuing the German-based company at between Pounds 400m and Pounds 500m. The proposals, likely to involve a placing and open offer, follow the completion earlier this year of a SKr3.46bn (Pounds 286m) buy-out from Stora, the Scandinavian pulp and paper group. Mr Lars Wisen, chief executive, said funds from the flotation would be used to finance acquisitions in western Europe and North America, where the group already operates 12 manufacturing plants, and to expand its activities in the emerging markets of eastern Europe and south-east Asia. He warned, however, that the float was unlikely to take place before next spring at the earliest. Announcing increased interim pre-tax profits, he said: 'We are keen to come to the market. But we will not do so before the conditions are right. We still have a lot to prove. 'We aim to be the best and only alternative in the flooring world by focusing on new product areas and strengthening our international presence.' Mr Wisen led the team which oversaw the buy-out. Stora sold the hardwood and vinyl flooring business to concentrate on its core forestry operations and strengthen its balance sheet. The acquisition was funded mainly by Goldman Sachs and CWB Capital Partners, the London-based acquisition fund, which together hold more than 87 per cent of the equity. Although the two institutions are expected to realise part of their investment from the flotation, Mr Wisen predicted they would retain a long-term stake. Preparations for a listing in both London and Frankfurt include pushing through a two-year rationalisation programme intended to cut administrative costs and improve international distribution. Since 1990, the company has cut its workforce by more than a third to 4,500 and has sold its carpet and ceramic tile businesses. It has also overhauled its management in Britain, where it plans to challenge manufacturers such as Marley and James Halstead. Mr Christer Hiller, chief financial officer, said the rationalisation had helped lift first-half pre-tax profits by 72 per cent to Pounds 16.7m, against a pro forma Pounds 9.7m. Turnover in the six months to June 30 rose from Pounds 263m to Pounds 270.9m and operating profits increased 36 per cent to Pounds 25.2m. Mr Hiller attributed improved profit margins of 9.4 per cent (7.1 per cent) to cost reductions and an increased concentration on higher margin goods. Most of those products were sold in four main markets: Germany, North America, central Europe and Scandinavia. In spite of flat demand in recent months, the group said it had detected signs of a recovery in continental Europe and was reaping the benefits of the strengthening US economy. It was also enjoying buoyant trading in Russia and other former Soviet republics, where recent demand had outstripped supply.</p>

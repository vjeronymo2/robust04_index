			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY-AREA COLLEGE FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> CLU KICKER TOES THE LINE AFTER INSPIRED SPEECH  </P> <P> It was right out of the movie "Knute Rockne: All American."  </P> <P> Greg Maw was at a team meeting the day before the final game of his senior  season listening to Tom Farmer, an alum who played for Cal Lutheran in the  early 70's, tell how he once slipped out of the hospital in a malarial fever to  suit up for a Kingsmen game.  </P> <P> Maw, who severely lacerated two fingers carving a pumpkin before Halloween, had  been told by his doctor to skip the last game of his collegiate career because  of the possibility of infection. But after hearing Farmer, Maw decided his  injury shouldn't keep him from kicking against Azusa Pacific.  </P> <P> With his left hand so heavily wrapped that only the tip of his thumb showed,  Maw was flawless on three conversions to help Cal Lutheran to a 21-17 victory.  </P> <P> Fann-tastic: Albert Fann of Cal State Northridge Monday was selected offensive  player of the week in the Western Football Conference.  </P> <P> Fann, a junior from Cleveland High, rushed for 251 yards and two touchdowns in  28 carries on Saturday to carry CSUN to a 24-13 victory over Cal State  Sacramento. Fann's effort fell a yard shy of Tom Bonnell's Northridge record  for rushing yards in a game set in 1972.  </P> <P> The record probably would have fallen had Fann been given another carry with  CSUN running out the clock. The Matadors got the ball for the last time with  2:03 left, but reserve Lance Harper carried on CSUN's final three plays.  </P> <P> In addition to his rushing total, Fann had 58 yards receiving, 41 yards in  kickoff returns and completed a 31-yard pass. Fann leads the WFC with 1,195  yards rushing, but, with one game left to play, he's still 370 yards shy of  Mike Kane's CSUN single-season record.  </P> <P> Improbable? Yes. But considering his performance on Saturday, perhaps not  impossible.  </P> <P> Miller time: Jerry Miller, Cal Lutheran's president, was conspicuous in his  absence from Cal Lutheran's season finale against Azusa Pacific. Miller is a  key player in the decision as to whether Bob Shoup will return as Kingsmen  coach next season or in the future.  </P> <P> Reporters searched for Miller at Saturday's game before finding that he had  pulled off a nifty end-around. He was reportedly in Palm Springs for a business  meeting.  </P> <P> Title game: In a way, Northridge is right where it wanted to be going into its  final game of the season. The Matadors are playing in the game that will decide  the Western Football Conference championship.  </P> <P> Unfortunately for the Matadors, win or lose, the title won't be theirs.  </P> <P> Southern Utah State upset Portland State, the WFC's two-time defending  champion, earlier this season and needs a win against CSUN to earn a share of  the conference title.  </P> <P> Northridge needs a victory for its fourth consecutive winning season.  </P> <P> Correction: While Valley College defeated Pierce for the third time in a row on  Saturday, the Monarchs still trail, 14-9, in the series between the rival  schools.  </P> <P> Ground force: Valley's victory against Pierce was its third in a row and fourth  in the last five games after the Monarchs started the season 0-3.  </P> <P> The emergence of a potent rushing attack has been the key to Valley's rise.  </P> <P> After rushing for only 101 yards in the first three games, Valley has gained  more than 200 yards a game in its last five.  </P> <P> "I said at the start of the season that we'd be a team to reckon with in  divisional play," Coach Chuck Ferrero said. "It just took us a while to get  some experience."  </P> <P> Ferrero also credits consistent play on the offensive line. Early in the  season, Ferrero never knew which linemen were going to practice because of  injuries.  </P> <P> "We're beat up just like everyone else is at this stage of the season," Ferrero  said. "But it's constant. We're not shuffling guys in and out like before."  </P> <P> The emergence of Cliff Robinson, a former standout at L. A. Baptist High,  hasn't hurt, either.  </P> <P> Robinson rushed for 107 yards in 17 carries against Pierce and has gained 240  yards in the last two games. A thigh bruise that sidelined Allen Moore for the  last two games has given Robinson some time to shine.  </P> <P> "He's a coach's guy," Ferrero said of the 5-foot-6, 160-pound Robinson. "He  does everything you ask of him. He listens to you and he doesn't complain. He  didn't carry the ball once in the first three games and yet, I never heard him  complain. He just kept practicing harder and getting better."  </P> <P> One-man gang: Moorpark linebacker Raymund Mosones seemed to always be around  the ball Saturday during the Raiders' 47-27 victory over Glendale.  </P> <P> Mosones, a sophomore, intercepted a pass for a touchdown, batted down another  pass, recovered a fumble that led to a Moorpark score and had several tackles  for losses.  </P> <P> Afterward, Mosones was at a loss to explain his touchdown run, during which he  rambled 11 yards then vaulted into the end zone.  </P> <P> "We're taught to run to the sidelines," Mosones said. "I don't know why I did  it. I just sort of did it."  </P> <P> Gary Klein and staff writers Mike Hiserman, John Ortega and Brendan Healey  contributed to this notebook.  </P></p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Taking a shine to new remedies. Is there a cure for baldness? Charles Arthur analyses the scientific basis of current treatments Most bald or balding people feel wigs or toupees are passe. Nowadays, a growing number of medical or surgical techniques promise new hair - or at least a convincing substitute. That doesn't mean they necessarily sound like something you would try at home. The latest claimed cure being tested by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) resembles a salon hair dryer and applies a weak pulsed electrical field of about 800 volts across the scalp without touching it. Apparently for social reasons, seeing a receding hairline in the mirror worries most men. Typical 'male pattern baldness' - thinning at the crown, followed by loss across the top of the head - is due to a combination of ancestry (bald fathers usually lead to bald sons) and male hormones, which eventually cause the scalp's hair follicles to shrink, spending less time growing hair and more time quiescent. In women, stress and immune diseases can also lead to hair loss (often temporarily), as can the sudden hormonal changes after pregnancy. Perhaps reflecting the increasing pressures of the modern world, a growing proportion of clients coming to hair loss clinics, traditionally a male haunt, are women. 'Ten years ago it would be maybe 1 to 3 per cent,' says Richard Ingham, UK director of marketing for Svenson Hair Clinics (which has 112 outlets worldwide treating 20,000 new clients annually). 'Now it's more like 10 per cent.' Current Technology Corporation (CTC), the Vancouver-based company set up in 1988 to market the electrical method, has already raised Cdollars 14m (pounds 6m) of which the company's two co-founders, Anne and Robert Kramer, have so far spent Cdollars 9m on trials and promotions. Their financial models say if they can get 70,000 Americans - fewer than 2 per cent of the 37m men and women who are losing hair - to take the treatments (at USdollars 12.50 pounds 6.50 weekly for nine months, and monthly afterwards), by the second year of operation CTC will make profits of USdollars 39m on revenues of USdollars 73m. Still, the causes of baldness are the same everywhere. In men, incidence increases with age; in the UK, almost 40 per cent exhibit some degree of hair loss by 35. In women, the figure for 'excessive loss' is 30 per cent, but not age-linked. But capitalising on the huge US market depends on receiving full FDA approval. For CTC, that is at least six months away; the FDA might even proclaim the method, which the company calls Electro-Tricho-Genesis (ETG), a dud. What then?   According to Robert Kramer, CTC's chief financial officer: 'We have started testing in other countries. And anyway, we wouldn't have started the FDA tests if we didn't think we had a better than even chance of passing.'  He also quotes successful studies performed by the University of British Columbia. Yet even FDA approval does not guarantee riches. The only baldness cure which has so far received the FDA's nod is the drug Minoxidil, marketed in the US by the Kalamazoo-based Upjohn Corporation under the trade name Rogaine (and in Europe as Regaine). 'The product is a solid performer,' insists Paul Fitzhenry, the company's European spokesman. 'Not a blockbuster, sure, but strong.'   Last year world-wide sales totalled dollars 143m - though only dollars 40m outside the US, despite the product being launched everywhere in 1988. (Sales in the US were slightly up on 1990; elsewhere, slightly down.) Both Upjohn's and CTC's cures are thought to work by stimulating blood flow in inactive follicles, prompting them back to hair production. Oddly, neither was originally aimed at curing baldness. CTC's ETG therapy began as a research program to help migraine sufferers. Minoxidil began its pharmaceutical life as an oral drug for high blood pressure called Loniten, developed by Upjohn and launched in the US in 1977. Among the side-effects doctors noticed with was new hair growth. Following seven years of trials, in 1988 Upjohn launched Rogaine as a baldness cure, to be applied externally twice daily. The treatment, is not, however, a panacea. Only one-third of users grow back the thick hair they wished for. Another one-third get soft, downy growth. The rest receive no benefit at all.  'The best effects are on those who have lost the least hair,' says Barry Monk, consultant dermatologist at the Manor Hospital, Bedford, who specialises in the subject. More frustrating for the user - though heartening for the company - is that as soon as the treatment stops, the hair gain is reversed. 'You go back to where you would have been without it,' says Monk. That means using the drug is a commitment for life, or at least the term of one's vanity; and in the UK, it is only available on private prescription, not through the NHS or across the counter. 'At pounds 30 to pounds 40 per month, it's a big commitment,' says Monk. 'There was a lot of interest at first, but now I can't remember the last time someone came to me asking for it.' Similarly, CTC's Robert Kramer admits that ETG is a treatment, not a cure. 'It's like diabetes,' he says. 'You get treatment on an ongoing basis.' Comparing the natural loss of a few bits of hair to a potentially life-threatening disease may sound like hyperbole, but probably reflects an American attitude. 'Upjohn's market research before the launch of Regaine indicated the British are less concerned about going bald than almost anyone. So the price here was less than in other European countries,' says Monk. Still, most companies see the US as the biggest potential market. For those unwilling to make a life commitment to sprays or (if it's approved) electricity, other alternatives include hair transplants and hair weaving. Transplants entail surgically removing healthy follicles from the side or back of the head and punching them into the skin at the front. The outcome 'tends to look like a planted forest,' says Monk. The cost is in the hundreds of pounds, though Svenson's Ingham comments: 'Once you've achieved a successful transplant, that's it.'  Failures do occur, though, usually due to infection of the transplanted roots. Hair 'weaving' is increasingly popular. Surgical thread a thousandth of a millimetre thick is woven into the bed of existing hair and then extended and enhanced with real hair, matched for colour and texture. Its disadvantages are that the 'weave has to be repositioned and cleaned every month as the existing hair grows through. 'But you can do what you like otherwise,' says Ingham. Why, in the end, do people want a cure for baldness?  'In a recession a lot of people are frightened about losing their job,' says Ingham. 'People who are disadvantaged in terms of hair feel disadvantaged generally, and worry that younger, more virile-looking men will pinch their job.' However, Monk disagrees. 'There's a sterotyped person who goes in for such treatments,' he says. 'To be honest, I feel thay can't face up to reality. Most people are prepared to go bald gracefully.'</p>

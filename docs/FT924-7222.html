			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Family hopes to buy Henry Barrett arms FAMILY MEMBERS hope to buy the main businesses of Henry Barrett Group, the Bradford-based steel and industrial fasteners company which was placed in administrative receivership on Friday. Mr James Barrett, 37, and his brother, Richard, 35, have offered Pounds 12m for the steel stockholding and building divisions, employing 450 out of the group's 750 people, . They were not placed in receivership. The brothers, who helped bring the group to the market in 1987, are backed by two venture capital funds and advised by Touche Ross. The receivers, Grant Thornton, are in talks with other possible buyers for Lindapter International, the special fastening subsidiary, which is also not in receivership. Mr James Barrett said the proposed purchase would secure the jobs and creditors of the stockholding and building divisions, accounting for about Pounds 60m of group turnover of Pounds 100m. It is likely to be less easy to find buyers for the subsidiaries now in receivership, principally Westbury Tubular Structures and Don Reynolds, which makes flat-panel cladding. Henry Barrett grew rapidly during the last building boom and its shares peaked at 280p in 1989.</p>

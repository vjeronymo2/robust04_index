Basyuni spoke last night before the  annual conference of WIZO, the Women's International Zionist  Organization, in Tel Aviv. Reporter Dani Gur-Arye was there:    [Begin recording] [Gur-Arye] Ambassador Basyuni served as  Egypt's military attache in Syria during the 1970's, and he is  acquainted personally with President al-Asad. Basyuni says  al-Asad is a tough negotiator, but he can be counted on to keep  his word in any agreement signed. As an example, Basyuni cites  the 1974 disengagement agreement between Israel and Syria:    [Basyuni] Since 1974, Syria kept their word, and no one  violation of this agreement. What it means? It means if you  sign agreement with the Syrians, they will keep it. They keep  their words. Maybe they will be very tough in the negotiations,  but they will keep their words after the negotiations, after  reaching agreement. And, the case with Syria is very clear: If  Israel will withdraw full withdrawal from Golan Heights, it will  be full peace.    [Gur-Arye] Ambassador Basyuni predicts the negotiations  between Syria and Israel will be renewed following the summit  between President al-Asad and U.S. President Clinton next week  in Geneva. He says 1994 will be a year of peace in the Middle  East. [end recording]</p>

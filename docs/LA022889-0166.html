			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BIRD'S BACK BUT CELTIC FANS STILL HAVE A WAIT  </P> <P> The good news for Boston Celtics fans is that Larry Bird, sidelined since  mid-November with bone spur surgery on both heels, has participated in his  first 90-minute workout with the team since his operation.  </P> <P> The bad news is that his right heel was in pain throughout the practice, and  team officials say he is not yet ready to see game action.  </P> <P> "It wasn't a hard workout," Bird said Monday. "We'll talk about it tomorrow,  see how it feels and go from there."  </P> <P> "Larry was rusty out there," center Robert Parish said. "But he looked pretty  good, considering how long he has been out. He was tentative. But that's to be  expected."  </P> <P> There is no set date for Bird's return. On Nov. 19, the date of his surgery,  speculation centered on a comeback sometime in late March.  </P> <P> "If he continues to make progress like this, I would expect him back in the  near future," coach Jimmy Rodgers said. "But this is just a checkpoint."  </P></p>

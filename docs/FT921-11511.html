			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Increased European sales help Menvier-Swain edge ahead IN SPITE of the continuing recession, Menvier-Swain, the emergency lighting and fire alarms group, managed a marginal profits increase in the half year to end-October. Although sales fell by 18 per cent from Pounds 23.9m to Pounds 19.7m - reflecting the loss of turnover from discontinued businesses - profits at the pre-tax level increased from Pounds 2.76m to Pounds 2.77m. All the loss-making businesses have now been sold. Profits were helped by a reduced interest charge of Pounds 363,000 (Pounds 429,000) on borrowings down from Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 4.7m. Gearing was cut from 74 per cent to 43 per cent. The interim dividend goes up from 2.2p to 2.7p, payable from earnings per share of 13.3p (12.7p). Mr Roger Fletcher, chief executive, said the dividend had been increased to adjust the proportion of the total paid out at the interim stage. Mr Fletcher said the UK market remained difficult with sales of emergency lighting and fire alarms down 19 per cent to Pounds 9.9m. However, market share and margins had been maintained. The fall in UK business had been offset by increasing sales of emergency lighting in continental Europe, which now accounts for some 41 per cent of group turnover. Sales from the Continent grew by 29 per cent to Pounds 8m (Pounds 6.2m) and profits advanced to Pounds 1.3m. Mr Fletcher said the French offshoot was having a particularly successful year, with a significant contract for the Channel tunnel project, while the group's newest acquisition, Univel, in Greece, was now contributing to profits. New EC safety directives covering essential safety requirements in new buildings came into force on January 1 in the UK, and the group was well placed to pick up any ensuing extra businesses, Mr Fletcher said. Mr Charles Swain has retired as executive chairman. He has been appointed Life President and will remain as a non-executive director. Mr Roy McDowell, a non-executive director of the company since flotation in 1986, is to become chairman.</p>

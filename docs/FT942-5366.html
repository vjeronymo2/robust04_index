			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Sport: Pierce adds fresh verve - Tennis This afternoon in Paris, international women's tennis will experience one of its periodic moments of rebirth. When Mary Pierce, the 19-year-old Canadian-born French No. 1 who lives in Florida, plays the effervescent Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, in the final of the 1994 French Open, she will be injecting fresh life into a sport that has recently been in decline. Ever since the retirement of Chris Evert in 1989 and the eclipse of her great rival Martina Navratilova, whose last major success was her Wimbledon victory in 1990, the game has been dominated by Monica Seles and Steffi Graf. Between them these two have won 23 of the last 28 grand slam championships, including the last 13. Until her comprehensive defeat at the hands of Pierce last Thursday, Graf had enjoyed a clear run following the stabbing of Seles in April 1993. The 24-year-old German has won her last 20 tournament finals. Although Graf and Seles have been wonderful ambassadors for the sport, the predictability of their victories had introduced an unhealthy element of ennui. Pierce, the No. 12 seed, who was competing in a grand slam semi-final for the first time, ended all that. Her crushing 6-2 6-2 victory over Graf which made her the first Frenchwoman to reach this final since Frankie Durr, who won the title in 1967, was exceptional in several ways. Pierce had played the world No. 1 twice, both times on hard courts last year, and had been crushed both times. Yet, after beating two of the top 10  -Sabatini and Navratilova - at the Virginia Slims Championships in November, Pierce seemed to become a different person. Now she can say:' . . . every time I play against Steffi and the top players I feel that I have the game to beat them.' She has proved that this week. Pierce hits the ball harder than anyone since Seles. She has been trained since late last year by Nick Bollettieri, who developed both Seles and that other mighty smiter, Andre Agassi. Bollettieri has encouraged her to go for her shots as Agassi and Seles do. This way of playing is risky. On a bad day the losers outnumber the winners. On a good day you are assured of spectacular success. For the past two weeks Pierce has had a succession of good days. During her six wins she has conceded only 10 games, a record in Paris since open tennis began in 1968. Mary smiles a lot on court. She can afford to, now that her father and former coach Jim has been banned from any venues where she is playing, following a fight he had with another spectator at last year's French Open. 'Many things have changed, on the court and outside the court. My life has changed. I enjoy myself more now and I have been training a lot physically. When you feel good physically you have a lot of confidence,' said Pierce. Confidence was crucial against Graf. Never did Pierce compromise, perhaps because, as she explained: 'I told myself this was just another match . . . I didn't think about Steffi being the other side of the net, I just had to think about the ball.' Easy to say, difficult to do. Clearly Mary was enjoying herself, and it showed. Too few players understand the importance of getting the crowd on their side  -especially when playing on home territory. Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe were past masters at it. Time and again I have seen them manipulating the vociferous crowd at Flushing Meadow so that their opponents have felt they were taking on the whole of New York. In Paris, Mary Pierce had the 16,000 French spectators eating out of her hand. A smile here, a gesture there and they would roar deliriously to compound the discomfort of the defending champion. The victory was all the more impressive for the variety of shot displayed by Pierce. Cleverly flighted lobs, well concealed drop shots and even the odd volley, all produced at the right moment to catch the champion off guard. You kept wondering if Mary would awaken from her dream. Certainly Graf hoped she would. 'It is very difficult to play a whole match like that. You sometimes have to miss some points so I still thought I had a chance,' said the loser. Any last chance Graf might have had evaporated when, having broken the Pierce serve for the first time to make it 2-2 in the second set, Graf lost her serve with three errors as a light drizzle began to fall. When they resumed, after a 40 minute delay, Pierce sailed into the attack. In 13 minutes she blasted through the next three games for the loss of four points to reach the final. Pierce's opponent today may prove more troublesome. Sanchez-Vicario, the No 2 seed, had looked fit and fast as she inflicted a 6-3 6-1 defeat on fellow Spaniard Conchita Martinez in the other semi-final. Sanchez-Vicario, always in the shadow of Graf or Seles, now has the chance to show us just how good she is. When she won the French title as a bubbling 17-year-old in 1989 the future seemed bright. Since then, however, there have been doubts on the great occasions. Too often she has faltered on the brink, as at the US Open in 1992 when, having beaten Graf, she froze against Seles. Pierce is another Seles. She plays the same way. She has the same confident outlook. It would be ironic if the unfortunate Sanchez, the only woman previously to have beaten Graf this year, should be thwarted by Graf's latest conqueror. Sanchez has won three of her four previous meetings against Pierce but lost their last encounter on a clay court in Hilton Head two months ago. My guess is that Pierce is now even more confident than she was then and, should today become the sort of exciting, new champion the game needs.</p>

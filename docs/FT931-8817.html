			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Axe still poised over London hospitals A 'CONCENTRATED effort' was announced by the government yesterday to improve London's local health services and prepare the capital for hospital closures. Ministers have accepted the logic and implications of the Tomlinson report's recommendations for changes in London's healthcare. They have put off politically-sensitive decisions about hospital closures until later in the year but set up a structure which should ensure that - unlike previous attempts to rationalise hospital provision in London - the decisions are eventually taken. Final announcements on the future of some of the capital's most famous hospitals will come after further consultation and a review of the allocation of specialist services. Meanwhile, action will be launched to improve general practitioner and community services in a London Initiative Zone covering the inner city. This is likely to lead to extra family doctors being brought into the capital on short-term contracts, with primary care centres set up in shops, sports centres, schools and offices. The job of improving London's relatively poor family doctor and community services presents ministers with a considerable challenge. But the difficult political decisions involve hospital closures. Yesterday's announcement, in a document called Making London Better, represents a compromise between ministers who have advocated immediate tough action and those counselling caution for fear of adverse public reaction. Most of the closure options proposed in Sir Bernard Tomlinson's report remain on the table for further consideration. A delay until the autumn will allow the government more time to prepare a detailed case to justify particular closures. St Bartholomew's hospital in the City, which has run the most conspicuous campaign against the Tomlinson report's recommendation that it should close, remains high on the danger list. The government intends to conduct consultations on removing its accident and emergency facilities and says the hospital then faces one of three options: closure, forming a combined trust with the Royal London - with the new trust management deciding how to rationalise services - or retaining Bart's as a much smaller specialist hospital. The document stresses that the option of retaining a smaller, specialist Bart's - the solution favoured by its management - 'would need to stand the test of the specialty reviews and its costs would have to be acceptable to purchasers'. Ministers will consider firm proposals in the autumn. But Bart's application to become a self-governing trust from April will not go ahead and its management links with the Homerton hospital in Hackney - included in the Bart's management's survival plan - will be severed. The Royal Brompton and Royal Marsden specialist heart and cancer hospitals in Chelsea are among the few clear winners from yesterday's announcement. Both have campaigned powerfully against Tomlinson's recommendation to re-house them at the Charing Cross Hospital, and the government says it is not convinced of the case for doing so. This decision adds to the threat facing the Charing Cross Hospital, which Tomlinson recommended should close if the Royal Brompton and Royal Marsden did not move there. The government will consult on proposals to close its accident and emergency department, and will consider detailed proposals for the future of Charing Cross in the autumn. Ministers are supporting proposals for two pairs of hospitals - University College and the Middlesex and Guy's and St Thomas' to be rationalised on single sites. The London hospitals have lost Pounds 50m in contract income this financial year and are expected to lose a further Pounds 50m next year. On a cautious estimate, says the government document, the capital's hospitals are likely to have to shed between 2,000 and 2,500 of their beds - between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the total - in four or five years.</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Crisis in the UK Economy: Calls for plebiscite led by SNP THE Scottish National party yesterday stepped up demands for a referendum in the UK on Britain's future relations with Europe - which would include a question for Scottish voters on the home rule issue. Mr Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, said the narrowness of the French vote made Mr John Major's position in refusing to hold a referendum untenable - and it was equally untenable for him to deny the Scots a ballot on their country's future. 'Why should the Scots be denied a vote on Europe's future and Scotland's place in Europe when the Danes, the Irish and the French have all had their say?' said Mr Salmond, MP for Banff and Buchan. He told a Glasgow news conference: 'Scotland needs a vote on Europe and a voice in Europe. If closer co-operation is to proceed - and the SNP, despite Maastricht's flaws, hopes that it will - Europe must be brought closer to the people. 'That means a small nation like Scotland, just like Denmark and Ireland, must have an independent voice at the heart of the new Europe.' The SNP meets in Perth for its annual conference tomorrow. On Saturday, there will be a debate on the Maastricht agreement - an amendment calls for a referendum. Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative party chairman, yesterday renewed his call for a referendum, saying the French result had knocked progress to monetary union 'completely off the rails'. 'Perhaps it is time for the people of Britain to have a say,' he said. 'A referendum on the issue would clear the air and make it much easier for John Major to speak for the country in the certainty that he was speaking for all the people.'</p>

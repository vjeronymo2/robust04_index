			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BAGNERIS DENOUNCES GM PLANT CLOSURE IN BID FOR LABOR SUPPORT  </P> <P> Saying he wanted to erode the strong labor base of one of his opponents, Los  Angeles City Council candidate Jules Bagneris III on Wednesday opposed closure  of the Van Nuys General Motors plant.  </P> <P> Lyle Hall, president of United Firefighters of Los Angeles from 1976 to 1984,  generally has been acknowledged as labor's candidate in the 7th District race.  But on Wednesday, Bagneris questioned that label.  </P> <P> "I've handed out my literature early in the morning at various plants,"  Bagneris said. "They're telling me they're going to support my campaign."  </P> <P> However, only one union representative showed up at Bagneris' mid-afternoon  news conference in front of the plant, while streams of workers ending their  shifts drove past him, some of them honking their horns. About 3,400 people  assemble cars at the plant.  </P> <P> The United Auto Workers union has already endorsed incumbent Ernani Bernardi.  </P> <P> The General Motors plant has been operating under a cloud since the fall, when  managers first announced that the production of Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac  Firebirds might be moved elsewhere in 1991. Final word was expected by March.  </P> <P> Hall said he was disappointed not to receive the UAW endorsement. But he said  his union support remains strong. He said he has been supported by United  Firefighters, the Police Protective League, Los Angeles County Federation of  Labor and Teamsters Joint Council 42.  </P> <P> Bernardi accused Bagneris of "really stretching" for campaign issues. He  defended his record, saying he has worked closely with General Motors  executives and union officials over the years.  </P></p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: TV-am fades out with a bumper Pounds 20m profit TV-AM enjoyed bumper profits last year as it wound down its breakfast television operations after losing the franchise and ceasing broadcasting on New Year's Eve. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 20.16m, against Pounds 12.5m for the preceding 11 months, reflected a fall in staffing levels to 130 people through most of the year compared with a peak of 400 and a 10 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 87m. Operating costs fell 17.7 per cent to Pounds 49.5m. The company, which first started broadcasting on February 1 1983, lost its franchise to GMTV, having bid Pounds 14m to renew its licence against GMTV's Pounds 34.5m. It attacked again yesterday the bidding system, saying 'the loss of our licence was the result of one of the most deeply flawed Acts of Parliament ever to reach the statute book.' Mr Bruce Gyngell, chairman, said: 'The Broadcasting Act of 1990 was not only a bad act but it was also totally inhuman. In effect, for fourteen months our staff had the sword of Damocles hanging over their heads.' Having failed to find other investments in television which would maintain the same return on investment for its shareholders, the company continued its liquidation by declaring a final dividend of 20p, making a total of 64p (14p) for the year. At the interim stage the company announced a 4p dividend and at Christmas announced a further 40p interim dividend. Total dividends paid since the company was floated in 1986 amount to 119.35p per share on a purchase price of 65p per share. TV-am will have finally disposed of all fixed assets by the end of March, and is holding about Pounds 6m cash in reserve against outstanding property rents.</p>

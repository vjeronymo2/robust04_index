[passage omitted]    The program is introduced by Luca Livoni:    Today, we have a very important program. We will be linking  up soon with Tbilisi, where we have our special correspondent  Alessandro Cassieri. [passage omitted]    So, this morning Batoni [Georgian polite form of address] E.  Shevardnadze will be asked many questions by the guests in the  studio or by people with whom we have linked up on the  telephone. These are Giorgio Napolitano, president of the  Italian Parliament Chamber of Deputies, Senate President  Giovanni Spandolini, Giuseppe Giacovazzo, deputy minister of  foreign affairs, Stefano Silvestri, professor at the Center for  International Relations, Raiuno director Demetrio Volcic, who  was special correspondent in Moscow for many years, and my  colleagues Giuseppe Chiseri and Carlo Napoli from Radio Two's  foreign department. [passage omitted]    [Shevardnadze]First and foremost, I would like to greet  Batonebi Napolitano, Spandolini, and all the radio listeners and  express my gratitude to all the organizers of this broadcast.  Regarding the situation that has taken shape in Georgia, it is  very difficult. However, certain positive events did take place  in 1993. These were the general consolidation of our people and  the defeat of such destructive and semifascist forces as the  supporters of the former president and their armed opposition  against the authorities and the Georgian people. There existed  the fundamental danger of the division of the nation, but this  has been eliminated since the supporters of the ex-president  were defeated politically, morally, and militarily. As for  Abkhazia, almost more than one-half of the population of  Abkhazia has been evacuated. Of the population of 500,000 in  Abkhazia, 250,000 persecuted Georgians are now in different  regions of Georgia. Tens of thousands of Georgians have been  destroyed and shot simply because they were Georgians.  Unfortunately, this problem cannot, as yet, be resolved. The  first round of negotiations is currently in progress in Geneva.  The main point in this agreement is that the refugees should  return immediately to their homes. The next round will also be  held in Geneva on 11 Janury and we will be going there with  definite hopes. If this is realized and the refugees return to  their homes, a peaceful regulation becomes realistic.    [Cassieri] The beginning of the conflict in this part of  Georgia is naturally connected with the new composition of the  Soviet Union. However, what, in your view, was the direct  motive and basis for the intensification of the autonomous  movement in Abkhazia; what process that has taken place in the  former Soviet Union over the last two years was able to  contribute to this?    [Shevardnadze]This is the manifestation of the  reactionary separatist movement. Not everyone knows that this  is Georgian land on which Georgians and Abkhazians have been  living for centuries. If we speak about proportionate figures,  Georgians make up one-half of the population, whereas the  Abkhazians constitute only 17 percent. Who is supporting this  17 percent and how is it possible that 17 percent has been able  to persecute 50 percent? This happened because the Abkhazian  separatists were backed by Russia's reactionary force: Rutskoy,  Khasbulatov, and the communists, fundamentalists and communists  who were in the Supreme Soviet at the time. They rendered  financial and material assistance and sent weapons and thousands  of mercenaries there. This 17 percent is demanding that  Abkhazia secedes from Georgia and unites with Russia.    [Cassieri] Apart from the responsibility of the old  nomenklatura of the former Soviet Union, those people holding  Soviet views, who, just two months ago, suffered another  "purge," you specifically demanded that the Russian Government  also assume responsibility, particularly when you were in  Sukhumi in August and September by which time the Abkhazians had  surrounded the city. That is to say, you demanded that Yeltsin,  whom you felt was not giving you the necessary support in order  to defend Georgia, should assume direct responsibility.    [Shevardnadze]I believe that Yeltsin was unable to  control the situation, as the Supreme Soviet at the time was  putting up considerable resistance and the majority of deputies  supported those separatist actions by the Abkhazians. Yeltsin  was unable to overcome this opposition in his conflict with  these people. The opposition between these two forces gave rise  to and aggravated the conflict in Abkhazia as well. You know  that I was in Abkhazia at that time. It was terrible to see the  destruction of this most beautiful part of Georgia.  [passage omitted]    [Napolitano] First of all, I would like to say to Batoni  Shevardnadze that I have often thought about him and his brave  step to struggle against so many problems that have arisen in  Georgia. I respect you very much and admire your character. At  the beginning of October, President [as published] Shevardnadze  appealed to those countries in Europe on whose help he was  counting. I would like to ask Batoni president to what extent  have those questions that were raised been coordinated on an  international scale and what help is needed and what can the  West do in this respect.    [Shevardnadze]Thank you very much. I likewise greet  all of you and thank you for such an appraisal of my activities.  My appeal, which has just been mentioned, signified our saving  Georgia and democracy. It is a question of the salvation of  democracy here, as Georgia has chosen a difficult path in a  region that is already very difficult from a geographical point  of view. The problems that were mentioned in my appeal are still  pressing; the situation in Georgia remains very serious. There  is total hunger. Georgia use to be a rich country where the  people lived well. However, we now have hunger and cold. This  is the fate of our nation. There are now hundreds of thousands  of refugees in Georgia. If it were not for the help from the  West, in particular from Italy and other countries, the  situation in Georgia would be much worse. I appeal once more to  everyone to whom the ideals of democracy are dear, to help  Georgia so that, through our combined efforts, we can save this  small but, at the same time, great country that has a  centuries-old civilization. Once again, I thank you very much  for your help.    [Giacovazzo] In spite of the great sympathy that I feel  toward Batoni Shevardnadze, I do not have such a good knowledge  of the problems in Georgia. I am more interested in issues  related to Russia. The Zhirinovskiy problem is of concern to  everyone at the moment, a problem that relates not only to the  present time, but also to the future. Is is possible that this  populist, ultraright- wing leader -- I don't know what to call  him -- will enjoy even greater success in the 1996 presidential  elections? To what extent is he a serious threat? Will we not  see a unification of the left around Yeltsin? I have one more  question that directly concerns Italy: You know that, this  year, Italy is presiding over the Security Council that unites  54 states including all the republics of the former Soviet  Union. Italy wants to make active use of its status in the  council and bring to a hasty end all the different conflicts on  the territory of the former Soviet Union, in particular those  taking place in Georgia. I would like to know how effectively  Batoni Shevardnadze thinks this role may be used and what is  possible for Italy to do this year as council president?    [Shevardnadze]I will try to answer in brief these  difficult questions. I assumed that this process would occur in  Russia and that 15-20 percent would support Zhirinovskiy. I was  mistaken, but this had to take place in Russia. I think that  this is due not so much to the victory of Zhirinovskiy's ideas,  but rather to confusion among the electorate. Zhirinovskiy  should have appeared after the collapse of the Soviet Union.  However, it is unfortunate that the forces that were standing  alongside him enabled him to acquire such influence. This is  indeed worrying. However, there is the other side of the coin:  Following Zhirinovskiy's success, Russian society has come to  its senses. Unfortunately, prior to the elections, many  democrats did not view him as a serious force and, therefore, I  think they were justly punished. I am left with the impression  that Russia's democrats have to unite and I believe that this  will indeed happen. They will unite to prevent the emergence of  fascism. If they unite, fascism will not take hold. If the  democrats do not unite and fascism strengthens its hold, this  will be terrible not only for Russia, but also for Europe and  the whole world. However, I believe that this will not happen.  Russia achieved great success when it adopted a new  constitution. This creates a serious guarantee of democracy and  this Constitution will enable President Yeltsin to eradicate  fascism and dictatorship. I think that President Yeltsin will  make use of this. Regarding the Security Council, I pin great  hopes upon it. It should adopt an even more firm position  particularly regarding such questions as ethnic conflicts. The  Security Council can do this. Conflicts characterize the  Caucasus, particularly Georgia. Europe should think how, as one  force, it can overcome the economic crisis. If this crisis is  not overcome on such a large territory, chaos could ensue, which  will cost the world dear. I pin great hopes on Italy's  presidency of the Security Council. We are ready to cooperate  in every way possible so that your presidency will make an  appreciable contribution.[passage omitted]    [Spandolini] I warmly greet President Shevardnadze and I  fondly remember our first meeting in Rome in 1991 when your book  "Freedom for the Future" was being presented. I recall your  comments, which proved to be incredibly correct, a few months  before the coup in Russia, about Gorbachev's future actions and  your view that this transformation may not have brought the  expected results. The freedom that was written about in that  book is now more urgent than ever, as is the independence of  Georgia....    [Shevardnadze]Thank you. Let me give you my answer.  The likes of Gamsakhurdia, Zhirinovskiy, Ardzinba in Abkhazia,  and certain others in Russia are a dangerous phenomenon and I  believe that, after World War II, the world paid less attention  to fascism and analogous movements. In my view, this has cost  the world very dearly and, therefore, we have to be vigilant  and, what is more, analyze aggressive separatism and not  tolerate what has happened in our region. As for Zhirinovskiy's  supporters -- Gamsakhurdia and the others -- I myself know,  through having had direct contacts with them over two years,  that they are surrounded by many inexperienced people. Our  people, for example, realized very quickly what Gamsakhurdia  represented. This was the reason for his defeat. The great  majority of his supporters are cooperating with us today. I am  certain that we will cooperate with almost all of them as  Gamsakhurdia propagated the ideas of national exclusivity,  irreconcilability with other nations, and religious intolerance,  and they could not have any future. People realized this and we  are now cooperating with them. Many of Zhirinovskiy's  supporters have chosen a different path. It only requires the  unification of the democrats and Zhirinovskiy will no longer be  dangerous.    [Cassieri] As the former [Soviet] foreign minister, you  naturally know all the Soviet Union's secrets. When  Zhirinovskiy threatened to use the "ultimate weapon," whom do  you think he had in mind? The future destruction of their arch  enemy or awkward neighbors? In your view, what was meant by  this, if anything at all?    [Shevardnadze]I think that what Zhirinovskiy is saying  represents the nostalgia of certain circles in Russia. Of  course, it is based on Russian chauvinist ideology. We should  view this as a chauvinist movement and a type of fascism: A  chauvinist world outlook and imperialist nostalgia -- these are  the two main characteristics of this movement. I would like to  repeat once more that, in order to overcome this, it is  essential for all democrats in Russia to unite.    [Spandolini] I realize that the European model is more  acceptable for the CIS than the U.S. one. I am pleased to hear  your view that Yeltsin will be able to curb the  fascist-chauvinist wave that is currently affecting Russia.  However, is Batoni Shevardnadze aware that the European  Community is facing a great danger? Separatist movements have  intensified in certain EC countries. Do you think that the same  danger awaits the CIS? In short, is there a risk of a second  Yugoslavia in Russia?    [Shevardnadze]When we compare the prospects for the  development of the European Community and the CIS, I believe  that the principle underlying the unification of the countries  in the CIS should be the same as that which underlies the  European Community. If this happens, the CIS will be a viable  prospect. This is the first thing. The second demand: The CIS  will survive provided that Russia proceeds along the path of  democratic development. This is an essential condition. God  forbid that it will happen, but if dictatorship becomes  established in Russia and Russia's reactionary forces are  victorious, naturally, the CIS will perish and I am convinced  that Russia, likewise, will no longer survive. Therefore, the  future of the CIS and Russia lies only along the path of  democratic development. I think that Batoni Yeltsin understands  this well. I will remind him of one step that has been taken:  One of my friends, Aleksandr Yakovlev, a well-known Russian  democrat, has been made head of Russian television. I think  this is a very important fact. There should be more of these  actions.    [Silvestri] I do not want to talk about the so-called  "ultimate weapon" as I think that Batoni President Shevardnadze  was right in saying that the ultimate weapon of war was  political force. Moreover, Russia does have the ultimate --  atomic -- weapon, which is enough. It is more difficult to  achieve stability in this region. Proceeding from this, I  wanted to ask President Shevardnadze whether it will be possible  to create elements of stability in the Black Sea region if there  continue to be prolonged national conflicts between Muslims and  Christians, in the main, in the Caucasus region.    [Shevardnadze]Thank you. This is how I see it: Given  that there existed such a grandiose and most-powerful empire as  that of the Soviet Union and that very little time has elapsed  since the collapse of the Soviet totalitarian system, we should  not be surprised that such a short period of time has been  extremely dramatic. I believe that the world should take a  better look at these processes. The changes that have occurred  on our planet since the collapse of the Soviet Union are the  subject of a separate discussion and the events in our region  are taking place precisely against the background of this  process. We have to take into account that not all the people  were ready for independence. We are now passing through this  difficult school. I firmly believe that we will achieve  stability and that the Caucasus will likewise become a stable  region. I would like to highlight two points here: 1. The  importance of the CIS, if only from the point of view that it is  necessary to revive the economy and it is impossible to do this  unless ties are restored between the republics of the former  Soviet Union; 2. The great unification of neighboring  countries. The foundations for such an alliance have already  been laid between the CIS and the countries of the Black Sea  basin. Their principles of collective security are gradually  coinciding and I believe that Europe and NATO should direct  their attention to such regions as the Caucasus. The Caucasus  is no less an explosive region than the Balkans. Therefore, I  think that, in order to achieve peace, we have to implement  collective measures. An explosion in the Caucasus could have  the most serious consequences on a global scale, if we take into  account what states could become involved in such a conflict. I  would like to be more optimistically minded and think about  peace and stability.    [Chiseri] As the program is coming to an end, we would like  to draw certain conclusions: You correctly pointed out that one  important factor that created a big danger to peace was  aggressive separatism. Don't you think that there exist many  reasons in the world for such a danger, for example, Islamic  integration, which has surfaced in your region as well?    [Shevardnadze]I don't think this is the main reason.  Such countries as Georgia have a centuries-old experience of  religious coexistence. In this small country, whose population  is only some 5 million, members of the Orthodox Church, Muslims,  members of the Armenian national church [grigorianelebi], and  Catholics have lived together for centuries. Georgians and Jews  have lived together for 26 centuries and there have never been  any conflicts between them, either of a religious or any other  nature. It is precisely because we are located on the border  between Islam and Christianity that history has enabled us to  acquire experience, on the basis of which I am able to say that  Georgians will live peacefully with people of all religions. I  believe that it is possible to achieve a peaceful and stable  situation. We also have to take into account the economic  crisis. I think that, as soon as we overcome our economic  difficulties, it will become easier for us to achieve stability  as well.    [Napoli] We have been speaking of Islam and Zhirinovskiy's  "secret weapon," but the greatest danger to Europe is presented  by those four republics, in particular Ukraine, that were left  with nuclear weapons following the collapse of the Soviet Union.    [Shevardnadze]I have very close relations with  Ukraine's political forces. I know very well how they are  disposed to this issue and I believe that the existence of  nuclear weapons in Ukraine is being dramatized too much. The  right course was not taken from the very start when we should  have spoken with Ukraine as a country that possesses nuclear  weapons. All the different nuances were not taken into account  in time. I am certain that Ukraine will adhere to a position  that befits a civilized country. I do not think that Ukraine  presents any threat. I exclude such a danger.    [Unidentified correspondent] I would like to ask you a  question that any Italian might ask. You were a great friend of  Gorbachev. Some three years ago, you separated from one another  amid great uproar. Have you maintained personal relations with  him? Do you think that Gorbachev is planning a political  comeback?    [Shevardnadze]As regards my personal relations with  Gorbachev, they are excellent. I respect him greatly and  believe that he is one of the greatest persons of our century.  As for his political future, I do not think that my good friend  has a big political future. However, politics is full of  paradoxes and one cannot exclude anything. If we reason  according to the established laws of society, we should conclude  that he has already fulfilled his mission and he will probably  not be given the chance to embark on another.(passage  omitted]    [Unidentified correspondent] What is your personal view of  U.S. President Clinton?    [Shevardnadze]I believe that the American people have  elected a worthy president.    [Cassieri] A few months before his departure from the  political arena, Gorbachev said in self-criticism that the  unification of the two Germanies had been a premature step, a  political mistake [defekti]. The same has been said by U.S.  Secretary of State Christopher. If you were speaking as foreign  minister, what would you say in self-criticism?    [Shevardnadze]Regarding the unification of Germany, I  believe it came too late. If this unification had occurred  earlier, say in 1986, it would have been better. As for  self-criticism, had both Gorbachev and I been able to control  the collapse of the empire, this, naturally, would have spared  us many problems. [passage omitted]</p>

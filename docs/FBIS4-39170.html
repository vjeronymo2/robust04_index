It envisages a change from taxing  enterprises' income to taxing their profits. Vitaliy Ilyin, the  head of our state's state tax inspectorate, stated this in an  interview for the press. He emphasized that the introduction of  new legislative acts was planned for this year, 1994. But it  was impossible to implement this in conditions of an economic  crisis and inflation.</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Housing market turnover halved TURNOVER in the housing market has roughly halved since 1988, Inland Revenue statistics indicated yesterday. The total number of housing transactions in 1988 was 2.12m. In the year to October this yearthey fell by 11 per cent to 1.08m, equivalent to 7 per cent of the owner-occupied housing stock. A report published by the Valuation Office, an Inland Revenue agency, said most deals arose from events such as job relocation or repossession. 'Very few are in consequence of a desire to move in and trade up in the market,' it said. Residential land values have fallen by about 23 per cent in London and 5 per cent in the north and north-west of England. 'What little optimism there was 12 months ago has gone,' the report added. The pace of decline in agricultural property had slowed in the past year except for dairy farms in the south-west and Wales. Arable farm values had fallen by 8 per cent, mixed farm values by 7 per cent and dairy and hill farms by 6 per cent since October last year. Across the country there was a big drop in the number of agricultural sales over the past six months. Most deals involved small parcels of land rather than whole farms. The report said the property investment market had continued to re-establish itself, albeit at lower levels. The report said the market in industrial property had virtually dried up in much of the country in the past six months. Development land values dropped 10 per cent in the six months to September 30, with a 17 per cent decline over the previous 12 months. Wales and the west Midlands were the most resilient parts of the country. The Property Market Report, published twice a year, is compiled from information supplied by 117 district valuers in England, Scotland and Wales. Meanwhile, Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth-largest building society, yesterday announced 400 job losses over the next one to two years. The cuts will result in the loss of a quarter of the staff at each of Alliance &amp; Leicester's administrative centres at Oadby, near Leicester and Hove, East Sussex. The cuts are expected to be shared evenly between the two centres, which employ 800 people each. Alliance &amp; Leicester said it was looking for voluntary redundancies; most of the job losses would be clerical. It said Alliance &amp; Leicester would not be closing any of its 412 branches, although there would be a review of branch staffing numbers in January. In March the society announced 85 jobs cuts in junior to senior management. The number of houses started by builders fell to 11,800 in October from 14,200 in the same month last year, government figures showed yesterday. There were 13,600 completions compared with 16,200 last year. Starts for the quarter to October were down 7 per cent compared with the previous quarter and 11 per cent from the same quarter last year. Property Market Report.

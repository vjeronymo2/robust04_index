			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLONIAL CUISINE IN BEVERLY HILLS;  </P> <P> RANGOON RACQUET CLUB AIMS FOR THE IMAGE OF A GENTLEMEN'S CLUB IN THE GOOD DAYS  IN BURMA  </P> <P> If Ralph Lauren ever does a Burmese collection, he ought to shoot the ads at  Beverly Hills' Rangoon Racquet Club. The place is said to be modeled after the  original Rangoon Racquet Club in the capital of Myanmar (formerly known as  Burma), and its owner, Emanuel Zwaaf, served in Burma during World War II.  </P> <P> The stylistic conceit of the place is of a comfortable colonial gentlemen's  club in Southeast Asia. Latticework frames the room, which is cooled by  slow-rotating ceiling fans. A jungle-scene mural dominates one wall. And the  waiters are dressed to look as if they might have just stepped out of one the  restaurant's many photos of Victorian-era colonial troops.  </P> <P> Polite intimations of the exotic aside, the restaurant promises comfort and  good food of an attractively old-fashioned sort. The room is lit just brightly  enough, and with a warm glow. The spacious red leather-look booths practically  beg to be slid into. And the menu is large, varied and tantalizing, suggesting  a cross between Trader Vic's and something like the old Brown Derby, with maybe  a touch of the Bistro thrown in.  </P> <P> But once you've been in the place for a few minutes, the pukka-sahib routine  begins to pale: It starts to seem like a very short trip from here to the  Elephant Bar, visually at least -- and anyway, maybe mock nostalgia for British  colonialism isn't exactly the most appropriate restaurant theme today. And  those booths resist sliding, because the seat portions aren't leather at all,  but a rough-textured fabric that clings to trousers and dresses. Most  disappointing of all, though, the food is all over the map in quality as well  as in geographical origin.  </P> <P> Dinners start off well enough with a complimentary "Scotch egg," an egg  hard-boiled, then baked in a thin pastry crust stuffed with ground veal and  beef. Also on the house are long tongues of delicious cheese toast and an  assortment of pickled peppers and olives.  </P> <P> Beyond these beginnings, the food is sometimes just what it ought to be in a  place like this: Crab-and-shrimp lumpia is a single crisp egg roll with a  well-seasoned seafood filling, served with orange-marmalade mustard and  Indonesian-style catsup and an excellent concoction from Malaysia called  Lingham &amp; Sons Chilly Sauce, salty-sweet and amiably hot. Cream of clams,  mussels and shrimp is a rich and pleasing soup, if not exactly bursting with  fresh shellfish flavor. Oysters Serangoon, oysters glazed with curry sauce and  returned to their shells atop a bed of spinach, are very good. And the  restaurant's well-loved cold peanut soup, full of shredded chicken, remains an  unusual and appealing specialty.  </P> <P> Another of the restaurant's specialties, chili made according to former Wrather  Corp. executive and perennial chili contest winner C.V. Wood's award-winning  recipe, is full of flavor, if not particularly spicy. But it is garnished with  bland, cardboardy restaurant-supply-company tortilla chips, which no serious  restaurant in Los Angeles has any business serving.  </P> <P> Lean slices of calf's liver, cooked medium-rare as ordered, were superb one  night, with a scattering of freshly fried onions on top. Chicken hash "21"  (based on the famous creamy hash served at New York's "21" Club) is a generous  serving of chopped dark meat in a lightly seasoned cream sauce, surrounded by a  piping of duchesse potatoes. It's sort of a silly dish, but it's comforting and  satisfying. And there's something appealingly luxurious about the thick,  custardy creme brulee, though the big globs of whipped cream and the chocolate  piping around the plate seem out of place.  </P> <P> There's something else more seriously out of place here, though. When the food  misses, as it often does, the failures seem due more to simple carelessness  than to any lack of culinary skill in the kitchen. Emanuel Zwaaf's obvious  professionalism (and frequent presence) notwithstanding, there often doesn't  seem to be a commanding officer in charge.  </P> <P> The problems begin with something as simple as the bread: French bread of  average quality, sliced from a long baguette, that on two occasions had been  practically cremated in the warming oven. Indeed, the smell of burning bread  wafts regularly through the restaurant.  </P> <P> One evening, a perfectly decent Caesar salad was ruined by ice-cold lettuce  leaves that had been improperly dried, so that the dressing was watery and  thin. Gazpacho, attractively presented with separate little bowls of minced  onions, cucumber, green pepper and croutons on the side, was obviously a little  too old or had been stored at too high a temperature one evening and had begun  to ferment.  </P> <P> Among the main dishes, of which the menu offers more than 40, steamed clams and  mussels in Pernod tasted of nothing but Pernod on one occasion, and the waiter  neglected to offer the garlic toast and rouille the menu promised. Shrimp and  chicken curry, elaborately served with an embarrassment of condiments,  consisted of one small piece of tough, overcooked chicken and three rather  tired shrimp, cloaked in a sweet curry sauce as thick as preserves. Maybe  British colonials in Rangoon liked their curry this way, but that's no excuse  for imposing it on L.A. diners.  </P> <P> On another evening, the sauteed lamb chops were tender and certainly of good  basic quality, but the thyme sauce with which they were coated was sweet to the  point of being sugary, and the accompanying flageolet beans were overcooked  almost to a puree. The RRC chopped steak was generous in size, but the meat  just didn't taste like much of anything -- at least until our waiter suggested  dosing it with the aforementioned Lingham Sauce, which fixed it up just fine.  (What does it say about a restaurant when the best sauce on the table comes in  a bottle from Malaysia?)  </P> <P> At the end of my last evening here, by the time the waiters had disappeared,  neglecting to bring the chocolate-covered walnut pieces that Rangoon usually  offers after dinner, or to ask if anyone would like a second cup of coffee or  an after-dinner drink, I was left with the inescapable sense that this  once-good restaurant just isn't trying very hard anymore.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rangoon Racquet Club  </P> <P> 9474 Little Santa Monica Blvd., Beverly Hills, (213) 274-8926.  </P> <P> Lunch Monday-Friday; dinner Monday-Saturday.

			<p>Qureshi   Claimed Plotting Return to Power   <F P=102> 94AS0265D Karachi AMN in Urdu 12 Apr 94 p 3 </F> <F P=103> 94AS0265D </F> <F P=104>  Karachi AMN </F> <F P=105>  Urdu </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Arrival of Ex-Caretaker Prime Minister"] </F>   [Text] According to one news report former caretaker prime  minister of Pakistan, Moeen Qureshi, is coming to Pakistan with  a package from the World Bank. It is believed that he will try  to convince the government to accept the tax reforms proposed by  the World Bank. The mention of a package from the World Bank  just when the budget is being prepared and the return of former  caretaker prime minister to Pakistan make the people  distrustful. Those who know the present situation are not  ignorant of the fact that the IMF, the World Bank, and other  financial organizations have always worried about Pakistani  people not having enough taxes. They also believe that the  people here do not have the heavy burden of energy costs as they  should have according to international standards. These  financial organizations do not like the prevalent rates of  electricity, natural gas, and petrol. In each budget, increase  in the prices of energy items and taxes is done because of the  pressure from these financial organizations.    All these organizations including the World Bank are unaware  of the fact that the wages earned by the employees in Pakistan  are much lower than international rates. They are also unaware  about the lack of such amenities as social security that are  given to people in exchange for taxes. The situation in  education, health, living, and employment is not satisfactory in  our country. The Pakistani people do not even know about the  international standard of living. In this situation, the World  Bank's assertion that Pakistan's tax rate is not equal to the  international level is not correct. If these monetary  institutions are interested in Pakistan then they should help  bring the living standards of the people here close, if not  equal, to international standards. When the people here have  international-level living standards, then we can demand  additional taxes from them    The wave of escalating prices that has drowned the nation  before the budget has ruined people's sleep. Prices of flour,  pulses, sugar, ghee, milk, meat, and other staples have risen  dramatically and artificially. It is a delusion to think that  this pre-budget increase in prices is just so they can call this  the budget of the people, and no additional burden of price  increases will be put on the people.    The fears felt by the people are getting stronger with the  return of the former caretaker prime minister and his mission.  The people are especially worried because he is bringing a  package from the World Bank. It is not considered impossible  that Mr. Moeen Qureshi will try to force the government to  accept these proposals. It is considered possible since during  his government he had resonantly announced, "If the future  government disagreed with my policies, it will not last."    The reliable information and the government's attitude  indicate that the government has already accepted the pressure  being put by the World Bank, the IMF, and other financial  institutions to an extent. The affect of this agreement has been  directly felt by the people also. Chowdhery Shujait Hussain,  former home minister and senator, has said in this context that  this year the budget will be prepared by the IMF and major  smugglers in our country. The government should understand the  deteriorating economic situation of the people here before it  implements the reforms suggested by the World Bank. It should  burden the poor with only as much taxes as they can tolerate.  The misfortune of the poor in the third world is that despite  political freedom, they are wearing the chains of slavery in  economic and defense areas. They can neither decide on their  economic development plans nor can they fulfill their defense  needs according to their wishes. Our country's tragedy is that  since our independence we have been subjected to unbearable  international restrictions. Pakistan has sacrificed its  interests for a long time during the Cold War between the two  superpowers. Now, the slavery of these financial organization is  its destiny. This plan to keep the third world in shackles and  ruling it is hindering the progress of all developing countries,  including Pakistan. Our government's lack of strategic planning  and tendency for expediency have helped the evolution of this  heinous practice. Our rulers have depended more on world powers  than the power of the people to save their government. The  challenge to this government that claims to be democratic is  whether it protects the interests of the people or those of the  international financial organizations.</p>

			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHILIPPINE PLOTS  </P> <P> Thank you for the excellent article on the former Marcos crony Eduardo Murphy  Cojuangco Jr. (Part A, Dec. 26).  </P> <P> One does not have to be a genius to conclude which Filipino businessmen and  politicians were most likely to have been involved in plotting and financing  the latest attempt to topple the democratically elected Corazon Aquino  administration.  </P> <P> As your own newspaper reported, ordinary soldiers were openly paid $15 a day  during the height of the stand-off in the Makati financial district. Reports  from the islands also tell of payments in millions of pesos to the rebel armed  forces officers.  </P> <P> But one thing that these businessmen and politicians seem to have forgotten are  historical lessons, ranging from Adolf Hitler to Manuel Noriega. Once these  types of people are in the saddle, among the first that they will eliminate are  the very ones who helped them seize power.  </P> <P> The other disturbing development during the latest coup attempt was the rebels'  breaking of the time-honored code that the physical safety of the country's  president not be jeopardized. There is a saying in the Philippines which  roughly translates thus: "There is no limit to revenge. . . ." Now that the  code has been broken, there is no telling what the fanatical elements of the  other side will attempt to do. That can only lead to more misery for ordinary  Filipinos.  </P> <P> EUGENE V. CORAZO  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     (Report by Charles Clover, Environment Editor: ``Shoppers'  Levy Planned To Fund Recycling'']    [Text] Eight out of 10 households will have doorstep  collections for bottles, cans and paper for recycling by the  year 2000.    The scheme, to be funded by a levy of one penny on every 10  pounds worth of supermarket goods, was presented to Mr. Gummer,  Environment Secretary, by 28 leading companies yesterday.    It should enable Britain to recycle 58 percent of its  packaging waste by the end of the century and is intended to  fulfill Britain's commitments under a new EC packaging directive.    The voluntary scheme will be run by a new industry body  called VALPAK and will cost nearly 200 million pounds a year.  That is less than a tenth of a much criticised 2 billion pounds  a year recycling scheme in Germany which Britain has accused of  swamping Europe with German refuse.    Mr. Gummer called on leading businesses such as Marks and  Spencer, Sainsbury's, Coca Cola, Tesco and Procter and Gamble to  draw up a scheme last year.    Yesterday he repeated his threat that legislation would have  to be introduced if the plan did not work.    The industry plan, published yesterday, aims to extend  doorstep collection and ``high-density'' bottle and can bank  schemes to three million homes by 1996. Mr. Mike Clasper,  managing director of Procter and Gamble and head of the Producer  Responsibility Industry Committee steering group which thought  up the British scheme, said the voluntary plan offered ``real  benefits for the environment at little cost to consumers.''    Mr. Gummer said that Britain was obliged to meet EC targets  which require the recovery of 50-65 percent of packaging within  five years.    ``I made clear when we invited the packaging industries to  produce a plan last year that the alternative to an industry-led  scheme would be Government action, which was likely to be more  costly, more onerous and less to the liking of industry,'' he  said.    ``I repeat that message today -- `doing nothing' is not an  option. I therefore urge all companies who make, use or sell  packaging to participate in discussions on the plan during the  next two months.''    ``As I said last July, we are quite prepared to move towards  a legislative approach if need be, though we prefer the  voluntary route.''    As Mr. Gummer welcomed the plan, industry sources reported  that furious disagreements broke out between the 28 firms  involved in a last-minute meeting on Friday. Procter and Gamble  and Coca Cola are understood to favour more collecting from  doorsteps, as they have done at a pilot scheme at  Shoreham-by-Sea in West Sussex, while other companies favour  concentrating on bottle banks and paper igloos.    One industry source said: ``This scheme is a mess. We are  now at five minutes past midnight and we're still all over the  place.''    A press conference at which the Producer Responsibility  Industry Committee report was due to be presented to the public  yesterday was mysteriously cancelled.    Incpen, the 20-year old Industry Council for Packaging and  the Environment, issued a strong statement immediately  criticising the voluntary approach adopted by Mr. Gummer, which  it said would not compel all industries to participate .    Mr. Peter Davies, chief executive, said: ``We support the  concept of this scheme but it must be followed immediately by  legislation to ensure compliance.''    The environmental group Friends of the Earth said that  Britain appeared to be doing only the minimum necessary to  comply with EC law.    Mr. Benedict Southworth, recycling campaigner, said:  ``Industry has been unable to agree among themselves, let alone  agree on a plan.''</p>

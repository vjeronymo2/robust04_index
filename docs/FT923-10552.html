			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Lotus seeks to join the bicycle race: John Griffiths on how the machine exciting Olympic hopes may be on the market soon LOTUS Engineering, the consultancy design and engineering arm of General Motors' troubled British sports-car subsidiary, is looking for a partner - almost certainly in the aerospace industry - to produce and distribute a roadgoing form of the 'supercycle' with which Chris Boardman of the UK is dominating Olympic pursuit cycling. It wants versions of the LotusSport pursuit cycle being used by Boardman, offering a more traditional riding position but incorporating the basic concept of a one-piece moulded monocoque frame, on world markets by early next year. Failure to do so may risk losing the benefit of the unprecedented - and largely unexpected - publicity for the machine. 'We could lose the market to makers of replicas which might look the same but lack its integrity and performance, ' Lotus said yesterday. Lotus plans to build a very limited number of machines over the next few months at its Group Lotus headquarters in Hethel, Norfolk, which has extensive facilities created originally for sports car production. The machines will be built for top competition cyclists and will cost at least Pounds 5,000 each. Lotus might go on to build up to 1,000 somewhat less expensive units a year  -forgoing carbon fibre at Pounds 330 a kilogramme and titanium at Pounds 150 a kilogramme - within its existing facilities. It is mainly interested in finding a partner to which it can either license the manufacture of a much higher volume of cheaper machines, a subcontractor capable of building them - or taking part in a joint venture that might lead to purpose-built facilities being created at Hethel. Lotus Engineering does not expect initial derivatives of the 'supercycle' to be sufficiently cheap to challenge manufacturers such as Raleigh in the highest-volume sectors of the conventional cycle market. But it believes there is scope for world-wide sales of many thousands a year towards the upper end of the market. The cycle is seen as presenting a potential challenge both to conventional racing and quasi-racing cycles and to the fad for 'mountain' bikes, most of which are unlikely ever to be used on a mountain but which nevertheless have a strong lifestyle image for which buyers are prepared to pay upwards of Pounds 600. Although Lotus lays claim to having done substantial development work on the cycle, and has invested some Pounds 125,000 in it, it is not a Lotus design. It acquired the rights to the machine from its creator, Norwich-based engineer Mr Michael Burrows, who had spent several years trying to interest a number of cycle manufacturers in his concept. The machine was unacceptable to the international cycle-racing authorities when Mr Burrows first attempted to introduce it three years ago. The ban was lifted last year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Edouard van Velthem: "Clinton Spurs Europe"] </F>   [Text] Has Washington decided to change its Balkan strategy  for the fourth time in four years? Officially, nothing has  changed: Support for the European plan, without forcing the  Muslims to accept a "shameful peace." However, there are a  number of signals in the background to suggest that President  Clinton has been convinced of the urgent need to find a  political solution.    At a meeting in Istanbul with his Atlantic alliance  colleagues, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe was able to  stress his satisfaction that "the United States has, for the  first time, shown a very strong commitment to quickly arrive at  a negotiated settlement." London is also said to hold this  view, which would appear to have taken hold during Bill  Clinton's recent visit to the Elysee [the French president's  residence]. Reports from the French and American sides are  consistent in underlining that, on this occasion, Secretary of  State Warren Christopher, who favors a heavy-handed approach  toward the Serbs, wisely chose to remain silent as President  Clinton agreed with Francois Mitterrand on the need to impose  the partition plan and that any lifting of the arms embargo  would risk extending the conflict.    An American colleague told us yesterday: "This is a subject  of great controversy in Washington, not just between the  Pentagon and the State Department, which is nothing new, but  also in Congress, where the `lobbying war' is currently raging  with reports of `ethnic cleansing,' and counterreports on `the  rise of Islamic fundamentalism in the region.'" In fact, in  recent weeks THE NEW YORK TIMES and THE WASHINGTON POST, while  coming down hard on Serbian aggression, have been reporting on  arms from Iran and the dispatch of new contingents of mujahidin  to fight alongside the Muslims."    As a result, the word sanctions has been revived to threaten  negotiators blocking the path to peace. The Sword of Damocles  certainly hit the mark when Germany hung it over Croatia,  forcing Zagreb into a reconciliation with Sarajevo. THE NEW  YORK TIMES, however, this time envisages a kind of reverse  pressure, whereby the possibility of lifting an arms embargo on  Belgrade would pressure the Muslims into accepting a compromise.    In official Yugoslav circles, too, people are more or less  convinced that "positive signals are, for the time being, being  sent to the federal authorities." These include, according to a  Serbian diplomat, "a degree of flexibility in applying  sanctions. Import and export operations have become somewhat  easier and we have even been able to ship 200 tonnes of raisins  to, of all people, the Germans."    The coming week should be very informative. The  Russian-American-European "contact group" without the  belligerents will pore over new maps for the partitioning of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The aim is to reconcile the "51/49" project  with the territorial demands of Sarajevo. They may well map out  "gray zones" based on the Unpas model for Krajina, in other  words, regions that fall directly under UN control.    Will there be a return to the reality of the French and  British standpoints when the interludes of American air strikes  and Russian deployment have been forgotten? It is not a  glorious solution for the international community, nor an  exultant situation for Bosnia-Herzegovina, but it may also be  the birth of common sense....</p>

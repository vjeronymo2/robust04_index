			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Labour tax reform 'could raise Pounds 8bn' LABOUR yesterday unveiled proposals for a series of tax reforms that it said could raise Pounds 8bn over two years without increasing the basic rate of income tax. The party also claimed families were facing an extra tax bill of nearly Pounds 8 a week in national insurance contributions, excise duty and income tax from next April. This was in addition to the higher fuel bills that would result from the plan to impose value added tax on household fuel. Labour labelled this the government's 'double whammy', in ironic reference to the Conservatives' advertising slogan used against Labour in last year's general election. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said: 'Even the family on three-quarters of average income is hit by the Tory double whammy.' Among seven proposed tax reforms, Mr Brown said the government could save Pounds 2bn over two years by ending the abuse of sovereign immunity whereby companies traded 'under the umbrella of' national governments - as in the case of the Kuwait Investment Office. He said at least a further Pounds 2bn could be saved by ending the 'underpayment' of corporation tax. He predicted water companies would pay 'next to no corporation tax right throughout the decade' thanks to Pounds 7bn of tax allowances. The Water Services Association, representing the 10 large water and sewerage companies of England and Wales, said last night that 'water companies are subject to the same tax rules as any other company'. It said the companies can offset some investment against profits in tax calculations. Because they are engaged in a large investment programme, allowances have generally been greater than profits. Mr Brown proposed saving another Pounds 1.25bn over two years by: Preventing companies from paying dividends in shares instead of cash to avoid paying advance corporation tax. Closing a loophole whereby capital gains tax and inheritance tax 'interact', enabling some companies to claim double tax relief. Not implementing the foreign income dividend for holding companies proposed by the government from November. Further sums could be raised by retaining stamp duty on share transactions, imposing a levy on 'excess' profits of privatised utilities, and accelerating the shutdown of business expansion schemes.</p>

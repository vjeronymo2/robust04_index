			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Bass advances 9% to Pounds 552m - Strong growth at Holiday Inn but brewing side declines 10% Brisk profits growth at Holiday Inn, the global hotel chain, allowed Bass to report a 9 per cent rise in full-year pre-tax profits despite a further fall in beer profits and sluggish performances from pubs and leisure. Profits for the 53 weeks to September 30 of Pounds 552m against Pounds 508m also benefited from an extra week of trading. Turnover for the year was flat at Pounds 4.45bn. Current trading was encouraging, however, said Mr Ian Prosser, chairman. UK consumer spending was picking up in areas such as pub retailing and soft drinks, although brewing was 'just grinding along'. The continental economy was showing some signs of improvement. Overall, the City was encouraged by the results and a few analysts raised their forecasts slightly for the current year. The shares, which had been weak in recent weeks on fears of mixed news from the group, rose 15p to 519p. Holiday Inn operating profits rose by 18 per cent to Pounds 151m. US hotels, contributing Dollars 203m (Pounds 124m), enjoyed increased occupancy rates and a modest improvement in room rates. Holiday Inn's best region was Europe, the Middle East and Africa with profits up 57 per cent to Dollars 22m thanks to aggressive promotion and UK growth. Brewing was Bass's only setback. Profits fell by 10 per cent to Pounds 140m (Pounds 156m). The company stressed, however, that the latest period included an extra Pounds 12m in duties and Pounds 16m in restructuring charges. The underlying fall in profits was about 3 per cent, one analyst calculated. Beer volume was up 1 per cent with Bass maintaining its position as the largest UK brewer with some 23 per cent of the market. However, analysts believe volume was down 1 per cent, adjusting for the extra week's trading. Bass reported strong growth in its national brands such as Carling and Grolsch lagers and a 6 per cent rise in cask ales. Pub profits rose 7 per cent to Pounds 220m. The number of managed pubs fell by 10 per cent but beer volume per pub was up 3 per cent and food takings rose 5 per cent in the Toby chain and 20 per cent elsewhere. Profits from leased pubs rose 3 per cent. Bass's leisure division reported a Pounds 2m rise in profits to Pounds 74m. Coral was the best performer, benefiting from a new format in some of its betting shops. Gala, the bingo chain, was ahead only Pounds 1m at Pounds 40m but will benefit this year from a trend towards much larger clubs. A final dividend of 14.5p is proposed for a total of 21.1p, up 6.6 per cent. Earnings per share were 40.1p, up 10.5 per cent from 36.3p. COMMENT Bass deserves full credit for progress at Holiday Inn which will likely continue for the foreseeable future. However, it is underperforming its competitors in UK brewing and pub retailing and it is finding it hard to grow turnover in a low inflation environment. A slow improvement in consumer spending will help it achieve pre-tax profits this year of about Pounds 580m for earnings of 42.3p. This puts the shares on a realistic discount of 8 per cent to the market multiple. Other stocks exposed to consumer spending or restructuring of the UK brewing industry offer better earnings growth than Bass.</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / TV operators face warning MR PETER BROOKE, national heritage secretary, will tell UK satellite television operators next week to move to a majority of European programming. Mr Brooke gave the warning yesterday in the first two-yearly report to the European Commission on the European content of UK broadcasts. He said: 'A number of broadcasters have yet to meet the targets for European and independently produced material referred to in the (EC) directive.' As a first step Mr Brooke will be writing to all the relevant broadcasters asking why they have not met the requirements. British Sky Broadcasting, a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the FT has a stake, is likely to be among those receiving letters.</p>

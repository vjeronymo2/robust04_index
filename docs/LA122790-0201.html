			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROWN PICKS 3 WESTSIDERS FOR POSTS;  </P> <P> POLITICS: TOM HAYDEN TO CHAIR EDUCATION PANEL AND IS REPLACED BY TERRY FRIEDMAN  IN LABOR POST. BURT MARGOLIN TO HEAD INSURANCE COMMITTEE.  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Willie Brown has announced that he will name three Westside  Democrats chairmen of major policy committees when the Legislature reconvenes  next month.  </P> <P> The San Francisco Democrat last Friday officially appointed Assemblyman Tom  Hayden of Santa Monica as chairman of a new Higher Education Committee; Terry  B. Friedman of Los Angeles as chairman of the Labor and Employment Committee,  and Burt Margolin of Los Angeles as chairman of a new Insurance Committee.  </P> <P> Brown made his announcement before the Christmas holiday, in part, to end  speculation about the posts, said Michael Reese, the speaker's press secretary.  </P> <P> Last week, Hayden announced on his own that he was stepping down as chairman of  the labor committee, a job he had held for two years, and would assume the  education post. Hayden's announcement came amid speculation that his Democratic  colleagues were urging Brown to strip him of the labor chairmanship as a  political punishment.  </P> <P> Legislative sources said lawmakers wanted to send Hayden a message that they  were displeased with a variety of his actions, including his role championing  "Big Green," the sweeping environmental initiative rejected by voters in  November.  </P> <P> Along with his labor panel duties, Hayden has been chairman of a subcommittee  on higher education. He had been urging Brown to elevate the subcommittee to  full committee status and said he could not turn down the offer.  </P> <P> Under Hayden, the education subcommittee has sought to update the state's  master plan for its higher education facilities.  </P> <P> In replacing Hayden as the labor panel's chairman, Friedman assumes leadership  of a full policy committee for the first time since he was elected to the  Assembly in 1986.  </P> <P> Friedman said he expects his committee to be at "the center of many big  issues." He said he anticipates fashioning legislation to ensure that workers  receive adequate notice of plant closures and, if necessary, are provided job  retraining.  </P> <P> The lawmaker said he also expects to stress worker health and safety  legislation and focus on employment discrimination, including proposals to  require equal opportunities for gays and lesbians.  </P> <P> Margolin could not be reached for comment on his appointment.  </P> <P> Insurance issues previously were handled by the Finance and Insurance  Committee. The new insurance panel is expected to review legislation dealing  with a variety of topics, including health and automobile insurance.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Litvinova, IZVESTIYA: "The Latvian Army: </F> `Green Beret' Experience Plus Soviet Training"]    [Text] The security of the state is becoming a priority for  the government; Prime Minister of Latvia Valdis Birkavs has  stated so. It has been announced that defense expenditures will  be increased, despite the runaway budget deficit.    Latvian military men are happy: So far the organizational  development of the armed forces has been sputtering for strictly  financial reasons. To be sure, helpers have come along. Germany  sent the uniforms of the former GDR Army, a little bit of  materiel, and sea cutters. This country is paying a great deal  attention to the Latvian army. The German military attache has  handed a present to Latvian Minister of Defense Valdis  Pavlovskis--two sets of high-grade picture and audio equipment  which are used in the conduct of military inspections. Experts  from Paris have visited in order to learn what assistance France  could provide. Riga requested assistance on the issues of  communication, transportation, military medicine, the navy, and  other spheres. Military instructors who have trained Latvian  "zemessardze" ("militiamen") have come from Great Britain. The  minister of defense of Belgium has offered army materiel,  weapons, and other resources released as a result of reductions  in the armed forces of Belgium. Finally, the Swedes and the  Danes have provided continuous assistance: This includes  consultations, materiel, and monetary subsidies. The Americans  are sympathetic: A military delegation has just visited Latvia.    In the words of Latvian Minister of Defense Valdis  Pavlovskis, a report has been submitted to the National Defense  Council analyzing where a military threat to Latvia may  originate. The content of the report is not yet known.  Meanwhile, newspapers have been writing about Russia in a harsh  tone, shaping their own concept of a possible threat and  potential enemy.    According to the Constitution, President Guntis Ulmanis,  commander in chief of the Defense Forces of Latvia, also heads  the National Security Council. But, of course, the Ministry of  Defense plays first fiddle. Latvian military commanders in the  upper echelon combine the experience of "green berets" and  participation in the war in Afghanistan; at issue are both the  minister of defense and the commander of the Defense Forces.    Current Minister of Defense Valdis Pavlovskis (who turns 60  this year) is a civilian. However, he has decent combat  experience: He reached the rank of captain in the U.S. Marines.  He commanded a "green beret" unit in Vietnam. As he told  journalists, he "taught guerrilla tactics" at an officer academy  in the United States.    Valdis Pavlovskis speaks Latvian with a slight accent: He  was  born in Riga, but spent his entire life in emigration.  Pavlovskis was active in organizations coming out against the  occupation of Latvia by Soviet troops. He returned to the  republic during the national renaissance period and soon took  the position of deputy of Talavs Jundzis, the first minister of  defense of independent Latvia. Jundzis, one of the activists of  the People's Front, now heads the Baltic Center for Strategic  Research. Valdis Pavlovskis was elected a deputy in elections to  the Saeima [parliament] this summer on the ticket of the  governing party The Latvian Way.    In an interview Pavlovskis complained that Balts abroad have  had to make a great effort to explain to the world why the  governments of Baltic countries did not even try to offer  resistance to the Red Army in 1940. In the words of the minister  of defense, if something similar recurs, we need to show to the  world: We are capable of fighting for our freedom. Commander of  the Defense Forces Dainis Turlais voiced a similar point of view  during a conference: "Our main task is to protect the country  against an aggressor at least for a few days so that the public  of the world and its organizations will be able to respond to  the conflict."    The order discharging Colonel Dainis Turlais from the Soviet  Army was signed by Marshal Shaposhnikov. Turlais, the former  chief of the operations section of the 40th Army (he fought in  Afghanistan for three years), gave up a promising career in  Russia, discontinued studies at the Academy of the General  Staff, and returned to Latvia to build its own armed forces.  Dainis Turlais is 43; he is energetic. The new, old-style  Latvian uniform fits him like a glove. In Turlais's opinion, the  Defense Forces of Latvia should consist of 10,000 people.  Attention should be focused on border guard formations. Rifle  battalions within the country should assist them if necessary.  However, the security concept and the defense plan which is now  being developed will still change because literally the last few  weeks have compelled many changes in the concepts of the Latvian  military, who are inspired by the support of NATO specialists.    For now, Latvian military cadres are being trained mainly  within the republic. The Academy of National Defense of Latvia  is housed on the premises of the imeni Biryuzov School, one of  the best in the former Union. The academy is headed by Valdis  Matiss, likewise a former colonel of the Soviet Army: He headed  a department at the imeni Frunze Academy. The current military  attache of Latvia in Russia, Gunars Alksnis, headed the  department of instruction at the same academy. Tactical  intelligence is his specialty. Latvian officers are also invited  to study abroad, but poor knowledge of foreign languages is an  obstacle. Incidentally, the language problem also surfaced  during joint exercises of the defense forces of the three Baltic  states: In what language are commands to be given so that  everybody would understand--not in the Russian language of  occupation, really? The minister of defense of Latvia ordered  that the system of commands and organization of communications  adopted in NATO be mastered this year.    Only citizens of Latvia are drafted for service in its armed  forces. However, some are not in a hurry to do their patriotic  duty. They evade the daily round of the army and desert their  units. Drinking and recruit hazing are flourishing. They have  already become the reason for fatal accidents. Here, two border  guards shot each other; there, a young guardian of the border,  after firing at his comrade. went further away from the post and  shot himself. The taunting of new recruits in a convoy regiment  ended in tragedy: Young soldiers driven to despair by outrages  in the unit decided to flee. Three Latvian guys tried to cross  the border in order to hide out in Russia, but the Latvian  border guards apprehended them. Some junior commanders were  relieved from their positions following an inquiry. Incidents in  the Defense Forces are dwarfed by the "glory" of the dashing  "zemessardze": loss of weapons, murders, drunken disorderliness.  "Zemessardze" ("militia," or literally "guards of the land") are  a peculiar structure. "Patriots make up the militia"--this is  how Girts Kristovskis, recently the militia chief of staff  (currently minister of internal affairs) characterized his  comrades. Activists of the People's Front and more radical  organizations of that time became "zemessardze." The trouble is  that patriotism is no substitute for training and discipline.  For a long time members of the militia in spotted camouflage  smacked of "Makhno's guys" possessed by the national-patriotic  idea. To be sure, attempts have been recently made to give them  a more or less civilized appearance. At any rate, there are  fewer scandals associated with these people, who are armed and  very dangerous. Evaluating the year 1993 in an interview to the  newspaper DIENA, the minister of defense observed: "The  relationship between the Defense Forces and the militia has  improved perceptibly. It is now much easier to find a common  language to achieve common objectives." Latvia was the first  among the republics of the former Union to introduce alternative  service, but soon gave it up: It was ineffective, and control  was lacking. Labor service was introduced, but it is virtually  defunct, too: There is unemployment in the state, and those who  draw benefits for months do not have enough slots to use their  energies. The Ministry of Defense has developed new rules for  induction into the military service: It is envisioned reducing  the number of categories of individuals ineligible for the  draft. However, the plan is to reduce the duration of service to  one year, with the exception of those who will have to master  advanced materiel.    How many soldiers are there in the Latvian army? According  to  data from the newspaper NEATKARIGA CINA, at present the Defense  Forces have 1,500 soldiers and 150 officers. Six hundred  soldiers and 30 officers serve in the naval forces. At the  border, 338,000 [as published] soldiers and 340 officers are in  the service. The navy consists of 15 vessels (nine are on full  readiness). The air force has two An-2 planes and two L-410's  (one is in operation). There are six helicopters. The Latvian  army has to date been using mainly former Soviet weapons. A  batch of Czech assault rifles has been purchased. Head of the  Cabinet of Ministers Valdis Birkavs stated that Latvia, like  Estonia, intends to buy weapons from Israel.    Since the beginning of the year the armed forces of the  three  Baltic states have noticeably stepped up coordination of their  actions. Preparations are underway for joint exercises of rifle  companies; in February they will be held in Estonia, in July--in  Lithuania, and in October--in Latvia. As Chairman of the Foreign  Affairs Commission Aleksandrs Kirsteins said, pooling their  efforts will make it possible for the Baltic states to create a  powerful echelon of defense against a potential aggressor.</p>

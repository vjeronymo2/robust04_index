			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses mixed as investors urged to hold cash A mixed pattern was seen among the Continent's bourses. Merrill Lynch said yesterday that it was recommending a reduction of its equity holding in preference to cash. It said that it recommended investors to 'hold a cash position that is three to four times what we would regard as normal weight at 8 per cent to 12 per cent for equity portfolios and 12 per cent to 18 per cent for balanced funds'. Merrill said the chance that markets would be flat to lower during the next few months suggested that investors should search for an alternative to equities. ZURICH saw Roche return to centre stage as Goldman Sachs removed the shares from its European recommended for purchase list. The SMI index finished 9.1 down at 2,628.6, having recovered from a low of 2,611.9. Roche certificates closed SFr105 down at SFr6,050 but up from a day's low of SFr5,940, as Goldman Sachs explained its move, saying that growth in the pharmaceuticals industry slowed in the first half of 1994 as market forces in the US and health care cost reforms in Europe took effect. Other factors included a reduction in the long term growth rates for major divisions, the impact of the Syntex acquisition, disappointing second-quarter sales, the Swiss franc's strength, and a decrease in net cash. Nestle, SFr14 lower in the immediate aftermath of its six months' figures, which were at the bottom end of expectations, picked up to finish SFr4 easier at SFr1,216. Against the trend, bargain hunting among cyclicals took BBC bearers SFr18 higher to SFr1,190. Ascom put on SFr20 at SFr1,620. Merrill Lynch commented that market expectations were still fairly high and that a number of areas might still cause disappointment in the market over the next 12 to 18 months. It was too early to ascertain the success of the company's actions to date, but from very cautious comments made last week by the finance director, it was clearly going to be some time before a significant growth in earnings was seen. FRANKFURT eased back ahead of today's futures and options expiry. The DAX index lost 10.14 at 2,113.98, down from an intraday high of 2,129.50. The Ibis indicated DAX closed at 2,129.36. Turnover came to DM6bn. The Bundesbank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged came as no surprise. Lufthansa added 50 pfennigs at DM199 after announcing that its supervisory board had agreed to a corporate restructuring - the freight, technical and systems divisions are to start to operate as legally separate units from the beginning of 1995. The shares improved to DM200.70 in late trading. MILAN was pulled higher by gains in bonds and some short covering on the last day of the September account. The Comit index moved forward 6.41 to 661.34. Insurers again led the market, on expectations that they will benefit from government reform of the pension system. Generali picked up L700, or 1.7 per cent, to L42.250, also helped by demand ahead of the start of its one-for-10 rights issue that begins today. Ras put on L900, or 3.7 per cent, at L24,950 and Fondiaria was L380, or 3.6 per cent, ahead at L11,800. Banks featured BCI, which bounced L140, or 3.8 per cent, to L3,810 in what was seen as a delayed reaction to the end of its rights issue last week. Olivetti, which said it had increased its share of the European personal computer market, strengthened L75, or 3.7 per cent, to L2,080. PARIS finished more than 1 per cent higher, helped by a firmer bond market. The CAC-40 index was finally up 24.36 at 1,977.30, off the session's high of 1,981.60. Turnover was about 3bn. Saint-Gobain, which released favourable half-year figures after the close, climbed FFr12 to FFr642. Chargeurs ended unchanged at FFr1,460 after reporting that it had returned to profit in the first half. AMSTERDAM was interested in Nutricia on speculation that it might be a takeover candidate for Heinz. The stock advanced Fl 2.80 to Fl 88. The AEX index put on 1.05 at 411.61, after a high of 411.84. STOCKHOLM was higher in response to lower debt market yields and the performance of other European markets. The Affarsvarlden index rose 7.5 to 1,461.9 in very high turnover of SKr3.6bn. Analysts suggested that many investors who expected the Social Democrats to win Sunday's general election were taking advantage of the current tax rules to sell. The party has said it will raise tax on share trade gains. MADRID was boosted by a recovery in the domestic bond market and heavy buying in banks, and the general index gained 4.07 at 304.44 in moderate turnover of Pta28.7bn.

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Industrial production in E. Germany down 3.2 per cent Industrial production in eastern Germany was down by 3.2 per cent in July and August, against the same period of 1991, according to the Economics Ministry, writes Quentin Peel. The figures continue to show large fluctuations between months and sectors, and no sign of sustained economic recovery. For example, mining output was down 23.5 per cent over the full year, but up by 14 per cent in August, compared with July. The best performances (on unadjusted figures) were in consumer goods and food processing, where production over the year was up 5 per cent. Construction activity was up by 4.7 per cent. Meanwhile, Reuter reports engineering orders fell by 2 per cent in real terms in September from a year earlier, according to the industry association. It said third-quarter orders were 9 per cent below those in the corresponding 1991 period. Domestic orders in September were down by 2 per cent and foreign orders by 1 per cent. For the three-month period, both foreign and domestic orders were 9 per cent lower compared to a year earlier.</p>

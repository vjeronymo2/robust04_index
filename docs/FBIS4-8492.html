			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Belgrade, April 12 (AFP) -- The Yugoslav  information ministry said Tuesday [12 April] it was withdrawing  press accreditation from AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE [AFP] and Cable  News Network (CNN), accusing them of waging a "media war"  against Belgrade.    The exact reason for the move was not immediately clear.    AFP management strongly protested the measure, calling for  the decision to be reversed. [passage omitted]    An AFP management statement said: "AFP has followed the  ethical rules of the profession rigidly and in all areas, over  the several decades it has been in Yugoslavia."    The cause of the Yugoslav action was not immediately clear.  It came after NATO air raids on Bosnian Serb forces besieging  the eastern Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde.    CNN does not have a permanent bureau in Belgrade.</p>

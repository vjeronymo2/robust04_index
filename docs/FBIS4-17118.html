The first tangible results of the visit that begun just  today  was the signing an agreement on military and technical  cooperation between the two countries by Russian Defence  Minister Pavel Grachev and Golhan in Moscow on Wednesday.    During the talks, the two ministers discussed Russia's  peace-keeping activity in the United Nations and the CIS. They  also focused on the restriction of Russia's positions in the  south, following the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the  emergence of the Commonwealth of Independent States.    The sides also touched upon the Karabakh conflict, the  Bosnian crisis and the implementation of the CIS collective  security agreement.    Grachev will have a one-to-one meeting with his Turkish  counterpart on Sunday to discuss prospects for military and  technical cooperation between Russia and Turkey and other issues  of mutual concern.    On Thursday, Golhan will lay a wreath at the tomb of the  unknown soldier in Moscow, visit the Mil design bureau and tour  a motorised infantry brigade.</p>

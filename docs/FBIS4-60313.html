			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Appeal by the defense minister;" date not given--read by </F> announcer]    [Text] Out of our concern for the lives of the misled and  helpless pilots and those who are under pressure, and out of our  concern for the safety of the remaining warplanes that are still  being manipulated by the rebellious, apostate, and secessionist  gang--being state-owned planes whose prices have been paid by  the people--we call on all those pilots not to obey the orders  issued to them by the rebellious, secessionist gang and to fly  their planes to any airport under the control of the legitimate  authority to ask for landing permission and to join their  brothers in the Air Force. They should be confident that they  will receive the same treatment that their brothers are  receiving in terms of rights and duties. It is better for them  to be at the side of the people, unity, and constitutional  legitimacy so that they will not be filled with regret after it  is useless to be so.    [Signed] Staff Brigadier General 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi,  the  defense minister</p>

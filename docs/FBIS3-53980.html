Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam, Foreign Minister Faruq  al-Shar', and Nasir Qaddur, minister of state for foreign  affairs, also attended the meeting.    People's Assembly Speaker 'Abd-al-Qadir Qaddurah and Prime  Minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi joined the meeting at a later time.    The talks dealt with the situation in the region, the peace  process, the Geneva summit between Presidents al-Asad and Bill  Clinton, and the prospects this summit has provided for the  efforts to establish a just and comprehensive peace in the  region.    The president briefed the Lebanese side on his talks with  President Clinton on the peace process and the need to advance  it on all tracks, including the Lebanese track.    Al-Hirawi, Birri, and al-Hariri expressed great appreciation  for the efforts President al-Asad exerted at the Geneva summit  for the sake of a just and comprehensive peace, and to explain  the principled Arab position that is in harmony with the  international legitimacy. They also expressed Lebanon's  thanks--from its president, government, and people--to President  al-Asad for stressing Lebanon's right to liberate its occupied  territories, and his call for implementing UN Security Council  Resolution No. 425, since it is an indispensable basis for peace  on the Lebanese track.    During the meeting, the conferees stressed the importance of  the continuous cooperation, coordination, and consultation  between the two fraternal countries during future stages of the  peace process. The Syrian and Lebanese sides expressed their  satisfaction with the development of bilateral relations.    The meeting was interrupted by a working lunch.    President al-Hirawi and the delegation accompanying him  returned to Beirut today.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Profit-taking trims coffee gains - Market Report London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures ended firmer but off six-week highs as profit-taking set in following a rally fuelled by trade, speculative and roaster buying and a bullish New York market, traders said. The November position, which had rebounded from an early low of Dollars 3,700 to touch Dollars 3,840 a tonne at one stage, ended the day at Dollars 3,773 a tonne, up just Dollars 18 on balance. 'It was quite a run, reflecting mixed buying and New York's rally,' explained one dealer. Both selling and buying here were technically inspired, he added. Other dealers said the London rally was encouraged by New York breaking resistance at 220 cents a pound in early trade. But the December position at the US market later backed off to 213 cents. COCOA futures closed lower but well off their lows after responding to a firmer New York market, dealers said. New York was on the upswing at midday amid light activity, they added. At the close London's December was down Pounds 10 at Pounds 1,013 a tonne after trading between Pounds 1,003 and Pounds 1,044. Market players were still awaiting fresh news of the Ivory Coast's crop, the dealers said. In its daily report private US-based forecaster Weather Services said the Ivory Coast's cocoa regions needed more rain as below normal shower activity continued in West Africa. 'Light showers are providing only some relief to dry conditions in Ivorian cocoa regions, and some reduction in crop production is likely,' the report said. Compiled from Reuters</p>

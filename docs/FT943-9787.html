			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Tiphook dismisses rights issue speculation Tiphook, the debt-laden transport leasing group, will report its annual results on Thursday - the figures had been expected yesterday in some quarters. The company blamed a mix-up with the Stock Exchange for the confusion, writes Andrew Bolger. Speculation that Tiphook might announce a rights issue was dismissed by a source close to the group, who said its five principal banks had pledged their support for four years and a rights issue at this stage was 'out of the question'. The speculation caused the shares to drop from 38p to 30p last week, but they were unchanged yesterday at 34p. Tiphook is expected to show a substantial loss for the year to April. The group escaped liquidation in March by selling its biggest asset, the container business, to Transamerica, the US financial services group, for an initial Pounds 673m. Tiphook still has debts of about Pounds 500m.</p>

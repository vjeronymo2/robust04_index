			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Beef ban threat begins to hit trade German threats to impose a ban on British beef imports because of fears over 'mad cow' disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) had already had 'disastrous' effects on the meat trade for at least one company, Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, said yesterday. 'It is having a disastrous effect on the company's trade with Germany and affecting inquiries from elsewhere. I'm simply not having it,' she said. Mrs Shephard is preparing a dossier for her German counterparts on the effect of renewed publicity over BSE on meat exports. Germany has called for a special session of European Union health ministers this month to discuss a ban on British beef imports. Mrs Shephard said she hoped the Germans would withdraw their request because it is supported by no other EU member country. Mr Mike Roper, export manager of Buchan Meats in Turriff, Aberdeenshire, said business with Germany had fallen 15 per cent in the past year because of renewed fears over BSE as well as the recession. He said: 'We provide a guarantee that our beef is BSE-free, but this is a popular issue in Germany and there is a lot of concern about it.' Germany imported about 900,000 tonnes of beef last year, but only 1,000 tonnes was from Britain - less than 1 per cent of total British beef exports to the EU. British beef exports to the EU - 126,000 tonnes last year - have only begun to take off in recent years. The German health ministry said yesterday it would take no unilateral action to ban British beef if the planned meeting of EU health ministers could prove that no risks were involved in importing meat which may be contaminated with BSE.</p>

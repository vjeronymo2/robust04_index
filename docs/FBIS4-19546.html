			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Charles Lambroschini: "The Fait Accompli"] </F>   [Text] Francois Mitterrand, who is running short of  excuses on Bosnia, has now resorted to the fig leaf. By  proposing to his allies yesterday to set up a kind of grand  conference to end the war, the president of the Republic is no  longer even trying to find a diplomatic explanation for the  Western countries' passiveness. It is simply a question of  distracting the public's attention while General Mladic deals  the death blow to Gorazde.    The Serbs will certainly not allow themselves to be  intimidated. Gorazde is merely the latest of the "safe areas"  theoretically placed under UN protection which has had to suffer  a military onslaught. For several months, they have totally  destroyed the credibility of the United Nations, whose  resolutions have been just so many pieces of paper. But, from  their viewpoint, the Serbs have just done even better. Taking  up a challenge which the former USSR had always avoided, for  obviously much higher stakes, they have demonstrated that NATO  was brandishing a stick and not a sword.    The two raids by the U.S. Air Force on Gorazde last week in  fact conveyed a very ambiguous message. By making do with  destroying a few vehicles instead of carrying out a large-scale  strike, the F-16 planes clearly indicated that the allies  preferred negotiation to war. The same signal of weakness was  given by the French Naval Air Force in 1983 when, after three  weeks of consideration, it avenged the 58 who died in the  Drakkar outrage by bombing empty barracks.    Bill Clinton's embarrassed statements yesterday confirmed  the  failed action in Gorazde. For the U.S. President, the aim is  "to prevent the conflict from spreading." The leader of the  world's only superpower is merely finding reasons for doing  nothing.    It is true that it is very late. The Atlantic alliance could  perhaps have halted the Serbs if it had intervened immediately  after the start of hostilities against Slovenia and Croatia in  June 1991. NATO's planes would not have found it difficult to  silence the artillery which, in November 1991, pounded Vukovar,  and it would have been even simpler, a few days later, to sink  the gunboats which were bombarding Dubrovnik, that jewel classed  as part of mankind's heritage by UNESCO.    But why did the Europeans try to restore order in Somalia or  restore peace in Cambodia, if they are too timid to try to put  out the fires on their own continent? And why are the Americans  so anxious to preserve NATO if the soldiers of this alliance  have no other function than to march on parade days? Finally,  why worry about the rapid return of the Russians to the  diplomatic and military game when they are content to be in a  vacuum?    The fait accompli which is now being accepted in the Balkans  is likely to topple other dominoes soon. By bowing to the  Serbs' takeover by force, the Europeans are exposing themselves  to a return to the law of the jungle in the near future.</p>

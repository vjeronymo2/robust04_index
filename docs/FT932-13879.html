			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Bonds: Abbey National in Dollars 1bn offering ABBEY National, the UK financial services group, yesterday raised Dollars 1bn through a 10-year bond issue in one of the biggest Eurodollar issues by a non-sovereign borrower, further extending the maturity profile of its debt. The deal, launched at a yield of 60 basis points over US Treasuries, met a generally positive reception from investors, though it failed to sell as well as Abbey's record Pounds 650m sterling issue last month, also at 10 years. Joint lead-managers Goldman Sachs and UBS, which between them took Dollars 780m of the bonds, said late in the day that more than three-quarters of the issue had been sold. However, other banks involved in the transaction said they had been able to place only around two-thirds of their paper. The lead managers held the spread at 60 basis points during the day, in the process picking up around Dollars 100m of bonds from sellers. The proceeds of the issue are understood to have been swapped into floating rate sterling in a transaction handled by UBS, though Abbey refused to confirm this. The swap is believed to have left the borrower with an all-in cost at marginally over 25 basis points above Libor - the same after-swap rate achieved in its 10-year sterling deal. Abbey said the money would be used partly to refinance maturing wholesale debt and partly to fund future lending. At the end of last year, before the sterling issue, less than Pounds 400m of its debt had a maturity of more than five years. Explaining the decision to move to longer-dated debt, Mr Roger Little, director in charge of trading at Abbey National Treasury Services, said: 'Despite the fact that (US) Treasuries have performed very well, there is generally a view that interest rates have bottomed out.' Abbey's sterling deal, considered generous when it was launched at a yield spread of 50 basis points over gilts, has since tightened to around 40 basis points. A similar tightening of the new dollar bonds was generally seen in the market as unlikely. The same issuer's three-year dollar paper was trading yesterday at a yield spread of over 45 basis points, suggesting little room for tightening of the 10-year paper. Meanwhile, the triple-A rated KfW came during the afternoon with a FFr1.5bn deal in an attempt to pre-empt the heavy issuance of French franc bonds expected later this week. Today, Aeroport de Paris is expected to raise FFr1bn in the domestic French franc market, with the European Investment Bank also turning to the domestic market for FFr2bn on Thursday. With borrowers having held back during the election period, and with this week's cuts in French interest rates, the pace of new issuance is expected to remain heavy. Three triple-A rated names turned to the Canadian dollar sector yesterday to tap small pockets of demand from investors for four- and five-year bonds. The four-year paper, maturing in May 1997, was officially priced over benchmark government bonds maturing during 1996, creating attractive-looking yield spreads. When compared with the rate for four-year bonds implied by the shape of the yield curve, however, the spreads looked less generous, at 26 basis points for GECC and 30 basis points for Rabobank.</p>

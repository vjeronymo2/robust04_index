			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'DEVELOPERS, SPARE THOSE TREES'  </P> <P> Re "Developers, Spare Those Trees" (Aug. 28): I agree wholeheartedly with  Lorlaine Davis and her Trabuco Women's Club. I'm a marketing expert and I  certainly recognize the signs.  </P> <P> Darn right, folks, those developers are drooling over the thought of wiping out  the last best area of Orange County's wilderness! Take my professional advice,  protesters, fight these developers by using their own weapons and techniques  against them.  </P> <P> Their No. 1 selling point is the rural location. They intend to sell these  clone-like homes by emphasizing the naturalness of the surroundings, no doubt  claiming that the location will also enhance resale values. Baloney! In a few  short years, the view in Trabuco will resemble that of Westminster or Garden  Grove! Mile upon mile, an endless panorama of cloned homes, liquor stores and  pavement.  </P> <P> Get the word out, Trabuco Women's Club members. That "rural paradise" the home  buyers think they're getting won't be there very long.  </P> <P> Those who doubt this go to the Irvine Park/Santiago Road crossing and look  northwest. The people on those hills paid about six times the normal cost for  their homes with a rural view. That view is now paved over.  </P> <P> I'd personally consider buying one of the proposed new homes in Trabuco Canyon  a bad investment if my intent was to be living with natural surroundings.  </P> <P> FRED J.

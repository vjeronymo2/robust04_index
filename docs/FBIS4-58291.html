			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 2 May (MENA)-- Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has  stated that resolving Yemen's problem depends on the two parties  to the dispute and that Egypt is following the developments and  doing what it can. Musa said: We hope the clashes will stop, as  President Mubarak said. He called for putting an end to armed  clashes in order to protect Yemeni unity from disintegration.    Commenting on the results of the elections in South Africa,  Musa said the African National Congress had been favored and  expected to win the majority of votes. He remarked that this is  a giant step in South African history because, once the  elections are over, the road will be open to putting an end once  and for all to racial discrimination and apartheid, so they can  embark on a new era of democracy and majority rule. Egypt is  looking forward to the final results and the proclamation of the  new system in South Africa, he said.    Touching on the situation in Rwanda, the foreign minister  said the situation in Rwanda is very serious and requires  collective African action. This is what President Mubarak  emphasized in his messages and in his contacts with the United  Nations and the OAU, because it is primarily an African  responsibility. But it is also an international responsibility,  Musa said.</p>

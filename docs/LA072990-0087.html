			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-AUSTRIAN CHANCELLOR KREISKY DIES  </P> <P> Former Austrian Chancellor Bruno Kreisky, the most popular political leader in  postwar Austria, died today, doctors said. He was 79.  </P> <P> Kreisky was hospitalized with a heart condition last week and had been in  critical condition, one of his doctors said Saturday.  </P> <P> Kreisky dominated Austrian political life for two decades and was chancellor  from 1970 to 1983.  </P> <P> He stepped down as chancellor after his Socialist Party failed to win a  majority in parliamentary elections.  </P> <P> In 1986, after indecisive elections forced the Socialists to form a government  with the Austrian People's Party, their conservative rivals, Kreisky broke with  the party and even renounced his honorary chairmanship.  </P> <P> He had lived in virtual seclusion for the last few years, largely because of  his health problems. Kreisky had undergone a kidney transplant several years  ago.  </P> <P> He had received medical treatment for circulatory problems for some time, but  his heart condition had "seriously worsened during the last 24 hours," the  Austria Press Agency quoted Dr. Wolfgang Enekel as saying Saturday.  </P></p>

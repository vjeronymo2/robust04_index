James Rowe. But, he said,  beneficiaries of such a proclamation should first apply for this.    De Venecia, who was given by Malacanang a draft copy of the  two proclamation orders that would cover insurgents on one hand  and government forces who committed crimes in the course of the  counter-insurgency campaign on the other, said: "It (the  application) is not a condition but a procedure that is but  logical and reasonable. We cannot just go to the top of Mount  Olympus and announce that we hereby declare an amnesty. My God,  who are these people?" he said.    De Venecia said amnesty that is granted even without being  asked for would make the program vulnerable to abuse. He said he  would favor the inclusion of Juanito Itaas and Donato  Continente, convicted killers of Rowe, in the program. Both  have appealed their cases before the court. "I have not studied  their cases but in principle, amnesties should be wide-ranging  and general application," he said.    When asked how an application for amnesty would affect the  contention of Itaas and Continente that they are innocent of the  murder charge, De Venecia said seeking inclusion in the program  would not necessarily be an admission of guilt. "You're just  applying for amnesty," he said.    De Venecia expressed confident that the second amnesty  program will result in the faster resolution of armed conflicts  with rebel groups whose number has been estimated at 25,000.  The first was declared by former President Aquino. The amnesty  proclamation needs the concurrence of Congress. [passage omitted]</p>

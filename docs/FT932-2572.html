			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Indian environmentalist arrested Police yesterday arrested Ms Medha Patkar, India's most prominent environmentalist, and 85 of her supporters on the 15th day of her fast to prevent the multi-billion dollar Narmada dam project going ahead, Reuter reports from Bombay. The project will displace nearly 200,000 people in three states. Ms Patkar says the government must suspend work and announce a complete review of the plan before she will give up her fast. Police said they arrested her 'because her health was deteriorating' and to prevent any trouble.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Kobaladze, head of Foreign </F> Intelligence Service press bureau, by unidentified  correspondent; place and date not given -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Today we are starting a new series  of programs about the Foreign Intelligence Service. Radio  Slavyanka's questions are answered by Yuriy Kobaladze, head of  the service's press bureau. Russia's Foreign Intelligence  Service has only existed as an independent organization since  the end of 1991, when it was hived off from the KGB. Has this  separation proved justified?    [Kobaladze] I am convinced that it was justified. Several  factors show that this move was the correct one. First, an  intelligence service can never be a law enforcement agency. Its  existence within the KGB, as it was then, meant that the  intelligence service was expected to perform law enforcement  functions. An intelligence service should not carry out such  work. An intelligence service is a completely separate and  independent organization, which performs a special, unique form  of work.    [Correspondent] But clearly, there must be some kind of  legislative framework regulating the activities of Russia's  Foreign Intelligence Service, stipulating the bounds beyond  which its officers must not stray in their work.    [Kobaladze] Yes, we are very proud of the fact that a law on  foreign intelligence was adopted last year for the first time in  Russia's history. This document was very carefully drafted. A  great deal of preparatory work was done, and our experts were  brought in to help. Everything that exists elsewhere in the  world in this sphere was analyzed. It transpired that,  basically, there is only one country, the United States, that  has developed legislation in this sphere, a clearcut law that  regulates the activities of the intelligence service. After  taking all this experience, all this international, world  experience, and modifying it, parliament adopted the law. We  believe it is a very good law.    [Correspondent] The Russian Federation's law on foreign  intelligence clearly defines the powers and responsibilities of  intelligence officers and stipulates the need for parliamentary  control over their activities. What else does Yuriy Kobaladze  regard as being fundamentally new in this document?    [Kobaladze] I also wish to emphasize the fact that party  influence in the intelligence service has been completely  removed, and this requirement is now enshrined in law. In other  words, an intelligence officer cannot be a member of any party,  cannot get involved in party activities. Furthermore, the  service has been de-ideologized. In other words, we in the  intelligence service do not serve the interests of any party  grouping or ideology, as it were. We have only one ideology:  defense of the country's national interests, serving the  fatherland, serving the lawfully elected authorities, and  serving the constitution. We do not have any other ideology.</p>

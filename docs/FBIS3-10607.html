			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Presidency Minister Oscar Santamaria, </F> Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria, and Human Rights  Commissioner Benjamin Cestoni, with foreign and domestic  reporters and an unidentified moderator at the Presidential  Palace in San Salvador -- live]    [Excerpts] [Santamaria] Domestic and foreign reporters, we  want to announce that this morning we will be holding the  regularly scheduled presidential news conference from the  Presidential Palace. The president sends his regards because he  cannot be with you this morning. Therefore, I will answer your  questions during the president's weekly news conference.    This morning we want to inform all of the media in  attendance  that at the beginning of this news conference we will discuss an  issue of utmost importance. It is the human rights issue.  Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria and presidential Human  Rights Commissioner Benjamin Cestoni are here with us this  morning. Cestoni recently returned from the 50th Annual  Conference on Human Rights at Geneva. Previously, the foreign  minister himself had been in Geneva.    We want to devote the first part of this morning's news  conference to this issue -- an issue we consider having the  utmost importance. We want to report to you that the government  is very satisfied that in Geneva, Switzerland, a conference took  place in which our country was included on the agenda -- the UN  agenda on human rights policy as discussed by the Human Rights  Commission that meets annually in Geneva. The conference was  held within this framework.    The Salvadoran case was analyzed from the different points  of  view. Diverse individuals who have dealt with the human rights  issue in our country took part in the conference -- namely, the  Human Rights Prosecutor's Office; Onusal's [UN Observers for El  Salvador] Human Rights Division, which also travelled to Geneva;  and, of course, the Salvadoran Government through its permanent  mission in Geneva. In addition, high-level government officials  also travelled to Geneva, as I have already mentioned. The  foreign minister and the presidential commissioner on human  rights also discussed the issue and presented arguments we  believe should be publicized in terms of El Salvador's human  rights policy.    We were able to establish that marked progress has been made  here in respecting human rights; this is evident. Based on  this, we have been working on a consistent, sustained policy to  improve and strengthen human rights. Proof of this has been the  diverse forums in which this issue has been discussed. During  the past year, numerous contributions have been made in this  area. Other human rights representatives who, on one occasion  or another, have visited the nation also have witnessed this.    In turn, we were able to make a presentation that we  considered fundamental. This contributed to the fact that at  the conclusion of the conference, the commission decided that  the Salvadoran case should be included in an agenda different  from the one in which it had been included up until this point.  We contended that the Salvadoran case should be viewed from  various perspectives. We want to be honest, and we want to be  realistic. Taking into account the progress we have made, El  Salvador should be encouraged in its human rights policy and not  be subjected to disciplinary action or punishment.    Sometimes it seems that evaluations by international  organizations on a given country's human rights situation focus  on what that country should do. We think we have done a lot.  Indeed, we have done a lot, and you are witnesses to the fact  that here we have not only one but a number of mechanisms that  have contributed to our human rights policy. They have all been  contributing. We have a Human Rights Division, which is part of  a human rights verification and promotion mechanism; we have a  Human Rights Ombudsman's Office, which also verifies and  promotes human rights; and we also have a presidential  commissioner for human rights as part of a policy that we  consistently carry out. Human rights are also handled by way of  an independent expert. As mentioned on previous occasions, the  expert has also been involved in human rights within the  country. We can possibly say that few countries have as many  mechanisms dealing with the verification and promotion of human  rights as El Salvador.    Nevertheless, I think there comes a time when a country  shows  proof and must say: We have progressed so much that we think the  policy should be handled differently, especially at the level of  international organizations. This is exactly what we did in  Geneva. We said that the Salvadoran case should be seen from a  different viewpoint or perspective, and that our progress has  been so significant and evident that we have sufficient reasons  and arguments to support our request. This is what the  international community heard.    Although the role of the expert continues to exist -- and we  have stated that there is reason for this -- his role, his  function, is totally different from the one he had in the  previous period. This is stated in the resolution I am going to  quickly read.    In (?Point 2), it states: The commission decides to extend  for one year the mandate of the independent expert for the  purpose of facilitating the advisory services for El Salvador  and of informing, in close cooperation with the Human Rights  Division in El Salvador and the Salvadoran Government, the Human  Rights Commission in its (?21st) period of sessions -- in other  words, next year -- regarding the evolution of human rights in  El Salvador as part of the Advisory Service on the Topic of  Human Rights. This is the name of the program we now have.    This is the government's achievement we mentioned earlier.  We are no longer under a process of observation concerning  violations of human rights. Instead, we have come under a  program which, as you heard, gives advice on human rights. This  is the context within which the Salvadoran case has been seen by  the authorities of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva, and  this is the treatment the country is now being given.    There has been a favorable response. We see that the  objective that took us to Geneva has been achieved. We went to  explain our reasons for the Salvadoran's being viewed from  another perspective and to say that we were willing to work in  the area of human rights within the framework of strengthening  and promoting those rights in El Salvador.    Messrs. members of the press, El Salvador receives this  resolution as encouragement, as a vote of confidence for the  work we have carried out. We think it is consistent with the  reality of the country's situation. This was my introduction in  which I wanted to tell you how the topic was viewed and  addressed. If you have any questions for me, the foreign  minister, or the presidential commissioner for human rights, I  hope you will ask them within the context of this topic I am  discussing. Thank you. After we address this topic, they will  leave and I will stay here to answer questions on other topics  you regularly ask me about.    [Moderator] Mr. Mario Jovel from the "Up to Date" newscast.    [Jovel] Good morning, Mr. Minister. I would like to know the  difference between the function or role that the special  rapporteur on human rights had before and the one he has now.  If the international community's eyes are no longer on the  country, might not this lead to the reemergence of lack of  respect for basic rights?    [Santamaria] I would like the presidential commissioner, who  arrived last night, to explain the context of the resolution.    [Cestoni] Thank you, Mr. Minister. Look, the difference is  substantial in terms of procedure. First of all, as the  minister read in the resolution, the report must be drawn up in  close cooperation with the Salvadoran Government. There must be  coordination on the information when providing a report to the  commission; this is done as part of the advisory process.  Previously, the report by the independent expert was based --  and [words indistinct] could contain this -- especially on the  analysis of human rights violations.    The topic is very specific. Topic 12 is called Violation of  Human Rights, and it is the topic under which El Salvador was  observed for 11 years. Beginning now -- and this is related to  your second question -- the advisory service is precisely  designed to strengthen the mechanisms that the country or the  international community have to protect human rights in any  country. In other words, we think that via the institutional  mechanisms we have as a government, we can handle the human  rights situation under standards acceptable to the international  community.    I want to tell you and the other reporters here that there  is  no country in the world that is exempt from observation by the  international community in Geneva. The topic covers the  violation of human rights anywhere in the world. This means  that these violations might exist anywhere in the world.  Nevertheless, I want to be very specific in stating that in the  case of El Salvador, the advisory service and our mechanisms  have led to the establishment of a favorable climate for full  respect for human rights.    [Santamaria] I would also like to ask the foreign minister  to  comment on the last part of what you said [words indistinct] or  not.    [Salaverria] I do not think so, but before that I would like  to tell you about the strategy we have followed with the human  rights commissioner and the Presidency minister. The Foreign  Ministry carried out a strategy to obtain the support of all the  diplomatic representatives in El Salvador. We also wrote to all  our ambassadors abroad. I directly addressed the foreign  ministers, and the president also held discussions with all the  presidents who could help us in Geneva. By way of this  strategy, we presented ourselves in Geneva to explain that El  Salvador did not deserve to be included in the group of human  rights violators. What we wanted was to be removed from that  group to alleviate doubts about whether El Salvador was a  violator of human rights. I think we have been successful. Dr.  Santamaria has already read the part of the resolution in which  the commission decided what it will do with El Salvador. But,  if you read the entire resolution, it commends El Salvador. All  of the paragraphs commend the work that has been done and the  progress we have attained.    Now, to be practical and to answer your question, we have  150  human rights observers here. They are working very successfully  and have helped El Salvador a great deal.    The appointment of a human rights adviser by the UN  secretary  general represents additional assistance we are receiving. This  is stated in Point 9, which says: We ask the UN secretary  general to provide the Salvadoran Government with the counseling  services requested through the Human Rights Center. In  practical terms, there is absolutely no difference between  having 150, 151, or 160 human rights advisers. The job they are  carrying out is destined to help the Salvadoran Government  improve its human rights situation. Ultimately, I think the  process will help us have a better society that will serve as an  example for the rest of the world.    [Moderator] Thank you, Mr. Minister. Jorge Barahona of El  Salvador's Teleprensa.    [Barahona] Good day. Mr. Pedro Nikkem is the UN special  human rights rapporteur. A few days ago, he prepared a report  with which you disagreed. My question is this: Is this human  rights adviser the same Mr. Nikkem who drafted the report  critical of El Salvador? If so, did you request that Mr. Nikkem  not be reappointed human rights rapporteur? Would not the  appointment of this gentleman place the government in the same  situation as before?    [Santamaria] I am going to ask the peace commissioner to  answer your question.    [Cestoni] We did not disagree with the Nikkem report. What  happened was perhaps a lack of communication on Nikkem's arrival  in the country. I had the opportunity to speak to him on  Friday. We both expressed satisfaction that mechanisms will be  sought to enable him to carry out his mandate. I want to tell  you that regardless of the name of the person appointed by the  UN secretary general, whether Nikkem or someone else, we will  assist him or her in carrying out his or her duty.    I also want to tell you that a new position has been created  by the United Nations. This position is the UN high  commissioner for human rights. Dr. Jose Ayala Lasso is the  first UN high commissioner for human rights. He was elected and  appointed last November in New York. The Salvadoran delegation  had the opportunity to get in touch with him to review the human  rights mechanism carried out worldwide by the United Nations.    I say this because the new procedures may permit us to have  the same human rights rapporteur or replace that person or seek  other mechanisms. The thing is that there is now within the  United Nations a Human Rights Center, where there are many  individuals capable of serving as a human rights adviser. This  will be a decision of the UN secretary general. We hope that  any person appointed fulfills the mandate of advising us. In  this regard, we want to make it clear that all countries,  especially El Salvador, will always require counseling in human  rights affairs.    [Barahona] If Mr. Nikkem is appointed once more, would you  consider this as a defeat [words indistinct]?    [Cestoni] No, no, quite the contrary. If a person is allowed  to continue in one position... [pauses] I want to make it clear  we have nothing personal against Dr. Pedro Nikkem. We clarified  this with Mr. Nikkem last Friday. We appreciate him very much,  because he has been close to the negotiation process since day  one. We want to make it very clear that we have nothing  personal against Nikkem. We simply want the mechanisms provided  by the United Nations to be definite to enable us to prepare  reports jointly. As you may recall, before now he was allowed  to prepare reports without even coming here. The idea is now we  will work closely together in drafting reports. At the end of  the news conference, you will receive copies of the resolution,  and this will give you a chance to read the part on cooperation  with the Salvadoran Government.    [Moderator] Thank you. Ismael Beltran of EL DIARIO DE HOY.    [Beltran] Good morning, Mr. Foreign Minister. It is still  unclear to me as to whether El Salvador has been exempted from  the group of countries considered to be human rights violators  -- a group in which we have been included in the past. Did you  manage to get us out of this group or are we still there?    [Salaverria] I can tell you that there are three categories.  Point 12 includes countries considered to be human rights  violators. El Salvador has never been included there. El  Salvador was included in the so-called Point 3 group, which  includes countries that were under observation and that may be  placed on the list of human rights violators or under the  category of those countries that must have a human rights  adviser.    Therefore, our achievement stems from the fact that we have  moved onto the category of those countries that are assigned an  adviser, which can only benefit El Salvador. It was a shame  that Mr. Nikkem could not come to El Salvador, but this was  mainly due to a misinterpretation -- to poor communication.  Nikkem was appointed as the expert to advise El Salvador in  July 1992, and his term expired in July 1993. In July, no one  told us, however, that his appointment had been renewed. After  his term expired, he wanted to come to El Salvador, and we asked  on what grounds he was going to visit our country because we had  never received notice that his appointment had been renewed. It  was not that we opposed his visit, but we wanted to know the  reason for it. Later, we were given the news that his  appointment had been confirmed in July. Unfortunately, by that  time Mr. Nikkem had become upset and said he no longer wanted to  come to El Salvador.    Despite all of this, we are on friendly terms with him, and  we do not believe he is trying to hurt us for the sake of  hurting us. It is a shame that Nikkem could not come to witness  the changes that have taken place in recent months, and that his  report was solely based on his observations during the months of  August, September, and October of last year.    Other human rights delegates who are visiting El Salvador  also attended the meeting in Geneva. For instance, Dr. Garcia  Sayan was there, and he issued a very positive statement for the  Salvadoran Government regarding the progress achieved in the  area of human rights. I believe we are at a position where we  can deal with anyone, be it Nikkem or any other person, on a  friendly basis.    [Moderator] Thank you, Mr. Minister.    [Salaverria] Excuse me. I need just another minute. I want  to make an observation: No country can be exempted from these  groups overnight. There is a procedure to be followed in this  organization. Things must be done and undone in a uniform  manner. Therefore, just as we entered gradually and ascended to  the top, we have also been exiting gradually. First, we were in  Point 12, where we stayed for a while, and later, last year, we  moved on to Point 3 -- where we might remain or be removed.  Today, we have reached the last phase of this process, in which  we have virtually gone through all observation mechanisms.  Currently, we have moved from the observation mechanisms to the  counseling stage, which is like going from night to day.    [Moderator] Thank you. Mr. Raul Mengen of Radiocenter  network is next. [Words indistinct] Mr. Fausto Valladares of  Megavision.    [Santamaria] I want to know whether you have any more  questions on the human rights issue, because our colleagues will  be leaving now. If not, we will drop the subject now.    [Valladares] Does this mean, then, that the [word  indistinct]  will not be able to report if there is a deterioration in human  rights? He will not be able to...    [Santamaria, interrupting] Look, I want to clarify one  thing.  The report can contain his perception of the country. We are  not denying his legitimate right to report whether there are  human rights violations in El Salvador, or whether we are moving  backward instead of forward. No, that is not the mandate. The  mandate involves obtaining broad powers to be able to report a  country's reality.    In this case, we managed to ensure that the report will be  written in an atmosphere of close collaboration between Onusal  and the Salvadoran Government. Why? To ensure an agreement  between the time in which an event occurs and the time of the  release of the report, because at times, as was the case today,  he could base his work on a three-month-old report because he  was unable to come to El Salvador. Perhaps this report did not  reflect the country's true reality when he arrived in El  Salvador.    We have never denied reality. We have welcomed harsh  criticism. Remember, we have faced very delicate and serious  problems. In the past there was talk about serious human rights  violations in El Salvador. Therefore, I think [words  indistinct] the resolution mentions the word offense. In other  words, the language that is already being used to describe El  Salvador is completely different. He, however -- and this point  is important -- is free to draft his report without having to  overcome any government obstacles. He is free to draft his  report as he sees fit.    [Valladares] At any rate, does this not imply that El  Salvador is under permanent observation?    [Santamaria] No, it does not imply being under permanent  observation, because, as I said, it is one thing to seek advice  to open a business; if you want to buy a house, however, you go  to someone to advise you on whether it is a good house, while it  is another thing be told you cannot buy the house because you  are unable to buy it. [sentence as heard] In other words, we are  talking about two completely different issues -- two completely  different analyses of the situation. I want to say that this  does not mean El Salvador has reached the end of the line, as is  the case with many countries. We are trying to strengthen  mechanisms to reach satisfactory goals.    [Moderator] Are there any other questions on this topic?    [Unidentified reporter] [words indistinct] there seems to be  some confusion as to what entails advisory and observation. If  this rapporteur appointed by the UN is going to be in our  country, or if he is going to remain in our country long enough  to prepare a report, will he not have already served in some  advisory capacity? Moreover, from the moment the individual  arrives in El Salvador he will be observing human rights issues,  either violations or observance of fundamental rights. Then,  according to the United Nations, the person appointed...    [Santamaria, interrupting] Of course. It is a fact that in  order to advise, the person must first evaluate. If someone is  asked to repair a house, I believe an engineer would first have  to check the foundations, the walls, and so on. We could  describe that process as the evaluation stage. Now, for him to  evaluate how we can overcome these difficult problems, we will  find that he will most likely suggest that in order for El  Salvador not to find itself in a position -- such as the one our  reporter friend here described as a human rights violator, as  classified by the international community -- then we must  increase this or that procedure, issues must be reviewed, and  certain institutions must be strengthened. In other words, the  general idea is that he is going to guide us in a way that, at  the end of the process, which is next year, we... [pauses] Just  to give you an example, by November when the next UN General  Assembly session takes place, it will not even be necessary to  discuss the Salvadoran issue anymore. By November we will have  been excluded from the General Assembly agenda. Today we are  being taken off of the Human Rights Commission agenda. In other  words, this detail is very important because, as I explained to  my friend here, there are steps to be followed. Listen very  carefully. In terms of New York -- the UN General Assembly -- we  have already been taken off of the agenda. In order words, El  Salvador is not going to be included on the agenda for this  year. In February 1995, at the Human Rights Commission, we will  also be taken off of the agenda.    [Unidentified reporter] [words indistinct] that our country  is excluded at the international level [words indistinct] but in  another analysis made in this case by the UN appointee [words  indistinct] human rights violation?    [Cestoni] Of course. The issue here is human rights. He  will come to analyze the human rights situation. If he  perceives that in the next eight or nine months we in El  Salvador experience a setback in human rights -- let us hope  this does not happen -- and there are serious violations, he  will obviously report them. No one can prevent the human rights  rapporteur from doing so. What we as government, people, and  society must do is to try to ensure that such a report, which  must be based on a true account of reality, be as effective as  possible in reflecting an improvement in the human rights  situation.    Let me add something else. When a government wants to do  something right, it does not wait for others to tell it what to  do. That is why it has been made clear that when the Salvadoran  Government requires counseling, the UN secretary general is  obliged to provide it. If we feel we need UN counseling, we  will request it; the United Nations does not necessarily have to  offer it. It can work both ways.    [Santamaria] I do not know if you have any more questions on  this topic. If you do not, I would like to thank the foreign  minister and presidential human rights commissioner for their  presence here to answer the reporters' questions.    [Unidentified station announcer] We are broadcasting live  from the Presidential Palace. Dr. Santamaria continues to speak.    [Moderator] [words indistinct] Raul Monge of Cadena Radio  Sol.    [Monge] During the past decade, the FMLN [Farabundo Marti  National Liberation Front] described the elections as an  electoral farce. Do you believe, as a government, that the  participation today of the FMLN in the electoral process, based  on peace accords, is sincere? Do you believe the FMLN will let  you govern if it fails to win the elections?    [Santamaria] Well, I think that the credibility and  confidence in one's actions is generated by deeds, not words.  However, this is the first time the FMLN has taken part in an  elections process. All Salvadoran citizens are aware of this  fact. If we base our opinion on words, particularly those from  the FMLN's top leaders -- namely, that they will respect the  results, regardless of who wins; that their participation will  strengthen the democratic process; and that this is the  objective of the FMLN's political participation -- then we would  have to believe that we are witnessing a strengthening of  democracy in El Salvador. This involves not only respecting  election results, but also respecting government actions  exercised by one person as part of the responsibilities of  exercising the government. [sentence as heard]    We believe words must be accompanied by deeds. This is yet  to be seen. I cannot give you any real opinions. Nevertheless,  what we have heard is that the FMLN will respect the elections.  In fact, this morning I heard an FMLN leader speak of accepting  the results. He said the FMLN definitely wanted to return to  civilian life, adding that overcoming the armed conflict was an  irreversible reality. We hope that the FMLN keeps its word.  [passage omitted]    [Moderator] Ismael Beltran from EL DIARIO DE HOY.    [Beltran] Good morning. Last week there were attacks during  several political rallies. One deputy who was hit in the eye  said political terrorism exists. What does the government plan  to do to prevent this? Will it protect political rallies and  motorcades?    [Santamaria] The cases that have occurred have affected some  political organizations. The PCN [National Conciliation Party]  is one of them. You remember that the PCN already reported an  incident at a public rally in an outlying city. It has now  happened to a mayoral candidate and his delegation, who were  attacked in a San Salvador market. Another member of Arena  [Nationalist Republican Alliance] was also attacked during a  visit to Apopa municipality.    We are completely opposed to these actions, and we condemn  such actions. This is really incompatible with what we are  trying to promote. We are trying to promote the consolidation  of the peace process and a culture of peace. This brings to  mind what we have just done in this country. The behavior,  attitude, and the way people act in these cases all contradict  the peace process. Moreover, these things show that there exist  people who still believe that the way to discuss the country's  problems is through violence. If we have a political campaign  and there are political opportunities to air our ideas, there is  no reason why we should respond in the opposite manner and carry  out violent actions. This is totally denounced, criticized, and  condemned by the government.    The public security institutions must respond to all reports  of such actions to guarantee the people's safety. We think that  those political groups and sectors that are staging these types  of actions to drive away or intimidate people... [pauses]  because we think this is perhaps their aim, they want to  intimidate people so that they will not go to public events to  support their candidates. We think this must be publicly stated  because, I repeat, such actions are not compatible with a  dignified campaign, as Onusal has been requesting. Onusal has  said the electoral process is admirable. At the same time some  people are resorting to these low and dirty tricks of attacking  candidates. We condemn these actions, and the government will  adopt measures to provide the support that is requested from the  public security institutions. It will enforce the law in those  cases in which they must be enforced against those responsible  for such actions.</p>

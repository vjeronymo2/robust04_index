			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Mitel cuts deficit in third quarter MITEL, the Canadian telecommunications switching equipment maker 51 per cent owned by British Telecom, reduced losses in the third quarter of fiscal 1992, but the recession continues to delay full recovery. The loss for the third quarter to December 27 was CDollars 4.4m (USDollars 3.75m) or 6 cents a share after preferred dividends, on sales of CDollars 97.1m. This compares with a loss of CDollars 6.9m or 9 cents and on sales of CDollars 107m for the same period in 1990. Sales are expected to improve in the final quarter. The nine months' loss was CDollars 13.7m or 17 cents on sales of CDollars 321m, against CDollars 16.1m, or 20 cents, on sales of CDollars 284m last time.</p>

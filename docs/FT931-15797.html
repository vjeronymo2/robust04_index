			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Arts: Spanish songs, French winds - Concerts Complete performances of Hugo Wolf's Spanish Songbook used always to be the province of senior artists. Even more than his Italian Songbook, it tests the expressive range and penetration of any singer, whether or not the songs are shared between two voices - as they were by Anne Sofie von Otter and Olaf Bar at the weekend (twice over) in the Wigmore Hall. Old memories were hard to suppress. This young pair offered a moral of earnest intelligence, careful pacing and any amount of good taste; that left much to be discovered yet. Both were happiest in the wry, romantic songs, especially on a teasing note (Miss von Otter was delightfully forthright, Bar good at comic defenciveness, though in piano his projection was sometimes frail). Darker undertones had to be taken on trust - the despair behind 'Ach Im Maien Wars', for example, or the numb misery in 'Dereinst, dereinst'. Which is not to deny that Bar made a good fist of the great, tragic 'Alle Gingen, Herz zur Ruh', nor that von Otter touched the heart strings with her Juliettish 'Geh, Geliebter'. Those, and many other prettily turned songs, were all from the 'secular' part of the Songbook where at the piano Geoffrey Parsons found his best form too - in some fleet, delicate accompaniments there is really no-one to touch him. The sacred or 'spiritual' songs 10 of them at the start) were another matter. Both singers were inclined to over-reverence, despite a lovely, floated 'Die ihr Schwebet' from the mezzo-soprano, and Parsons was unyieldingly stately. The baritone rose nobly to the wonderful 'Blendend ihr ins Augen bricht' line in 'Ach, Wie Lang die Selle Schlummert]' - but there was no broad lift from the piano, only an unchanging marmoreal tread. In fact, the 'spiritual' tempi struck me as considerably slower (and much less varied) than Wolf can have expected, especially with younger singers: stretching things out to the limit doesn't automatically suggest soulful depths. Some of those songs can grab you by the throat; on Friday we had to be content with suave, well-modulated singing, and the occasional sharper insight. A Poulenc feast in the same hall on Thursday (his birthday) had been more straightforward, and yet displayed more complex riches. Not because Poulenc  -even late Poulenc - outweighs Wolf; but because the clarinettist Michael Collins had assembled experienced wind-colleagues to deliver pieces which they know like the backs of their hands, and which reward such seasoned players with some of the most appealing music composed for their instruments in this century. To Collins himself went the late Clarinet Sonata, of course, and its companion sonatas for flute and for oboe were treated with no less expert tenderness and wit by Philippa Davies and Gareth Hulse. Richard Watkins boarded the difficult Horn Elegy (for Denis Brain) with rare confidence. The pianist Noriko Ogawa, mostly idiomatic and thoroughly musical, accompanied everybody with bright tact, and seized her opportunities in the big Trio with oboe and bassoon and the racketty, overflowing Sextet. A very good time was had by all.</p>

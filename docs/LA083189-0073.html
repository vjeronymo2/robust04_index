			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FOOTBALL '89;  </P> <P> CHANNEL LEAGUE  </P> <P> Rio Mesa  </P> <P> COACH: John Reardon, 22nd year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 4-6; 5th place in league, 3-4  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Rio Mesa has not had a winning record since 1985, when it  last advanced to the playoffs, and the once-mighty Spartans have won just seven  league games since. Reardon sees only one solution: "We need a game-breaker, a  kid who can rush for a hundred yards-plus a game or someone like that. I think  you need one to be a championship team. And I don't know if we have one." His  best bet appears to be tight end and defensive end Zelmer Lee (6-3 1/2, 210),  who Reardon says has attracted Division I attention. Along the offensive line,  Eric Paulson (6-2, 225), John Manachio (5-10, 185), Marco Cadena (5-11, 195)  and Matt McHale (6-2, 215) are the favorites to start. Scott O'Neil (5-9, 185)  will start at fullback and either Sal Balsano (5-8, 180), Gody Abelera (5-8,  170) or J.R. Nunnery (5-10, 170) will go at tailback. Senior Henry Wilson  (5-11, 170), a part-time starter last season, appears to have an edge over  junior Angel Lopez (5-9, 165) at quarterback. Fred Kim (5-6, 140) or Charlie  Thompson (6-1, 175) will be the split end. On defense, junior cornerback Sam  Garcia (6-1 1/2, 207) and senior free safety Myron Hart (5-10, 175) could be  among Ventura County's best at their positions. Darren Mitchell (6-0, 300),  Lance Roberts (6-2, 247), Gadiel Plazza (5-11, 200) and Lee will man the front,  Eric Lopez (5-10, 190) and Gilbert Gutierrez (5-8, 180) are the linebackers and  Carlos Cendejas (5-9, 170), Jamie Lidel (5-7, 160) and Abelera will join Hart  in the backfield.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Reardon, despite nearly resigning his position last spring, is glad to  be back, if that can be an indication of the Spartans' chances in the league.  "I'm happy I decided to stay," he said. "Otherwise I'd end up being a sports  writer or something." That horror aside, Reardon expects to compete along with  the likes of Santa Barbara, Oxnard and Buena for a playoff spot. "That's our  goal," he said.  </P></p>

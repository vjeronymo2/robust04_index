			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCAVENGER HUNT  </P> <P> Linda Deutsch's article about the HumanRace, the around-the-world travel  adventure contest ("Around the World in a Daze," Jan. 21), was entertaining but  unfortunately not very accurate. From the beginning, Linda failed to appreciate  that she had entered a challenging competitive race, not a relaxed tour where  she could socialize with her correspondent friends.  </P> <P> Realizing after the first day that she didn't have a chance of winning, Linda  became so caught up in her own anger she failed to see and realize that most of  the other participants were having a fantastic once-in-a-lifetime experience.  To say Linda complained is putting it mildly. In spite of herself, Linda  portrays the HumanRace as a fascinating challenge for the right person.  </P> <P> JONATHAN H.

Smart, Program Advisor, Los Angeles Regional Office, Federal Trade Commission, 11000 Wilshire Blvd., suite 13209, Los Angeles, CA 90024, (310) 575&hyph;7890. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has determined, as part of its oversight responsibilities, to review rules and guides periodically. These reviews will seek information about the costs and benefits of the Commission's rules and guides and their regulatory and economic impact. The information obtained will assist the Commission in identifying rules and guides that warrant modification or recision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At this time, the Commission solicits written public comments concerning the Commission's Rules and Regulations under the Fur Products Labeling Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Fur Act (15 U.S.C. 69) requires covered furs and fur products to be labeled, invoiced, and advertised to show (1) the name(s) of the animal that produced the fur(s); (2) that the fur is used fur or that the fur product contains used fur, when such is the fact; (3) that the fur product or fur is bleached, dyed, or otherwise artificially colored, when such is the fact; and (4) the name of the country of origin of any imported furs used in the fur product. Furthermore, the Fur Act contains invoicing, advertisting, and recordkeeping provisions. Pursuant to Section 8(b) of the Fur Act, ``[t]he Commmision is authorized and directed to prescribe rules and regulations *&blank;*&blank;* as may be necessary and proper for purposes of administration and enforcement of this Act.'' (15 U.S.C. 69f(b).) These implementing rules and regulations are set forth at 16 CFR part 301.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, Rules 19 and 27 (16 CFR 301.19 and 301.27) include provisions where measurements are expressed exclusively in inches or fractions of inches. Under Executive Order 12770 of July 25, 1991 (56 FR 35801, July 29, 1991), and the Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205b), all federal agencies are required to use the SI metric system of measurement in all procurements, grants, and other business-related actvities (which includes rulemakings), except to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms. To comply with these requirements, should the Commission elect to retain Rules 19 and 27 after conducting this review, the wording of these provisions will be altered to include the metric equivalents in parentheses beside the measurements in inches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 19(i)(1) (16 CFR 301.19(i)(1)) would be revised to read: ``Any person dressing, processing, or treating a fur pelt in such a manner that it is required under paragraph (e) or (h) of this section to be dsecribed as `color altered' or `color added' shall place a black stripe at least one half inch (1.27 cm) in width across the leather side of the skin immediately above the rump or place a stamp with a solid black center in the form of either a two inch (5.08 cm) square or a circle at least two inches (5.08 cm) in diameter on the leather side of the pelt and shall use black ink for all other stamps or markings on the leather side of the pelt.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 19(i)(2) (16 CFR 301.19(i)(2)) would be revised to read: ``Any person dressing, processing or treating a fur pelt which after processing is considered natural under paragraph (g) of this section shall place a white stripe at least one-half inch (1.27 cm) in width across the leather side of the skin immediately above the rump or place a stamp with a solid white center in the form of either a 2-inch (5.08 cm) square or a circle at least 2 inches (5.08 cm) in diameter on the leather side of the pelt and shall use white ink for all other stamps or markings on the leather side of the pelt.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 19(i)(3) (16 CFR 301.19(i)(3)) would be revised to read: ``Any person dressing, processing or treating a fur pelt in such a manner that it is considered dyed under paragraph (d) of this section shall place a yellow stripe at least one-half inch (1.27 cm) in width across the leather side immediately above the rump or place a stamp with a solid yellow center in the form of either a 2-inch (5.08 cm) square or a circle at least 2 inches (5.08 cm) in diameter on the leather side of the pelt and shall use yellow ink for all other stamps or markings on the leather side of the pelt.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 19(1)(2) (16 CFR 301.19(1)(2)) would be revised to read: ``A recommended method for preparation of samples would be: Carefully pluck hair samples from 10 to 15 different representative sites on the pelt or garment. This can best be accomplished by using a long nose stainless steel pliers with a tip diameter of 1/16 inch (1.59 mm). The pliers should be inserted at the same angle as the guard hairs with the tip opened to 1/4 inch (6.35 mm). After contact with the hide, the tip should be raised about 1/4 inch (6.35 mm), closed tightly and pulled quickly and firmly to remove the hair.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first sentence of Rule 27 (16 CFR 301.27) would be revised to read: ``At all times during the marketing of a fur product the required label shall have a minimum dimension of one and three-fourths (13/4) inches by two and three-fourths (23/4) inches (4.5 cm &times; 7 cm).''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These are technical, non-substantive amendments to Rules 19 and 27 which merely provide metric equivalents to the measurements expressed in inches; they do not create any new requirements. Thus, under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), no formal rulemaking proceeding is necessary to implement these revisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the Commission elects to retain Rule 43 (16 CFR 301.43), ``Use of deceptive trade or corporate names, trademarks or graphic representations prohibited,'' after conducting this review, it intends to update certain terms to reflect statutory and policy changes that have occurred since Rule 43 was originally promulgated. The phrase ``capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive'' would be changed to conform with the language regarding deception that is set forth in Cliffdale Associates, Inc., 103 F.T.C. 110, 164&hyph;65 (1984) and subsequent cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Commission solicits public comments on the following questions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Is there a continuing need for the Rules and Regulations issued under the Fur Act?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

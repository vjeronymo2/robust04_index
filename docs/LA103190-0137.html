			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN ARRESTED AFTER HIT-AND-RUN MELEE INJURES 4, SHUTS DOWN FREEWAY  </P> <P> An undercover sheriff's deputy, a trucker and a 6-year-old boy were struck by a  speeding car and another officer was bitten by a dog in a bizarre hit-and-run  melee that closed the westbound Pomona Freeway in the City of Industry for more  than three hours Tuesday morning, authorities said.  </P> <P> The victims were standing along the right shoulder of the freeway near the  Azusa Avenue exit, where the deputy's unmarked van, a flatbed trailer and a  passenger car had collided in a minor rear-end accident, according to the  California Highway Patrol.  </P> <P> Shortly after 8:10 a.m., a car that CHP officials said was driven by Thomas  Marshall Penick, 42, of Los Angeles, came down the shoulder at about 60 m.p.h.,  hit the three victims and sped off.  </P> <P> The undercover narcotics detective, whose name was not released, was listed in  stable condition with internal injuries in the intensive care unit of Queen of  the Valley Hospital in West Covina, sheriff's deputies said.  </P> <P> The truck driver, identified as David L. Butler, 42, of Long Beach, was  hospitalized with minor injuries. And the boy, who was in the passenger car,  was treated at the scene for scrapes and released.  </P> <P> In all, there were five undercover deputies in the van. Authorities said the  officers were on duty, but would not reveal their mission.  </P> <P> Minutes after the hit-and-run collision, a sheriff's patrol car arrived at the  scene. One of the undercover deputies hopped into the car, which caught up with  the suspect's 1985 Chevrolet Sprint about three miles away on the center  divider. As the deputy moved to arrest Penick, a black Labrador retriever  jumped from the car and bit the officer on the arm, officials said.  </P> <P> The deputy, who also was not identified, was treated at a nearby clinic and  released.  </P> <P> All westbound lanes of the freeway were closed at Hacienda Boulevard near the  City of Industry until about 11:30 a.m.  </P> <P> Penick -- who was driving on a suspended license, according to the Department  of Motor Vehicles -- had his jaw broken during a struggle with the arresting  officers, the CHP said. He was booked in the jail ward of County-USC Medical  Center for felony hit-and-run, reckless driving and resisting arrest.  </P> <P> Authorities said they have not determined why the Chevrolet was being driven on  the shoulder.  </P> <P> The dog remained at large.  </P> <P> "Luckily, this sort of thing doesn't happen that often," said Officer Dave  Boyland, a CHP spokesman.  </P></p>

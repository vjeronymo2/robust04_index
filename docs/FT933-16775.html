			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Italian corruption inquiry widens MR Giampaolo Zambeletti, the former owner and managing director of one of Italy's leading independent pharmaceuticals companies, yesterday gave himself up to Milan magistrates investigating political corruption. The move follows the arrest earlier this week of Mr Ambrogio Secondi and Mr Cristiano Steigler, respectively chairman and managing director of the Italian subsidiary of SmithKline Beecham, the multinational pharmaceuticals group. The group now also owns Zambeletti. Separately, magistrates have issued a warrant against Mr Claudio Cavazza, chairman of Sigma Tau, another leading independent pharmaceuticals group, and a former chairman of the Italian pharmaceuticals association. The arrests follow allegations that some leading pharmaceuticals companies paid large kickbacks to Mr Francesco De Lorenzo, a former health minister under investigation for corruption, in return for favours including faster product approval and privileged treatment in state-administered pharmacies. The allegations have been made by Mr Giovanni Marone, Mr De Lorenzo's former secretary, who was arrested earlier this year and whose testimony has been widely leaked. The pharmaceuticals federation, chaired by Mr Secondi, said it had given its lawyers authority to contact the magistrates and offer its 'fullest co-operation' in the inquiries.</p>

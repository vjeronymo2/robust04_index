			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRODUCT OF 4-DAY 'CRASH' SESSION;  </P> <P> COMMISSION TO GET LOS FELIZ AREA PLAN  </P> <P> The product of a four-day crash planning session for the Los Feliz area will be  submitted to the Los Angeles Planning Commission today.  </P> <P> The 83-page document proposes dozens of broad land-use changes as well as  specific building alterations that its authors hope will freshen up one of the  city's older regions without sacrificing the quality of an artistic,  pedestrian-oriented village that residents cherish.  </P> <P> The plan was drawn up by a dozen volunteer experts assembled by the Los Angeles  Planning Department and the Urban Design Advisory Coalition, a group of Los  Angeles architects, urban designers and arts professionals.  </P> <P> The planners spent a weekend interviewing residents and business owners from  the Los Feliz/Vermont/Hillhurst/Barnsdall Park area, then two days hashing out  and writing their ideas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arts Grant  </P> <P> The effort was one of five crash planning sessions being conducted in Los  Angeles under a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. The first,  covering the Van Nuys business district, was completed last October. Similar  plans will be done for Boyle Heights and Northeast Los Angeles, the Civic  Center and Watts.  </P> <P> Although the plan carries no direct force, it is expected to be used as a  sounding board for future decisions and as a foundation for government and  private initiatives in the community.  </P> <P> Among its wide-ranging and often provocative proposals are:  </P> <P> The use of density bonuses and mixed-use zoning along major commercial streets  such as Hollywood Boulevard, Vermont Avenue and Hillhurst Avenue, meaning that  up two floors of housing could be built above street-level stores and shops.  This would increase housing stock and contribute to the use of shops by  pedestrians, the planners said.  </P> <P> Creation of a parking management association and parking assessment district to  provide more parking for businesses.  </P> <P> Adoption of a pedestrian-oriented district to promote foot traffic along the  Vermont and Hillhurst commercial districts by encouraging cafes to "spill onto  the sidewalk and shops display their merchandise in large window displays."  </P> <P> A restructuring of Barnsdall Park, the municipal-cultural center built around  Frank Lloyd Wright's Hollyhock House. This would include renovation of the  house and grounds, construction of a plaza-style entrance off Vermont to unite  the park with its surrounding community and rebuilding of a shopping center at  the foot of the hillside estate to provide visual cohesion and parking for park  users.  </P> <P> Expansion of the hospital complex along Sunset Boulevard in a quid pro quo that  would involve hospitals such as Kaiser Permanente, Childrens and Hollywood  Presbyterian in efforts to improve Barnsdall Park, establish pedestrian  connections to a proposed Metro Rail stop at Sunset and Vermont and provide new  housing for hospital staff.  </P> <P> Creation of a shuttle to link the hospital complex with residential  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Cooperative ventures between government and private enterprise to build parking  structures near the U.S. Post Office on Vermont and the Lucky market on  Hillhurst.  </P> <P> Traffic measures to encourage the use of Los Feliz Boulevard, Hollywood  Boulevard and Vermont commuter routes while discouraging through traffic on  Hillhurst.  </P> <P> Differentiation of Hillhurst as a village-like retail shopping area north of  Franklin Avenue but with multilevel dwellings south of Franklin.  </P> <P> The framers of the document acknowledge that many of their proposals contain  built-in contradiction, particularly in connection with housing and traffic  circulation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Varied Needs  </P> <P> "Although the objectives of the regional versus local needs tend to conflict,  the plan must address the circulation needs of both," they said.  </P> <P> Similarly, they noted, the desire of hospitals to expand and provide housing  for their staffs raises concern about their intrusion into residential areas.  </P> <P> "It is important to maintain a 'good neighbor' balance with the hospitals in  order to ensure that they are a vital part of the community without changing  the residential character of adjacent neighborhoods," they said.  </P> <P> In spite of the disclaimer, the inherent contradictions brought an immediate  outcry from one Vermont Avenue businessman. John Leech, who recently opened the  bohemian coffeehouse, Sequel, after its predecessor, the Onyx, lost its lease a  few blocks away, said the plan smacked to him of underhanded up-zoning.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Proposals Criticized  </P> <P> "They're planning to triple the density on Hollywood Boulevard from Vermont to  Hillhurst," Leech said. "These guys are trying to creep in the back door and  not calling it rezoning, give them density bonuses. It'll create tremendous  traffic problems.  </P> <P> "I really think that the city planning people have already been talking to the  hospitals and the hospital developers and have pretty much in principle agreed  to what they're going to do and are only going through this pro forma."  </P> <P> Leech also criticized the notion that the artistic tone of Vermont could be  enhanced through a pedestrian overlay zone while the street was being promoted  as a commuter route.  </P> <P> "I think it's foolish," he said. "They're going to try to force more traffic up  the street and yet they're going to try to preserve it as a pedestrian overlay.  It's contradictory."  </P> <P> Others in the community reserved immediate comment. The Los Feliz Improvement  Assn., which helped organize the planning session, is scheduled to make a  presentation when the plan is submitted to the Planning Commission at 11 a.m.  in Room 353 of City Hall.  </P></p>

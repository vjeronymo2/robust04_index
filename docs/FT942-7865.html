			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Mahathir urges new MFN for China Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, has made a strong appeal for the US to renew China's most favoured nation (MFN) trading status. Addressing more than 1,000 representatives of businesses in the Asia-Pacific region, Dr Mahathir said nations of the Pacific must not quarrel and fight. 'Our Pacific Era will be stillborn if we divide the Pacific, if we create discriminatory trading blocs, if we draw a line down the Pacific, if we are unwilling to extend to each other the normal rules and regulations - like most favoured nation status - that are norms between trading economies,' said Dr Mahathir. In recent weeks Dr Mahathir has had talks with both President Bill Clinton and with China's leaders. 'Now China needs the world just as much as the world needs China,' said Dr Mahathir. 'That's a great departure from the old days when China regarded itself as the centre of the world.' Dr Mahathir also said that Malaysia was keen to see both Vietnam and Cambodia join the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) as soon as possible.</p>

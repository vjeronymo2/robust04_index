			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPENDTHRIFT JAPAN?;  </P> <P> THE SUN ALSO SETS: THE LIMITS TO JAPAN'S ECONOMIC POWER BY BILL EMMOTT; (TIMES  BOOKS: $18.95; 250 PP.)  </P> <P> Ever since Toyotas and Nissans invaded the American market many years ago,  books and articles about Japan have been written in successive waves. The first  admired such Japanese business practices as teamwork, government-industry  cooperation and long-term planning. Then came concern about America losing its  competitive edge and prescriptions about how American policies must change.  </P> <P> Recently a new concept has caught on. America is handcuffed, so the argument  goes, because Japan is fundamentally different from other Western nations:  neither capitalist nor socialist but something more perniciously  mercantilistic. According to this reasoning, Washington must press Japan to  change fundamentally its economic structure and its social customs in order to  import more and to save less -- to be, well, more like us. If necessary,  economic retaliation may be called for.  </P> <P> Bill Emmott's "The Sun Also Sets" may not start yet another wave of opinion,  but it should cause many of us to think hard about the latest hysteria. The  book has at its core one powerful idea: Japan's economic power arose incredibly  quickly -- just since the beginning of this decade -- and it is likely to  contract just as fast. As a result, Emmott says, fears about Tokyo's buying up  the world and having political clout to match are wildly misplaced.  </P> <P> Is this science fiction concerning a nation which is now banker to the world  and expanding at breakneck pace its corporate empire to every corner of the  globe? Not as presented here. Emmott's notions are not based on predictions of  an earthquake or a nuclear- reactor catastrophe or anything so accidental.  Instead, the author, who is business and financial editor and former Tokyo  correspondent of the highly respected British weekly newsmagazine "The  Economist," presents a logical and unemotional case for how underlying social  and economic forces in Japan are causing it to save less and spend more, and  how these changes feed on themselves and cause meaningful change.  </P> <P> The root of Japan's economic power, says Emmott, is its enormous mountains of  surplus cash, the result of phenomenal export performances and a consistently  high savings rate. If you make a straight-line projection of current trends for  another decade, he admits, Japan would be able to buy the equivalent of several  European countries. But it is a big mistake to extrapolate that way, he warns,  because Japan's society is anything but static. His prediction: Well before the  1990s is over, Japan's financial surplus will be gone.  </P> <P> "The nation of producers," the author writes, "is becoming a nation of  consumers, eager to accumulate material possessions, to buy foreign goods, and  even to show off wealth in conspicuous displays. The nation of workaholics is  becoming a nation of pleasure-seekers, eager to travel abroad, to enjoy  leisure, and to find whatever is best in life. The nation of healthy,  education-mad youth is becoming a nation of healthy pensioners, as the  baby-boom generation ages and lifespans lengthen. The nation of squirrel-like  savers, whose cash was controlled by the government, is becoming a nation of  investors and, most astonishingly of all, a nation of speculators."  </P> <P> Emmott traces each of the changes in Japanese society and shows how they will  curb Japan's financial power. One striking example is the growth of Japanese  travel abroad. By 1991, about 15 million Japanese could be leaving the country  each year, spending over $20 billion abroad, an amount equal to a reduction of  Japan's current trade surplus today by 20%. Another intriguing case is the  impact of the graying population on the savings rate. Japan will soon have more  citizens over 65 than any other industrialized nation, and pensioners are  spenders and not savers. Other trends include: rapidly rising imports,  particularly from South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the rest of Southeast Asia;  massive requirements to spend more on housing and social services; and an  increasingly deregulated banking system that will reduce government influence  on how and where consumers spend and save.  </P> <P> "The Sun Also Sets" seeks to change the current framework for thinking about  Japanese power. It is not predicting that Japan will become a second rate  nation, but only that it will not be the superpower so many people seem to  fear. Emmott says that upcoming economic pressures on Japan, together with the  nation's natural reluctance to assume visible leadership abroad, will assure  very limited political and military clout in the world, with the one exception  of East Asia where growing influence is well advanced and probably unstoppable.  </P> <P> Although the author has not done much original research, he supports his case  with reference to a variety of respectable sources from governments, think  tanks, and banks. There is no pretense of infallibility, but there is a high  degree of confidence that tomorrow will not look like today. Emmott is throwing  down a glove in front of the current "Japan is different and unmovable" school.  "The Japanese are not a breed apart," he says. "They respond to low prices by  buying more imports; they respond to affluence by buying expensive things; they  respond to financial freedom by seeking out good deals or a quick killing; they  respond to better and more secure pensions by saving less of their incomes."  </P> <P> The idea of the limits of Japan's power was first published by Emmott last year  in an essay that won top awards from a prestigious international panel of  bankers, economists, and politicians. In that condensed form it was even more  effective than the book, which suffers from diversions into tiresome issues  like whether foreign investment is good for the United States, how Japanese  banking was eventually liberalized, and why the United States should pay more  attention to competitiveness, etc. Given the added writing space, however,  Emmott might have given us a better context for evaluating his predictions.  </P> <P> Emmott is the latest of several new commentators on Japan from the press. In  fact, America's view about Japan is being heavily influenced today by  journalists, not in their capacity as unbiased news reporters, but as authors  of books and articles in which they present their personal views of problems  and solutions, often in highly emotional form. James Fallows of "The Atlantic  Monthly" has been attacking Japan's economic aggressiveness. Karel van  Wolferen, a distinguished Dutch reporter who recently published "The Enigma of  Japanese Power" accuses Japan of having a feudal political system where no one  makes decisions. Martin Tolchin of the New York Times warns about the threat  from foreign investors in "Buying Into America: How Foreign Money is Changing  the Face of Our Nation." Free lancer Daniel Burstein's view is evident from the  title of his new book: "YEN! Japan's New Financial Empire and Its Threat to  America."  </P> <P> We are fortunate to have top writers with access to people who make news,  unlike scholars buried in library stacks. But we should beware, too, for  journalists can be superb at following a single story line, even if it is too  simplistic. They can be masters of the penetrating anecdote, even if it is  misleading. And they are often preoccupied with what's hot today, regardless of  its connection to past or future.  </P> <P> Emmott may share the shortcoming of shallow research. However, he is way ahead  of the pack in thoughtfulness, originality, and recognition of the interplay of  dynamic social, economic and political forces. He is adding much needed balance  and perspective to the raging debate about Japan and his book should be widely  read and hotly debated.  </P></p>

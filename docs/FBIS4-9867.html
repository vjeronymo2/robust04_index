			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 24 Mar (PL) -- Today, Luis Suarez, director  of the Center of Studies on America, CEA, called the anti-Cuban  bill presented to the U.S. Congress by Representative Robert  Menendez vengeful and illogical..    In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Suarez said the proposal,  which will be analyzed today during a hearing at the U.S.  Senate, reacts to the impact caused by the converse project  defended by a group of representatives led by Charles Rangel.    Rangel spoke out in favor of repealing the so-called  Torricelli Law, as well as lifting the economic and trade  blockade imposed by Washington on the Caribbean island.    Menendez, with his antihistorical proposal, wants to  strengthen a policy in Congress that is clearly receiving  growing rejection. In the United States, this policy has  triggered demonstrations of civil disobedience like that by the  Pastors for Peace, the CEA director noted.    To conclude, Menendez said the proposal deserves the name of  Residual Project of the Cold War [Proyecto Remanente de la  Guerra Fria] as it opposes even the interests of U.S.  businessmen who want to improve relations between both nations.    Meanwhile, Lazaro Barredo, vice president of the  International Relations Commission at the National Assembly of  the People's Government, said Menendez' proposal is an  expression of how, in U.S. power circles, there are those who  shy away from the necessary and civilized negotiating table.    Barredo explained that what the representative of Cuban  origin proposed definitely is no different than the amendment  previously presented by Robert Torricelli, while he agreed with  Suarez that it is in response to Rangel's proposal.    Rangel's proposal had strong repercussions in the political,  economic, and academic sectors as it advocates true and  effective solutions to the Cuban-U.S. conflict, Barredo  indicated.    Barredo, who is also a Cuban reporter, recalled that  Menendez, together with Ileana Ros Leithenen and Lincoln Diaz  Balart, both of whom are also of Cuban origin, became a trio  that far from representing their constituency, have undertaken a  policy aimed at favoring only their personal interests.</p>

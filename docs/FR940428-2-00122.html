This order approves the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33757 (March 11, 1994), 59 FR 13349 (March 21, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In October 1992, the Exchange began trading standardized options on the E&hyph;100. The E&hyph;100 measures the collective performance of the most actively traded stocks on Europe's major stock exchanges. This broad-based index is calculated continuously from 5 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (11 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Central European time). The Exchange's trading hours for options on the E&hyph;100 are from 8:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. (New York time). The one hour earlier opening was adopted in order to attract European investors as well as to conform more closely with trading hours for futures contracts on the E&hyph;100 traded at the New York Commodity Exchange (``COMEX''), which begins trading at 7:30 a.m. (New York time). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, in the aftermath of the bombing of the World Trade Center in February 1993, the COMEX curtailed trading hours for all of its products and has continued to cease trading the E&hyph;100 futures contract at 11:30 a.m. (New York time), since such time corresponds with the cessation of trading of the underlying component securities in the European markets. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  The Exchange has proposed to modify the trading hours for its E&hyph;100 options to cease trading at 11:30 a.m. as well, since these hours will correspond more closely to the current trading hours for E&hyph;100 futures contract at the COMEX. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The COMEX scaled back the trading hours on the E&hyph;100 futures contract on March 1, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange believes that its current trading hours for E&hyph;100 options expose both the specialists and market makers to undue risk after both the underlying component securities and the E&hyph;100 futures contract have stopped trading, since they are unable to hedge their market risk effectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange will give its membership two weeks notice of the change in E&hyph;100 trading hours. An information circular advising the membership of the new closing time of 11:30 a.m. will be sent by facsimile to the Exchange's contracts at the major options firms, mailed to recipients of the Exchange's options related information circulars, and made available to subscribers of the Options News Network. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section 6(b)(5), <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  in that the proposal is designed to facilitate transactions in securities and to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, the Commission believes that the continuation of trading in options on the E&hyph;100 after trading in the E&hyph;100 futures contract has ended may place undue risks on Amex specialists and market makers in light of their inability to hedge their option positions effectively with the E&hyph;100 futures contract during that time. The Commission also believes that the Exchange's commitment to provide two weeks advance notice of the change in the E&hyph;100 options trading hours, as well as the manner in which such notice will be circulated, will ensure that all market participants are aware of the reduced trading hours, and as such will serve to protect investors and the public interest. Therefore, the Commission concludes that modifying the closing time for options on the E&hyph;100 from 4:30 p.m. to 11:30 a.m., to correspond the E&hyph;100 option trading hours more closely with the trading hours for the E&hyph;100 futures contract on the COMEX, will facilitate transactions in securities, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market, and, generally, protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , in recognition of the fact that the closing time for the E&hyph;100 futures contract already had been changed to 11:30 a.m. as of March 1, 1993. Given the potential risks to which specialists and market makers have been exposed since the reduction of the E&hyph;100 futures trading hours, the Commission believes that accelerating approval of the proposed rule change will help to minimize such risks, and thus promote just and equitable principles of trade and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market. In addition, the original proposal was published for the full 21-day comment period, and no comments were received. As a result, the Commission finds good cause for accelerating approval of the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> It is therefore ordered, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;07) is approved on an accelerated basis.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1982). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Fears of 'negotiating crunch' at enlargement talks Ministerial talks on enlargement resumed in Brussels last night amid dimming hopes that terms of entry into the European Union for Austria, Norway, Sweden and Finland can be reached by the deadline of Monday midnight. 'There is a genuine negotiating crunch coming' over this weekend, one EU ambassador forecast yesterday. Last night's talks centred on agriculture and fisheries. All but the Swedish government are unhappy with EU proposals for long-term aid to Arctic and Alpine farmers, which the applicants would largely have to fund themselves. They are also opposed to immediate realignment of their far higher farm prices to EU levels, and instead want border levies to iron out the price difference. The European Commission and, so far, a majority of the 12, say such frontier controls would compromise the border-free single market. The UK argues that a 'big bang' on farm prices for the would-be members could jeopardise the referendums on entry in three of the four applicant countries. They forsee the EU having to pay too much of the compensation for the farm price cuts. Norwegian fish and EU lorry traffic through Austria's Alpine passes are far more intractable issues, and could sink the talks. Austria wants to keep restrictions on EU truck transit through the Alps for 10 more years, rather than three as the Union insists. The 12 were last night trying to agree a common line on fish, which accommodates Spain's demand to catch 14,000 more fish in Norwegian waters, and French-led demands for restrictions on incoming fish products from Norway. Sweden, which has fewer differences with the EU over the central issues of agriculture, regional supports and fisheries, also made clear it would consider signing an accord before its Nordic neighbours if it had agreed terms but Norway and Finland had not by the March 1 deadline set by Brussels for the completion of the accession talks. Following a meeting in Helsinki of the leaders of the three countries, Prime Minister Esko Aho of Finland and Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, his Norwegian counterpart, criticised the EU's proposals to limit regional support to remote Arctic areas and for not meeting their demands for special treatment of Nordic agriculture. But Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, stressed that the talks were being conducted bilaterally and Sweden was anxious to conclude a deal with Brussels. 'Each country will have to decide for itself,' he said. Not yet on board, Page 11</p>

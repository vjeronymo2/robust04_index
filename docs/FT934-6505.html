			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Scottish farm union challenges penalties for cereals overshoot LEADERS OF Scotland's farmers are to press the UK government in London today to fight penalties imposed on them by the European Commission for apparently exceeding their cereal production ceiling. The House of Commons is also holding an adjournment debate to discuss the penalties, which the National Farmers' Union of Scotland says will cost Scottish agriculture Pounds 20m. The NFU accuses the commission of 'blatant discrimination' for offering a scheme to allow a gradual phasing in of penalties against farmers in eastern Germany who apparently overshot their production limit, but failing to offer a comparable solution to Scottish farmers. The problem has arisen from a discrepancy between the 'base area' used by the UK government to calculate what Scotland's cereal production should be under the European Union's reformed common agricultural policy, and the actual arable area for which farmers have claimed compensation from Brussels for cuts in support prices. Because the farmers' claims have exceeded the base area by 5.4 per cent, Brussels is reducing their compensation payments by the equivalent - Pounds 4.5m - this year. It is also requiring them to set aside an extra 5.4 per cent of their cereal-growing land next year without any compensation, in addition to the 15 per cent set-aside for which they are paid under the CAP reforms. The Scottish NFU says the base area was calculated using unreliable census figures from 1989-91 and that the farmers' claims, worked out using maps and precise measurements of land, are far more accurate. 'Farmers have taken a great deal of care when filling these forms in because their livelihoods depend on it,' said Mr Tom Brady, deputy chief executive. 'All the evidence we have suggests there hasn't been an overshoot at all.' He pointed out that the Scottish Office had found statistical errors in its census figures that had already forced it to ask Brussels to reduce the apparent overshoot from 16 per cent to 5.4 per cent. The farmers feel the penalties are particularly unfair given the estimated 20 per cent fall in this year's Scottish cereal output to about 2.3m tonnes, due both to set-aside and to bad weather at harvest time. 'Common sense has been stood on its head,' said Mr Brady. 'Scotland has made the biggest percentage contribution to reducing cereals oversupply in Europe, but still we are the only area of Europe to have substantial increases in set-aside announced.' The NFU wants the Scottish 'overshoot' to be balanced against a shortfall in compensation claims by English cereal farmers to give an overall UK figure in line with target output. But the Scottish Office, which points out that farm incomes have been boosted this year by the devaluation of sterling, is standing by its figures. 'The 5.4 per cent overshoot is being confirmed by provisional census returns coming in now,' said an official. Mr David Douglas, agricultural manager for Clydesdale Bank, expressed concern about the impact of the penalties on farm profits. He added: 'If this does come off, a lot of people will start to question whether they continue with set-aside or go back to farming without subsidies. It starts to defeat the object of the whole exercise.'</p>

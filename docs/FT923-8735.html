			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Inspectors start work in Baghdad A UNITED Nations inspection team, barred by Iraq from entering government ministries, completed its first day of searches yesterday without triggering a new stand-off with Iraq, Reuter reports from Baghdad. 'It was an inspection day, the first one. That is all it was,' Mr Nikita Smidovich, head of the 22-member team, said when the inspectors returned to their Baghdad hotel. 'We went where we planned to go.' He also said that the team saw what it wanted to see. He declined to say whether the team tried to inspect any government ministries, designated as 'off-limits' to UN arms inspectors by Baghdad. Mr Smidovich declined to say whether the inspectors found anything unexpected but said Iraqi officials treated US experts no differently from other members. Mr Smidovich, the first Russian to head a UN team in Iraq, said he expected no problems. The arms experts continue their mission today. The team, which arrived on Friday, was the first to enter Iraq since UN inspectors searched the agriculture ministry on July 28 after a three-week stand-off that drew threats of force from the US.</p>

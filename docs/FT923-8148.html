			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Commercial Union Interim figures from Commercial Union suggest that the upswing in the UK insurance cycle is arriving earlier and more strongly than the market had dared hope. Like General Accident, CU nudged into profit in the second quarter and sees underwriting conditions improving from here on. Unlike the competition, however, CU has been building UK market share. Premium income from non-life business grew at an annual rate of 19 per cent in the first half. The natural suspicion is that this inevitably involves sacrificing quality, but there is scant evidence of underwriting weakness in the figures released yesterday. Indeed, CU is already making an underwriting profit on private and commercial motor business, domestic household lines and - were it not for the loss on bomb damage to its own headquarters - industrial fire insurance as well. The only trouble with such success in the present climate is the implication that CU could be less well geared for recovery than some weaker rivals. The investment portfolio also has a defensive aspect. Only a quarter of assets is held in equities, with UK equities accounting for perhaps 20 per cent of this modest total. However, CU remains bearish and sees no reason to position itself for a recovery in UK corporate earnings. If this judgment proves correct, its own shares could still outperform both the market and the sector. They already offer one of the safer 7 per cent yields in the market.</p>

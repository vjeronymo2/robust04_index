			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by </F> 'Abd-al-Jabbar al-Barghuthi in Tunis; date not given]    [Text] Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat has stressed  that he will not feel at ease until all Palestinian prisoners in  Israeli jails obtain their freedom so that they may participate  in the battle for building the Palestinian national authority  and an independent state. 'Arafat rejected any attempt to  categorize or divide the prisoners and insisted that all of them  be treated equally.    'Arafat emphasized the need to close ranks and achieve  national unity. He called on everyone to behave as one man and  one heart, to think with responsibility, and to confront the  immense challenges we are facing with all methods available.  This, at a time when the Palestinians are knocking on the doors  of independence and freedom under the PLO's leadership and the  international community is looking forward to seeing the  embodiment of Palestinian rights in a way that would end the  suffering of our people and nation and provide them with the  opportunity to build the life for which they have always  dreamed. 'Arafat said that the Palestinian people have the  right to live in security, dignity, stability, and prosperity.    'Arafat criticized the foot-dragging and procrastination  inherent in Israeli policy on implementing the  Palestinian-Israeli accord signed on 13 September in Washington.  He described this policy as a rejected blackmail attempt that  will only lead to wasting more time and deprive the peace  process of credibility.    'Arafat held the Israeli Government responsible for this  delay and the ensuing continuation of the cycle of violence in  the occupied territories. He expressed the hope that Israel  will stop procrastinating and will respond to realities and the  requirements of the era on the dissemination of the climate of  peace and stability among states and peoples. This requires  that every people be guaranteed the right to self-determination  and the establishment of its independent political entity over  the soil of its homeland in accordance with the provisions of  the United Nations and the resolutions of its institutions  issued in this regard.    In this context, 'Arafat stressed the PLO's adherence to the  Palestinian people's legitimate rights and said: The day of  return is near and the attainment of our people's dream is not  impossible but possible. We must achieve that dream regardless  of how difficult the march may be and irrespective of the  obstacles it faces.</p>

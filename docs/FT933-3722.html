			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Arts: Blood on the music stands - Off The Wall / Antony Thorncroft watches the battle for survival between London's orchestras THE Arts Council always keeps its bad news for the run up to Christmas (ask Kent Opera which lost its grant during these dog news days). This year, on 16 December, it will announce which two of the four major London orchestras that it funds (the LSO, the LPO, the RPO, and the Philharmonia) will lose their grants. The LSO, with its Barbican residency, knows it is safe, but the other three are fighting furiously for their subsidy. The cause of the RPO seems lost. It has managed to organise its operations so commercially that it relies on the Council for Pounds 400,000, or just 7 per cent of its annual income, and the groundswell view is that it could survive on its own wits. But the Arts Council's master plan to merge the LPO and the Philharmonia into a super-band for the South Bank, where the LPO is already house orchestra, and the Philharmonia first reserve, has quickly hit the rocks. The Philharmonia approached the LPO to discuss such a deal, which would mean an enlarged orchestra with an enlarged grant. The Philharmonia was even willing to accept the LPO's name. But the LPO has rejected the idea of a merger. It no doubt feels that having won the residency at the South Bank only last year it is in a strong position to hold on to its autonomy - and take any extra money going. The Arts Council, in a display of discretion which comes close to cowardice, abandoned its responsibility for selecting the orchestras it plans to drop as clients and persuaded a judge, Sir Leonard Hoffman, to assume the role of Solomon. With the officially favoured option of a merger smothered at birth he will require all his skill to prevent what is already a mess, getting even messier. On Wednesday the Gate opens again at Notting Hill. London's most successful pocket theatre, with an awards list as long as it is small, has been closed for enlargement. Thanks to Pounds 80,000 from Allied-Lyons, which owns the pub below, it can now seat 130 as against the paltry 56 before. The formula stays the same - forgotten classics of world drama. Naturally for a theatre which has mined treasure from the Golden Age of Spanish drama, the new season opens with a Spanish play, but Bohemian Lights is by Ramon Maria del Valle-Inclan, Spain's leading early 20th century dramatist. Then the world premiere of The Madman of the Balconies by the Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa; and finally a British premiere for Strindberg's last play, The Great Highway. For the Gate this is a conventional repertoire. There follows a group of comedies that are real curiosities, works by a 17th century Mexican nun, a farce translated from the Sanskrit, and a Danish comedy. Actors at the Gate are not paid, but are given travel expenses and a free lunch. Artistic director Laurence Boswell and producer Caroline Maude earn just Pounds 5,000 each a year. They balance the books by picking up prizes, like a Pounds 25,000 Prudential Award for the Arts. But the very poverty of the Gate has been the key to its success. Because the actors come free it can employ them by the bus load and mount grandiose classics way beyond the resources of our national companies: for a production of Queen Elizabeth II a cast of 32 trod the match-box stage. They are happy to do so because the Gate is a marvellous take off spot. Its first director, Lou Stein, runs the Palace, Watford; its second director, Giles Croft, is at the National; and Boswell's predecessor, Stephen Daldry, has just taken over the Royal Court. Six of the younger actors in the current National Theatre company were signed from the Gate. Three of the Gate's past successes will be broadcast on Radio 3 this autumn. The advent of Classic fm a year ago seems to have given Radio 3 a shot in the arm, not least in terms of its audience. It now takes 6 per cent of radio listeners as against 5 per cent, and is still gaining. Not quite up to Classic's impressive 10 per cent, but commendable all the same. Radio 3's autumn schedule continues the quiet revolution. It is launching a new show case programme, Music Matters, on Saturday evenings, with Sunday repeats, which should secure its highest audience. It is taking all the live opera relays from the Met in New York, which Texaco has sponsored for over half a century, so 20 Saturday nights on Radio 3 will be opera nights; it has got into bed with Channel 4 over Derek Jarman's movie Blue, which it will transmit simultaneously with the TV screening, surely the first time a film has been broadcast on the radio; and in January it introduces its first music programme, pop and all, aimed at children since Pied Piper in the 1970s. And it has silenced all those who thought civilisation ended when Radio 3 started to smarten up last year.</p>

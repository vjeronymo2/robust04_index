			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> DON'T DESTROY DENNISON PARK  </P> <P> Dennison Park is a beautiful rustic park designed for family gatherings and  camping, for people to be in touch with nature. Although recreational vehicle  parks do generate more money for the county, you can't pitch a tent on asphalt.  </P> <P> To turn Dennison Park into an RV park -- a parking lot -- would be a crime  against historic California parks. Most campsites have 200- to 300-year-old  trees or large pines, which would need to be cut back or cut down for RV sites.  This is in direct conflict with Ojai's policy and the city of Ojai's ordinance  not to cut down oak trees. The county would also have to bulldoze most sites to  make them level for the larger recreational vehicles, and the roads would have  to be widened. In other words, the county would be destroying Dennison Park.  </P> <P> We're running out of parks for the family -- with kids -- to camp in tents and  be with nature.  </P> <P> Our county supervisors need to know how we feel.  </P> <P> DAVID JENSEN, Ojai  </P></p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Thousands of extra troops to bolster UN in Bosnia Russia, the US, the United Nations and the European Union are to seek a four-month cessation of hostilities in Bosnia in a fresh effort to settle the Bosnian crisis by negotiation. As part of a deal reached in London yesterday, the US will help to finance the despatch of thousands of extra troops to join the UN peacekeeping force commanded by General Sir Michael Rose. The move is an attempt to capitalise on the lowering of tension in Gorazde, the Moslem enclave in Bosnia, where Nato has imposed an ultimatum for the withdrawal of heavy weapons by the besieging Serbs. British officials said the deal would ensure that the UN force was increased by the full 10,500 extra troops sought last month by Gen Rose, most of which have not been despatched. However, no US ground troops are likely to be involved. Allies of the US had complained that Washington was reneging on its funding commitments. The deal was worked out in a series of meetings in London between Mr John Major, prime minister, Mr Vitaly Churkin, Moscow's chief envoy to former Yugoslavia, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, and Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister. Mr Churkin said the four powers had agreed to establish a 'contact group' on Bosnia to seek a comprehensive peace agreement. The group is expected to hold its first meeting in London this morning. British officials said Mr Churkin and Mr Charles Redman, the US special envoy to Bosnia, were likely to attend, along with representatives chosen by Lord Owen, the EU peace negotiator, from Britain, France and Germany. Mr Christopher said the group was 'an attempt to try to regain the momentum there was before Gorazde'. Its priority will be to negotiate a cessation of hostilities for four months, during which negotiations on a settlement would be held with Serb, Moslem and Croat leaders. The contact group members are expected to press for the ceasefire to start as soon as possible. 'I think the next week or two are going to be very intensive,' Mr Churkin said. Officials said the group had agreed that a settlement would have to involve a 'roll-back' by the Serbs from some of the ground captured during hostilities. The group had also agreed that the Bosnian Serbs would face 'a very firm response' if they failed to comply with the Nato ultimatum to withdraw heavy weapons to more than 20km from Gorazde.</p>

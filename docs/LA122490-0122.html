			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: LIZA, GERO A PAIR APART; NICHOLSON'S EYES ON ANJELICA  </P> <P> HERE IS A P.S. on the Liza Minnelli marriage situation. She and her artist  husband, Mark Gero, have mutually agreed to separate. I am told by their  intimates that "this is all they'd like to say right now."  </P> <P> Liza and Mark have been married since Dec. 4, 1979. It was Liza's third  marriage, after Peter Allen and Jack Haley.  </P> <P> I ran into Liza at the Frank Sinatra birthday party last week. She was glowing  and crowing, having a wonderful time, looking great, and telling me about a new  movie of hers that she wanted me to see. Liza was with her sister, Lorna Luft,  who is currently knocking them dead in the Rainbow &amp; Stars at New York's  Rockefeller Center.  </P> <P> Liza and Lorna spent most of their time with me raving about Lorna's baby  daughter, Vanessa Jade. Lorna said: "She may be my child, but she is just Liza  all over again. She looks like Liza, behaves like Liza. I just wonder how this  could be? It's my baby, but it's Liza Minnelli; very spooky."  </P> <P> Liza just laughed, winked at me and pretended to buff her nails.  </P> <P> THEY DO say Anjelica Huston's performance as a blond con woman in "The  Grifters" is Oscar bait. And last week the Los Angeles Film Critics gave her  their award, so anything can happen at the Academy Awards.  </P> <P> But that's not the big news about Anjelica. The speculation goes that Anjelica  and her ex-lover of 17 years, Jack Nicholson, are about to forge a reunion of  the professional kind.  </P> <P> Nicholson told Life magazine earlier this year that he wanted very much to act  with Anjelica again. They played together marvelously in "Prizzi's Honor." (He  is said also personally to miss her friendship very much.) Now he wants her to  play Josephine to his film Napoleon.  </P> <P> Does history repeat? Josephine was the love of Napoleon's life, but he had to  set her aside to wed an Austrian princess who could give him an heir. The long  affair of Nicholson and Huston came to a halt when Nicholson had a child out of  wedlock with another actress, Rebecca Broussard.  </P> <P> It would be fun to see Anjelica in those period Empire dresses, doing her stuff  as a woman scorned. And Jack? It's always fun to see Jack in any guise  whatsoever.  </P> <P> They are two of the acting greats of our time.  </P></p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Ugland returns to the black with Pounds 1.28m Shares in Ugland International yesterday rose 5p to 125p as the ship owner, manager and dry dock operator swung into the black with interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.28m, against a Pounds 780,000 loss. A new management team has been in place since last October at the company, formerly known as Bristol Channel Ship Repairers. The Ugland family holds a 30 per cent stake. Trading in the shares resumed last November at 108p following a three-month suspension during which the company was reorganised. In the six months to September 30, turnover jumped to Pounds 13.4m (Pounds 4m) following an improved performance from the shipping interests and the April acquisition of Gerrards Rederi in Norway. Earnings per share were 4.13p (6.96p losses) and a dividend of 1.65p (nil) is declared. Mr Andreas Ugland, executive chairman, said last year's Pounds 19m rights issue and the addition of eight ships from the Gerrards acquisition - which brought the total to 18 - had given the company a good base to increase profits. Gerrards contributed Pounds 868,000 to the pre-tax figure. Swansea Dry Docks, the ship repair business, fell to a Pounds 340,000 loss, on sales of Pounds 1.36m, owing to stiff competition. However, a second dry dock was opened in July and bookings had picked up after an intensive marketing campaign, Mr Ugland added. Net borrowings stood at Pounds 10.2m at the end of September, giving gearing of 45 per cent.</p>

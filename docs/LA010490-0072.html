			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEPOT SOLD FOR TRANSPORT CENTER  </P> <P> The city of Glendale has purchased the historic Southern Pacific Railroad Depot  for $3.3 million and plans to turn it into a regional transit center.  </P> <P> The purchase of the 66-year-old, colonial-Spanish-style building and the  2.4-acre site at 400 W. Cerritos Ave. from Southern Pacific Railroad was  finalized Dec. 27.  </P> <P> Funding for the purchase came from the city's share of Proposition A transit  taxes, which amounted to more than $3.5 million. The balance of the funds will  be used for administrative costs and to hire a consultant to study how to  preserve the depot while developing the site as a commuter hub, said Steve  Adams, project director and assistant to the city manager.  </P> <P> The city proposes to spend an additional $3.5 million to build a multilevel  parking garage.  </P> <P> The Amtrak commuter train will continue operating out of the station on a  long-term lease, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC press release No. IP/94/404: "Formal Opening of </F> Negotiations for the Mid-Term Review of the Fourth Lome  Convention"]    [Text] On 20 May 1994, at the annual meeting of the ACP/EU  [African Caribbean and Pacific/European Union] Council of  Ministers in Mbabane (Swaziland), negotiations for the mid-term  review of the Fourth ACP/EU Convention will be formally opened.    On 8 September 1993, the European Commission approved a  proposal requesting authorization from the Council and the  Member States to negotiate the review of certain provisions of  the Lome IV Convention signed on 15 december 1989 by the  European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)  states.    The proposal, together with draft negotiating directives,  was  presented by Mr Manuel Marin, Commission vice-president for  development cooperation and humanitarian aid.    On 7 February 1994, the European Union Council of Ministers  approved, by unanimity, the negotiating directives for the  partial revision of the convention.    The Lome IV signatories provided for the possibility of a  review midway through the convention's ten-year term, to  coincide with the renewal of the financial protocol, which must  in any event take place after five years.    The Commission believes that there is an urgent need to  adapt  the convention to present-day development cooperation  requirements. Thus, the Commission proposed that the European  Union confirm to the ACP states its commitment to the system of  cooperation introduced by the first Lome Convention, underlining  the special nature of a relationship based on the equality of  the partners and on mutual interest.    In the light of recent developments on the international  political stage and of the lessons learned in implementing the  present convention up to now, the European Union proposals,  adopted at the initiative of the European Commission, are  primarily designed to make European Union support for ACP  development more effective. Accordingly, the main objectives  are:     -  To ensure that the convention asserts the principles  of democracy, the rule of law and good governance, alongside  existing references in the convention (Art.5) to respect for and  enjoyment of human rights;    -  To adapt the instruments of dialogue  between the ACP and the European Union to take better account of  the basic principles and priorities of the European Union  cooperation policy and implement them more effectively;    -  To  achieve more coherent and effective use of ACP-EU cooperation  instruments and procedures.     Furthermore, the Commission proposed that, as in the case  with other European Union partners, the scope of the ACP-EU  Council of Ministers be extended in order to create, preferably  on a regional basis, a political dialogue.    A memorandum based on these proposals and on the subsequent  discussions in the Council was sent to the ACP states in  accordance with the procedure and timetable laid down in Article  366 of the Fourth Lome Convention.    Negotiations will be formally opened at the ACP/EU Council  of  Ministers, on 20 May 1994 in Mbabane (Swaziland).  <H5>  Background: the Lome Convention </H5>   The European Union and its member states together constitute  the principal source of official development assistance (ODA)  for the benefit of all developing countries. Today they account  for almost half of all aid received by developing countries.  The ECU2.5 billion made available every year to the countries  of the southern hemisphere thus gives the European Union,  considerable weight in its development action.    European Union financial aid managed by the European  Commission represents around 5 percent of the total world oda  and 15 percent of that of the twelve member states.  <H5>  From Lome I to Lome IV </H5>   The Lome Convention is the best known and most complete  example of the European Union's development cooperation policy.  It expresses at European Union level the interdependence woven  by history, trade, economics and culture between Europe and the  south.    In 1975 Lome I took over from the two Yaounde conventions,  marking the beginning of what was soon to be known as Lome  policy. A second convention, signed in 1980, assured continuity.  Lome III, concluded in 1985, enshrined new ambitions centred on  the objectives of rural development and food security.  <H5>  Lome Policy Rests on Four Pillars: </H5>    -  Cooperation between  two regional groups, based on respect for the political and  economic choices of each partner;    -  Stable, sustainable and  predictable cooperation based on legally binding arrangements  set out in a freely negotiated contract;    -  Comprehensive  cooperation combining a whole range of aid and trade development  instruments;    -  On-going dialogue in the framework of three joint  institutions: the ACP-EEC Council of Ministers, the ACP-EEC  Committee of Ambassadors and the ACP-EEC Joint Assembly.   <H5>  Lome IV -- a Ten-Year Convention for 70 ACP Countries </H5>   The European Union and 66 ACP states signed on 15 December  1989 the Fourth Lome Convention. Two new Caribbean states,  Haiti and the Dominican Republic, joined the convention.  Namibia and Eritrea also became members immediately after their  independence; the Lome Convention thus comprises all the  countries of Sub-Saharan Africa except South Africa.    For the first time, after a series of five-year conventions,  the Fourth Convention will last for ten years (with a renewable  five-year financial protocol expiring on 28 February 1995). It  will be in force from 1 March 1990 until the end of February of  the year 2000.    The financial resources made available for ACP/EU  cooperation  went from ECU8.5 billion under Lome III to ECU12 billion  (approx. $15 billion) for the first five years of Lome IV (up to  the end of february 1995). These resources are as  follows:     -  ECU10.8 billion to the European Development Fund,  i.e. an increase of 45 percent in nominal terms and of 25  percent in real terms with respect to Lome III. This amount  includes individual allocations for the 70 ACP states (the  "indicative programmes": ECU6.215 billion) as well as other  sectoral areas: structural adjustment (ECU1.15 billion),  stabilisation of agricultural revenues (the "stabex" system:  ECU1.5 billion) and of mining resources ("sysmin": ECU480  million), emergency aid (ECU250 million), aid to refugees  (ECU100 million), interest rate subsidies (ECU280 million) and  risk capital (ECU825 million).    -  ECU1.2 billion on own resources  from the European Investment Bank (EIB). Together with this  increase in aid, an important effort has been made in order to  improve the quality of European Union aid: with the exception of  risk capital managed by the EIB, all of the European Development  Fund is now made of grants.</p>

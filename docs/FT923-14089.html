			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Finance Bill passes Commons embodying tax changes announced in the March Budget that were not given legislative effect before the general election - was given a third reading by a government majority of 53 (303-250) in the Commons last night. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, rejected renewed criticism of the provision designed to ensure that the Inland Revenue is not deprived of sums of up to Pounds 15bn as a result of legal proceedings instituted by Leeds Permanent Building Society. The dispute concerns the implementation of changed collection arrangements for the composite rate of tax.</p>

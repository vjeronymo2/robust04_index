			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Bhupal Inder Saini] </F>   [Text] The positive ambience created by Mr. Narasimha Rao's  first meeting with President Clinton should go a long way in  launching India and the United States on a new partnership of  peace and development. Expectedly, the focus of the White House  talks was on India's economic reforms and the opportunities they  offer for strengthening Indo-American economic ties. There are  differences, no doubt, in the two countries' approach to issues  like nuclear nonproliferation, missile technology control and  human rights. But as President Clinton himself put it, they  have to be viewed in the totality of circumstances. Being  friends does not mean one must see eye to eye on every matter.    A major gain of the summit meeting was the resolve by the  two  countries to continue discussion on issues of which India and  the United States hold different views. As the prime minister  put it while talking to the Indian and ethnic media personnel,  the only way to resolve differences is to talk to and understand  each other. So far as Indo-U.S. relations are concerned, this  dialogue has not been as emphatic as it promises to be now.    Significantly, President Clinton acknowledged that with the  economic reforms now under way, India is destined to emerge as  one of the biggest free markets of the world. Both he and Mr.  Narasimha Rao recognized that with the expansion of its economy,  India would be able to contribute more meaningfully to the  shaping of the world, both politically and economically.    Another positive outcome of last night's talks in Washington  is the decision to have regular consultations at the Foreign  Office level. Such continuous dialogue will help the two  countries to identify and remove the irritants and  misunderstandings hindering a closer relationship.    The United States' recognition that India is poised to play  a  more significant role in world affairs is likely to put the  relations between the two countries on a sound and realistic  footing. It is also an acknowledgment by the only superpower in  the world today that India as a potential major economic power  cannot be wished away.</p>

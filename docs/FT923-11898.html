			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Italian lira, the sick currency of Europe: If Rome opts for devaluation others may follow and the EMS could fall apart FOREIGN exchange dealers have regarded the Italian lira as the sickest currency in Europe for months. Its failure to respond to extensive Bank of Italy support now makes it a prime candidate for devaluation, perhaps as part of a general realignment of the European Monetary System (EMS), according to London market analysts. Devaluation of the lira would further weaken market confidence in the EMS. Despite Monday's concerted intervention by central banks to prop up the dollar, there is still pressure on the UK to devalue sterling against the D-Mark, and even to leave the ERM altogether. Dealers in the foreign exchange market fear that if the Italians devalue now, the move will encourage other EMS member countries, such as Britain, to follow - and the EMS could fall apart. Since the spring, the Italian authorities have done everything in their power to stop the fall of the lira. They have raised the discount rate by 1.75 per cent in the last fortnight, to 13.75 per cent, to make the rate of return on lira investment more attractive. They have also actively intervened in foreign exchange markets, buying lira and selling D-Marks to keep the currency above its permitted lows in the EMS. The Italian central bank's governor repeated this week that a devaluation of the lira was out of the question. But yesterday, the lira looked as anaemic as ever, falling dangerously close to its permitted lower limit against the D-Mark of L765. 'The Italians could well devalue the exchange rate at any time in the next three months,' says Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International in London. Several factors have undermined the lira. Italy's political uncertainties are chief among them. It took over six weeks to form a coalition government, led by Prof Giuliano Amato, who now has a meagre 16-seat majority in parliament. The government's difficulties in fighting organised crime are also growing, with last weekend's assassination of a senior magistrate involved in mafia investigations further undermining confidence in the currency. Economic uncertainty is increasing. The government's budget deficit for this year was originally set at L128,000bn, but is now likely to overshoot by L47,000bn unless an emergency budget is approved by parliament. Industrial production is declining, falling in May by 5.6 per cent year-on year. Italy's policy of raising its discount rate to strengthen the lira has failed to impress markets. 'Every one percentage point rise adds 13 trillion (million million) lire to the deficit,' says Mr MacKinnon. 'A vicious circle has therefore set in: the lira falls, the Italians raise rates, the budget deficit increases and the lira falls again as the markets lose confidence in the economy.' The currency is undermined by uncertainty over European Monetary Union (Emu). The lira had benefitted from the conviction that Italy would be forced to reduce its budget deficit to meet the Maastricht Treaty convergence criteria. Since then the Danish 'no' vote to Maastricht and the French referendum on the treaty in September have unnerved the markets. 'Currencies like the lira are open to speculation all the more, because the market is willing to test the strength of the European monetary structure,' says Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London. However, some analysts believe the Italian government need not act immediately. Mr David Cocker, economic analyst at Chemical Bank in London, says Italy retains large foreign currency reserves with which to fund market intervention, estimated at about L38,000bn. There would also be little point in devaluing before the French referendum, since a 'No' vote would make devaluation politically easier. Rome has also given priority to implementing a radical economic reform package. This aims to cut L30bn off the deficit this year by a programme of privatisation. Analysts say the government would be 'devaluing in a vacuum' if it altered the exchange rate before the package has been ratified by parliament in September. But doubts remain over whether this package can be implemented by a government with such a thin majority, while the lira is already overvalued against the D-Mark by 25 per cent on a purchasing parity basis. 'Something in the economy has to give if you stick to an unrealistic exchange rate,' says Mr Gerard Lyons of DKB. 'The Italians are reaching the limits over what they can do with economic policy.' Analysts say EMS countries will probably allow a member to lower rates if it has already done everything in its power to strengthen the currency. 'There is a Europe-wide acceptance that Italy has specific problems, and that it is doing all it can domestically to deal with them,' says Mr Lyons.</p>

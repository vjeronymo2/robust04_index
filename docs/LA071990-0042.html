			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICROWAVE: JUICY SPARERIBS SHORTCUT  </P> <P> Barbecue spareribs in a microwave? You bet -- and in half the usual time. In  fact, ribs that have been microwaved are supremely juicy and tender because of  the microwave's moist method of cooking.  </P> <P> If you like ribs crusty brown, simply finish them off in the broiler or on an  outdoor grill as we direct in the recipes that follow.  </P> <P> We think you'll agree that barbecue was never more delicious. Certainly it was  never quicker or easier.  </P> <P> BARBECUED SPARERIBS  </P> <P> 3 to 3 1/2 pounds lean spareribs, cut in 1- or 2-rib widths  </P> <P> 1 cup barbecue sauce  </P> <P> Place ribs, meatiest side down and overlapping as needed, in microwave-safe  12x8-inch casserole. Cover with vented plastic wrap and microwave on high (100%  power) 5 minutes.  </P> <P> Reduce power to medium (50% power) and microwave 15 minutes per pound, turning  ribs over at half time and rearranging by moving undercooked ones to edge of  casserole and re-covering with wax paper.  </P> <P> Drain off all drippings. Pour sauce evenly over ribs. Cover with wax paper and  microwave on medium 10 minutes. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> Variations  </P> <P> Crusty-Brown Barbecued Spareribs:  </P> <P> Prepare ribs as directed. Remove from sauce and arrange in single layer in  large roasting pan. Brush with additional barbecue sauce. Broil in preheated  broiler 4 to 5 inches from heat 4 to 6 minutes until nicely browned.  </P></p>

The  source added: Once Presidential Council Chairman brother  Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, and Presidential  Council Vice Chairman brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid were informed of  this incident, they instructed that the incident be contained,  that a rapid investigation of the circumstances surrounding it  be conducted, and that full compliance with instructions be  enforced.    The Military Committee has been asked to monitor the  implementation of the instructions, and to take the necessary  relevant measures.    The source asserted that this incident will not undermine  the  joy that has swept our people in the aftermath of the signing of  the accord document in Arab Amman, the city of accord and  reconciliation, under the sponsorship of His Majesty King Husayn  Bin-Talal and the Jordanian people. Moreover, this incident  will not deter all from continuing to mobilize efforts to  implement the document of accord in order to build a modern  Yemeni state, a state of institutions, law, and order, the  source concluded.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Doreen Cheung in Beijing and Chris Yeung] </F>   [Text] Attempts by the Liberal Party and some independent  legislators to craft a compromise version of the package of  political changes proposed by Governor Chris Patten have fallen  on deaf ears in Beijing. The coalition had hoped to win  acceptance of amendments that would bring the proposals closer  to the post-1997 political structure envisaged in China's  interpretation of the Basic Law. But a senior mainland official  declined to give his blessing to adjustments that might reverse  Beijing's present stance that the territory's political  structure will terminate on July 1, 1997 and be replaced with  one worked out between now and then.    Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office  Chen Ziying, instead told a delegation of Hong Kong textile  merchants in Beijing that "the British side can do whatever it  likes to before 1997". Mr Patten's proposals come before the  Legislative Council next month.    Despite repeated attempts to broach the possibility that  China might accept the coalition's compromise version of Mr  Patten's proposals, Mr Chen would make no comment. Under the  Liberal Party's model announced last week, the total size of  franchise for functional constituency elections would be reduced  to no more than 170,000. Mr Patten seeks to widen the franchise  to about 2.5 million.    Henry Tang Ying-yen, who ranks highly in the Liberal Party,  said the delegation was told that the 1995 Legislative Council  had a lifespan of 20 months and would be disbanded by June 30,  1997. Mr Tang said a compromise was desirable to avoid a  "one-party-dominated" legislature in 1995, apparently referring  to the likelihood that a Legco controlled by "small `l'  liberals" could not survive the changeover because China would  not accept the "through-train" arrangement. "Mr Chen has not  said whether he would support our amendments or not," Mr Tang  said.    Leader of the delegation, Fong Hang, believed it was very  difficult for China to commit itself on any Hong Kong affairs  before 1997.    Mr Tang quoted Mr Chen as stressing that the nine new  functional constituency seats should not be turned into some  form of direct elections in disguise. Mr Chen said workers  should not be eligible to vote in the nine new functional  constituency seats because there were already two seats for the  labour sector. Mr Tang said Mr Chen agreed with coalition  proposals that the existing corporate voting system should be  adopted for the nine extra seats.    The Liberal Party and some independents held the view that  their model would have a better chance to get through the  Legislative Council if they could secure support from their  pro-China colleagues. A blessing from Chinese officials such as  Mr Chen was regarded as vital in winning support from the  pro-China side.    Legislator Tam Yiu-chung of the Democratic Alliance for the  Betterment of Hong Kong said his group "appreciated" the efforts  of the coalition, but would probably abstain in the vote after  the debate scheduled for June 29. "The Chinese principle is  that `we will go ahead with our own plans' and will not make any  positive statements on the amendments. The possibility of  getting support from them on the amendments is virtually zero,"  he said.    Mr Tam, a Preliminary Working Committee member who has just  returned from subgroup meetings in Beijing, said officials from  the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office had not given them  instructions on how to vote. "Whether the final blueprint is  the original model or any revised proposals will make no  difference to China," he said.    Privately, mainland officials said they were not concerned  which model Legco adopted. But at a separate meeting with the  local businessmen, senior Communist Party official Wang Zhaoguo  warned that the attempt by the British Government to "leave its  colonial legacy and bring chaos to the territory after it  retreats is doomed to fail".    Mr Wang, the party's United Front Work Department, claimed  that more Hong Kong people were now aware of the real motives of  the British Government. "This will be very conducive to the  stability and prosperity of Hong Kong in the transitional  period," he said.</p>

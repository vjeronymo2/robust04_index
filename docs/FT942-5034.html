			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Go-betweens for business angels - Richard Gourlay examines the growth of informal capital financing and the marriage bureaux set up to bring companies and cash together Informal capital supplied by business angels is increasingly recognised as an important source of finance for small private companies. Yet it is a stark fact that very few, if any, of the marriage bureaux that bring together wealthy individuals and private businesses make ends meet. Almost all have required subsidies from government, corporate sponsors, or other parts of their own business, to cover the full cost of their service. Even in the US, where the entrepreneurial seam runs deeper, the most successful marriage bureaux are subsidised. This is not to say private investors are not backing private companies. Introductions are probably made every day in the golf club and through family ties. According to some estimates, as much as Pounds 2bn has been invested in the UK informally over the last 10 years. The government clearly believes this informal investment is an appropriate form of finance for undercapitalised companies too small or too risky to be considered worthy of formal venture capital. But are introduction services, as currently structured, likely to increase substantially this flow of risk capital? In last month's white paper on competitiveness, the government said it wanted to work with Business Link organisations, TECs and the private sector to encourage informal investment. The DTI would work to try to help develop 'national coverage of a local brokerage service throughout England', the white paper said. But neither the white paper nor the DTI have said whether the government will provide any funding for this. The DTI's pump-priming funding runs out next December for the five business introduction pilot schemes it backed two years ago. The DTI has tried, but failed, to encourage the formation of a national database. The agencies - Venture Capital Report, Linc, Capital Exchange and Techinvest - could not agree the form such a national service should take. As a result, the introduction agency market remains fragmented and the service offered to subscribers varies greatly. The following are some of the leading providers: Venture Capital Report. Lucius Cary, who started VCR 16 years ago, is the grandfather of the business angel introduction industry. Publisher of a monthly report that goes to the 634 business angels on its books, VCR claims to be the most interventionist of the bureaux, assessing projects at a depth not attempted by other services. This, VCR argues, filters out the non-starters and gives busy investors a warts-and-all view of businesses including the amount of equity on offer. VCR consultants spend half a day interviewing the company and then compile a five-page summary of the business proposition for publication in the report. Investors pay Pounds 300 a year to subscribe; companies Pounds 350 and, on completion of a deal, a Pounds 1,000 fee plus 2.5 per cent of any money raised. VCR normally does about 15 deals a year but has already done 17 in the last six months, raising Pounds 1m. It has raised Pounds 15m since it was set up. Expansion of the formula is constrained by the time required for each appraisal. (Tel 0491 579999) The Local Investment Networking Company. Comprising 12 Training and Enterprise Councils and Enterprise Agencies, this national umbrella group is sponsored by the private sector. Councillors ensure business plans are complete but their assessment has in the past been seen as more perfunctory than VCR's. The company seeking equity writes a two-page summary that is published in Linc's monthly bulletin. Linc says there are 250 investors on the books of regional members who have helped raise about Pounds 4.5m for 95 businesses since the group was set up in 1987. It says investor meetings run by its members are increasingly popular; at each meeting about six companies tread the catwalk before potential investors in a beauty parade. Linc's record has been patchy. Some members, like Staffordshire Development Association, have been active and successful. Others have done almost no deals and have left Linc. Companies pay Pounds 200, investors Pounds 120 a year; some of the Linc members charge commissions when cash is successfully raised. (Tel 071 236 3000). Techinvest. Based in Cheshire and one of the DTI's five demonstration programmes, Techinvest is one of the more successful regional introduction services. Started in February 1993, it has 79 angels on its books and says it has raised more than Pounds 1m for 20 deals in 12 businesses. (Pounds 500,000 was provided in one deal by a venture capital group.) The service offers companies seeking money a subsidised advisory service during which consultants put the proposal into shape. It also runs investor meetings and plans to open them to the public for a fee next month. Techinvest sends some of its proposals to VCR and some to Linc for inclusion in Linc's national bulletin. Investors and companies pay Pounds 200 to join  -Pounds 400 if their cases are published through VCR - and a fee similar to VCR's if cash is successfully raised. The source of future funding is uncertain. (Tel 0606 737009.) The Capital Exchange. The youngest of the four partners the DTI was trying to encourage, Capital Exchange is purely a publishing operation. It aims to provide a market place for information and attempts to provide angels with a wide choice of businesses, but it does not vet its investors. A network of self-employed principle advisers spends about three hours verifying that companies seeking funds have a complete business plan. These advisers receive part of the Pounds 120 fee that the companies pay for inclusion in a newsletter. Capital Exchange says it has found as much interest among corporate as private investors. Set up late last year, Capital Exchange says it has found joint venture partners or equity for 19 businesses. It has no way of verifying how much of the Pounds 2.8m sought was actually raised. It has 1,100 members, 700 of which are investors, who pay Pounds 75 a year membership. (Tel 0432 342484.) Somewhat different from all of these is 3i, the UK's largest supplier of private equity to private companies. At the height of the recession, 3i had used successful businessmen and women with time on their hands as non-executive directors, particularly in smaller companies which the group was refinancing. Increasingly these non-executives wanted and took equity stakes, investing alongside 3i in classic informal financings where the managerial expertise of the angel was as important as the cash. The group says that a large number of its deals worth less than Pounds 500,000 now follow this pattern of co-investments alongside business angels. In the 17 months to the end of December 1993, 3i co-invested in 53 companies in this way; its contribution is between three and 10 times what the angels invest, depending on the size of the deal. 3i says it has 150 business angels on its books, many of whom want more than one non-executive equity investment. The angel is often the factor that makes the deal viable, 3i says. Other groups trying to introduce angels and opportunities include accounting firms such as Blackstone Franks that keep a database as part of their service to customers. The National Westminster Bank has said it will launch a pilot introduction service that will incorporate a national database of business angels. The launch has been delayed but NatWest says it is developing the product. Other introduction agencies are listed in a booklet produced by the British Venture Capital Association. One group not in this guide is Enterprise Adventure (Tel 0483 458111), which launched a national database last week called Venturelist. Computer-based, it hopes to be a national clearing house which angels can access via modems. After a period in which the service is free, companies will pay Pounds 300 for a quality assessment by a consultant and an entry on the database. Individual investors will pay Pounds 500 - firms of accountants bringing a number of angels will pay Pounds 1,000. Like the other services, Venturelist will depend heavily on getting an adequate supply of angels and a strong enough deal flow. Pinning down angels and the amount they invest is notoriously difficult. But if recent research is to be believed, there are about 50,000 informal investors in the UK. Colin Mason, of the University of Southampton, guestimates angels have as much as Pounds 3bn they would invest if only they could be joined with business opportunities. A better flow of information would clearly facilitate more marriages between angels and entrepreneurs. But judging by the record, most angels will continue to find their investment opportunities through their own networks rather than through the energetic offices of the business introduction services.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Southern plans further job losses SOUTHERN, the US utility, is to cut 1,250 jobs this year at its Georgia Power and Alabama Power units, Reuter reports. The company said at its annual meeting that it expected compliance with the clean air act to cost Dollars 2.2bn. Mr Edward Addison, chairman, said, in answer to a shareholder question, that the cost could be as much as Dollars 3bn. Mr Addison said additional workforce cuts were a priority. 'There's no question in my mind, looking at our five operating subsidiaries and Southern Co Services, that we still have many opportunities to cut out unnecessary duplication. This is particularly true of the staff support we provide to our basic business units.' The company reported on May 26 four months' earnings of Dollars 220m, or 70 cents per share. Mr Addison said that 'no charges will be brought' in connection with a US government investigation into investments by the company's pension plans, through his son, who worked at the investment firm of Kidder Peabody.</p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MCHENDRY WESTLAKE'S LASTEST HERO AS WARRIORS ADVANCE TO SEMIFINALS  </P> <P> During Westlake High's 29-game journey to the Southern Section 5-A Division  baseball semifinals, clutch performances from various players have helped  smooth the ride.  </P> <P> Friday at Bishop Amat, it was Matt McHendry's turn at the wheel.  </P> <P> McHendry, a senior right fielder, had two hits to set up two runs, then added a  diving catch that saved at least one run in a 5-2 win over the Lancers.  Top-seeded Westlake (28-1) will meet Marina (15-12-1), a 4-0 winner over Mater  Dei, Tuesday at 4 p.m. in a semifinal at Blair Field in Long Beach.  </P> <P> "A different guy has picked us up all year," Westlake Coach Rich Herrera said.  "It just goes to show that we have a pretty solid lineup."  </P> <P> Balance has helped the Warriors overcome a batting slump that has affected  their top two hitters, Tim Falsken and Mike Lieberthal, who are a combined  three for 19 in the playoffs.  </P> <P> And who better to come to the rescue than McHendry? He hit .235 and was  platooned in right field with Keenan McAluney during the regular season, but he  has started each of Westlake's three playoff games and is hitting .429 in the  postseason.  </P> <P> Yet his most important contribution Friday might have been his catch that ended  the fifth inning with the tying run at first base.  </P> <P> With Westlake nursing a 3-1 lead, Bishop Amat (18-10) put runners at first and  third with two out. George Garcia followed with a soft fly ball along the  right-field foul line, and McHendry -- playing deep in Bishop Amat's spacious  outfield -- sprinted in to make a diving catch.  </P> <P> The nearest fence at the Lancers' home field is 415 feet from the plate, which  forced McHendry to approach each ball with caution.  </P> <P> "I was playing back, just worrying about keeping the ball in front of me," he  said. "At first, I thought it was going foul, but I felt I had it all the way."  </P> <P> The rest of Westlake's defense was equally impressive. Shortstop Falsken and  second baseman Rick Wolters combined to turn two double plays, including one to  end the game, and pitcher Mike Eby (11-0) induced the Lancers into 13 ground  outs.  </P> <P> Westlake erased a 1-0 deficit in the second on Todd Preston's first home run of  the season and took a 2-1 lead on Dave Monheim's two-out single in the fourth.  </P> <P> McHendry helped produce a run in the fifth when he singled, stole second and  scored on Rob Neal's double to give Westlake a 3-1 lead.  </P> <P> The Warriors added two runs in the seventh. McHendry singled, Wolters was hit  by a pitch, and both runners advanced on a wild pitch from Eric White (6-3).  </P> <P> Neal then followed with a two-run single that gave Westlake a 5-1 lead.  </P> <P> That was plenty for Eby, a senior left-hander who went the distance for the  11th time in 13 starts. Eby allowed eight hits and four walks but pitched out  of three jams.  </P> <P> And McHendry's heroics were enough for Herrera, who was left wondering which  Warrior is next in line.  </P> <P> "I think it's our scorekeeper's turn," he said with a laugh.  </P></p>

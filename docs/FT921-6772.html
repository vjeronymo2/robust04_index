			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Record loss on UK loans hits NatWest RECORD LOSSES on UK loans in 1991 led to a collapse in the profits of National Westminster Bank to their lowest level since 1975. As a result, the bank plans to cut staff numbers by at least 4,000 this year, having shed 6,400 jobs last year. Separately, NatWest faced allegations yesterday that UK customers were being forced to pay, in the form of higher charges, for the bank's lending mistakes, because it also disclosed that its income from fees and commissions last year had risen sharply. NatWest's pre-tax profits last year dropped by 78 per cent to Pounds 110m due to a bad debt charge of Pounds 1.99bn, which included losses on UK lending of Pounds 1.45bn, the biggest ever incurred by a UK bank. The poor results - which meant that NatWest had to withdraw Pounds 220m from reserves to pay a maintained dividend of 17.5p a share - represent a sharp reversal in its fortunes. Only three years ago the bank made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.41bn, more than any other UK bank before or since. Nonetheless, its trading surplus last year rose 20 per cent to a record Pounds 2.03bn, largely due to a sharp rise in commissions. Lord Alexander, NatWest chairman, said the bank had pushed up the charges paid by UK customers and had new computerised monitoring techniques to ensure that an increased proportion of eligible customers paid their charges. Ms Jean Eaglesham, of the Consumers Association, said: 'Customers are paying extra charges to compensate for the bank's lending mistakes.' Only Lloyds Bank has made a bigger charge than NatWest to cover the risk of bad debts. However, Lloyds' 1989 charge of Pounds 2.1bn largely reflected difficulties on loans to less-developed countries rather than loans to UK customers. NatWest's bad debt charge meant that its UK financial services division  - the heart of its business and including its 2,816 branches - incurred a loss, its first ever, of Pounds 5m. Lord Alexander said there had been 'some departures from the principles of sound lending'. However, he said no NatWest executives or managers had lost their jobs as a direct result of the loan losses. Mr Tom Frost, who has been group chief executive since 1987 and retires next year, said it was bad banking practice to sack staff for making bad loans. Bankers 'would not lend any money at all' if they feared their jobs were on the line for lending mistakes. However, the group reduced staff numbers by 6,400 last year largely through a voluntary redundancy programme. 'I expect to see that trend continue,' Mr Frost said. 'At least 4,000 jobs will go this year.' NatWest's losses on loans to the Maxwell empire were much lower than many had expected, at about Pounds 50m, according to analysts. The bulk of bad debt charges arose on loans to small and medium-size businesses and to personal customers. Lord Alexander said he was hopeful that bad debt charges would fall this year.

			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FREEDOM BOWL CHRONOLOGY  </P> <P> 1984  </P> <P> Final score: Iowa 55, Texas 17.  </P> <P> Attendance: 24,093.  </P> <P> MVPs: Chuck Long, Iowa quarterback (29 for 39, 461 yards, six touchdowns);  William Harris, Texas tight end (six catches, 37 yards, one touchdown).  </P> <P> What happened: In a driving rain, Long threw a Freedom Bowl-record six  touchdown passes, each to a different receiver. Iowa took a 14-0 lead in the  first quarter, but Texas rallied to cut the margin to 24-17 at halftime. The  Hawkeyes then scored 31 consecutive points in the third quarter and limited the  Texas offense to 112 yards and five first downs in the second half.  </P> <P> 1985  </P> <P> Final score: Washington 20, Colorado 17.  </P> <P> Attendance: 30,961.  </P> <P> MVPs: Chris Chandler, Washington quarterback (15 for 26, 141 yards); Barry  Helton, Colorado punter (one for one passing, 31 yards, one touchdown;  39.0-yard punting average, one punt for 54 yards).  </P> <P> What happened: Colorado drove to the Washington five in the fourth quarter but  lost the ball on the fumble as the Huskies held on. Tony Covington's one-yard  scoring run in the third quarter and Jeff Jaeger's 18-yard field goal in the  fourth provided the winning points. Colorado pulled to 20-17 on Helton's pass  to Jon Embree off a fake field-goal attempt early in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> 1986  </P> <P> Final score: UCLA 31, BYU 10.  </P> <P> Attendance: 51,422.  </P> <P> MVPs: Gaston Green, UCLA tailback (33 carries, 266 yards, three touchdowns; one  for one passing, 13 yards, one touchdown); Shane Shumway, BYU defensive back  (five unassisted tackles, one interception, two passes broken up).  </P> <P> What happened: Green was the story, rushing for three touchdowns and throwing  for another. The Bruins scored 17 consecutive points in the third quarter, on  runs of one and 79 yards by Green (the former set up by a 70-yard run by Marcus  Greenwood) and a 49-yard field goal by Dave Franey. Green finished his  impressive day with a 13-yard halfback option pass to Karl Dorrell.  </P> <P> 1987  </P> <P> Final score: Arizona State 33, Air Force 28.  </P> <P> Attendance: 33,261.  </P> <P> MVPs: Daniel Ford, Arizona State quarterback (16 of 30, 272 yards, one  touchdown); Chad Hennings, Air Force defensive tackle (12 unassisted tackles  (three for 12 yards in losses), two sacks).  </P> <P> What happened: Arizona State took a 24-14 halftime lead with 24 second-quarter  points, then held on as the Falcons rallied behind third-string quarterback  Lance McDowell. Arizona State's second quarter included the longest pass in  Freedom Bowl history, 61 yards from Daniel Ford to Aaron Cox, who is now with  the Rams. Air Force played without standout quarterback Dee Dowis, who was out  with a fractured wrist. Steve Letnich started the game and drove the Falcons to  the game's first touchdown, but he was relieved by McDowell, who directed two  long scoring drives in the fourth quarter, each ending on a touchdown pass to  Steve Senn.  </P> <P> 1988  </P> <P> Final score: BYU 20, Colorado 17.  </P> <P> Attendance: 35,941.  </P> <P> MVPs: Ty Detmer, BYU quarterback (11 for 17, 129 yards, one touchdown); Eric  Bieniemy, Colorado halfback, 33 carries, 144 yards, two touchdowns; two  catches, 20 yards).  </P> <P> What happened: The game was a preview of things to come for Detmer, this year's  Heisman Trophy winner, and Bieniemy, who finished third in the balloting.  Detmer, then a freshman, came off the bench in relief of Sean Covey and led the  Cougars on a 65-yard drive that ended with a 14-yard pass to Chuck Cutler,  tying the score, 14-14. Two fourth-quarter field goals by Jason Chaffetz  provided the winning margin for BYU. The second, from 35 yards, came with about  three minutes to play.  </P> <P> 1989  </P> <P> Final score: Washington 34, Florida 7.  </P> <P> Attendance: 33,858.  </P> <P> MVPs: Cary Conklin, Washington quarterback (21 for 39, 217 yards, two  touchdowns); Huey Richardson, Florida linebacker (nine unassisted tackles (two  for losses), one sack, three passes broken up).  </P> <P> What happened: The Gators didn't put up much of a fight. Perhaps they were  distracted by speculation concerning their next coach (Duke's Steve Spurrier,  the 1966 Heisman Trophy winner from Florida, was named the next day). Junior  running back Emmitt Smith, playing his final college game before jumping to the  NFL, was held to 17 yards in seven carries by the Husky defense. Washington  scored four times in the first half, including one touchdown off a blocked  punt, to take a 27-7 lead. Greg Lewis provided rushing support for Conklin,  gaining 97 yards in 27 carries.  </P></p>

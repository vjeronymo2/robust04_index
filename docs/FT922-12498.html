			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Housing starts lift US economic hopes AN unexpected jump in US housing starts last month to their highest level for two years yesterday raised hopes for a slow economic recovery. Analysts were also cheered by better than expected trade figures for February. A surge in exports led to a deficit of only Dollars 3.4bn (Pounds 1.9bn), the smallest monthly shortfall for nearly nine years. Other signs of economic strength included a drop in claims for unemployment insurance in early April and a rise in an index of manufacturing activity compiled by the Federal Reserve bank of Philadelphia. The Commerce Department said housing starts rose 6.4 per cent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,345,000. Most analysts had expected a decline, following sharp increases in previous months. Starts are now running nearly 60 per cent above the trough reached in January last year. The growth may falter, however, given demographic trends that have reduced demand for housing. The increase last month reflected a big and probably erratic gain in starts for apartment buildings. Starts for single-family housing, the mainstay of the residential market, fell slightly. The decline in the trade deficit reflected a Dollars 2.4bn rise in exports to Dollars 37.8bn - a record in cash terms - and a Dollars 0.2bn fall in imports to Dollars 41.2bn. Exports in the first two months of the year were 8.1 per cent up on the same period last year. The strength of exports in February partly reflected a jump in aircraft sales, which move erratically on a monthly basis. Officials indicated slower demand in foreign markets might pose problems for US exporters this year. These more encouraging reports followed lacklustre figures for retail sales and industrial production this week, highlighting the halting nature of the economic recovery.</p>

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / US Money and Credit: Long bonds bear brunt of further inflation jitters A FRESH bout of inflation jitters is running through the US credit markets - just ahead of tomorrow's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee. The worries were sparked off by two sets of statistics last week. The producer price index, released on Wednesday, showed a rise of 0.6 per cent in April, well above analysts' expectations and the largest gain in 2 1/2 years. That sent long bond prices down more than half a point on the day. Thursday's consumer price index had an even greater impact on the market. It showed an unexpected 0.4 per cent rise last month and, when coupled with the release of figures showing a 1.2 per cent rise in April retail sales, knocked nearly 1 1/4 points off the long bond. The bad inflation news was particularly poorly timed from the US Treasury's viewpoint, for it came only a few hours before the government's sale of Dollars 8.25bn of 30-year bonds, the last stage in its large quarterly refunding programme. The worries persisted to the end of the week, with the yield on the long bond standing around 6.94 per cent on Friday night, compared with 6.84 a week earlier. All this has killed off the market's faint hopes that tomorrow's Fed meeting might ease monetary policy in view of the succession of other recent figures showing the disappointingly slow growth in the economy. Instead, it has again posed the question of whether inflation is a significant threat, and how soon the Fed's current policy, targeting a 3 per cent rate on Federal funds, might turn tighter. The consensus among many Wall Street economists is that the latest inflation figures are probably an aberration - the latest in a series of scares which are likely to continue as the economy moves slowly and erratically forward. This view suggests that it is hard for inflation to take off when the economy may grow by between only 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent in the second quarter, and when unit labour costs are rising by less than 2 per cent in the non-farm sector. Some bond bears argue that inflation has tended historically to accelerate in the third year of an economic recovery, and since the US is now in this stage it is bound to suffer accordingly. However, as Mr Mitchell Held, of securities house Smith Barney, points out, the current recovery is different from past ones, with the rate of utilisation of excess capacity falling far short of previous rebounds. He adds: 'The normal rise in the capacity utilisation rate will not come to pass and commodity prices need not rise. Therefore, the normal rise in inflation or inflation fears that often characterises the second, third and/or fourth years of an economic recovery need not materialise.' While bond bears have read dire warnings into the recent sharp rise in the price of gold - which historically has been a measure of inflation fears - many analysts attribute this partly to special factors at work in the precious metals market, including strong demand and worries about supply constraints in the Asia-Pacific region. Against this background, and with lingering doubts over the sustainability of the economic recovery, a Fed tightening of monetary policy still seems many months down the road, and the current 3 per cent target for Fed Funds could even stay in place for the remainder of this year. However, at the same time, inflation fears seem likely to stall the rally at the long end of the market around its current trading range - particularly given Wall Street's growing doubts about President Clinton's capacity to push strong, deficit-cutting legislation through Congress.</p>

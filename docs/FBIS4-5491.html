			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- The split in the governing  coalition deepened Tuesday over how to pick a successor to Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa who announced his resignation last  Friday, coalition sources said.    Leaders of three out of the seven parties in the coalition  met again in the Diet, following the one on Monday. They were  the heads of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the new party  Sakigake and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP). The head of  a pro-SDP group in the House of Councillors, the Democratic  Reform Party (DRP), joined the session.    SDP Chairman Tomiich Murayama, Sakigake leader Masayoshi  Takemura and DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi, DRP leader Eiichi  Nakamura agreed in the meeting that they will never give the  mandate on the choice of Hosokawa's successor to a lower-level  forum made up of secretaries general, coalition officials said.    Heads of four other parties -- Shinseito, Komeito, the Japan  New Party (JNP), and the United Social Democratic Party (USDP)  -- again boycotted the top leaders' session proposed by the  SDP's Murayama, arguing that the matter should first be  discussed at the secretary general-level forum. They are  Tsutomu Hata of Shinseito, Koshiro Ishida of Komeito, Hosokawa  of the JNP, and Satsuki Eda of the USDP.    The SDP, Sakigake and DSP are wary that Shinseito Secretary  General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi  Ichikawa may take the leading role in the secretary  general-level discussions over the choice of the successor.    After the three party leaders gave their blessings to  Murayama's proposal to reserve the mandate to pick the new  premier for themselves, the SDP-led camp conveyed its stand to  the Shinseito-led forum, adding fuel to the intra-coalition  hostilities.    Murayama, Takemura, Ouchi and Nakamura also agreed to band  again whenever necessary, while monitoring how the Shinseito-led  caucus would respond to their claim for the mandate, coalition  officials said.    The Shinseito-led caucus has been insisting upon its  authority to pick the coalition's next prime ministerial  candidate on the strength of a statement by Hosokawa that he  wants the caucus to take charge of decision-making on the  "remaining" matters, they said.    However, Murayama rejected their interpretation, saying,  "the  premier's remark merely implied that he wants the caucus to take  care of the remaining small businesses (until a next premier is  picked)."    "In selecting the prime minister of a country, the meeting  of  the deputy chiefs of the parties should not be given the mandate  to pick the premier," Murayama told the other three leaders from  Sakigake, the DSP and the DRP.    Takemura told the top leaders meeting, "although I agree to  make efforts to maintain the current combination, I want them  (the Shiseito-led caucus) to feel repentant and amend the  attitudes they have taken over the past eight months."    A Komeito official said of the rising intra-coalition  standoff, "now it is impossible to mend fences."    "We cannot help altering a combination of political parties  that comprise the ruling coalition government," he said.    Shinseito head Hata, who is the foreign minister, denied  reports that the coalition is on the brink of collapse.    Hata told a news conference Tuesday, "it's true that various  emotions are entangled." "But if we go back to the starting  point of why we established the coalition, I think we can  restore it."    JNP leader Hosokawa indicated there will be a recombination  of parties in the eight-month-old ruling coalition, telling some  party legislators "the coalition needs to accept a new group."    A separate standoff is beginning to undercut the solidarity  of the No. 1 opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP), party sources said.    While the backers of former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe  are waging a campaign to have him selected as the LDP's  candidate for premiership, LDP President Yohei Kono announced  his intention to run for premiership himself.    The LDP, the single largest party in the House of  Representatives with a 219-legislator parliamentary strength,  now stands a chance of sweeping back to power on the strength of  the growing intra-coalition animosity, political sources said.    The majority in the 511-member lower chamber is 256.  Watanabe backers said they have solicited the support from more  than 40 LDP legislators by Tuesday.    If Watanabe wants to sweep to power as the head of a new  coalition government, he needs to muster support of about 100  LDP legislators, on top of the allegiance of the combined  156-member strength of his own LDP faction, Shinseito, Komeito  and the JNP, which are deemed to be ready to lend their support  to Watanabe, the sources said.</p>

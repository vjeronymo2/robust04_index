			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Personal View: A spirit of solidarity The antagonistic system of opposing values which divided European thought and action for more than 40 years has come to an end. This has caused some people in the west to lose their sense of direction. A return to old hegemonic thinking appears, to some, to be easier than the creation of a dynamic policy of responsibility founded on a peaceful European order. Europe is one continent. Political and economic upheavals in any part of it affect every European country. No one can insulate themselves from this. No one can live on an island of the blessed. I cannot repeat often enough the tenet on which German foreign policy has been based since the radical changes in the east began. If eastern Europe fares badly, western Europe, too, in the longer term will not prosper. The west bears great responsibility for the development of political, economic, social and military stability in the new European democracies. That is not altruism. It is a necessary precept for stability in the region ranging from Vancouver to Vladivostok. The process of growing together is under way. It is taking place within a series of complementary frameworks: the European Community, Nato, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), the Council of Europe, the North Atlantic Co-operation Council and the Western European Union. The European Community and the western alliance are the cores from which Europe can draw strength. These institutions must be further and decisively developed - both internally and externally. As far as the European Community is concerned, the discussion over 'widening' or 'deepening' poses the wrong alternatives. Enlarging the number of members and deepening ties in the political, economic and security fields are not mutually exclusive. Anyone who tries to propagate this belief is a false prophet. Such people do not simply place obstacles along the path of integration; they also do not understood the concept of European integration. The founding fathers of the European Community organised it on a pan-European basis. On this point, the language of the Treaty of Rome is unambiguous. The economic philosophy of expanding the Community to the north and to the south was based on the aim of bridging gaps in prosperity, in a spirit of solidarity. This applies even more to the goal of enlarging the Community eastwards. Through the political integration of western Europe, traditional sources of conflict have been put aside. They have been replaced by a growing European awareness of interdependent interests. The national conflicts and uncertainties caused by the collapse of communism in eastern and south-eastern Europe have not spread. This is a positive result of post-war political developments in western Europe, which must not be underestimated. In Maastricht we laid the foundations for a forward-looking Community strategy of parallel enlargement and deepening. The momentum must not be lost. The basic condition is that the treaty establishing political union must be ratified by all member states before the end of the year. It is imperative that the European Council, meeting in Lisbon in June, should lay the groundwork for the shape of Europe in 2000, based on the twin pillars of widening and deepening. The prerequisites are: By 1995 those Efta states wishing to join should be jointly admitted, in as uniform a procedure as possible. The negotiations on accession must begin in 1993. Even this first enlargement makes institutional adjustments necessary in the Union. This applies to a redefinition of the composition of the European parliament and of the number of commissioners. These questions must be clarified by the end of the year. As the next step, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland should be able to accede to the Community. Europe's challenge for the coming years is to create the economic climate under which this can happen. The institutional basis of the Community must be further developed at the 1996 review conference which was envisaged at Maastricht. This includes the shaping of the common foreign and security policy, with the prospect of a common defence and the extension of the powers of the European parliament. The other reforming states of central and south-eastern Europe, too, must be gradually brought closer to accession through association. The former Soviet republics must be made close partners of the Union as part of the new eastern agreements. People who hark back to yesterday's dreams may try to escape down nationalistic paths of salvation. The only way of barring such routes is to open the road to Europe. This demands great effort and solidarity. If we fail in that task, we will face incalculable consequences for our own stability and prosperity. The author is German foreign minister. He retires on Monday after 18 years in office. This is the first in an occasional series on European issues</p>

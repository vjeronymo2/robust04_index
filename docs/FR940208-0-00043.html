			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Water quality measurement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Iowa proposes, at IAC 27&hyph;40.36(5), to revise its incorporation by reference of 30 CFR 780.21(a) by adding the following sentence at the end of the regulation: ``The methodology for measurement of the quantity of both surface water and groundwater shall also be described.'' OSM interprets this to mean that such measurement methodologies must be described in the permit application, although the State proposal does not explicitly so provide. The Federal regulation at 30 CFR 780.21(a) requires that all water-quality analyses performed shall be conducted according to the methodology in the 15th edition of ``Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater'' or the methodology in 40 CFR Parts 136 and 434 but the regulation does not specify that the methodology for measurement of the quantity of both surface water and groundwater shall also be described. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, section 30 CFR 777.13(a) requires all technical data submitted in the application be accompanied by, among other things, a description of the methodology used to collect and analyze the data. Iowa incorporates 30 CFR 777.13(a) at IAC 27&hyph;40.33(207). Hence, the addition of this proposed language simply reiterates the need for a description of the methodology used. Therefore, The Director is approving Iowa's proposed revision at IAC 27&hyph;40.36(5). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Water information requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Iowa proposes, at IAC 27&hyph;40.36(6), to revise its incorporation by reference of 30 CFR 780.21(d) by deleting the phrase ``may be required by the regulatory authority'' and replacing it with the phrase ``is required.'' The deleted phrase provided the State with discretion whether to require actual surface and groundwater information be provided when modeling techniques, interpolation or statistical techniques are included in the permit application. Iowa, by removing this phrase, will now require the actual surface and groundwater information to be included in all permits applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director finds that this is a matter left to the discretion of the State regulatory authority under the Federal regulations. Accordingly, the Director finds this proposed revision at IAC 27&hyph;40.36(6) to be no less effective than the Federal regulations and is approving it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 20. IAC 27&hyph;40.37(4), Cross Sections, Maps, and Plans <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Iowa proposes to revise its rule at 27&hyph;40.37(4) to correct a typographical error. The current language provides that the first sentence in incorporated 30 CFR 783.24, dealing with informational requirements for underground mining permit applications, is changed to read ``The permit application shall include cross sections at a vertical exaggeration of 10:1, maps at a scale of 1:2400, and plans showing. .&blank;.&blank;.'' The State provision thus specifies more detailed requirements for cross sections and maps than are specified in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 783.25(a). This State provision, along with IAC 27&hyph;40.35(a), the parallel State provisions for surface mining permit applications, was approved by OSM on November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56578, 56579&hyph;56580), as a provision that added specificity to the Iowa program without adversely affecting other aspects of the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Iowa, in its July 8, 1993, submission proposed to correct the provision to require cross sections with a vertical exaggeration of 1:10, instead of 10:1. However, in revising the provision, Iowa inadvertently created another typographical error by requiring cross sections with a vertical exaggeration of 10:11:10. Consequently, Iowa, in a letter dated August 20, 1993, submitted an editorial clarification to is revised rule to clarify that the provision requires cross sections with a vertical exaggeration of 1:10. OSM understands Iowa's intent to exaggerate the vertical scale of a relief map or cross section in order to make the map or section more clearly perceptible. Therefore, in Iowa's case, the scale of vertical representation is exaggerated 10 times compared to the horizontal. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

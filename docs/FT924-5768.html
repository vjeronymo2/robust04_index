			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Terror uninsured SINCE THE bombing of the Commercial Union building in the City of London in April, it has become clear that the insurance industry is reluctant to provide cover against acts of terrorism in mainland Britain. The large continental reinsurance groups, which underwrote much of the estimated Pounds 800m cost of the CU bombing, have little remaining appetite for such business. British insurers lack the capital to take the full risk onto their own books. The question is whether the government will have to act as an underwriter of last resort. The insurance problems arising from terrorism in mainland Britain are a direct concern chiefly for a small number of high-profile companies and institutions. These companies bear a disproportionate share of the cost of maintaining stable business conditions for the community as a whole. Yet less vulnerable businesses, which derive benefits from a stable trading environment, are understandably reluctant to pay higher premiums after the bombing of a giant City office block. The case for government involvement is that the private sector cannot achieve an equitable sharing of the costs of maintaining stability in conditions that occasionally border on war. The government has been obliged to accept the logic of this argument in Northern Ireland, where criminal damage compensation arrangements have existed since the late 1960s. But it is not inclined to extend it to the mainland for understandable reasons. One is that ministers might be accused of 'giving in to terrorism'. Another is cost. Yet terrorism wins a far bigger victory if Britain's leading companies are forced to constrain their operations to cope with the terrorist threat; if large office blocks sustain falls in value because they cannot be insured against terrorist acts; and if foreign financial institutions are tempted to take their operations to other financial centres in the European time zone where insurance is more readily obtainable. The point of compensation is that it neuters the economic impact of terrorist violence - a case not of acquiescence but of countering terrorism by other means. The government cannot be blamed for seeking to minimise the bill: the potential liability in mainland Britain is palpably greater than in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, lengthy discussions drag on between representatives of British industry, insurance providers and the government to look for a middle way whereby public-sector financial support could be harnessed to a market framework, so reducing the cost to the state. The problem is that the market has already fought shy, because no actuary can assess the risk of how often further bombings may occur and to what effect. That suggests that a halfway house will be difficult to achieve: if the risk is uncommercial, establishing a basis for sharing it between public and private sector will be a nightmare. Whether or not the government falls back on the approach adopted in Northern Ireland, there can be no escape from some form of state involvement. It may be an uncomfortable role, but it is a proper one for government.</p>

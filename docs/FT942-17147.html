			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Survey of Business in Dorset (5): Big range of products - Industry Ryvita, crankshafts, intelligent networks, oil, beer, liquid crystals, opto-electronic systems and pork pies - these are just a small number of the ever-increasing variety of products produced in Dorset. 'We have faced up to a new type of environment. Specialism is important,' says Mr Jeremy Pope, managing director of the long-established brewery company, Eldridge Pope, based in Dorchester. 'Focus is important', agrees Mr Rex Burke, chief executive of Hamworthy Engineering, one of the county's largest employers. Both companies have recently undergone a refocusing of activities in order to capitalise on their strengths. Last year, Eldridge Pope disposed of its beer wholesaling operation and entered into a trading alliance with Carlsberg-Tetley. The company now specialises in wine procurement, shipping, bottling and packaging, export packaging and specialist bottling for a number of brewers, contract brewering and the production of cask brands and specialist bottled beers. Hamworthy Engineering, which began in Poole in 1914 and became part of the Powell Duffryn Group in 1962, employs 1,200 people. Last year, it sold its transmissions and hydraulics division to the David Brown Group in order to focus on its other activities of marine and combustion engineering for which it has long had a worldwide reputation. For example, Hamworthy's 'Schilling' rudder is supplied to more than half the Japanese merchant fleet. The company recently acquired Airoil-Flaregas from Portals and relocated it from West Drayton to the Poole site. Hamworthy is also expanding its interests in compressors. By focusing on these activities, Hamworthy has achieved a turnover of more than Pounds 120m, of which about 60 per cent is export sales. Dorset is also home to a number of other thriving engineering companies. Davy International is a world leader in metals engineering technology with a turnover of more than Pounds 160m. Five hundred of its worldwide staff of 5,200 are based in Poole. According to Mr Roy Tazzyman, Davy's chief executive: 'As we have moved to higher technology we have found it possible to recruit some of the best research and development engineers, skilled designers and project engineers partly because Poole is an attractive place.' When Trafalgar House acquired Davy in 1991 it moved Davy's world head office from London to Poole - but because this was efficiently run with delegation to the various companies in the group, the HQ staff comprised only 15 people. Hunts Engineering, employing 70 people in Poole, began life in 1875 repairing bicycles in Bournemouth. This privately-owned company now specialises in crankshaft machining. It is in at the birth and death of various car models when car manufacturers require experimental crankshafts at the design stage - and it produces crankshafts and spares when mass production has ceased. Sixty per cent of its production is for export and the company has a turnover of Pounds 5m. Meggitt, with its head office in Wimborne, had sales of just Pounds 3.8m in 1983. Since Mr Ken Coates and Mr Nigel McCorkell took over management of the company in 1984 it has expanded rapidly in aerospace, controls, electronics and energy-related engineering products so that it now has a turnover of more than Pounds 360m with operating companies around the world. Its Dorset-based Wayfarer magnetic card ticketing systems are market leaders in a number of countries. Bournemouth International Airport has attracted several big companies with aviation technology systems and other interests. FR Group, with its headquarters in Wimborne, has developed rapidly into a world leader in the provision of special mission flight operations and undertakes significant aircraft maintenance, overhaul and conversion operations at the airport. AIM Aviation has its completion centre at the airport where it installs aircraft interiors and its avionics workshop undertakes system design, installation and overhaul of communications and navigation equipment as well as sophisticated in-flight entertainment systems. Poole Harbour is the largest natural harbour in Europe and a number of marine-based companies have facilities in the area, including Sunseeker, a family-owned company founded in 1962 which now has a turnover of more than Pounds 35m. Its motor yachts have found buyers in many countries. Another family-owned company with worldwide sales is Daler-Rowney which employs more than 100 people in three factories in Wareham where artists' canvasses, art cases and other artists' supplies are produced. Ryvita, a subsidiary of Associated British Foods, is based in Poole where its factory produces many millions of packets of the 'best-tasting crispbread' and has won two Queens Awards for export achievement with about half its total production exported. Another well-known food company based in Poole is Millers which was acquired from Booker in 1991 by the Irish Foods Group, Kerry. Millers employs 400 people in Poole and its pies and other products are consumed throughout Britain. Another leading factory, employing 450 people, is Dolphin Packaging, the public quoted company founded in Poole in 1969 which now has a turnover of about Pounds 30m from its production of specialist plastic packaging for the food and medical industries. Liquid crystals for the electronics industry are created in Poole by Merck, which has based its UK headquarters in the town and employs 650 people in the area. In Weymouth, DEK employs 220 people producing screen printers for the electronics industry. It also provides key leading edge assembly equipment with 80 per cent of its production being exported. Tecan produces high technology parts for the electronics industry by photo-chemical machining and other processes. In Poole, Siemens-Plessey Controls employs 1,000 people and creates traffic control and transportation systems and develops and markets equipment for the environmental sector. GPT, jointly owned by GEC and Siemens, employs 500 people in Poole, engaged in Telecoms systems work, including developing, testing and marketing intelligent networks where telephone systems are enhanced to provide a whole range of new services. Mr Jeffery Wear, engineering liaison manager of GPT in Poole, echoes the comments of many other managers in Dorset: 'The area is an attractive place in which to work and live'. Respecting that is BP, operator of Wytch Farm, the largest on-shore oilfield in western Europe which employs 300 people and produces about 2.5m gallons of oil a day. BP's well sites, especially those at Fur zey Island, have been attractively landscaped and incorporate many trees to screen the facilities from the public.</p>

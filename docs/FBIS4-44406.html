			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Fan Chieh-hui (5400 0267 2264): </F> "Li Chu-ming (2621 2691 6900) Discusses Writing the Political  Program of the `Democratic Party'--It Will Clarify Policy on  China Questions"]    [Text] After the merger of the Hong Kong Alliance and  Meeting Point into one new party, the "Democratic Party," there  will be a change in policy, and the formerly vague China policy  will be clarified and rendered specific. Li Chu-ming, chairman  of Hong Kong Alliance, described it as an excellent change to  accommodate the new developments in the overall situation.  Writing the political program of the new party is an opportunity  that will allow incorporating some of Meeting Point's ideas on  China.    When the Hong Kong Alliance was founded in 1990, it resented  being mixed up by outsiders with the "Chih Lian Hui," and it  therefore described itself in contradistinction as a local  political organization based on Hong Kong, closely interested in  every policy of the Chinese Government that concerns Hong Kong,  but "without any intention of involving itself in the politics  of Chinese territory outside of Hong Kong." In observance of  this principle, the Hong Kong Alliance has all along declined to  involve itself in China's internal affairs, and it has, indeed  for this reason, been criticized by outsiders that it lacked a  China policy and lacked discernment in matters Chinese.    On the other hand, Meeting Point had decided already at the  time of its founding in 1983 on a set of "New Three People's  Principles," i.e. on a "return to democracy" standpoint. In its  political program it clearly outlined as the role of the people  of Hong Kong "to contribute to the development of China," and it  supported in a variety of forms and through solid contacts the  progressive forces inside and outside the system. As to its  China policy, it emphasized in even stronger terms adoption of a  "critical relationship."    In the 10 prominent paragraphs of the manifesto on the  organization of the new party, there is one paragraph that  asserts that the people of Hong Kong are a part of the Chinese  people "with the right and responsibility to participate in and  deliberate on national affairs." This reflects a quite different  attitude on the China question than that of the Hong Kong  Alliance.    Yesterday, Li Chu-ming expressed to this reporter that  writing the political program of the new party will provide an  opportunity to further elucidate and concretely stipulate the  attitude toward China. He pointed out that the closer we get to  1979, the more reason there is for the people of Hong Kong to  concern themselves with the affairs of China, and it is also  clearly written in the constitution of the PRC that the Chinese  people have the right and duty to do just that.    He said, in the past the attitude of the Hong Kong Alliance  had been that the people of Hong Kong should not concern  themselves with policies and measures that had only to do with  China's internal affairs, and that they should not comment on  such. However, from now on there will be a change in that they  should make their position clear on particular events whenever  necessary. He believes "it is a good thing to clarify policy  `toward China.'"    The two parties appointed 16 delegates to form a combined  preparatory committee to implement the merger and may later set  up another team with the particular responsibility to write the  political program of the new party. Li Chu-ming indicated that  the Hong Kong Alliance will of course incorporate some points of  the Meeting Point's political program. He said: "Wherever the  Hong Kong Alliance lacks competent people and specialized  knowledge, things from Meeting Point will be taken over."    On the question of policy toward the Chinese Government, he  declared: "We shall certainly approve of everything good, and  everything that is not, we shall oppose." The Hong Kong Alliance  has shifted from avoiding involvement in internal affairs to  actively facing problems of that nature, and is displaying  precisely the attitude of a "critical relationship" that Meeting  Point had advocated all along. Meeting Point's political program  contained its standpoint on six eminent problems in China-Hong  Kong relations, namely: the state's nationality principle,  consideration of legal principles, the 4 June incident, the role  of the people of Hong Kong, participation in national affairs,  and the "critical relationship." As far as the Hong Kong  Alliance is concerned, it did not display concrete principles,  but merely emphasized the principle of "promoting mutual  relations between China and Hong Kong outside of the political  area." What changes there will be in the political program of  the new party will certainly deserve our close attention.</p>

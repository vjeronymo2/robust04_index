			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The first meeting between employers and unions took  place on 1 February. Nothing has leaked out of this meeting, but  the topics to be discussed were the following: salaries,  employees, and a final solution to the crisis. The members of  the private sector who had participated in this meeting said the  discussions were constructive. Bernard Craan reaffirmed that the  objective of the movement by employers' associations is the  lifting of the embargo.    [Begin recording] I believe that what we employers are doing  is a rational step. We are just expressing our exasperation, and  saying aloud what everybody has been saying in a quiet voice. It  is time for the protagonists of this crisis to sit, think, and  find the solution the country needs so this embargo can  eventually be lifted and so we can again begin working normally  toward the establishment of a fair society and a state of order.    I think I am just saying what everybody else is thinking. I  do not see why I should be afraid. We have made contact, we keep  making contact, but the results of thr contacts cannot be  disclosed until they have been completed. We cannot unveil our  strategy and say what we are going to do and how we are going to  do it. It would be thoughtless on our part. [end recording]    It should be recalled that a second meeting between the  employers' sector and the labor union sector is scheduled for  today.</p>

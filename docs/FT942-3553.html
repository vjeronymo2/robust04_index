			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Dixons to accelerate Currys revamp Dixons, the electrical retailer, is accelerating the shift of its Currys chain into out-of-town superstores by disposing of 100 high street branches this year, writes Neil Buckley. The group has appointed Conrad Ritblat Sinclair Goldsmith to rationalise Currys. Costs of the programme will be disclosed next month. Dixons said moving Currys out of town had long been its aim, but although it had reduced the high street stores from 500 to 335, it had been held back by the sluggish property market. Keeping stores open had often proved better than closing them without being able to dispose of the lease. However, Dixons said the property market was now recovering and the 'trend of improving returns in the high street stores has come to an end'. Dixons plans to add up to 40 stores to Currys' 158 superstores this year.</p>

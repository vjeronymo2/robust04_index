			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: COVINA;  </P> <P> PAYMENT FOR SLIME DRAIN  </P> <P> The City Council has agreed to pay most of the costs of installing an  underground storm drain to stem the flow of green slime onto three local  streets.  </P> <P> The slime is caused by irrigation runoff from the Covina Palms housing  development on Rimsdale Avenue.  </P> <P> A 30-inch drain will be installed on the west side of Glentana Street, a  cul-de-sac abutting the development. The $150,000 project is scheduled for  completion Feb. 1.  </P> <P> Developers McIntyre/Reenders Development Co. and Lewis Homes of California will  contribute $45,000 and the city will pay $105,000.  </P> <P> Residents blame city officials for failing to require the storm drain before  the site was developed. The developers have argued that they should not have to  pay the entire cost since the city had not originally required the drain.  </P></p>

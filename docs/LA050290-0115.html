			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> UFW FOUNDER ASKS UCI TO JOIN BOYCOTT  </P> <P> United Farm Workers founder Cesar Chavez received a standing ovation from more  than 430 people who packed a UC Irvine auditorium Tuesday to hear him ask for  support of the 4-year-old boycott of table grapes. The grapes boycott -- the  third organized by UFW since it was founded 28 years ago -- is aimed at forcing  growers to stop using pesticides, which Chavez and other union members blame  for an alarming increase of cancer among farm workers in the Central Valley.  </P> <P> The East Los Angeles-based roots-rock band Los Lobos made a surprise appearance  to show its support for the boycott and for Chavez.  </P> <P> Chavez is encouraging students at 11 Southern California campuses this week to  fast for one day in observance of his cause.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HORSE RACING ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BAYAKOA WINS SPINSTER BY A RECORD 11 1/2 LENGTHS  </P> <P> Bayakoa strengthened her bid to become older mare of the year Saturday, scoring  a record-breaking 11 1/2-length victory in the Grade I Spinster Stakes at  Keeneland in Lexington, Ky.  </P> <P> Bayakoa, ridden by Laffit Pincay Jr., took the lead at the start and gradually  put distance between herself and five rivals in winning the $250,000-added race  over 1 1/8 miles in 1:47 4/5.  </P> <P> It was the largest winning margin in the 34 years of the Spinster, and the  second-fastest time in the race's history, equaling Track Robbery's mark in  1982. Numbered Account set the record of 1:47 2/5 in 1972.  </P> <P> Goodbye Halo finished second by 1 1/2 lengths over Sharp Dance. Stoneleigh's  Hope was another three lengths back in fourth before a record Keeneland crowd  of 28,788.  </P> <P> The victory was worth $172,412, pushing Bayakoa's lifetime earnings to  $1,061,866.  </P> <P> Bayakoa returned $2.80, $2.20 and $2.40. Goodbye Halo paid $2.60 and $2.60, and  Sharp Dance paid 3.80.  </P> <P> Goodbye Halo, a 4-year-old daughter of Halo, stumbled at the gate and an  anticipated two-horse battle with Bayakoa never materialized.  </P> <P> Bayakoa and Goodbye Halo had met five times this year, with Bayakoa winning  four times. Goodbye Halo, however, turned in a strong effort in the last  meeting in defeating her rival by 15 lengths in the Grade II Chula Vista  Handicap at Del Mar.  </P> <P> Adjudicating and Rhythm, 2-year-old stablemates of Easy Goer, finished 1-2 in  the $572,000 Champagne Stakes at Belmont Park.  </P> <P> Adjudicating, ridden by Jacinto Vasquez, got to the end of the mile a neck in  front of his stablemate, ridden by Craig Perret, in 1:37 3/5.  </P> <P> Juvenile fillies also were featured on the program, with Stella Madrid  overcoming a poor start to win the $294,500 Frizette.  </P> <P> Rhythm and Adjudicating are owned by Ogden Mills Phipps, whose father owns Easy  Goer, the 3-year-old who is the leading candidate for horse of the year.  </P> <P> In the filly race, Stella Madrid was left at the break, but Angel Cordero put  her along the rail and into the lead after the first quarter-mile. She was  never headed and won by a half-length in 1:38 4/5 for the mile.  </P> <P> Western Playboy, winner of the Bluegrass and Jim Beam Stakes, set a stakes  record and led by as many as 17 lengths in winning the $300,000 Pennsylvania  Derby at Philadelphia Park. The colt covered the 1 1/8-mile course in 1:47 3/5.  </P></p>

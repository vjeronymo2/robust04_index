			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy  believes Ukraine's navy must be based at the Crimean port of  Sevastopol, but does not object to the city being the main base  for the Russian Black Sea Fleet. "Crimea must not become a  source of discord between the two fraternal nations," he said to  INTERFAX. He said he and his Russian counterpart, Pavel  Grachev, at a meeting they had behind closed doors in Sevastopol  on Thursday, had discussed the life of Crimea's population. The  40-minute meeting was followed by talks on the Black Sea Fleet  between a Ukrainian and Russian delegations.    Russia's delegation was led by Grachev and included Navy  commander-in-chief Feliks Gromov and ambassador at large Yuriy  Dubinin. Ukraine was represented by Radetskyy and Navy  commander-in-chief Vladimir Bezkorovaynyy.    "At this stage of negotiations the question of the division  of the fleet should be solved, while the redeployment problem  will be tackled at the second round of negotiations by the  presidents of Ukraine and Russia," Bezkorovainy told  Interfax-Ukraine.    He said that, at the present round of talks, the two  countries were going to divide the fleet infrastructure between  them but would not discuss the division and leasing of any naval  bases.    The president of the Ukrainian autonomous republic of  Crimea,  Yuriy Meshkov, addressing a rally in front of Black Sea Fleet  headquarters, protested against the deployment in Crimea of "a  second fleet," meaning the Ukrainian Navy. "This does not meet  our interests, because the Black Sea Fleet is able to ensure the  security of the citizens of Crimea and protect their legitimate  rights."</p>

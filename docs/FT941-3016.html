			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Italian Elections (March 27): Battle in outpost to open road to Rome - Robert Graham reports from the port city of Trieste, where electioneering differs from the rest of Italy Few places feel as far away from Rome as Trieste, the once proud port city of the Austro-Hungarian empire, which looks across the placid waters of the Adriatic to the Italian peninsular. The chatter of Slav languages can be heard down by the wharves. Dotted about the city is an array of buildings and monuments attesting to a polyglot influence from north and central Europe, including a staircase dedicated to the sojourn of James Joyce. Not surprisingly the general election campaign has a distinctive local flavour. This is dictated by the 25,000-strong Slovene-speaking community and by the irredentist demands of the right for a return of large parts of Istria, territory lost by Mussolini's adventurism and formally alloted under the 1975 Treaty of Osimo to Yugoslavia, now complicated by the break-up into neighbouring Slovenia and Croatia. Trieste is the sole place in north and central Italy where the neo-Fascist MSI movement, recently re-baptised the National Alliance, is running candidates independent of media magnate Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement. The MSI accounts for more than 20 per cent of the vote, feeding on the 350,000 Italians in the region forced out of Istria and still hoping to recover property. Mr Gianfranco Fini, the movement's leader, has chosen Trieste as one of the seats he is contesting for the chamber of deputies under proportional representation rules. Politically, the city also set an unusual precedent in municipal elections last December. Mr Riccardo Illy, dubbed 'the king of coffee' because of his big family coffee business, was elected mayor without any previous political experience and refuses to draw an official salary. He beat off a close challenge from the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi with the support of eight parties from the left and centre. 'The big change since the municipal elections has been the appearence of Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement,' says Mr Illy. Forza Italia only appeared here towards the end of February. Already more than 50 Forza Italia supporters' clubs have sprung up in the city and the surrounding region. All this is the result of its enormous resources deployed nationwide. Indeed, the Trieste operation epitomises the way Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest media group has been used to provide a national organisational framework for his political ambitions. The Forza Italia movement in many respects is little more than a political front for Fininvest. In Trieste Forza Italia's headquarters are almost opposite the Fininvest offices so that personnel can move between the two. Mr Pasquale Maurizio Loria, Forza Italia's Trieste campaign co-ordinator, has taken unpaid leave from being a local Fininvest television network manager. 'You must realise that I am talking under my Forza Italia hat,' he insists politely, sitting in the Fininvest offices. However, his office bustles with election phone calls. Piled on a desk are videos on a dozen different topics of Forza Italia's programme. These videos bear the distinctive insignia of Diakron - the polling and marketing company controlled by Fininvest. Even Forza Italia's hastily selected main candidate for the chamber, Mrs Antonietta Vascon, a television documentary producer and commentator with no previous political experience, is linked to the Berlusconi empire. She appears on one of the Fininvest channels discussing Trieste issues. The Trieste constituency consists of 270,000 voters, split into two chamber seats on the new majority vote system and one for the old proportional representation system, plus one senate seat. Here, as in the rest of northern Italy, Forza Italia is allied with the League and a breakaway faction of the old Christian Democrat party. The polls suggest this alliance has just more than a third of the vote, slightly ahead of the Progressive Alliance led by the former-communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). Much of Forza Italia's strength, however, comes from previous League supporters - in turn defectors from the former Christian Democrats who used to account for a quarter of the vote. Even though Forza Italia and the League each agreed to field one candidate for the two majority-vote chamber seats, the alliance is not easy. 'It is natural that some of our League vote goes to Forza Italia. We have lost some appeal as a new party,' says League candidate Gualberto Niccolini, a well-known local sports journalist. He can afford to be more relaxed as he has the easier of the two seats. The other seat covers a more industrial belt with a strong Slovene presence long cultivated by the left. Mr Renato Kneipp, the Progressive Alliance candidate in this constituency, is a popular Slovene. However, the League and Forza Italia are trying to discredit Mr Kneipp by stressing his membership of Reconstructed Communism, the hardline rump of the old Communist party which refused to join the PDS. 'The PDS said it broke with communism and now they are allied with people who still call themselves communist,' says Mr Niccolini. of backing parties and candidates that address local issues. Today this means those seen as most capable of pressing for the city's free port and offshore financial status, developing high-tech jobs linked to the prestigious Trieste university and arguing for a voice in the fast changing world on its frontiers.</p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. SCHOOLS MOVE TO REMEDY HEALTH SERVICES  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Unified School District took the first step Monday toward  revamping its school health-care program after hearing a report that criticized  the district's 50 doctors and 500 nurses for being busier with paper work than  medical services.  </P> <P> School board members adopted the report's harsh findings and its recommendation  that the district join forces with the Los Angeles County Department of Health  Services to eliminate overlapping services and inefficient use of staff and  resources.  </P> <P> County officials attending Monday's meeting indicated they would be willing to  share health-care services with the district, which is expected at its Jan. 14  meeting to adopt a resolution seeking the county's help.  </P> <P> The report said district programs are out of date and fail to meet the needs of  students, especially those of recent immigrants who have never seen a doctor.  Adequate services do not reach the one in five city schoolchildren who live in  poverty and the one in three who lack medical insurance, the report also  concluded.  </P> <P> Compiled for the district by an educator, a health-care specialist and a  pediatrician, the report presented a number of proposed changes that could be  implemented starting immediately.  </P> <P> If only "relatively few dollars (were) spent in school-based preventive and  primary care, (it) would save the county enormous sums in inappropriate  emergency care," the report said.  </P> <P> The report also found that money to improve the district's student health-care  program is available but the program would have to be reorganized before  additional funding could bring improvements.  </P> <P> One suggestion was for the district and the county to explore possible linkups  with colleges, universities or medical schools to provide better health care  for children. The Department of Nursing at Cal State Los Angeles, for instance,  has expressed interest in jointly developing a training program to upgrade the  skills of new school nurse practitioners.  </P> <P> Board member Julie Korenstein said she was not aware that school nurses could  be put to better use. "Frankly I was very amazed to find . . . what nurses can  do on our campuses," she said.  </P> <P> Among the report's recommendations:  </P> <P> * Turn over responsibility for some medical services such as screening for  tuberculosis to the county Health Department, which already performs such  tests.  </P> <P> * Install nurse practitioners in school clinics to care for children with minor  medical problems, instead of sending such children home and having them enter  county hospitals, which proves costly to the county.  </P> <P> * Reevaluate the assignments of 320 district psychiatrists, who spend a  significant part of their time performing tasks that do not require their  professional expertise.  </P> <P> * Restructure the jobs of the district's 50 doctors and 500 nurses so that  doctors are able to treat more ailing students and nurses are able to prescribe  medication.  </P> <P> The report, which took one year and cost $40,000 to compile, was based on  interviews with more than 100 medical experts, educators and administrators.  </P> <P> In other business, the board said it plans early next year to review its  expulsion policy, toughened last June to allow automatic expulsion of students  who bring firearms to class or seriously assault others.  </P> <P> Board members said they want to offer an alternative to students as young as 12  who are currently being expelled and left to the streets because there is no  place for them at county-run programs.  </P> <P> Concerned about the fate of such delinquents, the board on Monday voted to  suspend the expulsion of nine teen-agers whose cases had come up for review.  </P></p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Transamerica falls 10% from record earnings After-tax profits at Trans-america, the San Francisco-based financial services group, fell 10 per cent from a record high the year before, a period when the earnings had been lifted by investment gains, writes Richard Waters. Excluding these one-off items, net income on continuing operations, of Dollars 103m, was up from Dollars 99m the year before on stronger results from leasing and consumer and commercial lending. Mr Frank Herringer, president and chief executive, said the company was 'encouraged by signs of recovery in the Californian economy' and expected 1994 as a whole to be a good year. During the latest period, income from real estate tax planning services dropped to Dollars 16m from Dollars 20m the year before, as the wave of mortgage refinancings by US homeowners diminished with higher interest rates. This decline was more than offset by a rise in income from commercial lending to Dollars 14m, from Dollars 9m the year before, thanks to lower credit losses and better lending margins. Leasing income was up Dollars 2m at Dollars 16m and consumer lending rose Dollars 1m to Dollars 24m. Reported net income was Dollars 106m, or Dollars 1.34 a share, down from Dollars 124m, or Dollars 1.49, the year before. First-half net income of Dollars 209m was down from Dollars 215m last time.</p>

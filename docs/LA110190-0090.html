			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> 'AX MURDERER' TOPS SLOW FRIGHT NIGHT  </P> <P> A costumed man was mistaken for an ax murderer in Oxnard and a group of shaving  cream terrorists plagued Thousand Oaks during an unusually quiet fright night  Wednesday, Ventura County police authorities said.  </P> <P> "We've gotten lots of calls about juveniles hanging out, but that's about it,"  said Senior Deputy E.J. Rogers of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department three  hours before midnight.  </P> <P> "Of course, the night isn't over yet and the moon's not quite up."  </P> <P> In Simi Valley, a teen-age assailant with a sweet tooth confronted a young  trick-or-treater near Sequoia Park and made off with the child's candy. Aside  from the bully's theft, Simi Police Lt. Don Austin said there were few  incidents of malicious mischief.  </P> <P> "When Halloween falls in the middle of the week, we don't see the number of  pranks as when it falls on a weekend," Austin said.  </P> <P> The case of the mistaken ax murderer involved a man who showed up at his former  girlfriend's front door with an ax raised over his head, said Oxnard Police Lt.  Tom Kady. "She wasn't home and the people there didn't recognize him," Kady  said. CHRISTOPHER PUMMER  </P></p>

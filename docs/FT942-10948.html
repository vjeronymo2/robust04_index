			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Offshore variable rates slip Many offshore rates remain competitive with the mainland market and, for those seeking gross income, they are worth considering. But variable offshore rates from building society subsidiaries have generally followed the downward trend of mainland rates recently. Woolwich Guernsey has proved the exception by increasing the rates on larger balances in its International account. As on the mainland, fixed rates have firmed slightly, with both the Halifax International and Lombard Banking (Jersey) increasing their rates. New accounts have been introduced for UK residents by N&amp;P Overseas, with a 90-day notice account, and Britannia International has opened up its new Index-Linked account to both UK and overseas residents. But its market-leading, five-year fixed-rate bond is available only to expatriates. Onshore, the slide continues in variable rates. Small reductions are not always advertised widely and investors should be aware that the return on their savings could be eroded. With investors chasing decent rates, smaller societies have been inundated with inquiries. Being unable to cope, some have withdrawn accounts to new money. Accounts now closed that have featured in our charts in recent weeks are Bullion Share from Teachers, Quay Account from Tynemouth, and Scarborough 94 by post from Scarborough. The leapfrogging of fixed rates from building societies has stopped for the moment, but guaranteed income bond rates go on rising. The top rate now is from Eurolife at Pounds 10,000, paying 7.00 per cent net (9.33 per cent gross equivalent) over five years.</p>

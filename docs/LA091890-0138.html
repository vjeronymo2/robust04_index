			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICAN LABOR UNION ACTS TO FORCE OUT CONTROVERSIAL LEADER IN BORDER TOWN  </P> <P> Agapito Gonzalez, who for decades has controlled the maquiladora unions in the  Mexican border town of Matamoros, is being forced from power by national  leaders of the Mexican Workers Federation.  </P> <P> Fidel Velazquez, the 90-year-old patriarch of the federation, known by the  initials CTM, accused Gonzalez of corruption and dismissed him as president of  the federation's Matamoros branch a week ago. Gonzalez has refused to accept  the ouster, saying that he was elected as the union's secretary general in  Matamoros by local union members and was not appointed by Velazquez.  </P> <P> The conflict is expected to be resolved this week. Both Gonzalez and  representatives of National Maquiladora Assn. were reported to be in Mexico  City on Monday to discuss the situation with Velasquez.  </P> <P> Under Gonzalez, the 40,000 workers in Matamoros' 83 plants became the  highest-paid employees among the maquiladoras, which are predominantly  U.S.-owned factories that assemble export goods from imported components. Union  gains in Matamoros included a 40-hour work week in a country where 48 hours is  the norm.  </P> <P> However, in recent years, few new maquiladoras have been started in Matamoros,  despite a boom in the rest of the border area and the city's relative proximity  both to Eastern U.S. manufacturing centers and to the Mexican industrial city  of Monterrey. Tijuana now has five times as many of the plants as Matamoros and  50% more people working in them.  </P> <P> Gonzalez is blamed for this situation by factory owners, who accuse him of  arrogance and of calling strikes for frivolous reasons, such as personal feuds.  Owners expressed their concerns to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari during  his recent visit to Rio Bravo, a town west of Matamoros.  </P> <P> Then, early last week, Velazquez announced that Gonzalez would be replaced by  Diego Navarro, who last year was named head of a new maquiladora union in  neighboring Reynosa.  </P> <P> Matamoros employers had been predicting Gonzalez's departure since February,  when the national federation reportedly was auditing local union records.  </P> <P> Maquiladoras are Mexico's third-largest source of foreign exchange -- after oil  exports and tourism -- and provide about 450,000 jobs. The Mexican government  actively promotes foreign investment in the factories, emphasizing their low  labor cost and proximity to the United States.  </P> <P> The Matamoros federation includes 35 unions representing 87,000 workers, most  of them employed by maquiladoras.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As we have learned, Radovan Karadzic, president of  the Srpska republic, met with Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic in Belgrade today. After the talks, correspondents of  foreign television stations overwhelmed President Karadzic with  questions about threats of air strikes. Let us hear how Dr.  Karadzic answered:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Please  comment on the statement by French Foreign Minister Juppe that  he will demand an ultimatum for the Serbs, 10 days to withdraw  20 [words indistinct].    [Karadzic] Minister Juppe should ask [Austrian Foreign]  Minister Mock about the fate of the Austrian ultimatum in 1914.    [Unidentified correspondent, in English fading into  Serbo-Croatian translation] Will you withdraw your artillery  from the positions around Sarajevo?    [Karadzic, in English fading into Serbo-Croatian  translation]  Immediately, as soon as we sign the peace plan.    [Unidentified correspondent, in English fading into  Serbo-Croatian translation] The NATO secretary general today  said that it was high time to do something in Bosnia. How would  you comment on this?    [Karadzic, in English fading into Serbo-Croatian  translation]  Well, had they taken no actions in the former Yugoslavia, it  would not have disintegrated. I would love it if they would not  meddle into our affairs at all, because, it is precisely they  who have caused this war.    [Unidentified correspondent, in English fading into  Serbo-Croatian translation] What will happen if the NATO  Council issues an ultimatum to the Serbs to withdraw from their  positions around Sarajevo?    [Karadzic, in English fading into Serbo-Croatian  translation]  How can we withdraw from Sarajevo? Sarajevo is not a  surrounded town, but a divided town. We hold half of the town.  If somebody is asking us to give up our own town, then no,  never, out of the question.    [Unidentified correspondent, in English fading into  Serbo-Croatian translation] Do you believe in air strikes, Mr.  Karadzic?    [Karadzic, in English fading into Serbo-Croatian  translation]  I believe in God. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Sport: Battered survivors limp into last leg - Sailing / Keith Wheatley previews the Whitbread's last dash With the Whitbread race poised for the final dash east across the Atlantic from Fort Lauderdale to Southampton, one wonders if it will be a Kiwi double. New Zealand Endeavour has an 18 hour 21 minutes lead in the maxi class; and Yamaha, skippered by Auckland yachtsman Ross Field, is 10 hrs 26 mins ahead of her closest W60 rival, Intrum Justitia. Grant Dalton, in charge aboard NZE, is also close to his personal goal of being the fastest boat around the world overall. Dalton has always maintained that he built a maxi-ketch simply because research said it would go round the 32,000-mile course up to four days faster than the smaller, lighter W60 class opposition. That prediction has proved over-optimistic since, with 85 per cent of the race gone, Endeavour is only 11 hours ahead of Yamaha. However, mid-summer weather in the north Atlantic is generally light and this should favour the maxi class with their huge sail areas. Yamaha's fifth leg victory was as unexpected as it was welcome to the crew. They had consistently been second or third into every port and were thoroughly sick of the bridesmaid role. Ross Field punched the air with delight as he crossed the line. He attributed Yamaha's win to reading the weather correctly, good tactics and excellent crew work. Field gave the specific credit for getting the weather right to meteorologist Nik White, who joined the boat in Auckland. 'Nik has limited sailing experience, worked for the New Zealand met office for two or three years, is highly qualified and we don't let him up on deck,' said Field. 'He tells us what he thinks is going to happen and we position the boat accordingly.' White may have set a Whitbread trend. Dennis Conner announced this week that he was cancelling plans to sail on the last leg with Winston and sending weather expert Bill Biewenga in his place. Biewenga, a veteran of three previous Whitbreads, has often worked as a consultant for single-handed racers, giving them optimum weather routes by radio from a land base. Field's elation was short-lived as the Florida stopover was consumed by allegations that Yamaha had broken rules relating to outside assistance during leg one. The claims were made by deposed women's crew skipper Nance Frank as part of her US litigation against race officials and yacht owners. In essence, Frank claimed that her navigator, Adrienne Cahalan, (Field's fiancee) had been in fax contact with Yamaha swapping weather information from different parts of the course. This would be a clear breach of standard yacht racing rules if proved. Field, a former undercover detective with the New Zealand police force, obeyed orders when his own lawyers told him to 'take the Fifth' and say nothing. The international jury for the race took refuge in procedure when it declined to open a hearing because no current competitor had lodged a protest. This was in spite of claims by race director, Ian Bailey-Willmot, that he had evidence to authenticate Frank's allegations. So Field and his crew were excused a trial, but left with allegations hanging heavy in the air. Field declared himself 'very bitter' about the outcome. Also shaking his head over cruel fate was Tokio skipper Chris Dickson. They arrived in Fort Lauderdale eight days after Yamaha, the last boat in the 14-yacht fleet. Tokio lost her mast, and with it the chances of winning the race she had dominated, five days into the leg. 'The boat came very upright. I heard a lot of feet running around on deck and someone said 'Oh No. The mast has gone.' It was snapped at the bottom spreader. There were broken bits everywhere,' said Dickson on reaching Florida. 'I have never experienced anything like it, we felt numb, really numb. It crossed our minds to pull out of the race when the chance of winning evaporated. But after a while the crew, to a man, decided that we would finish the job.' The man with the biggest hurdle to face is probably British sailor Lawrie Smith, skippering Intrum Justitia. They had been lying second to Tokio, had virtually discounted a challenge from Yamaha, and now find themselves having to fight to get back in the race. 'It's terrible. You feel it's all going against you,' said Smith over the misfortune that had his boat parked in the Doldrums while Yamaha disappeared over the horizon. 'However, luck tends to even itself out. We hope there will be a lot of breeze in the next leg, we always do well in that.' New Zealand's domination of the Whitbread has obviously led Wales to think that there may be an X-factor in the race favouring small proud nations used to handling sheep. The first entry for the 1997 / 8 race has just been announced in Cardiff. Welsh Dragon will be skippered by the Anglesey-born international helmsman Edward Warden-Owen and is backed by the Cardiff Bay Development Agency.</p>

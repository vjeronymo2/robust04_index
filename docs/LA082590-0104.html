			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOW CLIMBS 49.50 IN LARGEST GAIN SINCE IRAQ INVASION  </P> <P> Stock prices reversed course Friday and had the biggest rally since Iraq's  invasion of Kuwait, although traders were cautious about predicting a  definitive end to the huge selloff that on Thursday had brought stock averages  to their lowest levels in more than a year.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial index climbed 49.50 points Friday, or 2%, to close at  2,532.92. But the Dow still showed a net loss for the week of 111.88 points, or  4.2%.  </P> <P> Traders attributed the rally mainly to technical factors, such as short  covering, and to modestly encouraging news, such as a dip Friday in oil prices.  Few predicted a sustained rally. But some said stock prices may now bottom out.  </P> <P> "Stocks are really deeply, deeply oversold on a short-term basis," said Bill  Raftery, a technical analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. Extreme  nervousness over the Middle East situation may have sent prices down too far.  </P> <P> John Burnett, a trader at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities, said  there "is a perception that the selling over the past several sessions has  discounted everything but the end of the world."  </P> <P> The bond market, still wracked by fears about oil prices and the Persian Gulf  situation, finished one of the worst weeks since the stock market crash three  years ago with another plunge on Friday. The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond,  a sensitive indicator of trends in interest rates, fell 7/32 of a point, or  about $2.19 per $1,000 in face amount. Its loss for the week was more than $22.  The bond's yield reached 9.15%, the highest since April, 1989.  </P> <P> In stock trading, the over-the-counter market also rallied strongly, although  OTC stocks had been hit the hardest by the recent selloff. The NASDAQ  over-the-counter composite index was up 7.11, or 2%, to close at 367.33.  </P> <P> On the Big Board, 943 stocks rose while 643 fell. Volume, although heavy at  199.04 million shares, was less than the 250.44 million shares that changed  hands during Thursday's selloff. "I don't think that can be good news," said  Jeff Kaminsky, a stock trader at Mabon, Nugent in New York. "I would much  rather see strong volume on the way up than on the way down."  </P> <P> Friday's rally followed gains in major foreign stock markets, including Tokyo  and London. The Nikkei Stock Average closed up 428.13 at 24,165.76, a 1.8%  rise. In London, the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 11.4  points, at 2,086.4. In Frankfurt, the German DAX index rose 38.70 points, or  2.6%, to close at 1,559.04.  </P> <P> Analysts said that although the situation around the Persian Gulf remains  extremely tense, with Iraqi soldiers surrounding Western embassies in Kuwait,  the lack of other major developments was interpreted as an encouraging sign.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, as another weekend of extreme uncertainty approached, both the  dollar and gold prices rose. After falling Thursday to new lows against the  German mark, the British pound and the Swiss franc, the dollar started off by  gaining ground in Asian markets and continued to rise in trading in Europe and  then the United States. In U.S. trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.557 German  marks, up from 1.548 on Thursday. The dollar was at 1.268 Swiss Francs, up from  1.2598. The dollar rose to 146.47 yen, up from 145.88.  </P> <P> After trading lower overseas, gold rose on the New York Commodity Exchange to  settle at $415 an ounce, up $3 an ounce from Thursday.  </P> <P> Oil prices retreated somewhat from the level reached Thursday, which was the  highest in seven years. The U.S. benchmark price for West Texas Intermediate  crude ended down $1.02 at $30.91 a barrel for October delivery. Analysts  attributed the relatively steep one-day drop to profit taking by oil traders.  </P> <P> Michael Rosen, a bond trader at First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles, said he  expects bond prices to continue to fall, in response to concerns about the  impact of rising oil prices and potential hostilities in the Middle East. He  said that some economic fundamentals point to a lowering of bond yields. But he  said, "You can throw fundamental analysis out the window right now, especially  as tensions (in the Middle East) escalate."  </P> <P> Market highlights:  </P> <P> * The rally was fueled by heavy buying of blue-chip growth stocks that had  taken a beating in recent sessions. Boeing jumped 3 3/8 to 45 7/8, GE gained 3  to 61 1/2, IBM rose 3 1/2 to 100 3/8, Home Depot added 2 5/8 to 31 1/4, Disney  soared 2 3/4 to 97 7/8 and Wal-mart rose 1 3/8 to 26 7/8.  </P> <P> * Oil stocks plunged anew. Arco tumbled 3 5/8 to 134 7/8, Unocal dropped 1/2 to  31 1/8 and Chevron lost 1 3/8 to 74 1/4. However, the oil-service group, hit by  profit taking on Wednesday, rebounded. Halliburton rose 1 3/8 to 52 and Baker  Hughes added 7/8 to 30.  </P> <P> * Tech stocks were clearly targeted by bargain-hunters. Conner Peripherals  jumped 1 1/2 to 22 1/4, Intel soared 2 3/4 to 36 and Autodesk leaped 2 7/8 to  47 1/2.  </P> <P> * Big gainers among Southland stocks included Fluor, up 4 to 35 1/2, Jacobs  Engineering, up 2 to 17 1/2, Amgen, up 2 5/8 to 44, and MCA, up 2 5/8 to 41  1/4.  </P> <P> Despite the overall rally, prices of utility stocks fell. The Dow utilities  average fell 0.75 to 190.96. Doris Kelley-Alston, a utilities analyst at  Merrill Lynch, noted that utility stocks move closely with interest rates. She  said that when the prices of Treasury bonds started to give way Friday, "We saw  it reflected in the electric utility industry."  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT  </P> <P> Gulf Fears Beat Bond Prices Down  </P> <P> Bond strategists said prices strengthened early Friday on internal market  technical influences and the Commerce Department's gross national product  report, which showed the economy grew by only 1.2% in the April-June quarter,  less than many forecasters had envisioned.  </P> <P> The GNP report suggested serious economic problems confronted the United States  that required the need for lower interest rates, which tends to boost the value  of bond prices.  </P> <P> But the effect of the statistic quickly faded and prices fell as investors  refocused attention on rapid developments in the Persian Gulf, where a showdown  loomed between U.S. and Iraqi forces over Iraq's seizure of Kuwait on Aug. 2.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight  loans, was quoted at 8%, down from 8.063% late Thursday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> Dollar Ends Week on High Note Again  </P> <P> The dollar repeated what is becoming a usual Friday performance -- rising ahead  of an uncertain weekend in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> After falling in the previous session to new lows against the German mark, the  Swiss franc and the British pound, the dollar was ripe for a technical rebound.  It began rising in Asian trading and continued to gain ground when activity  shifted to Europe and the United States.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> Cattle Futures Dip on Fears of Slump  </P> <P> Cattle futures prices slipped Friday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange under  continuing fears of a recession.  </P> <P> On other markets, oil prices turned lower; soybeans and wheat advanced; corn  was lower, and gold posted some minor gains.  </P> <P> Cattle futures settled 0.25 to 0.75 cent lower, with the contract for delivery  in October at 76.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.55 cent to 1.15 cents  lower, with August at 88.17 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to 0.33 cent  higher, with October at 48.42 cents a pound, and frozen pork bellies were 1.82  cents lower to 0.30 cent higher, with August at 41.90 cents a pound.  </P> <P> Precious-metals futures erased losses and notched small gains on the Commodity  Exchange in New York. Gold settled $2.80 to $3.60 higher, with the December  contract at $423.20 an ounce; silver was 6 to 7.9 cents higher, with August at  $5.187 an ounce.  </P> <P> Market Roundup, D6  </P></p>

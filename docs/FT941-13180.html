			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / EU car sales rules attacked A European consumers' group yesterday called for an end to the system of exclusive distribution networks for EU car sales, writes John Griffiths. The Bureau Europeen des Unions de Consommateurs claimed the system, which is exempt from normal EU competition rules, has worked against consumers' interests while providing virtually none of the benefits claimed by Europe's motor industry. BEUC's denunciation came less than 24 hours after the industry commissioner, Mr Martin Bangemann, had suggested the 10-year 'block exemption' from competition rules could be extended after it expires in 1995. BEUC's director, Mr Jim Murray, claimed the exemption had been 'an unmitigated disaster' for consumers. It had restricted competition, denying consumers freedom to buy competitively priced cars throughout the EU.</p>

Under a decree of the State Council, membership of the CAS  is  the highest academic title in China, representing the highest  scientific honor and supreme academic authority of the country.    "The CAS members are now completely on an equal footing with  academicians of other countries," a spokesman for the CAS said.    The spokesman said that the academician system will promote  China's scientific and technological exchanges with other  countries and is consonant with the country's reform and opening  endeavors.    It also indicates China's ever-increasing academic strength  and burgeoning of talent, he said.    The CAS, which was founded in November 1949, now has 545  members, or academicians as they are officially called now.</p>

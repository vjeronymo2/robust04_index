			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Reform of expert evidence urged Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, criticised the government last night for failure to implement recommendations of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice for reform of the use of expert evidence in trials. Speaking in London, Lord Taylor said the use of expert witnesses in both civil and criminal trials 'needs a drastic re-evaluation'. The commission, which reported in July last year, made 40 recommendations for changes in the use of experts. Lord Taylor said a handful had been dealt with quickly but in February 'three-quarters of the package was still 'under consideration'. We are now in November and the silence is becoming deafening,' he said. He stressed that important issues of public confidence were involved since most notorious miscarriages of justice had turned on the accuracy and reliability of expert evidence in the hands of the prosecution and on whether it had been properly disclosed to the defence. Lord Taylor said that the establishment of a Forensic Science Advisory Council, as recommended by the commission, was overdue. He said he supported Lord Woolf, the law lord appointed by Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, to carry out a fundamental review of civil justice, in calling for 'a radically different model of conducting civil justice'. He urged in particular the appointment of a single, independent expert in most cases. He said that in civil trials the use of experts increased costs and caused delays. A system whereby one independent expert was appointed by the court to resolve technical issues at an early stage could save litigants money, reduce delay and reduce the stress of going to law.</p>

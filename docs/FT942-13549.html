			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / South African Elections: Mandela, 75 going on 16, leads the way - African National Congress We know only one thing for certain about this week's South African election  -who will win it. Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, is on the right side of history, and that will put his party on the right side of victory as well. For neutral observers that has taken some of the excitement out of the election campaign. But partisan participants have had no trouble getting excited about the campaign. Certainly, Mr Mandela has loved it, and the crowds have loved him. 'Although I am 75 years of age, when I am among you I feel like a young man of 16. You are the people who inspire me every day of my life.' He has paid this tribute to countless crowds, and he has never sounded less than sincere, however often he has said it. 'I am humbled to represent the work and struggle of so many people who made democracy a reality in our country.' No one is tempted to disbelieve him. Mr Mandela is a natural, with his radiant smile and his obvious love for his people. Unlike President FW de Klerk, the National party leader - who arrives at rallies surrounded by a phalanx of security men and only smiles on cue - Mr Mandela's smile is straight from the soul (and his security is too often ignored). He spends as much time as possible shaking hands and displaying his regal physique to adoring crowds, whether standing on the back of a truck to make a circuit of a football field, or sticking his torso through the sun roof of his car to tour townships waving like royalty. But there is another side to the septuagenarian leader: he is one of South Africa's most boring speakers. By the time he finishes, he has often lost half the crowd. But he is not deterred. With his forefinger wagging in a style first popularised by former President PW Botha, Mr Mandela delivers headmasterly lectures condemning mass protest action (pioneered by the ANC, but no longer welcome now it is assuming power), urging co-operation with the police and tribal chiefs (hated symbols of apartheid), even extolling the virtues of punctuality. Mr Mandela persists with his stern lectures, oblivious of the reaction of his supporters. And that fact tells the real truth about the campaign: that it is not a contest at all. There are almost no 'swing voters'. It is inconceivable that many of those viewing a recent televised debate between Mr Mandela and Mr de Klerk were trying to decide between the two contestants. South Africa simply does not work like that; people do not leave the ANC camp to join the NP, or vice versa. The gulf is too wide. Mr Mandela's greatness lies in his efforts to bridge that gap.</p>

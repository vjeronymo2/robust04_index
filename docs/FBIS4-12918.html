			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad Nazzal, Hamas representative in </F> Jordan, by Raja Talab in Amman "a few days ago"]    [Text] [Talab] Was the 'Afula operation a reply to the holy  al-Ibrahimi Mosque crime or part of a new strategy and method of  struggle against the Israeli occupation?    [Nazzal] The 'Afula operation, carried out by the al-Qassam  Battalions--the military wing of the Hamas Movement--was the  first reply to the Hebron massacre. It will be followed by  three more operations similar to the 'Afula operation in  influence and power.    [Talab] Some Palestinian voices criticized the operation.  They said the 'Afula operation, which targeted civilians,  depicted matters as a racist conflict between Arabs and Israelis  although the conflict is one of liberation and all forms of  armed struggle should target the occupation army only. What is  your comment?    [Nazzal] Forty days after the Hebron massacre, the  Palestinian people realized that the international community  will not take revenge for them. All that the Security Council  did was to issue a inconsequential statement. Consequently, the  Palestinian people in all their factions and classes were happy  for this operation and considered it a restoration of honor and  dignity. As for the Palestinians you mentioned, they are  limited in number and isolated. They considered the operation an  embarrassment and a pulling of the rug from under their feet.    [Talab] Will the next operations be similar to the 'Afula  operation?    [Nazzal] The next operations are supposed to be highly  qualitative to match the magnitude and ugliness of the Hebron  massacre.    [Talab] You have a significant political presence in Jordan  and Syria and these two countries are parties to the peace  process. The 'Afula operation must have moved the United  States, the sponsor of the peace process, to restrain you as a  Hamas Movement. Have you been exposed to any pressure from  Amman or Damascus, or to any questioning after this operation?    [Nazzal] The operation was received with great joy by the  Arab and Islamic circles. It came within a context that is  understood by the Arab and Islamic parties. It is regrettable  that the PLO condemned the operation although no Arab party did  so.    [Talab] Does this mean you did not come under any pressure  or  questioning because of the operation?    [Nazzal] No criticism whatsoever was leveled at us by the  official Arab parties nor were there any pressures because of  the 'Afula operation.    [Talab] Information says the PLO complained to Jordan about  Hamas' strong political role in Jordan. Was this brought to  your attention in order to reconsider your role?    [Nazzal] We have learned about this complaint from  unofficial  Jordanian sources, but nobody spoke to us about it. This,  however, is indicative of the depth of the PLO leadership's  impasse. Matters have gone so far in the PLO as to file  complaints with the U.S. Administration to bring pressure to  bear on Jordan. I believe there is a Jordanian understanding of  the Hamas Movement's attitude toward the political settlement  and the continuation of resistance against occupation.    [Talab] After the 'Afula operation, Israel went back to  say that your movement is receiving financial support from Iran  and that those who planned and implemented the operation  received their training under Hizballah in southern Lebanon when  they were in Marj al-Zuhur. Is this true?    [Nazzal] I think the Hamas Movement is able to develop its  military and security capabilities without having to seek  outside help. The Movement has an efficient military body that  gains experience day by day. Hence, talk about Iranian or  outside financial aid is not true.    [Talab] Where do you get your financing from then?    [Nazzal] I can say that Hamas finances itself and also  receives financing from the people. So far we did not receive a  single penny from any government.    [Talab] There are reports that the Hamas Movement is  involved in plans to get rid of Yasir 'Arafat in order to abort  the peace process. How true is this?    [Nazzal] Hamas does not believe in political assassination.  It believes that its efforts should focus on resisting the  occupation and its tools. What is being said about an  inclination or plan to assassinate 'Arafat or other Palestinian  figures is baseless.    [Talab] But how will you deal, after a short while, with the  presence of 'Arafat and the Palestinian leadership in Gaza and  Jericho and later on in the rest of the West Bank?    [Nazzal] Hamas' policy is not to clash with the Palestinian  authority and its tools. This, in any case, does not mean  stopping the resistance. Therefore, Hamas will continue its  policy of resisting the occupation until it is removed.    [Talab] Do you have any information that 'Arafat agreed with  the Israelis to get rid of the Hamas Movement?    [Nazzal] We have information about intelligence meetings  between Palestinian and Israeli security bodies to coordinate on  confronting Hamas and to exchange information on Hamas'  leadership, cadres, and activities.    [Talab] How afraid are you of these meetings, especially  during the next stage when 'Arafat returns and is in control of  the West Bank and Gaza?    [Nazzal] There is no doubt that we view with caution  cooperation between the Palestinian and occupation authorities  aimed at confronting the Palestinian opposition. However, we,  at the same time, believe that the Palestinian masses will side  with whoever expresses their hopes and ambitions and represents  their conscience. The masses will reject all those who are  cooperating with the occupation and are standing in one trench  with it. Hence, we are in line with the Palestinian masses in  terms of continuing the resistance against the occupation.    [Talab] There is information that cadres from Fatah Hawks  inside the occupied territories have turned to the Hamas  Movement because the Fatah leadership in Tunis stopped financing  these cadres, hence limiting their military moves against  Israel. How true is this?    [Nazzal] There is no doubt that there is broad opposition  within Fatah toward a political settlement. This opposition is  increasing and includes various sectors. Hamas has links and  channels of communication with those honorable and sincere  sectors from Fatah, some of whom have been absorbed into Hamas  ranks, especially from the military elements and cadres.  Perhaps this could enrich Hamas' experience, especially since  experienced Fatah cadres have joined the movement.    [Talab] It seems that the expertise of the Fatah cadres who  joined Hamas made itself felt in the 'Afula operation?    [Nazzal] No doubt any cadres with past experience who join  Hamas will provide a qualitative addition to the movement's  experience and we believe that any cooperation between Hamas and  the Fatah cadres will constitute a real threat to the occupation  and its tools.    [Talab] Do you have channels of communication with the Fatah  leadership abroad as you have with Fatah at home? Have these  connections created coordination between you and them?    [Nazzal] Official contacts with the Fatah leadership abroad  has been frozen since the Oslo agreement. We have individual  contacts with certain Fatah opposition figures but these are  personal contacts.    [Talab] Are you considering promoting these contacts with  Fatah opposition figures to have a practical effect in foiling  the peace process?    [Nazzal] We welcome any contacts and coordination with the  Fatah opposition figures and cadres provided this coordination  and cooperation is intended to confront the occupation.    [Talab] But are they also prepared?    [Nazzal] There are certain Fatah cadres who coordinate and  cooperate with the Hamas Movement.    [Talab] Is there any practical coordination on the  leadership  level?    [Nazzal] There is none.    [Talab] You opposed Mustafa al-Natshah's appointment as  mayor  of Hebron and demanded municipal elections. How do you support  a municipal election that is not rejected by the occupation  while at the same time you oppose participation in electing a  Palestinian authority if these elections are not rejected by the  occupation?    [Nazzal] We have always supported and still support  municipal  elections that are not connected with any political plan because  municipal elections are the means by which services can be  extended to the Palestinian public, alleviating their suffering  and improving their health and social conditions. Therefore, we  call for municipal elections in every Palestinian town. This  happened in 1976 and those elections were not connected with any  political plans at a time when all the Palestinian forces were  opposed to recognizing the Israeli enemy and had a stand that  was similar to the current Hamas position. Therefore, we do not  find it embarrassing to accept elections provided they are not  linked with a political plan.    [Talab] In a statement to the press, Israeli military  intelligence chief Uri Sagi [name as published] said that Hamas  will participate in electing a Palestinian authority under a  non-Hamas platform because he believed that the pragmatic trend  within Hamas in the occupied territory will exercise pressure in  this direction. How do you comment on this?    [Nazzal] Hamas' initial decision was not to participate in  the autonomy elections. This decision was based on Hamas  rejection of the Gaza-Jericho agreement and its consequences in  terms of measures and results. Therefore, the talk on Hamas'  participation is by way of exploration, feeling the pulse, and  drawing conclusions. It is not based on genuine information.    [Talab] Is this your final stand on elections?    [Nazzal] I am speaking about this situation at this stage.  Nobody is able to talk of the future. Everything is subject to  study and reconsideration.    [Talab] I understand, then, that you are not closing the  door  completely to the question of dealing with the elections?    [Nazzal] The door is open to all possibilities.    [In a box on page 14, SHIHAN publishes the following "stop  press" item: "Muhammad Nazzal has told SHIHAN that the bus  operation was the work of the 'Izz al-Din al-Qassam battalions  in retaliation against the Hebron massacre, and that Hamas will  carry out three more operations in retaliation for the grotesque  massacre at Hebron's al-Ibrahimi Mosque.    "Nazzal emphasized that the option of armed action against  the occupation will continue until the occupation has ended.    "It may be mentioned that the above interview with Muhammad  Nazzal was held some days ago."]</p>

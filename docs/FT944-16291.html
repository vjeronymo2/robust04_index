			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Nasa to auction space machinery For sale by private treaty or negotiation: a few boring machines, never used, one careful owner, apply to auctioneers in London or the US. The machines, however, are only boring in the engineering sense and the sale is far from ordinary: more than Dollars 120m (Pounds 76m) of equipment is up for grabs in a worldwide sale on behalf of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa). This is the largest sale of space technology manufacturing plant to come on the open market. The equipment comes from a Dollars 2bn project to develop an advanced solid rocket motor for the Space Shuttle. Rocket casings made at Mount Vernon, Indiana, were to be floated down the Mississippi to a propellant plant at Iuka, Mississippi, loaded and then floated into the Gulf of Mexico and round to Cape Canaveral. Last October, however, with mounting budget pressures and continued safe performance of the existing shuttle motor, Congress killed the project. The only problem was that the factories had been built and equipped. Nasa has given the task of selling the production equipment to National Industrial Services of the US, which has enlisted Henry Butcher, the London plant and machinery consultants, to handle the sale outside North America. The two organisations have to find buyers for some of the world's biggest, and most sophisticated machine tools - most of them specially built in 1991 to Nasa's exacting standards, and mostly never used. Apart from boring machines, there are sophisticated machining centres and welding stations, and everything from overhead cranes to process mixers and electrical substations. 'This has to be the finest sale of so-called second-hand machine tools and process plant that has ever come on to the open market,' Mr John Cowing of Henry Butcher said yesterday. He expected worldwide interest in the sale. The 100 main items for sale have price tags ranging from Dollars 3m to a mere Dollars 30,000. It is understood the total raised will be considerably less than the original investment, which included research and development spending. Peripheral building services equipment will be sold in an auction at Iuka on November 2 and 3, but the main items will go by private treaty or negotiated sale.</p>

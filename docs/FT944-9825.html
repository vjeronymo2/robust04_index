			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: In the (p)ink Sir, I was very grateful, while in Salt Lake City last month, to find daily in the hotel newsagent's shop copies of the FT, US edition, looking just like the UK edition - and making the hands just as dirty. Can it be that, when the arrangements for the US edition were made, an indispensable requirement was that the printer's ink should be just as easily transferable from page to finger as is the case with the parent edition?

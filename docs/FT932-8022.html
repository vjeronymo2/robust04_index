			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Bank opts for a conciliatory tone on derivatives THE Bank of England's internal report on derivatives, published yesterday, adopted a broadly conciliatory tone towards the derivatives industry, in contrast to the forcefully expressed concerns of some other regulators. The internal working group was chaired by Mr Richard Farrant, a deputy head of banking supervision, and included a representative of the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA). The report recommended that at least two members of the board (including the finance director) of any institution should be sufficiently knowledgeable to ensure that the business was controlled effectively. This policy would be adopted by the Bank, an official said. Concern about the lack of understanding of derivatives at board level echoed the Promisel report by the Bank for International Settlements, published in October 1992, which prompted the Bank of England to set up the internal working group. The Bank of England report recommended further research on the relative price volatility and liquidity of cash and derivatives markets, exploring the links between financial markets, and the level of systemic risk. The Bank, the SFA and the Securities and Investment Board are discussing ways of pursuing this research. The Bank pointed to a need for more data on derivatives markets, and is considering establishing a survey of the derivatives markets comparable to that already conducted for forex activity. On the issue of market risk, the Bank warned that the limitations of models needed to be understood by supervisors. Another area of concern was that some large unregulated institutions operated in the derivatives market, as a result of regulatory gaps. Meanwhile, a wide-ranging study of the risks associated with derivative products is expected to be released in the next month or so by the Group of Thirty, the Washington-based think-tank. Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of JP Morgan, is heading the G30 study group.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Getting on the aid map is only half the battle: Meeting government criteria for regional financial assistance can be a tricky but rewarding business THE SKIRMISH between parts of Britain vying for assisted-area status is over. Now the fight for the grants it unlocks can begin. From this weekend the government's new assisted areas map, announced last Friday, comes into effect, entitling companies in parts of London and on the east and south coasts of England for the first time to regional financial assistance from the Department of Trade and Industry. Many company directors in the new assisted areas are aware there could be something in this for them - the DTI received nearly 2,000 submissions pleading to be on the new map, which covers 34 per cent of Britain's working population. But many newly assisted areas, and companies within them, face a steep learning curve if they are to obtain full benefit from a grants regime which has no automatic entitlements and no fixed grant rate. The message to new contenders from successful applicants in north-east England - parts of which have been assisted since regional aid began in the 1930s - is encouraging. 'It was a good return on the effort,' said Mr Neil Heppell, finance director of Tyneside-based Freudenberg Technical Products, which was offered Pounds 900,000 in regional selective assistance last year towards a Pounds 5m project. Mr Peter Cowin, co-founder of Seabait, a Northumberland fishing-bait producer, said: 'The DTI were very helpful and processed things very quickly.' He has made two succesful applications for regional assistance grants totalling Pounds 45,000. Inevitably, not all applicants succeed. In 1991-92, offers of assistance totalled Pounds 210.5m, against applications for Pounds 368.5m. The DTI expects to offer about the same amount of regional assistance grants this year. Small companies in assisted areas can also apply for regional enterprise grants of up to Pounds 15,000 for investment projects, or up to Pounds 25,000 for innovation projects. These grants totalled Pounds 13.7m in 1991-92. To maximise the chances of getting assistance, it is important to understand not just the DTI's criteria but the thinking behind them. On average, awards in development areas run at between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the fixed capital cost of a project; in intermediate areas, the average is 10 per cent. The main criteria are: The project must show viability. It must create or safeguard jobs. It must have a regional or national benefit. It must need the grant. Assistance must be the minimum required to enable the project to go ahead and be funding of last resort. Arguing a project's case may be complex; applicants must decide whether to go it alone, enlist the help of accountants or auditors, seek advice from enterprise agencies and similar bodies or turn to one of the teams of consultants specialising in UK and European grants and loans applications. Grants are good business for consultants - within days of the annoucement of the new map, Eurofi, which says it is Europe's largest independent grants consultancy, had sent offers of help in applying for assistance to targeted companies throughout Britain's newly assisted areas. Mindful that many companies resent paying for no certain result, many consultants work largely on a success fee basis, geared to the grant obtained. 'No duck, no dinner,' said Mr Vince Taylor, one of the accountants in Coopers &amp; Lybrand's 15-strong specialist grants team, which helped 10 of the newly assisted areas to lobby successfully for their place on the map. Officially the DTI has no view on the use of consultants by applicants. Privately, some officials find reputable, experienced consultants helpful while others have mixed feelings, especially if the consultants' fee is linked to the size of grant obtained. Mr Jim Driscoll, responsible for grants and inward investment at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, warns against any premature actions, such as taking an option on land, which suggests firm commitment to a project. Mr Driscoll says applicants often find it difficult to understand their project must be commercially viable, yet need grant aid to proceed. 'Need means the need to secure the project in that location,' he said. If all this sounds daunting, potential applicants can take heart from Mr Cowin. Applications for assistance are easy, he says, compared with the Euro-grants maze. 'That's a nightmare.'</p>

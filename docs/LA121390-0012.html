			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSIAL ABORTION PILL  </P> <P> I read your editorial in opposition to the import ban of RU-486 ("The Effect Is  to Deny Medical Science a Tool," Dec. 3). And I applaud your voice in this  area.  </P> <P> In mid-November, I testified before Rep. Ron Wyden's (D-Ore.) subcommittee  investigating this matter. I represented the National Cushing's Assn. (NCA).  Cushing's Syndrome is a rare, endocrine disorder, affecting primarily women, in  which the body produces massive amounts of cortisol resulting in disfiguring  systemic difficulties. Limited studies at National Institutes of Health with  RU-486 have shown great promise in treating this disease. The problem is the  import alert. This alert allows the Food and Drug Administration to limit  access to the drug, and it also allows the French manufacturer to play games  with its distribution choices -- even for legitimate research. We don't know  how many Cushing's patients could be helped by this drug, and the import alert  guarantees that it will stay that way. NIH studies have been halted because of  uncertainty about availability of the drug.  </P> <P> We believe that the agenda of politics should never affect the progress of  science, and we plan to carry that message forward.  </P> <P> ANDREA P. HECHT, President  </P> <P> National Cushing's Assn.  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

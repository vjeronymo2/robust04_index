			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> SERVING IN ARMED FORCES IS A FAMILY TRADITION  </P> <P> I congratulate you for your great work in publishing Nuestro Tiempo for the  Latino community.  </P> <P> As a Spanish teacher at Loyola High School, I constantly use Nuestro Tiempo in  my classes, not only to show my students what good Spanish writing should be,  but for its interesting and informative articles as well.  </P> <P> I bring to your attention an important project being carried out to encourage  our troops in Saudi Arabia. Students in my Spanish Honors classes wrote letters  of support, in Spanish, to soldiers. About 50% of the students received letters  of response and gratitude, also in Spanish.  </P> <P> EDWARD F. CASTELLANOS  </P> <P> Loyola High School  </P></p>

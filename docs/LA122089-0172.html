			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NEVADA LOOKS AT INTERSTATE PARI-MUTUEL TRACK BETTING  </P> <P> A proposal for interstate pari-mutuel betting in Nevada race books makes its  initial appearance Thursday before the state Gaming Commission.  </P> <P> The Nevada Pari-Mutuel Assn. is asking the commission to schedule a hearing on  a proposed regulation that would allow sports books to share pari-mutuel  wagering with California horse racing tracks.  </P> <P> The association, formed by several major Las Vegas resorts, contends that  approval of pari-mutuel wagering would decrease the risk to legal sports books  and boost total horse race betting in the books.  </P> <P> Dennis Amerine, a former Gaming Control Board member who heads the association,  said it will allow bettors in Nevada to receive the same odds as bettors at the  tracks. At present, most race books pay race track odds, but only up to a  certain limit.  </P> <P> The benefit of pari-mutuel wagering, said Amerine, is that the race book will  not be at risk. In pari-mutuel wagering, bets are put into a pool and winners  are paid after a commission for the track and payment of taxes is made.  </P> <P> Under the proposed regulation, the sports books would share in the commission,  assuring income to the book without it taking the risk of paying off on long  odds.  </P> <P> Amerine said most race books do not accept big wagers so they can protect their  bankrolls and do not offer some bets race tracks offer, such as quinellas.  </P></p>

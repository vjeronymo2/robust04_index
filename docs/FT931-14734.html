			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: FNFC trims loss and seeks Pounds 46m FIRST National Finance Corporation, the consumer credit group, yesterday announced a rights offering of Pounds 45.8m in order to rebuild its weakened capital base. The group also disclosed a pre-tax loss for the year to end-October of Pounds 31.8m, reducing the previous year's deficit of Pounds 33.7m. It again passed its final dividend. The issue of 47.6m convertible preference shares, at Pounds 1 each, will ensure that the company complies with the new minimum EC capital adequacy requirement for bank holding companies of 8 per cent capital to assets. It had been feared it would fall below this ratio in June, when it must repay Pounds 12m of loan stock. Up to Pounds 5m of the issue could also be used to strengthen its loss-making commercial finance arm. FNFC said it would declare a dividend of 0.5p at the 1993 half year and a further 1p at the full year, if the issue was approved by shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting on February 8. The group disclosed a strong improvement in its consumer credit subsidiary First National Bank for the second half. It made a full-year loss of Pounds 4.6m (Pounds 20.1m) in the year after a second half profit of Pounds 8.2m. The commercial lending arm, First National Commercial Bank, performed badly because of a higher provision of Pounds 10m for bad loans in the second half. It made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 13.4m in the second half, taking the full-year loss to Pounds 18.9m (Pounds 8m). The group made a loss of Pounds 54.2m after tax and extraordinary items. The extraordinary loss of Pounds 25.1m included a Pounds 3.1m write down in the value of the company's premises and a Pounds 2.3m loss on the disposal of its leisure activities. Mr Martin Mays-Smith, chairman, said the outlook for the group was 'much improved' after two years of heavy losses. The consumer credit operation was being made increasingly profitable by falls in interest rates. The group was very sensitive to interest rate movements because it was financed principally by bank debt, and because minimum lending rates applied to consumer loans such as mortgages and advances for home improvements. When the one month London Interbank Offered Rate averaged 10.8 per cent in December last year, the net interest income on consumer credit balances was Pounds 7.8m. When it was 7.2 per cent last month, net interest income was Pounds 9.7m. Analysts said the consumer credit business, which made loss-making loans in the late 1980s when the company faced heavy competition, was likely to continue its recovery as improved credit scoring started to take effect. The issue, on the basis of two convertibles for every seven ordinary shares and one for every 6.72 existing convertibles, was prompted by an erosion of the group's capital base from Pounds 217m of shareholders funds in October 1990 to Pounds 135m at October 1992. The preference shares, which have a 7 per cent net yield, will be convertible into ordinary shares at a price of 63p from May 15 this year until May 2008. They would comprise 30.4 per cent of the group's fully diluted ordinary share capital. FNFC's shares rose from 56.5p to 71p on the announcement, and closed at 68p. See Lex</p>

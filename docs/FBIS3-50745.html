On its flank, the market  base has expanded. In 1990, 300,000 units per year were being  sold, while the figure today easily exceeds 600,000. And this  sector faces an increasingly clearly defined concentration with  a limited number of brands. Only seven of the 17 brands on the  market account for 70 percent of the sales.    In recent days, the 18th brand has been added, and it seems  certain to claim the lead for itself. Philco, the reigning  champion in the television and car-stereo sectors, has now  ventured into the refrigeration field. It has purchased 30  percent of Helametal, which produces the Peabody refrigerators.  But the people at Philco hasten to explain that it is not a  question of absorbing the firm, but rather of adding to their  holdings.    To speak the truth, the most serious operation took place  some months ago within Philco itself, when the head of the  Argentine Industrial Union (UIA), Jorge Blanco Villegas, bought  37 percent of the company's stock from the Plata Commercial  Company (Soldati). This package, added to the shares controlled  by his sister Silvia, gave him control of the stock.    Silvia Blanco Villegas is the majority stockholder in  Inversora Antartica [Antarctic Investments], a company that is  affiliated with the SOCMA (Francisco Macri's holding company)  and is the owner of the other 37 percent of the Philco stock.  The rest of the shares are in the hands of Japan's NEC.    Once the president of the UIA had consolidated his control  of  Philco, the expansion into the refrigeration sector began. This  is the sector that has traditionally located its plants in the  provinces with developing industry. That is the case for  Helametal itself, which in addition to a plant in Buenos Aires,  has another in Catamarca.    The enterprise is continuing to manufacture Peabody  refrigerators. This brand has a market share of between eight  and 10 percent. But it is now also producing the models with  which Philco reentered the refrigeration sector after an absence  of almost a quarter of a century (it had produced freezers until  1970). Six models, five of them domestic, and a more  sophisticated one imported from Korea, are included.    Those responsible for launching the new products are sending  a kind of double message. On the one hand, they say they spent  almost $3 million on the advertising campaign, as well as an  amount they do not want to specify on purchasing the Helametal  stock. But they will swear to anyone who will listen that they  did not go into the refrigeration market to beat out the smaller  or more inexperienced firms. "For us, settling our debts will  suffice. At least for the time being," Fortunato Gacceta, the  commercial manager of the firm, says cautiously.    We asked how much had been spent on equipment.    "About $400,000. The serious investments will come later."    They took the competition into account. They know that  Philco  is a heavyweight in the so-called "brown line" (televisions and  video and audio equipment). They take it for granted that when  they added their refrigeration line, it was not to become one of  the minor manufacturers, but to fight for the lead.    CLARIN asked Daniel Sciaroni, who heads McLean, S.A.  (Patrick  and Saccol), if his firm was taken by surprise by Philco's  action.    "We expected it, but we also positioned ourselves. We  invested $20 million in a new plant, in Caseros, whereby we are  doubling our production. Between the plant in Caseros and that  in San Luis, we will be producing 1,500 refrigerators a day  within a few months."    They are saying at McLean, Patrick, and Saccol that  together,  they have the lead in a market involving 600,000 refrigerators  and 200,000 freezers per year. They say that the next most  important firm is Whirlpool, the multinational North American  firm that bought its refrigeration line from Philips two years  ago. But they say that the entry of Philco into the market  changes the game.    "Philco has an industrial strategy, as we do. It produces  for  the domestic market, and in addition it exports some of its  products. Its production will not go unnoticed," a spokesman for  McLean standing behind his superior said.    We asked who would be affected first.    "It will surely be the smaller producers. There are 11  refrigerator brands that, taken together, account for no more  than 30 percent of the market. One of these firms will surely be  the first to fall."</p>

The 63-minute speech  revealed the thorny issues currently facing the United States  while demonstrating the U.S. ambition to lead the world.    Basically, the address focuses on U.S. domestic issues.  Clinton placed cracking down on crime and reforming the health  insurance and social welfare system on the top of U.S. domestic  issues. His placing cracking down on crime above economic  issues is quite a noteworthy signal. The high crime rate has  become a problem the American people are most concerned about.  Because the entire American society has been eroded and is  being paralyzed, Clinton, in addition to urging the U.S.  Congress to pass the bill on cracking down on crime, called on  all American people to abide by law and order, to work  hand-in-hand to rebuild American society, and to regain the  forces that had bound the society to enable the American people  to overcome their frustration, defeat the evils, and create a  good future.    Health insurance for everyone is another issue that Clinton  has insisted on. He hopes to revamp the current health  insurance system so that the 37 million Americans who currently  are not insured will also be taken care of. If the bill is  passed, it will be the most significant U.S. social reform since  the life-time social security welfare system was established in  the later days of the Great Depression. While delivering the  state of the union address, Clinton even threatened that he  would immediately veto the Congress' version of the  comprehensive health insurance plan if it could not provide  health care to all Americans.    Obviously, Clinton's state of the union address was designed  to create a favorable climate for the Democratic Party's  mid-term election campaign at the end of this year. Whether the  Congress will pass the health insurance bill is something that  remains to be seen. But, it is indisputable that Clinton was  able to tightly grip the pulse of the times and to precisely  point out the issues the American people are most concerned  about. The state of the union address indeed gives us a quite  clear indicator for gaining an idea of what course the United  States will take in the future. As a matter of fact, many of  the problems Clinton raised in the state of the union address  are not unique problems of the United States. Such problems as  the rise in crime rate, change in people's perception of values,  and the crumbling of society's binding force are common problems  that obsess many societies during their transformation periods.  Therefore, Clinton's urge for rebuilding society also provides  other countries with a soul-searching opportunity.    What kind of foreign policy the United States will pursue at  a time when the country is facing domestic difficulties is also  a problem the world is concerned about. In the state of the  union address, Clinton said the United States will maintain a  strong national defense and will not leave the rest of the world  alone -- this for the time being should give relief to those who  had been worried that the United States might return to  isolationism. However, this does not mean the United States is  capable of establishing a single-polar power setup with the  United States as the sole dominant force -- it still needs the  cooperation of other countries concerned. For this reason,  although Clinton said Mainland China must make noticeable  improvement in its human rights record, he did not use the  most-favored-nation issue as a means to force Peking [Beijing]  to comply. It is quite clear that Washington is doing  everything it can to improve its relations with Peking -- this  is a fact that we must know clearly in observing U.S. policy  toward China.    Northeast Asia (Communist China, Russia, and the Korean  peninsula) constitutes a significant portion of the part of the  state of the union address that deals with U.S. foreign policy.  Northeast Asia is a potential flash point that not only has  always been a potential security problem for the United States,  but also is closely related to building a new international  order. Such being the case, Clinton, in addition to his efforts  to improve relations with Communist China, declared that the  United States will support the promotion of democracy in former  Soviet Union countries -- including Russia -- and will continue  to push for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.    But, these goals cannot be achieved overnight. Russia's  economic reform has slowed down, and Moscow's relations with its  neighbors are becoming increasingly tense. Russian Foreign  Minister Kozyrev recently complained that the West simply does  not understand Russia's "special role" in the former Soviet  Union bloc -- this shows how tense relations are. All these  problems may result in the resurgence of radical Russian  nationalism. Ukraine's situation is more or less the same.  According to Western intelligence, if Ukraine's economic  situation does not improve, racial conflicts will very likely be  stirred up, which will result in a splitting of the country. If  this happens, the agreement between Ukraine and the United  States signed recently at the Moscow summit meeting on  destroying Ukraine's nuclear weapons may be torn up. Such an  outcome very likely will directly jeopardize the already fragile  Russian-Ukrainian relations. Facing these situations, the West  does not seem to have a set of effective countermeasures.  Therefore, maintaining good relations with Communist China to  check Russia's possible expansion from the southern flank has  become a natural response of the United States in the present  stage.    Tensions on the Korean peninsula are also on the rise. North  Korea has threatened to tear up the armistice agreement of the  Korean war if the United States imposes economic santions on it.  In response, the United States is considering deploying Patriot  missiles in Korea. From this development, we can see that there  is still a long way to go to make the Korean peninsula  nuclear-free. In view of Communist China's close relations with  North Korea, Washington must rely on Peking as a lever for  dealing with Pyongyang.    Relations between Russia, Communist China, and North Korea  are intricate and entangled with each other. If Russia's  economic and political reforms succeed, then, given that  Peking's military spending has continued to increase, Moscow  certainly can serve as a kind of checking force. But at a time  when Russia itself is full of crises, the United States can only  try to improve its relations with Communist China and invite it  to make common efforts to ensure world peace.    Then, will Communist China exercise self-restraint on  weapons  exportation and on other issues, and how will the United States,  while pursuing its security benefits, continue to apply pressure  on Communist China's human rights record? -- these are the  developments we should keep a close eye on while analyzing  Clinton's state of the union address.</p>

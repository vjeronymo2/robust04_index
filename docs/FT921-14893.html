			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Arts: Today's Television The repeat run of The Fall And Rise Of Reginald Perrin continues on BBC1 (8.00). This is not one of the greatest TV comedies, but the late Leonard Rossiter did bring a delightful Walter Mitty-ish quality to Perrin's character. Otherwise the most promising programmes appear to be on Channel 4. Brother Felix And The Virgin Saint (8.30) is the second part of Bamber Gascoigne's account of a long 15th century journey by a Dominican monk who fell in love with St Catherine and determined to touch her bones. Today he reaches the Holy Land and Jerusalem. Without Walls (9.00) is in two parts. The first is another item in this programme's 'J'accuse' series, with architect Max Hutchinson arguing that St Paul's Cathedral, far from being the triumph that so many believe, is a second rate mediaeval botch. For the second part television archivists should have their video recorders ready: Paul Madden offers a tribute to 'The Avengers', the seminal 60s series in which bowler-hatted Patrick Macnee was partnered first by Ian Hendry, then by Honor Blackman in leather, then by Diana Rigg, and later still by Linda Thorson. There has never been another series quite like it.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASEBALL;  </P> <P> FREEWAY LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SUNNY HILLS TAKES THE TITLE IN NO-HITTER AGAINST TROY  </P> <P> Nearly lost in the midst of celebrating only the second league baseball  championship in Sunny Hills High School's 29-year history Tuesday was a  no-hitter tainted by eight walks and two hit-batsmen.  </P> <P> Starter Brian Veronda had the rare distinction of being replaced in the midst  of pitching a no-hitter in the sixth inning after walking the bases loaded, but  reliever Ryan Frace struck out four of the six batters he faced in host Sunny  Hills' 5-1 victory over Troy.  </P> <P> The victory gave Sunny Hills (18-7 overall, 12-2 in league) the Freeway League  title, matching the school's only other championship in 1985. Sunny Hills holds  a two-game lead over Troy with one game left to play.  </P> <P> "It (no-hitter) didn't even enter my mind," said Doug Elliott, Sunny Hills  coach. "We won the ballgame, and that's all I care about. League titles have  been pretty hard to come by around here."  </P> <P> Veronda (5-1) walked seven and hit two batters but managed to avoid any trouble  thanks to a couple of fine plays by Sunny Hills shortstop Benny Rodriguez and  several key strikeouts.  </P> <P> But when Troy (15-7, 10-4) loaded the bases with nobody out in the sixth inning  and trailing, 5-0, Elliott never hesitated in motioning for Frace to enter the  game.  </P> <P> "I didn't even know he had a no-hitter," Elliott said. "You mean they didn't  get any hits today? I didn't know that."  </P> <P> Troy avoided a shutout when Tho Nguyen scored while Frace induced Darby  Carmichael to hit into a double play and then Frace struck out the side in the  seventh to clinch the title.  </P> <P> Sunny Hills scored all of its runs in the third inning with two outs off losing  pitcher Tom Wilson (8-1). Right fielder Jeff White hit a two-run single, and  the Lancers benefited from some sloppy play by Troy's outfielders who committed  three errors in the inning.  </P> <P> "That inning took the life out of us," said Dan Robinson, Troy coach. "They're  good, that's why they're No. 1 in the league. Veronda is right up there with  the best pitchers we've faced this year, although he was a little wild today."  </P> <P> The game was delayed for 15 minutes in the sixth inning when plate umpire Scott  Daniels was hit in the face by a wild pitch and had to be treated by local  paramedics. Daniels suffered a deep facial cut but continued to umpire the game  following treatment.  </P> <P> La Habra 4, Fullerton 3 -- The Highlanders (12-8, 8-6) scored three runs in the  top of the fifth to take a 4-2 lead. Rob Szente had a two-run double and David  Stevens followed with an RBI single in the inning. Tom Juarez (3-3) scattered  eight hits for the victory. Chris Rubal had two hits for Fullerton (11-10-1,  8-6).  </P> <P> Sonora 8, Buena Park 7 -- The Raiders (7-16, 3-11) scored two runs in the top  of the seventh for the victory. Jack Hay tied the score, 7-7, with an RBI  single and Kevin Cook then walked to force home the go-ahead run. Stuart  Cochran of Sonora had four hits.  </P></p>

The representatives of the Yemeni community expressed their  happiness over this meeting with the brother president in their  second home, Qatar. They briefed him on the situation of the  Yemeni community in Qatar, and also on the care and hospitality  accorded to them by the Qatari Government under His Highness  Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, amir of Qatar. They praised  the fraternal ties that bind them to the fraternal Qataris --  officials and people. They expressed their confidence that this  visit will contribute toward promoting and enhancing the ties  between the two fraternal countries and peoples.    The representatives of the Yemeni community in Qatar also  expressed concern over the current political situation in the  homeland. They reiterated their adherence to our people's  national constants, foremost among which are unity, democracy,  and stability.    Brother Presidential Council Chairman Lt. Gen. 'Ali  'Abdallah  Salih spoke to them. He expressed his great happiness over his  meeting with his compatriots in their second home, Qatar. He  appreciated the strong patriotic sentiments they expressed  toward their homeland, toward its unity, and toward the problems  plaguing the country due to the ongoing crisis.    The brother president paid tribute to the positive stands of  the Yemeni expatriates in general, and the expatriates in Qatar  in particular, especially since their conduct reflects the  Yemenis' nobility, as well as their cultural and humane values.  He urged them to make greater efforts to promote and enhance  their ties with their Qatari brothers, and to do their best to  reinforce these fraternal ties to epitomize the ties of kinship  between them and their Qatari brothers, given the fact that they  are representatives of their people and homeland.    The brother president also addressed the current  developments  in the homeland, and the challenges posed to Yemeni unity and  the Yemeni people. He reaffirmed his confidence that our people  are, God willing, capable of coping with these challenges,  thanks to their cohesion, solidarity, and unshakable faith in  Yemeni unity, which is the people's destiny and fate.    The brother president added: I am confident that our people,  who have managed to cope with the challenges that faced the  Yemeni revolution [words indistinct], are capable of coping with  the current challenges posed to unity in the same spirit, and  with the same zeal and (?faith).    The meeting was attended by the members of the delegation  accompanying the brother Presidential Council chairman on his  current visit to the State of Qatar.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Observer: IdEA'sman Has the Institute of Economic Affairs, the grandaddy of right-wing thinktanks, played too safe in the choice of its new director general - 40-year-old John Blundell? Blundell's predecessor, 37-year-old Graham Mather, had upset the IEA's old guard by cosying up to prime minister John Major. He was accused of allowing the government to influence the IEA - rather than the other way round - and had to go. Blundell is unlikely to make the same mistake, but will he be as effective as Mather in getting the IEA's signals heard in the right places? Blundell is an administrator, rather than a distinguished economic thinker, who has spent the past ten years in the US working closely with the late Sir Antony Fisher, founder of the IEA. Sir Antony made his fortune in Buxted chickens and used it to promote IEA-style thinktanks in over 40 countries. In his later years much of the work was delegated to Blundell as president of Atlas Economic Research foundation. Although he is not well known in the UK, Blundell has two big advantages. He knows how to chat up prospective sponsors, always important for a cash-strapped thinktank, and he has a vast network of contacts in academe. 'The market place for ideas is international,' says Blundell, who intends to carry on being a big importer.</p>

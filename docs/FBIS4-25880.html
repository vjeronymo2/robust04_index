			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, 14 Jun (XINHUA) -- The special defense  and public security subcommittee under the Sino-British Joint  Liaison Group began formal negotiations on 13 June after four  days of informal meetings. Concerned parties here said that  this indicates positive progress in Sino-British talks on the  handover of Hong Kong military land.    Chinese and British representatives for the talks told the  press yesterday that the two sides have narrowed their  differences through the informal experts' meetings. They  expressed hope that this formal meeting would bring forth a more  positive outcome, and they would strive to reach an early  agreement.    Chen Zuoer, Chinese representative for the special defense  and public security subcommittee, said: Chinese and British  experts have worked frantically hard with a positive and  pragmatic attitude since 8 April. They have coordinated well  both in and out of the meetings, and made progress in narrowing  differences between the two sides with a fairly flexible work  style. He said: Following the consultations, the 16th round  Sino-British meeting on Hong Kong defense and public security  has begun. We are looking forward to a more positive outcome  and an early agreement from this experts' meeting.    British representative Alan Paul agreed with Chen Zuoer's  remarks. He expressed hope that the formal meeting would yield  positive and early results on this basis and pave the way for  the liaison group's plenary meeting, to be held next week in  Hong Kong.</p>

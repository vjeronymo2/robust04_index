			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Excerpt] [Announcer Aleksandr Panov] The SCSE [State  Committee for the State of Emergency] trial resumed and was  again adjourned until 10 January in Moscow. Our correspondent  reports sensational, as he put it, details of today's sitting.    [Correspondent Aleksandr Ukhov] The lawyers of defendants  [Anatoliy] Lukyanov and [Vasiliy] Starodubtsev proposed that  criminal proceedings against their clients be dropped in  connection with the fact that Lukyanov and Starodubtsev had been  elected to Russia's highest legislative body. At the request of  defendant Lukyanov, lawyer Padva read out a letter from Boris  Yeltsin which the Russian president had sent Lukyanov on 30  December. The letter said, inter alia:    [Padva reading letter] I congratulate you on the holiday  (and  wish) that we establish fruitful and constructive joint work  sharing responsibility for the future of Russia and its  citizens. I am asking you to submit your proposals regarding  forms of interaction between parliamentarians and the president  and mechanisms for resolving possible contradictions between us.

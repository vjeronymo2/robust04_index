			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] As has already been reported, Latvian-  Russian interstate talks resumed in Moscow today. Ritums  Rozenbergs, Latvian Radio Moscow correspondent and the LABRIT  newspaper, will tell us more.    [Rozenbergs] This morning, the Latvian and Russian  delegations considered texts of the agreement. The delegations  agreed that additional consultations were needed on certain  issues. As a result of the meeting held this morning, both the  Russian and Latvian sides hope that the social security issue  for Russian military pensioners will be tackled. However,  findings of banks' experts are needed in order to reach this  agreement. So then, it is necessary to clarify the mechanism of  the payment of pensions.    On the issue of the Skrunda military base the delegations  decided at the morning meeting that the text of the agreement  would be acceptable for both sides. The Russian delegation has  not yet given final consent in connection with the fact that a  rent payment of 400 million dollars a year, demanded by the  Latvian side, is under question. The Latvian side expresses the  wish that several agreements favorable to Latvia could be  reached.

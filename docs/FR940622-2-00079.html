			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The proposed change does not affect any initiators of any previously evaluated accidents. Additionally, the proposed change involves equipment that only provides indication and therefore, it cannot increase the probability of any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated in Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) Section 7.7.1.24.1, no credit is taken in the safety analysis for operation of or operator reliance upon the leakage detection monitoring instrumentation associated with the drywell sumps. Notwithstanding, the drywell floor drain sump flow monitoring system provides the capability to detect and measure leakage from unknown sources of leakage in the drywell. The drywell floor drain sump inlet flow monitoring V-notch weir box instrumentation is designed to meet the accuracy requirements of Regulatory Guide 1.45. This instrumentation does not provide any automatic action or control functions. In addition to the V-notch system, drywell floor drain sump flow rates can be determined by using the sump pump pump-out timers, cycle counters and level switches. In addition, unidentified leakage into the drywell is monitored by a flow rate meter in the condensate discharge line from the drywell air coolers and by a particulate and a gaseous radiation monitoring channel of the drywell fission product monitor. While the drywell fission product monitor does not provide a quantitative leakage rate, it is sensitive enough to provide plant operators with early indication of an unanticipated increase in unidentified leakage. Furthermore, a number of other parameters are monitored with appropriate instrumentation to provide the plant operators with indirect indication of increases in unidentified leakage. These parameters include drywell pressure and drywell temperature. These alternative methods of detecting increases in unidentified leakage rates provide operators with sufficient information to take appropriate action to respond to an increase in leakage. Based on the above, Illinois Power concludes that the proposed change will not increase the consequences of any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The proposed change does not involve any modification to plant structures or components and only involves equipment that provides indication of leakage to the plant operators. The affected equipment does not provide any automatic action or control functions. As a result, the proposed change does not involve a change in the operation of the plant, nor does it introduce any new failure modes. Therefore, this proposed change cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The margin of safety associated with the instrumentation affected by the proposed change may be related to the limits on unidentified leakage. As stated in the Bases for Technical Specification 3/4.4.3.2. ``The allowable leakage rates from the reactor coolant system have been based on the predicted and experimentally observed behavior of cracks in pipes .&blank;.&blank;. The evidence obtained from experiments suggests that for leakage somewhat greater than that specified for unidentified leakage the probability is small that the imperfection or crack associated with such leakage would grow rapidly. With respect to Intergranular Stress Corrosion Cracking (IGSCC) related cracks in service sensitive austenitic stainless steel piping however, an additional limit on the allowed increase in unidentified leakage (within a 24-hour period or less) is imposed in accordance with NRC Generic Letter 88&hyph;01, `NRC Position on IGSCC in BWR Austenitic Stainless Steel Piping,' since an abrupt increase in the unidentified leakage could be indicative of leakage from such a source.'' The proposed change does not alter any of these limits on the unidentified leakage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As previously described, flow rates into the drywell floor drain sump can be determined based on the indicated run time for the sump pumps and the known pump flow rates or by monitoring the sump fill-up times and considering the volume corresponding to the current level control band. These alternate methods are sufficient to determine whether unidentified leakage in the drywell exceeds the 5 pgm limit and whether changes in this leakage exceed the limit of a 2 gpm increase in any 24-hour period or less.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, with respect to the ability to detect changes in unidentified leakage rates, in addition to the V-notch system, drywell floor drain sump flow rates can be determined by using the sump pump pump-out timers, cycle counters and level switches. In addition, unidentified leakage into the drywell is monitored by a flow rate meter in the condensate discharge line from the drywell air coolers and by a particulate and a gaseous radiation monitoring channel of the drywell fission product monitor. While the drywell fission product monitor does not provide a quantitative leakage rate, it is sensitive enough to provide plant operators with early indication of an unanticipated increase in the unidentified leakage rate involving reactor coolant. Furthermore, a number of other parameters are monitored with appropriate instrumentation to provide the plant operators with indirect indication of increases in unidentified leakage. These parameters include drywell pressure and drywell temperature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated above, the drywell floor drain sump flow monitoring instrumentation does not provide any automatic action or control functions. Further, as stated in USAR Section 7.7.1.24.1, no credit is taken in the safety analysis for operation of or operator reliance upon the leakage detection monitoring instrumentation associated with the drywell sumps.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of all the above, Illinois Power concludes that the proposed change does not involve a reduction in the margin of safety. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 15 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 15-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 15-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a notice of issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

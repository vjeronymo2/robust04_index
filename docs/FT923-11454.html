			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Banks set to bounce California's cheques: State administration grapples with severe budget crisis as big pay day looms CALIFORNIAN banks are preparing to bounce the state government's cheques, as the state grapples with its most severe budget crisis since the Depression. Left without a formal budget for the fiscal year that began this month, the state government has been reduced to paying its employees and contractors with a form of cheque, or IOU, known as a registered warrant. For recipients, these warrants are meant to be as good as cheques, while the banks earn interest on them until the state redeems them. More than Dollars 1bn is already outstanding in this form, a big pay day is impending next week and banks are starting to grumble. Small community banks have virtually stopped accepting the IOUs. Bank of America, one of the main Californian banks, said yesterday it would no longer accept the state's IOUs from August 5. 'This is a very unusual situation. I don't think anyone has issued scrip or IOUs since the 1930s,' said Mr Ron Snell at the National Conference of State Legislatures. Bankers' threats appear to have forced Governor Pete Wilson of California, a Republican, and Mr Willie Brown, Speaker of the Democratic-controlled state assembly, into a new effort to resolve their disagreements. 'It's going to take this sort of action to get out of the impasse,' said Mr Richard Mount of the Saratoga National Bank, near San Francisco, noting that the 5 per cent interest paid to banks on the warrants did not begin to cover handling costs. But the size of California's fiscal problems, and the public policy questions which underlie them, will make it hard to reach a solution. Faced with a budget shortfall last year, Governor Wilson agreed to a heavy tax increase. As the state's economy continued to suffer from recession, however, this failed to bring in as much revenue as hoped. This year, the state faces a shortfall estimated at Dollars 11bn-Dollars 12bn, for a total budget of Dollars 55bn-Dollars 60bn. 'Even the states which had very large problems at the beginning of the 1980s, because of the collapse in oil and energy tax revenues, did not have shortfalls of 20 per cent,' Mr Snell comments. The difficulties are rooted in the state's development over the last two decades and the policies it has pursued. The growing population has put heavy burdens on public education and social security. The burdens have been made worse by immigration from elsewhere in the US, Mexico and Pacific Rim countries. The state has also taken over from city and county administrations more of the cost of providing services, as a consequence of the 1978 state constitutional amendment, known as Proposition 13, that limited property taxes. Much discussion between Governor Wilson and Speaker Brown focuses on how to reduce the state's payments to local governments so as to compensate them for the property tax reduction under Proposition 13. California has a history of passing by referendum constitutional amendments which mandate spending or earmark revenues. As a result, its governors complain they control less than 10 per cent of their budget. The fiscal crisis has been brought to a head by recession, which has hit California harder than most other states, and by cuts in defence spending, once a mainstay in the state economy. Mr Gray Davis, state controller, said this week that he would start redeeming some of the IOUs from August 3. The state has about Dollars 1.5bn in cash, but is constrained in using that until a budget has been passed. Even so, a longer-term solution is expected to require radical rethinking of the services California offers its population and the taxes it may levy.</p>

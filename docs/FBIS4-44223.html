			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Debt Will Soon Equal Our Entire GNP"] </F>   [Text] The Finnish national debt is fast approaching 100  percent of our gross national product, and it will not be  possible to achieve the goal the Finance Ministry proclaimed  again last year of halting the debt at 70 percent, warned  Finance Minister Iiro Viinanen.    He estimated that the debt will be close to 500 billion  [Finnish] markkas [FMk] in 1997.    Viinanen said the European Union (EU) solution will increase  the need to take out around FMk10 billion in new loans next  year, while at the same time the ministries have exceeded their  budget limits for next year by FMk11 billion. Such a situation  is serious and precarious, the finance minister stressed.    "The debts are becoming an enormous burden on the national  economy, but many choose not to see this," said Viinanen.  "However the fact is that the billions that go to service the  national debt must be taken from somewhere."    Viinanen pointed out that it is still true that state  spending is rising at a faster pace than revenues. Tax revenues  will not increase much during the late 1990's, he said, at least  not to the extent that they will offset national budget deficits.</p>

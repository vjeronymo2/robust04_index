			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SMALLER SCHOOL DISTRICTS URGED BY TASK  FORCE  </P> <P> Dividing the Los Angeles Unified School District into at least eight and as  many as 49 smaller districts will improve academic performance and reduce the  number of dropouts, according to a report issued Wednesday by a task force  formed to study ways to break up the district.  </P> <P> The report shows that the 610,000-student district is "incapable of addressing  the legitimate education needs of Los Angeles-area students," said  Assemblywoman Marian La Follette (R-Northridge), a longtime advocate of  breaking up the district who formed the task force.  </P> <P> But two of the seven members appointed to serve on the Los Angeles Task Force  for Better Education said that despite the report's conclusions, they have not  seen enough evidence that dividing up the district would cure the many ills  plaguing city schools.  </P></p>

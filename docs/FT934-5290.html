			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Strong opening to new equity trading account - Market report Another strong session in financial, consumer and industrial growth stocks in the UK market yesterday, matched by weakness in the defensive high yielders, signalled the City's conviction that this afternoon's Budget speech will be favourable for equity investors. The first day of the new equity trading account closed last night with the market showing a gain of about 2.2 per cent since the middle of last week, when investors shed fears of adverse tax changes and turned to a positive view of the likely Budget proposals. Attention focused entirely on the domestic scene, with the stock index future again providing a lead for equities. After opening lower in the shadow of the heavy fall in Tokyo, UK shares moved ahead steadily and gains were trimmed only slightly when Wall Street, in its first full return from the Thanksgiving break, managed a meagre gain of only 7 Dow points in UK trading hours. The FT-SE Index closed 24.4 ahead at 3,135.8, having touched 3,144.1 earlier. A good level of institutional interest was seen, with overseas buyers looking confidently for further cuts in UK and European interest rates soon. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, often the focus of private investor activity, gained 11.1 to 3,466. There were gains among life assurance stocks as fears of tax threats to pension fund values eased, in merchant banks, which benefit from a strong equity market, and in brewers, hotels and stores, all hoping for a benign Budget. But water and electricity stocks suffered as their solid dividend prospects appeared less exciting in a stock market now looking for a Budget focused on promoting economic growth. A fresh round of losses in oil stocks as crude prices continued to weaken was balanced by perceptions that cheaper oil would subdue inflation and encourage industrial economies. Trading volume remained high, with 687.8m shares passing through the Seaq network compared with 697.6m on Friday. Friday's retail business was worth Pounds 1.53bn, at the high end of this year's daily averages. Last week brought a total of nearly Pounds 7bn in retail business, in spite of the brief absences of Wall Street and Tokyo for holiday breaks. The excitement of the day came in the domestic television sector with the first of the bid moves so widely-predicted since official takeover restrictions were eased last week. Carlton Communications made an agreed bid worth Pounds 758m for Central TV, setting the sector alive with activity. In addition to the relaxation of fears of adverse changes in company taxation, the stock market was also confirming its belief that UK base rates will be reduced again in the near future, even if not today. Several strategists have predicted that domestic rates will be cut from the present 5.5 per cent minimum to 4 per cent, or even lower. Interest rate optimism is also fuelled from other European financial centres where a rate cut from the Bundesbank is anticipated. While there has been a distinct shift in sentiment over the past trading week, there were still signs that share prices were being driven ahead by the unwillingness of marketmaking firms to hold heavy stock positions over the Budget period. Equity traders are expected to take their cue from the stock index futures traders this morning.</p>

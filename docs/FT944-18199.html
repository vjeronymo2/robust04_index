			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / China plans reform of state enterprises China has unveiled a six-point plan to overhaul its ailing state-owned enterprises. The scheme aims at transforming government businesses into shareholding companies with management independent of official controls. The China Securities newspaper quoted a representative of the State Economic and Trade Commission as saying that 'substantial reforms of the state-owned enterprises have become vital for further economic development'. But China's approach to enterprise reform has been faltering and change is being constrained by worries about unemployment among state sector workers. These concerns have been exacerbated by the latest bout of inflation. Government attempts to bring prices under control seem to have deflected attention from reforms. According to official estimates, approximately one-third of China's 11,000 large and medium state-owned enterprises loses money, another third is said to be breaking even and the remaining companies are profitable. Western economists, however, doubt this assessment and believe the number of loss-making businesses is closer to one half with many of these enterprises virtually bankrupt. The key element of the new reforms is a system to enable state assets to be evaluated and then sold. State-owned investment companies, holding companies or asset management companies will become shareholders and authorised to sell a portion of an enterprise's assets. Initially, the government will select pilot enterprises for the reforms. About 100 enterprises have been earmarked for the programme. The measures are also aimed at streamlining bankruptcy procedures to enable hopeless cases to be liquidated or sold off. This will be done under the new bankruptcy law. The six-point plans also calls for establishment of an 'effective' social security net to cover pensions and unemployment insurance. China's social welfare provisions are rudimentary, or non-existent. Eighteen Chinese cities, including Shanghai, Shenyang and Tianjin have been included in the pilot programme.</p>

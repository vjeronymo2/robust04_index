			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Abkhazia's Justice Ministry, temporarily based in  Tbilisi, has evaluated the referendum on the legal status of  this autonomous republic as a political farce.    The Justice Ministry's statement, distributed on Thursday,  says that the aim of this measure is "to announce Abkhazia as a  sovereign state" despite the UN and Security Council decisions.  (As is known, their resolutions reconfirm Georgia's sovereignty  and territorial integrity.)    "The intention to hold a referendum at a time when ethnic  cleansing and genocide of the Georgian population are underway  in Abkhazia is cynical," underlines the statement.    To this effect the ministry declared that "according to  Georgia's laws and norms of international law, results of this  referendum will have no legal force."</p>

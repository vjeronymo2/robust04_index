			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: A setback for the Revenue - Expatriates THREE YEARS ago, a sudden change in the Inland Revenue's views on the taxability of offshore portfolio bonds (OPBs), caught many current and former expatriates by surprise. Since, the authorities have been vigorously pursuing claims for the tax which they consider to be due. Some investors have paid. But for most, the matter remains unresolved. OPBs are theoretically single premium life assurance policies although they are primarily investments. By transferring a portfolio of stocks and shares, unit trusts, gilts and so on to an offshore insurance company in return for the issue of a bond, investors could retain the right to manage their investments while - so it was thought - enjoying the tax treatment of a single premium life policy. Such treatment is that no liability to tax arises until you take benefits from the bonds - and not even then provided you keep within the so called 'premium allowance' which permits drawings each year of 5 per cent of the sum originally invested. Clearly, since the insurance companies, being based offshore, are beyond the reach of the Inland Revenue, such arrangements enable you to avoid tax altogether for extended periods, even when you are resident in the UK and drawing a 5 per cent 'income' from your bonds. It was, no doubt, this, combined with the fact that considerable sums were being invested, which attracted the attention of the Inland Revenue. Its reaction was to claim that a 60-year-old piece of anti-avoidance legislation  -currently Section 739 of the 1988 Taxes Act - was applicable. If correct, this would strike at the heart of OPBs by enabling the taxing authorities to 'look through' the bond and charge tax on the underlying income in all years during which you are ordinarily resident in the UK. But the legislation itself contains exemptions which negate the operation of the section. To benefit, you must prove to the satisfaction of the Inland Revenue either: (a)'that avoiding taxation was not the purpose or one of the purposes of acquiring the bond', or (b)'that its acquisition was a bona fide commercial transaction, not designed for the purpose of avoiding tax.' It has gradually become clear that the Inland Revenue's views are by no means unassailable. Can the Section be made to apply to a bondholder who, while ordinarily resident in the UK now, did not have that status when the bond was acquired? Indeed, those negotiating with the Inland Revenue Special Investigations Section, might well have felt that they were partaking in a dialogue of the deaf. All arguments were politely turned aside and the 'party line' reiterated. However, Royal Life International and Matheson PFC report that a client of theirs has succeeded in an appeal brought before the Special Commissioners. All assessments raised by the Inspector of Taxes have, it seems, been discharged. This is a substantial breakthrough, even though such appeal decisions are not binding in any but the case of the taxpayer concerned and are not even officially reported. Most importantly, the Special Commissioners found that Section 739 cannot apply in the case of a bond effected by an individual at a time when he was not ordinarily resident in the UK. Although that conclusion is directly contrary to the decision reached by the Court of Appeal for Northern Ireland in the case of Herdman v IRC in 1967, it had for some years been doubtful whether that remained good law. Any lingering doubts were eliminated by referring - as a recent House of Lords decision makes clear may be done - to the statements of W S Morrison in the course of the 1936 Finance Bill debates, when Section 739 was first enacted. For good measure, the appellant also convinced the commissioners that he was entitled to exemption from the section as well. His aim had been to provide for his retirement and although taxation was taken into account, avoiding tax was not held to be one of the purposes for which the bond was effected. It was also held to be a bona fide commercial transaction. If you are an OPB holder and acquired your bond while resident overseas, this is certainly good news. Nevertheless, celebrations are, for the moment, premature. Not surprisingly, perhaps, the Inland Revenue has begun preparations which might lead to a High Court challenge on points of law, although the Special Commissioners' findings on matters of fact in this particular case, cannot be overturned. Consequently, until the situation clarifies, anyone intending to return to the UK for residence at some time in the future, would be unwise to make investments of this type. Without doubt, however, the Inland Revenue has suffered a severe setback. Donald Elkin is a Director of Wilfred T. Fry Limited of Worthing, West Sussex.</p>

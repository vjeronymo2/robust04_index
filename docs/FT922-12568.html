			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Peru economic plan imperilled by aid freeze: Leslie Crawford reports that a balance of payments crisis may follow Fujimori's palace coup PERU'S ECONOMIC stabilisation programme appears to be in jeopardy because of the suspension of international aid following President Alberto Fujimori's palace coup on April 5. The country faces a balance of payments crisis because it can no longer rely on a Dollars 1.3bn debt-relief package put together by the Support Group of creditor nations. The money would have allowed Peru to clear debt payment arrears with the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). This in turn would have paved the way for a rescheduling agreement with commercial banks, owed more than half of Peru's Dollars 23bn foreign debt. Of the Dollars 1.3bn pledged by the support group, Peru has received only Dollars 300m from Japan in December. A further Dollars 100m linked to an IADB loan is due from Japan. The US has frozen Dollars 320m in economic aid, most of it earmarked for debt relief. Germany has suspended Dollars 110m in development grants and Spain some Dollars 50m. Humanitarian aid is unaffected. The US emergency food programme estimates it feeds 3m people, or one in seven Peruvians, who would otherwise starve. The IADB, the only bank currently lending to Peru, has put about Dollars 400m of credits on hold. Mr Fujimori's cash-strapped government needed the IADB loans to reactivate the economy, which is still suffering from the shock of an IMF austerity programme. 'The government faces a dilemma,' says Mr Jorge Chavez, president of Peru's Central Bank. 'It either draws down international reserves to meet its foreign obligations, or it declares a new moratorium, which would set back Peru's rehabilitation within the international financial community.' Peru has Dollars 1.4bn in reserves, but Mr Chavez would resist any attempts by Mr Fujimori to draw on the funds. 'I will not lend the government a single dollar to pay debt arrears,' he says, 'it would be an irresponsible use of reserves.' He says the coup took him by surprise. He was at an IADB meeting in the Dominican Republic when Mr Fujimori installed a military-backed 'emergency government," closing parliament and the judiciary. He believes Peru's only hope of winning back financial aid will depend on Mr Fujimori's announcing a timetable for the rapid restoration of democracy. Unless this happens, many believe that Mr Chavez, who has clashed with the president in the past, will resign. Mr Fujimori is also under pressure to produce a quick turnaround in the economy, now that he has 'unshackled' himself from the parliament he so despised. 'The coup has raised expectations that people's living standards will improve,' says Dr Jorge Gonzalez Izquierdo, the economics dean at Lima's Universidad del Pacifico. 'If the austerity continues, Fujimori's popularity will plummet.' Mr Fujimori maintains that the about Dollars 90m 'saved' by closing Congress will be spent on raising teachers' wages and social programmes. Dr Gonzalez Izquierdo maintains that this is pure demagoguery: 'The government has failed to implement a single programme to alleviate poverty since it took office 22 months ago.' The business community, which overwhelmingly endorsed the coup, is expecting favours. Exporters want the central bank to intervene in the open foreign exchange market to bring about a devaluation of the sol. The currency's strength against the dollar is the result of a flood of drug money and speculative capital and has transformed Lima into one of the most expensive cities in Latin America. Industrialists want lower taxes, lower interest rates and a freer labour code. Some economists, like Mr Hernando de Soto, question the effectiveness of the government's macroeconomic programme in the absence of deeper social reforms. He says that 92 per cent of farmers do not have titles to their land. Unable to obtain credit, they were condemned to poverty. Only 150,000, out of 23m Peruvians, paid tax last year, with tax evasion preventing the government from being able to provide basic health and education services, let alone equip an army to fight a fully-fledged civil war which has claimed 23,000 lives, mostly civilian, in 12 years. The tensions were visible when Mr Fujimori addressed the tourist business council this week. His speech was subdued and offered no clues about how he intends to manage the economy or his timetable for political reform.</p>

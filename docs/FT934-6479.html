			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Gaidar urges more government protection for Russian industry Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's deputy prime minister, yesterday called on the government to apply 'sensible protectionism' to the country's industrialists and entrepreneurs. Mr Gaidar who led the country's move towards a free market two years ago, said that since prices had been liberalised and the economy opened to imports, Russian companies' demands for protection against foreign competition showed they had adjusted to market conditions. He denied that he had changed his ultra-liberal views over the past two years to win votes in next month's parliamentary elections. Protection for business has been a popular theme in the election campaign. 'When we freed prices we needed imports because we did not even have any domestic markets', he said yesterday. Russia's circumstances have changed. Now, the government was happy to respond to pleas from its farmers for an end to grain imports, and from other producers who now realised they had a market to defend. Import tariffs, which the government has steadily increased since opening up the economy in January last year, were also a useful source of budget revenues, he said: 'We believe that domestic markets should be protected and we can use these tariffs to raise some additional revenues.' He did not say which imports should be taxed, but added they should not be punitive ones, simply fees to support domestic industry. At the same time he vowed to resist demands to protect Russian monopoly producers which had no domestic competition. Nor would he isolate the Russian economy from world markets, he said, claiming that Russia's speedy entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, would help the country stay its course as an open economy, with access to other markets. In the past two years, Russian consumers have been flooded with western advertising and goods ranging from chocolate to cars, while Russian producers of similar, if lower quality, goods have been deep in crisis. While many Russians have welcomed an increased choice of goods - that is those who can afford them - many are offended by the impression that their country is no longer a great industrial power. The main parties competing with Russia's Choice, the electoral bloc headed by Mr Gaidar, are promising increased support for national producers and protection from western competition to give them time to adjust to market conditions. The day after Mr Gaidar met leading Russian bankers, President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree limiting the activities of foreign banks in Russia. Yesterday a new list of increased import tariffs was published.</p>

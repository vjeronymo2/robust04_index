			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. We used the date of the start of the Dutch sales verification for all missing payment dates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Foreign Market Value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated in our preliminary determination, we determined that the home market was not viable for any of the three such or similar categories. We selected Germany as the third country market for sales of yarn and staple fiber, and Japan as the third country market for sales of pulp. We calculated FMV as noted in the ``Price-to-Price'' and ``Price to Constructed Value (CV)'' sections of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Cost of Production <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioner alleged that Akzo's third country sales were made at prices below the cost of production (COP). On the basis of petitioners' allegations, we gathered and verified data on production costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  We compared Akzo's third country prices to the COP as explained in our preliminary determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In order to determine whether third country prices were above the COP, we calculated the COP based on the sum of Arami's (i.e., the actual producer and seller of subject merchandise) submitted costs of materials, fabrication, general expenses, and packing, except in the following instances where the costs were not appropriately quantified or valued: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. We recalculated interest expense based solely on Arami's financial statements (see DOC position for comment 12);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. We included certain non-operating expenses in general and administrative (G&amp;A) expenses (see DOC position for comment 17); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. We disallowed Arami's claimed reduction in fixed overhead for certain intercompany charges (see DOC position for comments 14 and 15).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Accordingly, we increased its submitted cost of manufacturing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Price-to-Price Comparisons <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For those products for which we had an adequate number of sales at prices equal to or greater than the COP, we based FMV on third country prices. We calculated FMV using the methodology described in our notice of preliminary determination, with the following exceptions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. We recalculated inventory carrying costs incurred in the Netherlands on German and Japanese sales and German credit expenses to reflect the short-term borrowing rate of Arami (see comment 7 below). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. We used the average credit days of all transactions with a reported shipment and payment date for sales missing both a shipment and payment date. We have inserted the date of the start of the Dutch sales verification for those sales with missing payment dates only. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. We corrected a clerical error in the calculation of third country indirect selling expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Price to CV Comparisons <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For those products without an adequate number of sales at prices above the COP, we based FMV on CV. We calculated CV based on the sum of the cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, and U.S. packing cost. In accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B) (i) and (ii) of the Act we: (1) Included the greater of Arami's reported general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the cost of manufacture (COM), as appropriate and; (2) for profit, we used the higher of the statutory minimum of eight percent of the sum of COM and general expenses or the actual profit incurred as calculated on a market specific basis (see Comment 18). As a result, for the German market we used actual profit and for the Japanese market we used the statutory minimum of eight percent. We calculated CV based on the methodology described in the calculation of COP above, with the following exceptions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. In the financing calculation, we included additional interest expense based on market value (See Comment 13). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. We corrected a clerical error in the calculation of third country profit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In instances where we compared Akzo's U.S. prices to CV, we made deductions, where appropriate, for the weighted-average third country direct selling expenses. We also deducted the weighted-average third country indirect selling expenses. We limited this adjustment by the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Determination of Critical Circumstances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' exist with respect to imports of PPD-T aramid fiber from the Netherlands. Pursuant to section 733(e)(1) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.16, we have analyzed the allegations using the Department's standard methodology as discussed in our preliminary determination, except that for purposes of determining whether there have been massive imports we compared imports in five-month periods rather than four-month periods (see DOC position for comment 4). Accordingly, we find that critical circumstances do not exist. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Currency Conversion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Verification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we verified information provided by Akzo by using standard verification procedures, including the examination of relevant sales and financial records, and selection of original source documentation containing relevant information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

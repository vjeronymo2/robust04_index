We have common views on international relations. The  Republics, which were for a long time part of the former Union,  are closely linked with one another.

The economic  ties between China and Uzbekistan are also developing normally.  The PRC is intending to render humanitarian assistance for  saving the Aral and henceforth, it intends to develop  cooperation in all spheres, emphasized the esteemed guest.    At the end of the talks, the document signing ceremony was  held.

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / CBI issues code for prompt bill payment A CODE of prompt payment practice, seeking a commitment from all companies to pay bills on time, was launched yesterday by the Confederation of British Industry. The code, Prompt Payers - in good Company, advises on steps a company should take to ensure it pays its bills on time. It is being sent to all CBI members with a letter from Sir Brian Corby, CBI president. Introducing the code, Sir Brian said: 'Cashflow is the lifeblood of business. Late payment can damage business relationships and endanger the very survival of a company. While to some, paying bills after the due date may appear a simple means of easing financial pressures,it is in fact a clear breach of contract. 'It is also short-sighted and can be in no one's interest if an otherwise sound and valued supplier goes to the wall because bills are not paid on time.' The code says a reasonable company should: Have a clear, consistent policy to pay bills in accordance with contract. Ensure that the finance and purchasing departments are aware of this policy and adhere to it. Agree payment terms at the outset of a deal and stick to them. Promise not to extend or alter payment terms without prior agreement. Ensure that there is a system for dealing quickly with complaints and disputes, and advise suppliers without delay when invoices, or parts of invoices, are con-tested. The code has been published following a joint survey at the start of 1991 conducted by the CBI and Cork Gully, the insolvency division of Coopers Lybrand Deloitte, which showed that late payment of bills was endangering the survival of one in five small businesses.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BAY AREA QUAKE;  </P> <P> WITNESS / STATE SEN. JOHN SEYMOUR;  </P> <P> HOTEL'S 4TH FLOOR PROVIDED VIEW OF CHAOS, ASSISTANCE  </P> <P> Anaheim Republican state Sen. John Seymour was dressing for a political  function Tuesday afternoon in his room at San Francisco's El Drisco Hotel when  the 6.9-magnitude temblor struck. The furniture began to move. Something  crashed from a table.  </P> <P> "The immediate thought was, 'My God, this is the heavy one,' " said Seymour,  who was in the Bay Area city with his wife, Judy, for a fund-raiser for U.S.  Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) " 'We're on the fourth floor and we've got to get  out of here.' "  </P> <P> But the couple discovered that the hotel was not only a safe spot, but also  provided a view of both chaos and cooperation following the 5:04 p.m. temblor.  From his vantage point in the hills of the Pacific Heights neighborhood,  Seymour said the flames of the Marina district fire lit the sky.  </P> <P> "It was eerie as darkness fell because (the rest of the city) was totally  black. The only light you could see was the light of vehicles, the sirens  going."  </P> <P> Outside, people were scurrying. "I recall one woman running through the streets  hollering, 'Papa! Papa!' I don't know if she ever found her father," he said.  </P> <P> He added that history apparently was with him Tuesday because the night before,  a taxi driver told him of El Drisco: " 'You should know that it is one of the  few hotels that withstood the 1906 quake.'

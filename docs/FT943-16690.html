			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Arts: Ambitious beyond the simple portrait - William Packer admires the work in the 15th Portrait Award The Portrait Award, now in its fifth year with BP and its 15th in all, has become so much a fixture in the calendar that we may well take it too much for granted. Certainly it is a measure of its established position that again this year, rather like a former Prince of Wales, it is 'no better, (it) is much the same.' The great thing is that it is no worse. 'Much the same' in a position of strength is no bad thing at all. Of course all but the judges will disagree with the prizes given, and even they may have agreed to disagree among themselves. That too is in the nature of the beast. What is clear is that with their three winners and clutch of commendeds, they have been drawn towards the more awkward and unsettling of the works: works that by their scale, and the formal and technical problems they take on, are ambitious beyond the narrower conventions of portraiture. Shani Rhys-James's huge and richly expressive self-portrait with tins of paint (2nd prize); Louise Courtnell's starkly-lit self-nude (commended); Peter Edwards' wistful elderly model in blue jumper and long, patterned skirt, sitting with the arms folded lightly on her lap (1st prize - Pounds 10,000 and a commission): these are things for only the bravest of boardrooms. But then, while never excluding the possibility, the safer icons of boardroom, officers' mess or bishop's palace were never the Portrait Award's particular thing. Rather it was to restore the portrait itself to the currency of contemporary art - which has largely been achieved, as these award exhibitions have long-since shown in their quality and variety. Of the works unfavoured by the judges this time, I recommend Brian Martin's large studio conversation piece; Euan Gray's somewhat fierce and intense self-portrait; Minna Thornton's rather more swift and delicate self-portrait; an ambitious full-length self-portrait by Douglas Houghton; and Jason Line's three-quarter length of a friend, Drax, resplendent in his patchwork shirt. My only gripe against the Portrait Award is its restriction to artists of 40 and under. The young already have enough going for them - yet another competition or award for young artists 'in those difficult years after leaving college' would be one too many. Artists in mid-career need encouragement too, and there are many whose premature exclusion has been the award's loss in the longer term. David Remfry is one of them, a most accomplished figure draughtsman and a virtuoso of water-colour, which he regularly exploits on the largest scale the medium can reasonably stand. The evidence of this latest show is that his handling of it is growing ever more radical, free and experimental, whatever the apparent subject of the work might be, bringing the eye always back to the surface, to the stroke of the brush and the flow of the paint. His principal subject has always been the female figure, young, beautiful and active, usually in her party clothes and often be-hatted. This new work at the Mercury continues his trend of recent years in extending that particular pre-occupation into larger, more complex and ambitious compositions - the night-club, the party, the dance, with Remfry's friends supplying the immediately recognisably dramatis personae. Few artists catch the life and movement, the very spirit of the party with such wit and light dexterity. Geoffrey Humphries is another remarkable draughtsman of the figure, which remains his principal subject, in life-painting and portraiture. He includes one or two such examples in this exhibition at Albion, but for once the bulk of the work is of a different kind. He has spent most of his time in Venice these many years, yet so domineering is the city as a subject that he has long fought shy of it. Latterly, however, he has begun to work from it at last, not in the conventional and familiar image of Grand Canal, Piazza and Palazzo, but rather the intimate and informal city of his own daily life, of bar and shop, alleyway and waterfront. In all of this he has been working mainly in water-colour for practical reasons. The results come small in scale but in remarkable quantity, and with an economy of statement, and delicacy of touch that grow surer with every one.

David Remfry: A Little Night Music; Mercury Gallery, 26 Cork Street W1, until July 23. Geoffrey Humphries: Albion Fine Art, 61 Ledbury Road W11, until July 16.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Israeli air raids kill nine guerrillas in Lebanon ISRAEL'S war with the pro-Iranian Lebanese Shia Moslem Hizbollah escalated yesterday when Israeli aircraft twice bombed Hizbollah targets in Lebanon, killing nine guerrillas and wounding 20. Unconfirmed reports said that one of the dead was an Iranian revolutionary guard. The bombing raids and helicopter gunship attacks on two Shia villages in southern Lebanon constituted the most serious Israeli offensive against Hizbollah since the violence following Israel's assassination of the group's leader, Sheikh Abbas Musawi, in February. A Hizbollah delegation had met Syrian Vice-President Abdel-Halim Khaddam in Damascus on Wednesday night. Syria has supported Hizbollah's 'resistance' operations against the Israelis. The first Israeli bombing raid yesterday targeted a Hizbollah base at Janta, just three miles west of the Syrian border, renewing fears that Syria could be drawn into the Hizbollah-Israeli conflict. The current fighting began on Tuesday, when Hizbollah militiamen overran a hilltop position of the South Lebanon Army (SLA), Israel's proxy militia in southern Lebanon. Reuter adds from Jerusalem: The Israeli army said it was checking Palestinian claims that undercover troops had shot and wounded seven children on Wednesday, during a Palestinian election campaign in the occupied West Bank city of Nablus.</p>

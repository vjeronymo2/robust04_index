			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Management: Standing oration - Japanese companies are looking for ways to improve efficiency in the office Since the beginning of this month, staff at the Yokohama town hall are being urged to conduct meetings standing up. To help them, the City Office has built a new conference room which, instead of tables and chairs, is furnished with 16 podia. The new conference room was the result of mounting concern among Yokohama city staff over the number of meetings held each day and the amount of time each one took. If meetings were held standing, city officials reasoned, they were bound to finish sooner. A growing number of Japanese companies are similarly looking for ways to improve efficiency among office staff. Shiseido, the Japanese cosmetics company, has set aside two hours each day as 'concentration time'. Staff at the Tokyo head office do not attend meetings or answer the telephone during that period. Instead, a few members of each division take turns to man the phones allowing their colleagues to concentrate on the work in hand. Shiseido launched the scheme in April after it discovered that interruptions during the day from telephone calls and meetings were the main cause behind the need for staff to work overtime. The scheme is part of a wider programme aimed at improving productivity among its office staff. Shiseido hopes to reduce the number of overall working hours from the current 1,920 to 1,860. This may not seem much, but in Japan any reduction is highly unusual. Toyota, the car manufacturer, is also implementing a programme this month which aims to raise productivity among office staff by 30 per cent. The company plans to achieve this by requiring divisions to re-direct 20 per cent of staff time to new businesses and, for the remaining 10 per cent, by reducing working hours. What has triggered this growing concern with raising productivity is the economic slump, which is one of the worst for the country since the end of the second world war. Company profits in Japan, announced last month, were down for a third consecutive year. Against this environment, a preoccupation of Japanese company managers has been the need to ensure profitability even while markets are not expanding. Since it is socially unacceptable in Japan to make large redundancies, one way to maintain profits in sagging markets is to raise productivity. Office workers have become a target of this productivity drive because, while Japanese companies are recognised for their achievements in raising productivity on the factory floor, they have not had similar successes in the office. Between 1976 and 1990 the production costs incurred by all listed Japanese companies fell 5 per cent, largely as a result of improvements on the factory floor, says Kuniyoshi Sasaki at the Japan Productivity Centre. Meanwhile all-non-manufacturing costs - those related to administration and marketing - rose 33 per cent Another reason why concerns about productivity are targetted at the head office rather than the factory floor is that most Japanese companies took on many white-collar workers in the past few years when the economy was surging. Between 1955 and 1991, the number of professionals and engineers employed by Japanese companies grew by 385 per cent, that of managers by 280 per cent and clerical workers by 326 per cent, the Japan Productivity Centre found. This compares with 111 per cent growth in the number of skilled workers. The Bank of Tokyo estimates white-collar workers accounted for nearly 70 per cent of the rise in the number of employees between 1986 and 1991. Personnel costs have been creeping up, from 11 per cent of revenues five years ago to 12 per cent last year according to the Ministry of Finance. Sasaki lists several problems which must be tackled if productivity in the Japanese office is to be raised. Too many meetings. Sasaki attributes this to the 'village society' mentality that still rules in Japanese companies. One reason for Yokohama City Office's standing-only conference room is because it discovered that city staff spent too much time there. According to its research, 200 conferences are held on average by City Office staff per day, with each conference averaging two hours 25 minutes. The situation has even led the City Office to publish a booklet on how to cut down on meetings, which suggests they should not last longer than one hour on average, and that briefing papers should be restricted to a maximum of three. Currently, says Sasaki, whenever something happens everyone meets to discuss it. There then has to be a more informal get-together, followed by drinks and so on. Unclear responsibilities. Multiple management layers in Japanese companies mean it is often difficult to know where responsibility for particular decisions lies. For example, the department head is usually responsible for the department's activities, but it is the divisional head who is actually involved in day-to-day issues. Ineffective use of office equipment. When a new machine is introduced in a factory, the whole production process is reviewed and work is re-arranged accordingly to raise productivity. But in the office, the wider use of PCs and copiers has not resulted in similar efficiencies. 'There is a need for office work engineering,' Sasaki says. Office automation has not been accompanied by a reorganisation of work patterns which would raise productivity. If anything, he says, the volume of paperwork has increased. While a return to better times may blunt current enthusiasm for productivity increases in the office, the labour shortages expected in Japan early next century mean companies may have to come up with solutions now. However, Sasaki does not expect a dramatic improvement in the foreseeable future. The government's policy is to maintain employment levels even if that means excess labour among companies. Government subsidies pay for the salaries of workers seconded to subsidiaries, those who are asked to stay at home for lack of work, or who need to be re-trained to do other work.</p>

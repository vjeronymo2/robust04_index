			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Leading Article: The German past MR ERICH Honecker, alive and apparently well enough to stand trial, is back in Berlin. Much German diplomacy has gone into getting him there, but it is fair to assume the German government is less than overjoyed by its success. Had Mr Honecker languished quietly in Moscow, he would have saved his countrymen a good deal of embarrassment. But are they his countrymen? That is part of the difficulty. Mr Honecker is accused of crimes committed when he was a senior official, and latterly head, of a separate East German state. He now finds himself, much against his will but by decision of the majority of east Germans, a citizen of the Federal Republic, under a government still composed almost entirely of west Germans. That government is preparing to prosecute him for breaking the law of the state which he at the time led, and which no longer exists. It will not be easy either legally or politically. Few Germans, east or west, can have forgotten the warm reception Chancellor Helmut Kohl gave Mr Honecker when the latter visited Bonn in 1987, and any that have will no doubt have their memory refreshed by television archive footage. Yet to leave Mr Honecker scot-free, after young border guards have been tried and sentenced for shooting would-be escapers to the west (which they did with his approval and authority, if not on his direct orders), is clearly impossible. Perhaps the border guards should not have been prosecuted, but that too would have been hard to explain to the families of those shot. In Germany of all countries, the fact that the guards were acting under orders could not be held to exonerate them, even if those orders came from the authorities of a then generally recognised state. Mr Honecker's fate is thus bound up with a much larger problem of 'overcoming the past' (vergangenheitsbewaltigung), which Germany shares with its post-communist neighbours, but which takes on a special character in Germany for two reasons. First, this is, so to speak, the second past that Germany has had to overcome. All discussion of purging or punishing the former communists and their collaborators inevitably reawakens the traumas of de-Nazification. Secondly, Germany differs from its eastern neighbours in that only part of it lived under communism. The anti-communist revolution in East Germany was rapidly overtaken and swallowed up by the process of reunification; and the issue of past versus present is inevitably intertwined with that of east versus west. Where Nazi crimes against humanity are concerned, even the UK has found it necessary to waive the statute of limitations in order to prosecute alleged criminals now found to be residing on its territory. Happily the communist regime in East Germany, inhuman as it was in many ways, did not engage in genocidal activities. That being so, there is a strong case for disposing of its legacy as quickly as possible. The priority, in Germany's own interest and that of its European partners, must be to bind and heal the wound. No doubt it is necessary that it first be cauterised, by a clear judicial process to establish where responsibility lies - a process which must be kept as far as possible separate from today's politics. Once that has been done, the emphasis should shift to national reconciliation, in which clemency will have its part to play.</p>

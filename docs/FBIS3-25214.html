			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Good evening. Negotiations to free the two Italian  aid workers held hostage by Somali bandits in a village some 80  km from Mogadishu will resume tomorrow. There is talk of a  ransom demand of $50,000. Achille D'Amelia reports.    [D'Amelia] The two Italian aid workers kidnapped in Somalia  remain in the hands of their captors, at least for tonight. The  elders of the village of Timare, where the men were kidnapped,  are giving assurances that all will be resolved upon the payment  of the $50,000 ransom. However, things may not necessarily turn  out that way. A ransom has not been paid in other cases, and  hostages have been released.    Italian Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Carmelo Azzara and  the diplomatic delegation that was visiting Somalia on another  mission related to the safety of the Italian contingent during  their withdrawal have ceased their other activities and have  said that they will remain here until the release of Sergio  Passadore and Gianfranco Stefani has been obtained. The  original mission has been suspended. The under secretary and  Ambassadors [Maurizio] Moreno and [Mario] Scialoja were  scheduled to go on to Nairobi, Addis Ababa, Asmara, Djibouti,  and Cairo. In fact, they were scheduled to meet General Aidid  in Nairobi.</p>

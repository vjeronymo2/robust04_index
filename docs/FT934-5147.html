			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Clarke targets tax perks - Mortgage interest relief and student grants in the forefront of chancellor's attacks Mr Kenneth Clarke targeted middle-class perks in his efforts to find more tax revenues, claiming that people could afford to do without them. And while most other allowances and tax rates were not changed the combined effects of Mr Clarke's measures and those already put in train by his predecessor Mr Norman Lamont mean that people with a personal allowance and a married couple's allowance will pay Pounds 61 more tax next year on earnings between Pounds 8,000 and Pounds 30,000 a year, and Pounds 319 above that. The decision to override indexation means that the same people will be Pounds 94 and Pounds 443 poorer respectively than if Mr Clarke had allowed tax bands and allowances to rise. Foremost of the attacks on perks was the much-predicted cut in relief on mortgage interest, which will go down to 15 per cent in 1995-96. Earlier this year Mr Lamont had already set in motion a cut from 25 per cent to 20 per cent next April. The ceiling on loans qualifying for relief remains at Pounds 30,000. Together, the two cuts will recoup nearly Pounds 1bn from homebuyers by 1995-96. This rapid stepping down from the 40 per cent level at which relief stood three years ago suggests that the government already has its sights on abolition. The cut means that a borrower with a mortgage of Pounds 30,000 or more will pay Pounds 10 a month extra tax from 1995-96, assuming interest rates remain unchanged. He will also have to pay Pounds 20 more a month for his mortgage. But Mr Clarke pointed out that the sharp fall in interest rates has already cut the cost of a mortgage - by Pounds 160 a month in the case of a Pounds 33,000 loan. Another target was the student grant. 'Tuition is free,' Mr Clarke said, 'but why should the bus driver or the pensioner also pay higher taxes to finance the living costs of tomorrow's lawyers?' So the shift from grants to loans for student maintenance, initiated in the mid-80s, is to be accelerated. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said last night that grants would be cut by 10 per cent in 1994-95 with a parallel increase in loans. Similar adjustments would be made over the next two years until, in 1996-97, loans and grants would be in broad balance. On income tax the chancellor left most of the key rates and allowances unchanged. But while this means no rise in income tax, the freezing of the tax bands and allowances rather than indexing them to inflation amounts to a hidden tax. With wages rising by about 3 per cent a year this will yield Pounds 550m next year and Pounds 1.55bn the year after. The chancellor is obliged by law to index allowances and tax rates, so yesterday's announcement will require parliament's approval. The three tax bands remain as before: 20 per cent, 25 per cent and 40 per cent. In his last Budget Mr Lamont had already foreshadowed a Pounds 500 increase in the 20 per cent band to raise it to Pounds 3,000 in 1994-95. Most of the allowances also stay the same rather than rising with inflation. The personal allowance, for example, stays at Pounds 3,445; if it had been indexed it would have gone up to Pounds 3,515.</p>

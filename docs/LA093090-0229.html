			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DELAYS TURN FINALE AT SAUGUS INTO AN ENDURANCE CONTEST  </P> <P> If patience really is a virtue, then there were 5,965 virtuous souls at Saugus  Speedway on Saturday night, where the first of the three much-awaited main  events of the 1990 Winston/Fall Spectacular was able to squeeze itself in just  before the 11 o'clock news.  </P> <P> Seemingly interminable delays in the B and C main events marred the season's  final night of racing, but the 50-lap Street Stock oval main event was able to  get into the books at a reasonable hour.  </P> <P> Reseda's Dave Blankenship, who finished a tight second to Simi Valley's Craig  Rayburn in the Street Stock points standings, started on the pole and led all  the way to capture the $1,000 purse. Al Meek of Simi Valley started second and  finished second. Ed Horst of Reseda was third.  </P> <P> The 100-lap Sportsman main event, which promised to be a wide-open race,  remained just that: a promise. The frequent use of yellow and red flags during  preliminary B and C main events delayed most of the night's action, with the  last race finishing after midnight.  </P> <P> In the Sportsman B main, John Watkinson of Canyon Country, Rusty Parr of  Newhall, John Cran of Reseda and Alton McBride of San Diego finished in the top  four places to advance to later main events.  </P> <P> Also in the Sportsman B main event, Larry Woodside of Saugus was injured when  his car was struck in Turn 4 of Lap 1. Woodside was able to leave his car under  his own power but appeared woozy. Race officials said that Woodside was  complaining of back pain.  </P> <P> The 25-lap B main for Street Stock figure-eight cars had some fireworks when  Jon Christensen of Lancaster and Mike Branam of Lakeview Terrace were involved  in a spectacular collision at the intersection.  </P> <P> Neither driver was hurt, although Christensen had to be restrained by officials  as he advanced toward Branam. Christensen gestured angrily at Branam before  both cars were removed from the track.  </P></p>

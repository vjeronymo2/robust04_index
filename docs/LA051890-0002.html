			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITION 111 PROS AND CONS AND ENDING TRAFFIC GRIDLOCK  </P> <P> After thinking about the gas tax hikes that are on the ballot, I have come to  the realization that it would be foolish to vote for them.  </P> <P> All you have to do is look at the ridiculous building on the Harbor Freeway.  </P> <P> With the money Caltrans is spending for the double-decking how many miles of  monorail could be built? They could even use the same right of way as they are  using now.  </P> <P> If car-pooling would work, we wouldn't need the double-decking. We also do not  need any more buses. They cannot and do not serve the people very well.  </P> <P> I think the people know that if state officials get their hands on any of the  money they will do as they darn well please, no matter what type of regulations  have been attached to the bill.  </P> <P> I always thought that all this talk was to get the cars off the road and get  mass transportation for the people to take them where they need and when they  need to go in a reasonable time and at a reasonable cost. But I guess this is  not to be.  </P> <P> HOMER L. CARLSON  </P> <P> Ontario  </P></p>

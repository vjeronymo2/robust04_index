			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIRLINES PICKED FOR NEW ROUTES TO JAPAN  </P> <P> An administrative law judge recommended Thursday that five U.S. airlines be  awarded direct routes to Japan from six U.S. cities.  </P> <P> The judge picked United, Delta, American, Continental and America West airlines  to fly the new routes in what is already a $6-billion annual aviation market  for the two countries.  </P> <P> Cities getting new flights would be Chicago; Los Angeles; San Jose; Portland,  Ore.; Seattle, and Honolulu.  </P> <P> The complex, 90-page recommendation followed applications by a dozen carriers  to serve various U.S.-Japan routes under a new international air agreement.  Transportation Department officials are expected to make a final decision on  the carriers and routes in November.  </P> <P> Judge John J. Mathias selected United Air Lines for Chicago-Tokyo and proposed  that two routes be awarded to Delta Air Lines: Los Angeles-Tokyo and  Portland-Nagoya. Other carriers and routes he recommended were American  Airlines for San Jose-Tokyo, Continental Airlines for Seattle-Nagoya, and  America West Airlines for Honolulu-Nagoya.  </P> <P> If approved, it would be the first Japanese route for America West.  </P> <P> The airlines that sought routes but got none were Hawaiian, Northwest, Pan  American and Trans World. Mathias also rejected applications that would have  added direct flights between Japan and St. Louis, Houston and the Hawaiian  island of Maui.  </P> <P> Mathias said his recommendations followed department guidelines for awarding  the routes and would enhance competition among airlines and cities to be  served.  </P></p>

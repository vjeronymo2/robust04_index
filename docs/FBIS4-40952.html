			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Leonid Nikitinskiy: "Zhirinovskiy's `No-Lose' </F> Case"]    [Text] On 15 June the State Duma chairman's office  received an official submission from the general prosecutor  requesting that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's immunity as deputy be  lifted in connection with the institution of criminal  proceedings against him.    We have learned that after Aleksey Kazannik instituted a  criminal case 26 January on the grounds that the book "Last Dash  to the South" incited war and whipped up interethnic strife, its  author -- V. Zhirinovskiy -- was questioned as a witness by an  investigator from the Main Military Prosecutor's Office. A  number of expert assessments of the case were made --  philosophical, psychological, and military-historical -- which  concluded that certain passages of the aforesaid work did indeed  contain indications of calls for war and the whipping up of  ethnic strife. The work done at the Prosecutor's Office, in the  opinion of Acting General Proseuctor A. Ilyushenko, makes it  possible to charge V. Zhirinovskiy under Articles 71 and 74 of  the Russian Federation Criminal Code. But, since he is a State  Duma deputy, this requires his consent.    Under Article 20 of the Law on the Status of Deputies, the  Duma should examine the General Prosecutor's Office submission  within one week and provide a reasoned response. The decision  to agree ("yes") or refuse ("no") to institute criminal  proceedings against Zhirinovskiy should be adopted under the  ordinary standing order regulations by a majority of all the  deputies.    Most of the various faction leaders and deputies polled by  this writer 15 June believe that the Duma will not hand  Zhirinovskiy over to the Prosecutor's Office, however odious he  may be. The submission will most probably not be backed by the  Communists, the agrarian faction, the Democratic Party of  Russia, or the "Women of Russia" -- not to mention  Zhirinovskiy's supporters themselves. They do not need to vote  against, they need only abstain or refuse to exercise their  vote. The majority of deputies from "Russia's Choice,"  "Yabloko," the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, and the "12  December Union" will vote in favor of the Prosecutor's Office  submission, cunningly aware that their votes will still not be  enough.    The only original answer that differed from the common model  was provided by Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, who believed that an  agreement could be reached with the left wing on "handing over"  Zhirinovskiy if the favor were to be repaid, for instance, with  a seat in the government. But nobody is likely to pay this  price for him -- moreover, such complex and convoluted ploys  need thorough preparation, whereas the General Prosecutor's  Office submission was sprung on the Duma.    The problem for the deputies lies first in setting a  precedent by stripping a colleague of his deputy's immunity --  given that, in the future, the Criminal Code will unfortuantely  smile not only on Zhirinovskiy and not only on this kind of  "ideological" crime. Second, if Zhirinovskiy loses his mandate  as deputy in any further development of this scenario, a  collapse will threaten not just the Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia -- his disappearance from the Duma (where, incidentally,  he has been quite quiet of late) is likely to destabilize the  equilibrium which has been achieved to a certain extent here and  to reshuffle the entire makeup of the corps of deputies (with  consequences which would be hard to predict).    If we made the rather unprobable but not altogether  impossible assumption that the majority of deputies would  nonetheless back Ilyushenko's submission, then the Main Military  Prosecutor's Office would have to continue its investigation,  interrogate Zhrinovskiy as the accused, and, if necessary, hold  confrontation interviews.    Once the investigation is over the indictment would be sent  to the court. Article 74 Part 1, which incriminates  Zhirinovskiy (incitement of ethnic strife), provides for a fine  and up to three years' imprisonment. Conversely, Article 71  (propagandizing war), which has hitherto never been actually  applied in practice, provides for between three and eight years'  imprisonment. But most probably (although we would once again  add the rider that such a turn of events is unlikely) the courts  would find a way to hand down a punishment that did not actually  involve incarceration.    In this event the subjugator of India would gain a criminal  record and the status of convict, but would not lose his  deputy's mandate, which would not be stripped automatically in  this event, but only after a new Duma decision. The Duma could  vote for the mandate to be retained even in the event of  Zhirinovskiy being sentenced to a punishment actually involving  incarceration (Article 4 of the Law on the Status of Deputies).  The considerations which will guide his colleagues in this  event are the same as in the case of stripping him of his  deputy's immunity.    But by following through the most extreme version of this  unfolding scenario, we are geting further away from the  genuinely likely outcome. Most probably, the criminal case  against Zhirinovskiy will be reliably obstructed at the first  stage -- that is, next week. And such a decision would  fundamentally suit everyone.    The Prosecutor's Office will do its formal duty, and Acting  General Prosecutor Ilyushenko will score another point in the  light of the likely resubmission to the Federation Council of  his candidacy for the post of general prosecutor; Zhirinovskiy  will get additional political publicity, without which he would  become reminiscent of a deflated and wrinkled child's balloon;  the Duma as a whole would retain the relatively balanced and  monolithic nature of its ranks; deputies standing on nationalist  positions would take great pride in having saved their soul  mate; the democratic factions would be able to accuse their  opponents of harboring instigators of war; and finally, the  president will be given a pretext to level the selfsame  accusation against parliament as a whole, a pretext which could  usefully be held in reserve. Generally speaking, no one could  lose.</p>

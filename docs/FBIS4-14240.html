			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jamal Salim and Tariq 'Abdallah] </F>   [Text] After 70 years, during which Muslims -- in what was  once called the Soviet Union -- suffered from persecution and  oppression under the yoke of the communist rule which imposed on  them the principles of atheism, the new Islamic republics have  shaken off the dust of humiliation and degradation and replaced  it with the light of Islam, of which the majority know nothing  other than the two testimonies. These republics are strenuously  trying to find a place for themselves on the world's map,  especially as they are being subjected to many cultures that are  alien to them, each of which is trying to attract them to its  ranks. Egypt started to help these republics get to know their  Islamic roots as soon as the Soviet Union collapsed.    Al-Azhar University President Dr. 'Abd-al-Fattah al-Shaykh  said that the number of students who came in 1990-91 for higher  studies reached 7,204, while 39,708 such students came to the  university during 1985-1992, and the overall number during the  scholastic year 1991-92 reached 8,118. He added that 250  scholarships had been given to the new Islamic countries and  there will be 250 this year. He said that the number of  scholarships will be increased in the coming years.    'AQIDATI has met with the following students:    Muhammad 'Ali Hakim Sharif from Tajikistan -- a fourth-year  student in the Islamic Research Institute. He said: A group of  Muslims from Tajikistan, including myself, have come to study in  Egypt at the expense of the Islamic Relief Organization. He  added: Muslims in our country suffer from weak religious  awareness and many of them know nothing about Islam other than  the two testimonies. This is why I have come to Egypt full of  determination to try to fill this vacuum, which is increasing  daily because the communists killed a large number of 'ulema and  shaykhs.    Muhammad Ahmad Qadi from Dagestan -- a second-year high  school student at the Islamic Research Institute. He said: We  Muslims in Dagestan are suffering from a struggle between the  remnants of the collapsed communism and the new light of Islam.  The population of Dagestan is three million, of whom 75 percent  are Muslims. Regrettably, though the president of the republic  is a Muslim he is also a communist. This is why we have  suffered from much persecution, including a ban on prayers and  on celebrating Muslim holy days. In these conditions, my father  played a big role by setting up a secret office for teaching the  Holy Koran and the Arabic language. Even though the 'ulema in  our country are very few in number there are conflicts among  them over trivial matters of jurisprudence. This is why we are  in dire need of more Muslim 'ulema from all over the world,  provided they are tolerant and well educated.    The child Qutb-al-Din Tabari from Tajikistan gave us  details of his visit to Egypt. He said: I came to Egypt to  learn the Arabic language and memorize the holy Koran.  Currently I am a student at the Ahmad Libi Elementary School in  Madinat al-Nasr. Praise be to God, I have succeeded in  memorizing five parts of the holy Koran. I am making diligent  efforts to memorize the entire book. I am doing well in my  Arabic lessons at the elementary institute. I will also attend  the Islamic Research Institute and afterward al-Azhar University.    Tabari added: When I go back to my country I will become an  Islamic preacher and I will explain the concepts and  fundamentals of Islam to my kinsfolk. I recall that when I  returned to Tajikistan, I urged my friends to visit Egypt and  learn Arabic and the fundamentals of Islam because al-Azhar is a  scientific institute where Islam is well taught.    Zaynatallah Habiballah from Tajikistan is still waiting for  the results of her exams at the Islamic Research Institute. She  said she will attend al-Azhar University. She added: I believe  that my education at al-Azhar is a mission that I must  accomplish well. I come from a Muslim family in Tajikistan who  perform the Islamic religious duties. My grandfather was an  ulema who was educated at al-Azhar.    'Abd-al-Qadir Amin from Eastern Turkmenistan is a first-year  student at the Shari'ah and Law School. He said: I came to  Egypt three years ago on a grant from al-Azhar. I am learning  the fundamentals of true Islam in order to propagate it in  Eastern Turkmenistan. No awareness of Islam exists there, even  though there are 25 million Muslims in Turkmenistan. Muslims  throughout the world are unaware of the situation in Eastern  Turkmenistan, where Islam is threatened with complete extinction  despite this huge population.    Ramadan Shunshula from Dagestan is a student at the Islamic  Research Institute. He said: The Muslims in Dagestan suffer  from the communist rule of the country despite the collapse of  communism. The Muslims are trying to regain their glories and  the fundamentals of their religion. Hence, I urge the Islamic  countries and organizations as well as all the Arab countries to  keep the Muslims in mind and promote Islamic awareness in our  country. Western missionaries are making intensive efforts to  dominate the mentalities of the Muslim people in Dagestan.  Muslims of the whole world should take responsibility for us.    Mustafa Tabari from Uzbekistan said: Our country is  currently witnessing a huge Islamic awakening due to its dire  need for Islam. Accordingly, many mosques, Islamic schools, and  religious institutes have been built since independence.  Furthermore, a Religious Affairs Ministry has been established  to supervise such activities. We look forward to the support of  the Islamic countries, particularly Egypt, in terms of the  religious education in our country. Tabari added: We learned  the Arabic language in the first year through our mixing with  the people and avid reading.    Ya'qub Bin-Khalduf is from the Tatar Republic. He is in the  second year of al-Azhar High School. He said that more  attention should be paid to non-Arabic-speaking students, adding  that these students should receive a one-year intensive courses  in the fundamentals and basics of the Arabic language, in  addition to the principles of Islam and its rulings regarding  purity, prayers, fasting, and alms. He added: The students  should take an exam at the end of the year, the results of which  will determine the student's educational stage at al-Azhar.    Muhammad Karim from Tajikistan had the following to say:  Our country is currently witnessing a power struggle between the  Communists and Islamists. Accordingly, religious activities  have so far been banned. The Islamic organizations must  increase the number of scholarships to overcome this ban and to  end the lack of awareness of the Islamic religion.    Ilyas Bin-Sulayman from Uzbekistan, a student at al-Azhar  High School, says that Islam in Uzbekistan. [sentence incomplete  as published]    Alluding to the problems facing them in obtaining  scholarships at al-Azhar, 'Abd-al-Halim Bin-Fadl al-Din from  Uzbekistan, who is at the al-Azhar Preparatory Institute, said:  Our main problem lies in insufficient knowledge of Arabic and  the lack of funds required for our travel to Egypt.    Firdaws Bin-'Abd-al-Hafiz from Uzbekistan said: I spent two  years at the al-Bukhari Islamic Institute in Samarkand. I  learned a certain amount of Arabic. I also learned the five  foundations of Islam. But this is not sufficient for a graduate  to propagate Islam in an affective and influential manner.  Therefore, we decided to attend al-Azhar in order to learn  Islam properly so we could carry out the propagation in our  country.    He added: Praise be to God, there are still good people in  the world. Shaykh Sa'ud 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Butayni from Kuwait  undertook to send 57 students from Uzbekistan to complete their  studies at al-Azhar at his own expense. Shaykh al-Butayni also  provided all the funds for the students' transportation and  tuition fees until the end of our studies at al-Azhar.    Anas Ya'qub from Tajikistan, a seventh grader at al-Azhar  School, said: I joined al-Azhar fully determined to learn the  true religion in order to convey my knowledge to my kinsfolk.  To a question about the most prominent ulema and scholars in  the Muslim world, Ya'qub said: I like to listen to Shaykh  al-Husari, Shaykh Mahmud 'Ali al-Banna, and Shaykh al-Hudhayfi.</p>

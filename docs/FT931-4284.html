			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (1): Why software is over-priced - Alan Cane examines the reasons why European software buyers are continuing to pay more than users in the US / European Viewpoint THAT the cost of computer hardware and software in Europe is high, perhaps exorbitantly so compared with the US, is not news. It is not even controversial; in free markets, suppliers are at liberty to charge whatever price they like and competition is presumed to act as the universal leveller. What is surprising is the seeming acquiescence of European customers who, knowing that the prices they are being charged are far higher than can be accounted for by distribution, insurance and the costs of doing business in Europe, pay up regardless. The US magazine Information Week has been at the forefront of a campaign to expose the cost differentials that exist. Research published in its December 1992 issue suggests that on average buyers in the UK pay about half as much again for their software as their US competitors; French computer users are the most exploited paying 1.8 times the US cost of a piece of software. So, for example, Lotus 1-2-3 selling for Dollars 495 in the US, costs Dollars 752 in the UK, Dollars 821 in Germany and Dollars 1006 in France. 'It is not just mass-market pc software' the magazine observed. 'Enterprise software, networking software, even Unix software such as the Informix relational database, are subject to the European premium'. Does it matter? The lack of any great public agitation about the issue would suggest computers users simply accept the differential as a fact of business life. The hard truth, however, that the European software market is dominated by US suppliers and that the position is unlikely to change much in the future. Customers who pay too much for their software are putting themselves at a disadvantage compared to their US competitors. There are three reasons. First, information technology is accepted as essential to efficient business but it may cost a company between one and five per cent of its revenues. Paying over the odds for software simply adds to the burden. Second, most companies both here and in the US have some way to go in learning how best to use their information technology (IT); if software costs are a barrier to software purchase, the company is giving up a place on learning curve it may find difficult to reclaim. It is a common complaint among hardware suppliers that 'intelligent' customers willing to make bold and imaginative use of IT are scarce in Europe; high software prices are no incentive for change. Third, highly priced software increases the temptation to illegally copy programs. This practice has been widespread in Europe in large and small companies. It is now being curbed thanks to the efforts of the Business Software Alliance which has resolutely pursued firms it suspects of cheating, taking court action where necessary to ensure compliance with the law. WHAT is a fair price in Europe for US software ? Whatever the market will bear, is the cynical response but most buyers and sellers agree the premium for doing business in Europe should be a surcharge of no more than 10 to 30 per cent of the US price. Social costs - salaries and benefits - for example, are higher in Europe than in the US. There are heavy costs associated with translating a product for each of Europe's diverse national markets which can be equivalent to the cost of developing a new package from scratch. And there are marketing and currency exchange costs to be reckoned with. There has been, nevertheless, tremendous growth in the packaged software market in the past year. The latest UK figures from the marketing consultancy Romtec suggests that 1992 sales for all packaged applications were 43 per cent up on 1991. Graphics led the way with 86 per cent growth over 1991, but established applications like word processing and spreadsheets are still showing growth rates of over 40 per cent. Some portion of this must be due to customers switching from DOS-based applications to Microsoft's Windows. Microsoft and Lotus have also stimulated the market by bundling together several of their most popular programs in suites selling for a large discount on the sum cost of the individual programs. Microsoft, for example, sells its Office suite for Pounds 575; the individual packages, Word, Excel and Powerplus, cost Pounds 395 each if sold separately. THERE are some sound reasons why European customers seem to be accepting the situation without a fight. In the first place, analyses like that carried out by Information Week tend to rely on suppliers' retail list prices. Street prices may be very different - perhaps as much as 30 per cent to 40 per cent below list. Second, larger customers have the muscle to strike advantageous deals with their suppliers - discounts for quantity, multiple-site licences and so on. Third, even smaller customers can strike worthwhile bargains by shopping around. The fact remains, nevertheless, that Europeans are paying too much for their software. The chief barrier to change seems to be that customers have few or no levers to exert pressure on suppliers. There are a number of self-interest groups like the Computer Users of Europe, established to lobby Brussels and the European Parliament on behalf of customers during a squabble over software protection last year which seemed to pose a threat to the open systems movement. It is well aware of the problem but so far is still considering what approaches would be most appropriate. The problem may be well on the way to solving itself. The accelerating pace of globalisation in the computer industry is already creating strong pressures for a convergence of prices world-wide. In this issue of Software at Work there are examples of companies including Rockwell Graphics and British Telecom which are sourcing their project management software globally. Companies of this size and market muscle will not be prepared to buy at different prices in different territories. For the moment, though, unless Europe's users can organise themselves to bring pressure to bear on suppliers, they will continue to pay over the odds for their software.</p>

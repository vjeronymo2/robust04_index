			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev,  Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others]    [Text] The detention of the CIA member Aldrich Ames and his  wife Maria on charges of spying in favor of Moscow is  Washington's internal affair, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister,  Sergey Lavrov, told Interfax on Thursday [24 February]. This is  his personal assessment of what happened, he noted.    "This is a problem for the Americans. They detained their  own citizen, a CIA member, and they must deal with him in  accordance with their own laws. Instead of it high-ranking U.S.  officials have said, before trial, that this incident may have  an impact on Russian-American relations. We do not quite  understand it," Lavrov said.    The U.S. secretary of state, Warren Christopher, has already  told Senate that he has no intention of commenting on events  that concern America's intelligence work, he noted. "He can  comment on other country's intelligence work, but not on that of  America. Following this logic I must refrain from commenting on  our activity, the more so as I do not see our activity in this  case. What I see is that they arrested their own man. But this  is their own problem. Let their court of law consider the  charges against Ames," Lavrov said.    He finds it hard to say why this incident "surfaced" right  now. "Judging by what U.S. officials say, they have been dealing  with this business for a long time. It's not quite clear why  they decided to sort it out right now. This was a step taken by  the American side, and we learned about it after the fact," the  diplomat said.    Lavrov was skeptical about the supposition that "the Ameses  case" is a kind of "retaliation" for Russia's political efforts  to resolve the crisis in Bosnia. "It's hard to imagine that the  Americans decided to "avenge themselves" on Russia in this way.  This would have been too petty," Lavrov said.    With reference to his Tuesday's meeting with the U.S.  ambassador to Moscow, Thomas Pickering, the diplomat said that  the ambassador had only handed him written information  concerning Washington's reaction to the Ameses incident. "We  accepted it and promised to study it in detail," Russia's deputy  foreign minister said.    It's essential to avoid "emotions and overdramatization" in  connection with the Ameses case, said the Director of the  Foreign Ministry's press and information department, Grigoriy  Karasin, at Thursday's briefing.    The Foreign Ministry received information concerning this  through "official channels", he said. "However there are many  serious questions that need to be analysed before making any  conclusions," Karasin noted.    According to him, this should be dealt with by professionals  from Russian and American secret services. "Contacts between  them are well established. The main thing is to settle the  incident without political or diplomatic complications and avoid  kindling passions," the spokesman for Russia's Foreign Ministry  said.</p>

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Mixed signs from trade and industry committee THERE IS good news and bad news for the government in the composition of the cross-party trade and industry committee of MPs which met yesterday to decide the terms of their inquiry into the coal industry. The good news is that the six Tories who make up the majority of the 11-strong committee include Sir Cranley Onslow, a former chairman of the 1922 committee of Tory MPs, who is likely to be a loyalist; and also Mr Keith Hampson, MP for Leeds north-west, who is still seen as a henchman of Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. Other committee members expect Mr Hampson to keep ministers in touch with the committee's work, and indeed, believe it will be helpful, given that the government's inquiry will be taking place at the same time. The bad news for the government is that the Tories also include Mr Michael Clark, the MP for Rochford in Essex who was one of the six Conservative MPs to vote against the government on Wednesday night. Formerly chairman of the all-party energy committee (which has been scrapped), he remains a trenchant and knowledgeable critic, who emphasises the need for investment in areas such as clean-coal technology, rather than simply spending money on redundancy payments. The Labour representation on the committee is in flux at present, with Mr Doug Hoyle and Mr Jim Cousins both about to leave for other parliamentary appointments. Mr Michael Clapham, MP for Barnsley West and Penistone, is set to join the committee. He is sponsored by the National Union of Mineworkers and several mines in his constituency have already closed. The other vacancy is likely to be filled by Mr Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman. Mr Richard Caborn, a former Labour frontbench spokesman, is the first opposition MP to chair this committee, and so is particularly keen to show fairness as well as rigour in his approach. Other Labour MPs are Mr Adam Ingram, who was parliamentary private secretary to Mr Neil Kinnock, and Mr Stan Orme, former chairman of the Labour MPs and opposition energy spokesman from 1983 to 1987. Although the committee is realistic enough not to expect all its recommendations to be approved by the government, its members are conscious that the public furore over the government's original plans for pit closures had given them an unusually influential position, and they will be keen not to miss the opportunity. The committee agreed yesterday to a wide investigation and set itself an ambitious deadline of completing the inquiry by mid December, so that the report can be prepared over the Christmas recess. Its terms of reference take in the consequences of British Coal's pits closure programme for the electricity consumer, the exchequer and the economy; and an examination of alternative energy policies. The first interrogation session will take place next Tuesday, when the MPs will question Mr Heseltine.</p>

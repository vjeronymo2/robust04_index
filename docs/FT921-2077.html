			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / TUC seeks mark of service quality THE Trades Union Congress will today launch a campaign calling for the introduction of a new Quality Work Assured servicemark to highlight the importance of good employment practices in public services. To be awarded the servicemark, an organisation would have to show that it was committed to 'a quality staff, providing a quality service in a quality work environment'. This would mean good practice in staff training and development, equal opportunities, 'decent pay and conditions', partnership and workforce consul-tation. The scheme also aims to improve investment in training and employee involvement in the public sector. It is an attempt to challenge government initiatives to improve service standards, such as compulsory competitive tendering and the Citizen's Charter. The TUC says these result in poor working conditions, low pay and unsatisfactory service. The servicemark would be based on the approach of quality assurance schemes such as those of the British Standards Institution. The plans will be discussed with experts in quality management from the public and private sectors at a seminar in London today. Contracting out has seriously damaged the quality of public services, according to a report published yesterday by the Public Services Privatisation Research Unit. The unit is funded by six unions representing employees in the public sector. The report says that 10 per cent of contracts in the NHS and local government are terminated early - often because of the contractors' financial problems. Quality Work Assured. TUC, Congress House, Great Russell Street, London WC1B 3LS. Free. Privatisation. PSPRU, 20 Grand Depot Road, London SE18 6SF. Pounds 50 for private-sector bodies; Pounds 10 for public bodies.</p>

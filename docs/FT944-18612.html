			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: No pact in Mauritius Sir, I was proud that Mauritius should emerge with such warm approval from the pages of your newspaper (Survey, September 27). The achievements of the Mauritian people since independence are such that the nation can be justly proud of them. It is generally the lot of a small country (as the recent experience of Haiti shows) only to come to international attention after natural disasters or political strife. But the success of Mauritius is underpinned by its people's belief in democracy and law. It is the patient achievement of countless thousands of Mauritians, often in spite of official discouragement. This success has not been created in 10 years and cannot be claimed exclusively by the present government or its prime minister. Moreover, as your correspondents remark, underlying this improvement is a serious and growing concern. For although the Mauritian people have not lost faith in democracy, it is widely believed - from numerous instances - that the government of Mauritius has. At the last election in 1991, I called publicly for international observers because I believed then that electoral malpractices were bound to occur. The prime minister refused this request. I and others have renewed that call because the dangers we perceived have not diminished. The prime minister has recently announced, after strong pressure, some changes in the electoral procedure which would help to safeguard its integrity. We do not believe that is enough. Public confidence in the transparency of elections must be fully preserved if improvements which your correspondents found on their recent visit are to be maintained. Finally, may I take this opportunity of stating that, contrary to what your survey states, no pact between me and the prime minister, whereby the prime minister would remain in office for several years, has been agreed, nor would any such agreement be acceptable to me, the party I lead, or the vast majority of the Mauritian people. Navin Ramgoolam, leader of the opposition, 85 Sir S Ramgoolam St, Port-Louise, Mauritius</p>

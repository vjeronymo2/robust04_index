			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Natalya Pachegina in the "Diplomacy" column: </F> "'Balkanization' of North Caucasus Is Not Beneficial to the  Russian Federation, and the Foreign Affairs Ministry Hastens To  Announce This on the Eve of Yeltsin's Visit to Georgia"]    [Text] Anticipating possible suspicions about the "true"  aims of Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin's visit to  Georgia scheduled for 3 and 4 February (some see the warming of  Georgian-Russian relations as a "military-political alliance;"  others, a recurrence of Russia's imperial ambitions), on 31  January Russian Federation Foreign Affairs Minister Andrey  Kozyrev met with leaders of the North Caucasian republics,  apparently disarming them immediately with an announcement about  the existence of a certain Russian strategic line in the  Caucasus. Its contours, the minister did not neglect to note,  are formed "on the basis of carefully weighed balance of state  and regional interests." In proposing to the dispassionate  presidents a "state view" on the future of Russian-Georgian  relations (as is known, at the Federation Council session on the  same day they opposed the signing of a full-scale treaty with  Georgia, including the definition of the status of Abkhazia and  South Ossetia), the minister observed that Russia, as well as  the integrated and economically prosperous Georgia, need  certainty on matters of protecting their external borders and  also on prospects for the disposition of Russian troops on the  republic's territory. Assuring those present that the treaty  between Russia and Georgia will become a stabilizing factor in  the life of the region, Andrey Kozyrev pointed to its direct  link with a political settlement in Abkhazia and South Ossetia  where Russia still does not abandon "the difficult but noble"  mission of peacemaker. Kozyrev stressed that it is wrong to see  in Russia's peacemaking efforts in the Caucasus "the  Zhirinovskiy factor," something being speculated on both within  the country and abroad.    Russia's position on Abkhazia's political future, the  foreign  policy department head said, is unchanging: While supporting  the thesis of Georgia's territorial integrity, the Russian  leadership is ready to assist the elaboration of such a status  for Abkhazia that would take into account the interests of its  multi-ethnic population. In this light the legitimacy of the  referendum in Abkhazia on the future political structure is,  according to the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry, directly  related to the settlement of the refugee problem. Rejecting  suggestions about the Russian leadership's sympathies toward  Tbilisi, the minister made it clear that the sanctions used by  Russia against the Abkhaz population had nonetheless been  correctly understood and appreciated by the Sukhumi leaders.  The latter are invited (for their own well-being) to  "realistically sum up the situation, display flexibility, and  work toward a compromise."    In the course of the president's visit Moscow also hopes for  success in a South Ossetian settlement, where, it believes, the  thesis about Georgia's territorial integrity must remain  unchallenged. In addition to recommendations about inviting the  South Ossetian leadership to participate in working out  Georgia's new constitution, Tbilisi, as Kozyrev promises, will  also be encouraged to deal with the issue of the Ossetian  refugees, whose return to Georgia would be conducive to  resolving the essentially Russian Ossetian-Ingush conflict.  During the visit to Georgia, the minister assured, the question  about the position of Russians in the republic -- pensioners,  war veterans, and former Soviet Army servicemen -- is also bound  to come up. And although the official position by the Georgian  leadership with respect to the Russian- speaking minority does  not arouse Moscow's concern, Moscow cannot but note that in the  last two years 150,000 citizens have moved to Russia.    Concluding the meeting, Kozyrev stressed that the Foreign  Affairs Ministry's Department on Liaison with the Federation  Components, Parliament, and Public and Political Organizations  seeks to expand cooperation between the Russian regions and the  neighboring countries, while the leaders of the North Caucasus  republics, who are expected to display understanding of the  statewide importance of the upcoming visit to Georgia, are free  to join this process.    As NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent has learned, the  reaction by the North Caucasus republics' leaders to Kozyrev's  report has not been enthusiastic, to put it mildly. By general  admission, one of the "guests" at the house on Smolenskaya  Square confided, a treaty with Georgia is untimely. The  unfavorable situation in Tbilisi, leaders of the Russian  Federation components think, in contrast to the Russian foreign  minister, is not yet cause for Russia's tutelage of Georgia.  The opinion of the Federation Council, as articulated by Aslan  Dzharimov and Akhsarbek Galazov, presidents of the Republic of  Adygeya and North Ossetia; and Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of  the State Duma's Committee on CIS Affairs, will apparently  create certain difficulties in ratifying the draft treaty  prepared for the visit.</p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIOLENCE INVOLVING DEPUTIES  </P> <P> On May 23, 1989, I filed a police report with the Marina del Rey sheriff's  station.  </P> <P> The two young deputies who came to my home to take the report were so kind,  considerate of my grief and pain, that weeks later I sent a letter of thanks to  Block. Since then I have been working closely with a sergeant in the fraud and  forgery division. This gentleman has been helpful way above the call of duty.  </P> <P> I am sure that all of us abhor unnecessary violence. But until we "walk in  another man's shoes" can we be sure that we know both sides of the story?  </P> <P> MARIAN K. TANAKA  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Jubilation in Serbia as UN lifts some sanctions Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic is a happy man. The UN decision to suspend some sanctions against his country has absolved him from the status of international pariah, and it may also have cleared the way for a final showdown with his erstwhile proteges, the Bosnian Serbs. The 100-day moratorium on some of the UN's punitive measures does not mean that life will improve quickly for the ordinary Serbs, yet the jubilation in official circles is unmistakeable. Belgrade's closely guided press proclaimed yesterday that 'the world has changed its mind about Yugoslavia.' 'The blockade has broken,' read a headline in Vecernje Novosti, the biggest circulation daily. The immediate effect of the UN decision is to suspend the bans on direct flights, sporting and cultural exchanges with Serbia and Montenegro, the two remaining constituents of the Yugoslav federation. The UN move was approved as part of a twin strategy of tightening pressure on the Bosnian Serbs and rewarding Serbia for its apparent severance of links with its Bosnian cousins. In practice, few Serbs can afford air tickets, and formal culture virtually collapsed with the old Yugoslav state. As for sport, Yugoslavia is probably too late for the European football championship. The most draconian sanctions - including the freezing of foreign bank accounts - remain in force, and the entire set of punitive measures could be reimposed if Yugoslavia openly resumes supplies to the Bosnian Serbs. But the optimism in Belgrade reflects a feeling that in practice, the sanctions regime will be very difficult to reconstruct once the international community has started to dismantle it. Russia is impatient for commercial links with Yugoslavia, as soon as the opportunity arises. The Yugoslav national carrier JAT expects the first direct flights to link Belgrade to Russia and then Greece - both staunch friends of Serbia. Within weeks, there could be air links with a host of European cities. The lifting of sanctions was bitterly opposed by the Bosnian government, which insists that Serbia is still supplying Bosnian Serbs.</p>

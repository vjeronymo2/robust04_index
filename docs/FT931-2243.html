			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Travel Focus - Golfing Holidays: Florida's fun, in rain or sun THE RAIN smashed against the windscreen. It was hard to see beyond the end of the bonnet, so I stopped searching for the golf club and returned to my hotel. You get used to that in Florida in late summer. Torrential rain falls almost every afternoon and is followed within minutes by the sun. Soon the ground is steaming. I was in the north-east, the Palm Coast-Daytona Beach area. The Palm Coast, two hours' drive north of Orlando, is a parcel of land the size of greater London where ITT is building a community of 20,000 homes. It has tennis, riding, biking, any water-borne sport and five golf courses. I was there for golf. I had mentioned to David Leadbetter, the well-known coach, that I was going golfing in north-east Florida and he urged me to play Hammock Dunes. The name had a ring to it. 'It's great,' said Leadbetter, so to play Hammock Dunes became a primary objective. I started, however, at Cypress Knoll, 25 minutes' drive from the Sheraton (Palm Coast) Resort where I was staying. Cypress Knoll, carved out of swampland, was designed by Gary Player. It has such narrow fairways that I nearly went an entire round without using my driver, something I have never done in 40 years of playing golf. My frustration was offset by the beauty of the surroundings. A heron swooped down in front of one tee. A swallow-tail butterfly fluttered past another. There were water moccasins everywhere and, apparently, an 8ft diamond-back rattlesnake. Next morning I left the Palm Coast and drove south to Daytona Beach. Indigo Lakes is semi-private, which means it is open to anyone for a few thousand dollars in membership. Accuracy was demanded but not as much as at Cypress Knoll. The fairways are generous and some of the greens enormous. Then it was the turn of Cypress Head, another semi-private course, designed by Arthur Hills in Port Orange, just south of Daytona. Because the water table is so close to the surface in Florida, any earth that is moved to dig a bunker or sculpt a mound reveals water - the dominant feature on most of Florida's courses. Not so at Cypress Head. It has holes like those at some of Britain's famous inland courses. Thickets containing oaks, pampas grass, willows, thistle and wax myrtle had to be skirted or driven over and although there was water on many holes, it was neither intrusive nor overpowering. I could play Cypress Head again and again. Good news awaited me at my motel. I had a starting time at Hammock Dunes the next morning. I celebrated with a swim in the Atlantic. Although it was late afternoon the sand on Daytona's 24-mile-long beach was hot underfoot. Hammock Dunes is an ultra-private new club on the Palm Coast. It had only 112 members last August, one per acre. What sticks in my mind is not the excellent condition of the course or the number of challenging holes. Instead, I was struck by the attention to detail on the practice ground. I went to limber up and found a pile of balls laid in such a way that must have taken several minutes to do. It was the same at all of the 15 positions on the practice ground. Nor is it all golf. Within 60 miles are Disneyland, the Epcot space centre and Universal Studios. This somewhat unsung part of Florida represents a realistic alternative to Spain and Portugal for a spring or autumn golfing holiday. John Hopkins was a guest of British Airways Holidays and Destination Daytona.

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Arts: Blockbusters, and Buckingham Palace - What people really wanted to go and see during the year What did people want to see in 1993? It was the year when the masses stormed into the Long Gallery of Buckingham Palace. In two months, 377,000 visitors trod reverently along the red temporary carpets. Some people went to see the art and a lot of people bought ties. This happy experiment, long overdue, will be repeated next summer. It should become a permanent feature of a London August. This was the year when cultural one-upmanship meant saying smugly 'Actually, I saw it in New York . . .' or, 'I saw it in Washington.' Matisse and the Barnes Collection were the titans among the international blockbusters, giving pleasure to millions and handsomely repaying their investment. Matisse at the Pompidou Centre in Paris attracted 743,000 visitors. It was not far off double the number (410,00) who went to the Grand Palais for the vast and dazzling exhibition of paintings from Renaissance Venice, The Century of Titian. The Pompidou show needed a lot of fortitude. By ducking and weaving it was possible at least to clap eyes on most paintings. Even so, I wonder how many people share my feeling that it would be more accurate to say one experienced the Matisse show than actually saw Matisse. Comfortably outstripping Matisse already is the exhibition which, if the late Dr Edward C. Barnes had had his way, would never have been thrust onto on the world's stage; Impressionist and Post-Impressionist masterpieces from the Barnes Collection at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris until January 2. The number of visitors is estimated to stand at over one million. Yet I confess to feeling only slightly wistful not to be one of the million who has 'seen the Barnes'. My far keener regrets are for missing Jacopo Bassano (Kimbell, Fort Worth/Bassano del Grappa), Judith Leyster (Haarlem/Worcester Art Museum), and above all Ribera's suffering saints and philosophers (Metropolitan, New York). Those are chances which will not recur whereas, being rational for a minute, what has one missed with a loan selected from a permanent exhibition? In Paris, moreover, the Barnes exhibition was adulterated with pictures from the Orsay's collection. So the real experience still awaits us, the Barnes Foundation at Merion in Philadelphia. This is by all accounts one of the most idiosyncratic and absorbing collections of paintings of the century - always assuming that its trustees yet again thwart the wishes of Dr Barnes by re-hanging the collection. At the Royal Academy in London, the most successful exhibitions were Pisarro (195,700 visitors) the Great Age of British Watercolours (208,887), and American Art. This last, despite being soused with critics' bile, drew close to 200,000. One exceptional show which might have seemed rather difficult, Wisdom and Compassion; Sacred Art of Tibet, had 147,000 visitors, more than Sickert (136,000) and not far off the National Gallery's biggest success, Edvard Munch (162,000). This was the first year that I recall major exhibitions having muzak. There was Russian chant at Gates of Mystery at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and maddening trumpets at Canaletto in England at Birmingham. However, it seems horribly likely that muzak will become more common as museums look for a wider, younger public. Just about every other human activity is now done while listening to music, so why not looking at paintings? Happily, 1993 also brought the day closer when if you do not like the music, you do not need to go. In September, Microsoft 'delivered London's National Gallery to the Desktop'. A CD-Rom allows art-lovers to 'search, browse, and navigate' the gallery's 2,000 paintings. It gives an animated lesson in perspective, and takes you on guided tours of the galleries, and teaches you how to pronounce artists' names. Give it a decade, and the world's greatest museums, palaces, cathedrals, even the blockbuster shows, will be accessible without getting off the sofa.</p>

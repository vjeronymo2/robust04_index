By retaining water or rainfall storage, the survival rate of  trees in semi-arid areas has been raised to about 90 percent  from 30 percent.    The new method, developed by researchers from Beijing  Forestry University after five years' study, consists of  collecting and storage of rainfall and maintaining soil  moisture, is able to double or even triple the water available  for trees in arid or semi-arid areas.    Arid and semi-arid land accounts for 52.5 percent of China's  total territory, and the average tree survival rates were four  percent and 30 percent in arid and semi-arid areas respectively.</p>

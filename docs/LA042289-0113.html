			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAPSULE REVIEWS OF AFI FILM FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Following are capsule reviews of a selection of the screenings today and Sunday  at the American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the  Cineplex Odeon Cenutry Plaza Cinemas.  </P> <P> SATURDAY  </P> <P> 'Never on Tuesday'  </P> <P> United States, 1989, 89 minutes  </P> <P> 11:10 p.m.  </P> <P>  A funny, slick technical exercise, with an all-star Brat Pack guest cast,  about two girl-crazy teen-agers who crash into a beautiful young model's car in  the desert. When the model turns out to be a Manhattan-bound lesbian, feminism  and male hormones are put to a severe test. The most impressive thing about  writer-director Adam Rifkin is his age: At 20, he's got a good handle on many  of the pop-movie skills and tricks that would-be sellouts struggle for at 40.  If he comes on here a bit too much like imitation Robert Zemeckis, salted with  Ron Howard and John Hughes, at least he has lots of time to grow and develop.  MICHAEL WILMINGTON  </P></p>

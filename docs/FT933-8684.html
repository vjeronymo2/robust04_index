			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Perilous problems of EC capital controls: The hunt for ERM scapegoats IN THE hunt for scapegoats for the ERM debacle, foreign exchange dealers present tempting targets. In recent days, ministers in France and Belgium have called for tighter curbs on international currency to curb the power of the 'financial speculators'. These calls enjoy wider support on the Continent than might be imagined. Only last year, Ireland, Portugal and later Spain all imposed temporary exchange controls to protect their embattled currencies. Some EC member states made similar noises at the emergency EC finance ministers' meeting in Brussels on August 2 which led to the de facto suspension of the ERM, according to a senior monetary source. But the political and financial costs of introducing anything which could be interpreted as the re-imposition of capital controls look prohibitive. Such moves would split the EC into a free-trade camp led by the UK, Germany and the Netherlands and a more dirigiste-minded rump, and would be a severe blow to the single market. As one senior European finance official said this week: 'It would mean destroying the present currency market, and that is why I think it is inconceivable. Yet I can imagine that it will be proposed. There would be accusations that we are building not only a trade fortress but a monetary fortress too.' EC finance ministers will debate various options at a meeting in Brussels on September 13. Their preference will be for a Community approach rather than allowing 'wild-cat' operations by individual member states. One option likely to be discussed is temporary curbs on overall capital movements of the kind which existed in the UK up to 1979 and which were still in force in many European countries until the mid-1980s. Under Article 3 of the EC directive providing for the free movement of capital, member states can impose 'protective measures' for up to 180 days to deal with adverse currency movements affecting their exchange rate and monetary policies, subject to approval by the European Commission and opinions of the EC's monetary committee and EC Central Bank governors. Spain, Ireland, and Portugal all invoked this clause last year, and won retrospective endorsement from the Commission. This made it difficult for individuals or banks to borrow a currency quickly in the hope of selling it in currency markets. Similar 'safeguard' measures to defend national currencies exist under Article 73 of the Maastricht treaty. The drawback is that the country which re-imposed such controls would face a heavy financial burden, because it would unwind the heavy international investment in European bond and equity markets that has accompanied the single market programme. Spanish equity market prices fell sharply after the government's imposed temporary controls to defend the peseta. Some economists have pointed out that it would be extraordinary for France to re-impose such controls at a time when it is privatising some of its biggest state enterprises through stock market flotations. Alternatively, a government could tax the foreign exchange profits of the main commercial banks operating within its borders. But in the global 24-hour market, banks could easily respond by shifting operations offshore. A tax on the profits of commercial banks might not hit the currency speculators, either. In the recent ERM crises, the principal movers of capital have been hedge funds based in New York and pension funds all over the world who own international assets. Commercial bank dealers could argue that their main role is as intermediaries between the main players. However, one leading figure in the London foreign exchange market suggested yesterday that France could consider legislation that would force commercial banks on its territory to lodge funds with the central bank in amounts that match their lending to overseas parties. In recent ERM crises, the method by which international speculators have operated has been to borrow francs from French banks in huge quantities, sell the currency and then buy it back at a cheaper exchange rate. If commercial banks had to lodge a sum with the central bank that was equivalent to their overseas lendings, they would in effect lose any interest premium on the loan. This method of controlling speculation was used by the Bank of England in the 1970s under the 'corset' scheme and in Germany in the so-called Bar-Depot scheme. 'It would be hard to implement, and would probably need all the OECD countries acting together,' said the London banker. 'But I would not be surprised if the Bank of France were considering such a move this week.'</p>

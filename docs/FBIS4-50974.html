			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Xie Zuan (6200 9449): </F> "China's Export Is Troubled by Antidumping Policies"]    [Text] China's economy has developed rapidly in the 1990's  and currently ranks side by side with the world's major trading  nations. In 1993, China's foreign trade reached $195.7 billion.  However, while China's economy and trade are striving to move  toward and converge with the outside world, it is troubled by  the antidumping policies of foreign countries. Hong Kong's  economy is closely linked with that of mainland China and  inevitably feels the impact of antidumping moves. Concerned  quarters are urging the mainland and Hong Kong to advance or  retreat together and join hands to deal with this issue.    According to reports from Beijing, Li Lanqing, vice premier  of the State Council of China, pointed out a few days ago: The  antidumping issue has an important bearing on China's export,  and, if it is not properly handled, there will be the danger of  complete collapse.    In fact, China has been accused by foreign countries of  dumping an accumulated total of more than 150 kinds of export  products and has been forced to pay antidumping taxes on them.  Last year alone, China was accused of dumping goods in nearly  100 cases, which directly involved over $30 billion of its  export volume, constituting a considerable threat to China's  exports.    On 14 April last year, the Mexican Secretary of Commerce and  Industrial Development announced at a press conference that  Mexico would conduct an antidumping investigation into more than  4,000 types of products under 10 categories from China and, at  the same time, would increase antidumping taxes by a large  margin. To date, this is the world's biggest antidumping case.    If things continue in this vein, the concerned official  pointed out, the normal development of China's exports will  certainly be adversely affected. Even if China is able to  restore its status as a signatory state to the General Agreement  on Trade and Tariffs in the future, the advantages it derives  will be offset.    Therefore, economic and trade circles from the mainland and  Hong Kong have repeatedly called for fighting antidumping  accusations. Various quarters have attached importance and have  responded to this call. It has been revealed that China will  formulate various measures to deal with antidumping accusations  and has demanded that the problem be thoroughly solved.    These measures include stepping up the formulation of an  antidumping law so that there can be guiding principles for  antidumping work. At the same time, China will strengthen the  position and role of commercial import and export chambers and  will authorize these chambers "to be responsible for organizing  and coordinating antidumping accusation defense work" and to  manage and coordinate the work of various trades. In addition,  China will strengthen the management and control of sensitive  export commodities.    At the same time, China will, by inviting tenders for export  quotas, levy export tariffs, implement measures such as  temporary active quotas, and exercise quantitative control over  some export products.    China will set up an antidumping defense foundation to take  a  stand against antidumping accusations. China will also  energetically train antidumping personnel to cope with a large  amount of antidumping defense work abroad and investigation on  import commodities.    The Ministry of Trade and Economic Cooperation will hold an  antidumping forum with the United States and the EC this year.  China will also maintain close ties with Hong Kong's commercial  circles in order to jointly do a good job in antidumping work  and to facilitate the smooth development of foreign trade.</p>

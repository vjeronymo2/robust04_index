			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 26 KYODO -- The primary strategist of  the ruling coalition, Ichiro Ozawa, on Sunday [26 June] denied  the possibility that Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will return to  power.    "A result that derails common sense is not to be expected,"  Ozawa told reporters.    Hata and his cabinet ministers resigned en masse Saturday  prior to a possible defeat in a no-confidence vote against his  cabinet tabled by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the  largest opposition party.    Earlier Sunday, another key coalition figure Yuichi  Ichikawa,  secretary general of Komeito [Clean Government Party], also said  "I don't think Mr. Hata will become prime minister again and he  himself probably thinks similarly."    Ozawa said it would be natural to extend the term of the  current 150-day regular Diet session, which closes on Wednesday,  if the Diet fails to nominate a new prime minister.    Ozawa, secretary general of Hata's Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party], also urged the LDP and the Social Democratic Party  (SDP), the No. 2 opposition bloc, to offer their own vision of a  new government to succeed Hata's minority coalition  administration.    "Both the LDP and the SDP should put to the people their  blueprints for establishing the next government because it is  they who pressed the Hata cabinet to resign... We will wait for  those blueprints," Ozawa said.    Ozawa said the resignation of Hata and his cabinet was not  intended to meet the SDP's demand that the cabinet resign  voluntarily as a prerequisite for its rejoining the coalition.</p>

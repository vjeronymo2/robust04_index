			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Waddington advances 16% to Pounds 9m PROFIT RISES in its packaging and games divisions offset a fall in the printing side at John Waddington and led to a 16 per cent pre-tax increase from Pounds 7.76m to Pounds 9.01m in the 26 weeks to October 2. Although the advance was broadly in line with expectations, the shares slipped 12p to 245p, affected by the mixed nature of the results. In the packaging division, overall operating profits rose to Pounds 6.1m (Pounds 5.68m) on turnover up at Pounds 74.9m (Pounds 61.7m). Within the plastic packaging side, the US food services business performed well, lifting operating profits by Pounds 1m to Pounds 2.7m on turnover up at Pounds 23.5m (Pounds 13m). Carthage Cup Company, bought in May for Dollars 5.4m (Pounds 3.57m), chipped in profits of Pounds 400,000 on sales of Pounds 4.6m. Mr Geoff Gibson, finance director, said Carthage added a more downmarket range to the existing portfolio. There had been a 25 per cent increase in volumes in the US to meet demand, but the price had been a certain lack of efficiency. On the food and drinks side, profits slipped to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 1.5m) on turnover of Pounds 22.9m (Pounds 21.2m). Within paper and board packaging, cartons raised profits 17 per cent to Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 1.8m) on turnover up at Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 15.2m). However, the labels business increased its losses to Pounds 800,000 (Pounds 300,000) on turnover flat at Pounds 6.8m. Mr Gibson said that although the lost Heinz contract had been replaced with new business, albeit at lower margins, there had been problems with self-adhesive labels. Mr Martin Buckley, group chief executive, said he was 'disappointed' with the specialist printing division, where profits shrank to Pounds 1.52m (Pounds 2.33m) on sales of Pounds 25m (Pounds 23.6m). The decommissioning of a press at Chorleys, the confidential printer, had led to a one-off dent in profits, though higher margin work has been possible since. The recession on the Continent had hit the continuous stationery side. The cash-generating games division lifted profits to Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 2m) on turnover down Pounds 500,000 at Pounds 11.9m. 'Essentially a marketing business', according to Mr Buckley, it is now moving into the toys side with a distribution deal for radio-controlled toys. About a third of Waddington's business is in the US where it is seeking acquisitions - 'the multiples expected are more reasonable', said Mr Gibson. Group turnover climbed to Pounds 118.2m (Pounds 108m) and operating profits to Pounds 9.83m (Pounds 9.48m). The interim dividend is raised to 3.8p (3.6p) payable from earnings of 8.13p (7p) per share.</p>

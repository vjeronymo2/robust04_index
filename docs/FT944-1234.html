			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Options ameliorate Hoerner pay cut Mr John Hoerner, chief executive of Burton Group, saw his salary fall from Pounds 739,000 to Pounds 597,000 last year, according to the retailer's annual report, writes Neil Buckley. He may not be too downhearted, however. At yesterday's share price of 68p, he is sitting on a paper profit of more than Pounds 950,000 on share options which become exercisable before the end of June. In the year to September 3, Mr Hoerner's basic salary and taxable benefits fell from Pounds 453,000 to Pounds 422,000. The company said this was due to a reduction in taxable benefits to come into line with corporate governance guidelines - which involved Mr Hoerner giving up one of his two company cars. Mr Hoerner's performance-related bonus also fell, from Pounds 171,000 to Pounds 60,000, as pre-tax profit - although ahead from Pounds 16.3m to Pounds 41.1m - did not perform as well against targets set by the remuneration committee as in the previous year. His pension contribution was unchanged at Pounds 115,000. Mr Richard North, former finance director who joined Bass after leaving Burton in July, earned between Pounds 555,000 and Pounds 560,000, including a special bonus of Pounds 263,000 - equivalent to one year's salary - for 'securing the group's financial stability'.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD;  </P> <P> ISRAEL: TV IS UNSPARING IN ITS MESSAGE: THE OCCUPYING FORCES ARE THE FORCES OF  PERSECUTION.  </P> <P> Avi Pazner, turn on your TV.  </P> <P> Watch a replay of the news videos we saw just the other night, on networks  broadcasting across the United States and around the world. We saw three  scenes:  </P> <P> Israeli soldiers firing guns at boys who had been throwing rocks at them; an  Israeli soldier dragging a woman in a shocking pink blouse down a street as she  cried out in resistance, and we saw you.  </P> <P> There you were, Avi Pazner, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak  Shamir. You were speaking for the nation many of us were taught in synagogues  to pray for and sing praises to as the land of milk and honey and truth and  justice -- the long-sought home for a long-persecuted people.  </P> <P> We watched as you said: "Israel is acting with utmost restraint."  </P> <P> We watched and listened, but, sadly, our eyes told us we could not believe what  we heard. You understand the position we are in, Avi, because from 1974 to 1981  you were based in Washington as the Israeli Embassy's press counselor and you  saw the events in the Middle East as we did -- on TV. You saw how powerful  pictures tell powerful truths and influence powerful policy-makers. It's that  way all around the world now, as the Cable News Network spreads a visual gospel  more believable than the most carefully crafted words of the most ingenuous  government spokesman.  </P> <P> For decades, most people strongly supported Israel in its fight for survival,  because they knew that Israel's cause was just.  </P> <P> Today, Israel's cause remains just. But the eyes of the world are seeing a  different story from the one you are telling, Avi Pazner. They are seeing news  videos from Israel, night after night, that show clearly that the leaders of  this land of truth and justice no longer speak truth, no longer cherish  justice.  </P> <P> It used to be, when you were based here, Avi, that television news brought home  to us the horrors caused by Palestinian terrorists who attacked and killed  Israeli women and children and busloads of tourists, and so on.  </P> <P> Now it's Israelis who are doing the killing. And now the TV cameras are not  just getting there in time to show the carnage, as used to happen in those  hit-and-run terrorist attacks by Palestinians. Today, TV news is showing us the  killers as they kill. To our horror, the killers are Israeli soldiers,  occupying forces on the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> The essential truth Israel's right wing Likud Party leaders never understood is  this: Occupying forces will always be seen as persecuting forces. That's true  whether the occupying forces are storm troopers who are inherently evil or  refugees from persecution who are inherently good.  </P> <P> So the policy of the Israeli government cannot succeed if it is the policy of  an occupying force, trying to strong-arm peace on to conquered Palestinian  people. Policy toward Israel is changing daily -- in Washington, at the United  Nations and in capitals around the world.  </P> <P> Israel alone has it in its power to end this sad, downward spiral. Put away the  guns and end the occupation. Talk peace -- unconditionally -- and do it now.  </P> <P> So, turn on your TV, Avi Pazner, and you will see that Israel has lost the war  of the global television news. Think about that, Avi, and you'll see that you  must tell the boss that it's come to this: Israel, alone, can act now to win  the peace. Or Israel may end up standing alone.  </P></p>

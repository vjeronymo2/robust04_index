			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA emphasizes that the record is not being reopened on any of the delayed provisions of &sect;1910.269. Revised &sect;1910.137 and &sect;1910.269 are final rules, and the Agency is not considering the modification of any of these requirements. Additionally, &sect;1910.137 and all paragraphs of &sect;1910.269 other than paragraph (a)(2), which becomes effective on January 31, 1995, went into effect on May 31, 1994, as scheduled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 1910_[AMENDED] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth above, the following Note is added to &sect;1910.269 immediately preceding the text of the section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1910.269  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Electric power generation, transmission, and distribution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA is staying the enforcement of the following paragraphs of &sect;1910.269 until November 1, 1994: (b)(1)(ii), (d) except for (d)(2)(i) and (d)(2)(iii), (e)(2), (e)(3), (j)(2)(iii), (l)(6)(iii), (m), (n)(3), (n)(4)(ii), (n)(8), (o) except for (o)(2)(i), (r)(1)(vi), (u)(1), (u)(4), (u)(5). OSHA is also staying the enforcement of paragraphs (n)(6) and (n)(7) of &sect;1910.269 until November 1, 1994, but only insofar as they apply to lines and equipment operated at 600 volts or less. Further, OSHA is staying the enforcement of paragraph (v)(11)(xii) of &sect;1910.269 until Februrary 1, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Corrections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several provisions in &sect;1910.269 contained minor typographical or grammatical errors. Additionally, several national consensus standards were approved and published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and by ASTM shortly after the promulgation of revised &sect;1910.137 and &sect;1910.269. Some non-mandatory notes and a non-mandatory appendix contained references to older editions of these ASTM standards. These non-mandatory references are intended to provide employers, employees, and other affected parties with additional information on techniques of complying with the OSHA rules. In fact, two notes in &sect;1910.137 accept compliance with specific ASTM standards as being compliance with &sect;1910.137. The Agency has reviewed the new ANSI and ASTM standards and has found them to provide newer, more technically up-to-date information than the older versions. Therefore, this correction notice is updating the references in &sect;1910.137 and &sect;1910.269 to the later ANSI and ASTM standards. In &sect;1910.137, OSHA is retaining the slightly older editions of the ASTM standards, in addition to the more recent editions, to clarify that electrical protective equipment manufactured in accordance with the older standards is still acceptable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 1910_[CORRECTED]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the notice of rulemaking appearing at 59 FR 4320 is corrected as follows. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Manchester to seek Olympics contracts bids MANCHESTER is to invite consortia to bid for contracts to design, build, operate and maintain the stadium, cycle track and other sporting facilities for its bid for the 2000 Olympics. The combined-contract approach - DBOM for short - was used for the city's Metrolink supertram. Designers and builders receive the bulk of their returns from running the facilities over several years, rather than simply taking profits from construction. Mr John Redwood, the environment minister, opened the bidding for the Olympic facilities to worldwide competition yesterday. Only well financed consortia of architects, civil engineering contractors, development companies and leisure management specialists are likely to have much chance. Several large contractors have already made inquiries and are assembling consortia. Mr Robert Lewin of Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank advising the Manchester team, said consortia should declare themselves by July 27. A shortlist of three or four will be asked to go into more detail by November 2, with selection of the preferred consortium in January. The aim is to negotiate a contract by this time next year, with construction starting three months later - at about the time the International Olympic Committee is choosing between Manchester, Berlin, Milan, Brasilia, Beijing and Sydney. For the supertram, rival consortia had to prove they could underwrite the Pounds 135m project. However, for the Olympics contracts, experience of successful syndicated fund-raising from financial institutions to pay for big projects will be enough. The Olympic Village, a housing project, is not included, but as much as half the Pounds 1bn cost of the games is likely to be involved. The government has committed Pounds 55m to preparing the ground and the bid. Total public-sector commitment is likely to be nearly Pounds 300m if Manchester wins the games.</p>

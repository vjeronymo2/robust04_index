			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Government defeated on Welsh council name The government was defeated last night when peers voted to keep the ancient name of Powys for a Welsh council. The Lords divided by 88 to 60, a majority of 28, to retain the name instead of replacing it with Mid Wales. The vote came during the report stage of the Local Government (Wales) bill, which replaces the principality's eight counties and 37 districts with 21 all-purpose authorities in 1996.</p>

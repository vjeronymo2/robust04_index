It  is necessary to mobilize people's enthusiasm in harnessing the  Huai He and the Tai Hu and exert joint efforts to do a good job  which will help eliminate the calamities, maintain a long period  of peace and stability, and benefit the generations to come.    At the Third Work Meeting on Harnessing the Huai He and the  Tai Hu which concluded today, State Councillor Chen Junsheng  conveyed Premier Li Peng's abovementioned opinions.    In his concluding speech at the meeting, Chen Junsheng said:  The project of harnessing the Huai He and the Tai Hu has a  direct bearing on the future economic development in the two  valleys and on the whole situation of nationwide reform,  opening, and socialist modernization drive. Therefore,  governments at all levels in these areas and relevant  departments of the central government should shoulder the  historic task of harnessing the Huai He and the Tai Hu with a  great sense of responsibility. They should see to it to attain  the set goal of achieving the initial results in harnessing the  Huai He in the "eighth five-year" period and basically  accomplishing the work in the "ninth five-year" period as well  as basically accomplishing the work of harnessing the Tai Hu in  the "eighth five-year" period.    Chen Junsheng said: The Huai He and Tai Hu valleys -- with a  population of 143 million people, 200 million mu of farmland,  and one sixth of total grain output in the country -- is China's  main production base of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing seeds.  This is one of the economically developed areas in China -- a  golden area with a total industrial and agricultural output  value accounting for one eighth of the country's total. But the  Huai He valley suffers from severe droughts and floods, with  fairly serious floods every three or four years. In 1991 alone,  the economic losses caused by the floods of the Chang Jiang and  the Huai He reached 48 billion yuan. If we do not speed up the  harnessing work, inestimable life and property losses will occur  again once great floods hit.    While talking about the first three-year work of harnessing  the Huai He and the Tai Hu in the "eighth five-year" period,  Chen Junsheng said: Among 18 backbone projects for harnessing  the Huai He, 12 of them have been started, with an investment of  2.235 billion yuan. Among 10 backbone projects for harnessing  the Tai Hu, seven of them have been started, with an investment  of 1.292 billion yuan. The construction of all projects goes on  fairly smoothly, with some projects already playing their role  in preventing floods.    Chen Junsheng said: The work of harnessing the Huai He and  the Tai Hu will enter an all-out critical stage this year.  Departments concerned should have a sense of urgency and  strengthen their leadership in the work. For this year, the  state's investment in the projects is 1.84 billion yuan, an  increase of 50 percent over last year. Department concerned of  the central government must ensure that such funds are available  in time. Local governments also must guarantee the input of  supplementary funds.    Chen Junsheng emphatically said: It is necessary for  departments concerned to further strengthen leadership in the  work of harnessing the Huai He and the Tai Hu, clarify their  responsibilities, and carry out their duties. All relevant  provinces and cities in the Huai He and the Tai Hu valleys  should closely cooperate with each other and be united in  harnessing the floods. They must follow the basic principle of  taking the whole situation into consideration, be cooperative,  and sharing burdens in their future efforts of harnessing the  Huai He and the Tai Hu. Thanks to the efforts of the past  several years in building water conservancy projects for  harnessing the Huai He and the Tai Hu, these projects will be  put into operation one after another. All localities must  attach great importance to the management of these projects so  as to generate maximum results. Equal attention should be paid  to project construction, management, and flood prevention.  During the construction period, it is possible for floods to  occur each year. Therefore, we should not relax efforts in all  flood-prevention tasks. Effective measures should be made to  repair the projects damaged by floods. We should be resolute in  doing a good job in dredging river courses. We should guarantee  that projects already accomplished are put into service on time  so as to ensure safe flood seasons.    At the meeting, Minister Niu Maosheng of water resources  talked about this year's goal of harnessing the Huai He and the  Tai Hu. He said: It is imperative to launch a compressive drive  to harness the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Huai He's  main tributaries. We should open the passage of the middle  reaches of the Huai He with all speed. All-out construction of  the new river course for the Huaihong should begin so as to  ensure its all-line completion in 1995. More efforts should be  made in building projects for diverging river water to the east  and the south, with a goal of accomplishing the first phase  project in 1995. We should still focus the work of harnessing  the Tai Hu on projects designed to diverge water of the Taipu  He, the Wangyu He, and the Hangjia He to the south and ensure  that these projects will be accomplished in 1995. Continued  efforts should be made to build the dikes surrounding the Tai Hu  and flood-prevention projects in east Shao Xi and west Shao Xi.</p>

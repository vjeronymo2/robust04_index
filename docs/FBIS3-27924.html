Hyundai Electronic Industries Co. and  three other Hyundai corporations contracted to buy Maxtor Co., a  San Jose-based hard disc manufacturer, last August. The Hyundai  companies agreed to finance their acquisition with a loan from  Citibank, a U.S. bank which Hyundai said has promised to lend  $150 million.    The takeover of Maxtor, the fifth largest hard disc  manufacturer in the world, which has production lines in Hong  Kong and Singapore, is certain to add muscle to the Hyundai  Business Group's electronics division. To obtain approval for  its takeover plan, a government official said, the Hyundai  Business Group lobbied hard at the Economic Planning Board, the  Ministry of Trade, Industry Energy, the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs as well as the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of  Korea. Officials from these government agencies form the  committee deliberating on foreign direct investments, chaired by  Yim Chang-yol, second assistant minister of finance. Instead of  holding a meeting on Hyundai's acquisition plan, the committee  received written opinions from its members by Friday.    Based on the committee members' opinions in favor of  Hyundai,  the Ministry of Finance instructed the Bank of Korea yesterday  morning to give a green light to the takeover plan. Does this  approval by the ministry signal any change in the government  attitude toward the Hyundai Business Group, whose founder Chong  Chu-yong antagonized President Kim Yong-sam by challenging him  in the presidential election in December 1992? There are signs  of improving relations between the government and the Hyundai  Business Group.    When he encountered Chong at Korea University where the late  honorary chairman of a vernacular newspaper lay in state last  week, President Kim smiled and shook hands with the Hyundai  founder. Another sign of improvement came earlier this month  when the Bank of Korea approved Hyundai Motor Co.'s plan to  invest $6.8 million in a joint venture auto company with a  Malaysian corporation.    Despite these signs of improvement, however, it may be too  early to say that the government has buried the hatchet. Though  it has approved Hyundai's plans for investments abroad, the  government is holding back its decision on Hyundai's plans to  raise funds for investment in the nation. The Hyundai Business  Group has applied to the Korea Development Bank for 832 billion  won in loans to finance its auto, electronics projects and other  projects.    It is apparent the government-owned bank cannot make any  decision on the issue without a cue from the government,  although an official from the Ministry of Finance maintained  that his ministry is not involved in any specific loan request  to the bank. In addition, the Securities Supervisory Board has  not allowed Hyundai Housing and Industrial Development Co. and  three other Hyundai corporations yet to sell their stocks over  the counter.</p>

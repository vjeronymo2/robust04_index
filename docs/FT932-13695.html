			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Survival through a part-exchange: Pressure is growing for a review of London stock market operations The London Stock Exchange faces a curious paradox. It supports a successful international share market in London that has left every other stock exchange in Europe searching for a way to compete. By the end of last year nearly 40 per cent of turnover in French shares was taking place in London, not Paris. Other European equity business done in London ranged from 12 per cent of turnover in German shares to 56 per cent of Dutch stocks. Yet the spectacular failure to complete Taurus, the paperless settlement system, has caused the exchange's existence to be called into question. Before the fiasco, the central stock market authority had already been engaged in a steady unbundling process: it had given up or lost a number of functions, from acting as a trade association to regulating member companies. Now, the shock from Taurus has shaken City confidence in the exchange so hard that this orderly process threatens to accelerate and slip beyond the exchange's control. According to the most pessimistic observers in the City the exchange could eventually be broken up, its remaining functions being taken on by a number of other regulatory or commercial entities. Pressure for a fundamental review of the exchange's operations is coming in large part from the big securities houses in London, whose dealing activities provide the heart of the share market. They have long felt neglected by the exchange, and have been stirred into action by the Taurus incident. And after three years under the abrasive Mr Peter Rawlins, the chief executive who resigned to take the blame for the Taurus, the exchange is finding that it has few friends elsewhere in the City or Whitehall. Two of the market authority's main activities are likely to be shed within the next few months. The first is share settlement (the process of exchanging stock for cash after a share trade takes place). The Taurus debacle left the exchange with little credibility in this area, and it has proposed the creation of a separate, industry-wide clearing house to take on the job. The second activity likely to be shed is the dissemination of share prices and company news through the exchange's Topic service, which has a dominant share of the market for such information in the UK. Rivals such as Reuters, which relaunched its own rival screen service at the start of this year, are fast eating into the exchange's market and it has concluded that, to stay competitive, it would have to make a substantial investment in upgrading its outdated technology. The answer, likely to be agreed at a board meeting today, is to contract out the management of Topic, leaving the exchange with royalty income from the system, before disposing of it altogether at some time in the future. Together, settlement and information services brought in Pounds 101m of the exchange's Pounds 194m of income last year. Much of this income will be lost, though the exchange plans to remain a wholesaler of information, collecting and processing company news and share prices and feeding them to commercial distributors. These developments will further eat into the exchange's cost base - one of the main bones of contention between the market authority and its members, who have experienced lean times themselves and baulk at funding a large central market organisation. The exchange's staff numbers have already fallen to about 1,000 from 1,800 one year ago. After the planned changes in the exchange's operation staff numbers will fall considerably further. However, costs will not fall as fast as many stock exchange members would like. The exchange already has extensive empty office space in London, with leases which do not expire for several years. The cost base, according to one board member, will still be Pounds 130m, compared with nearly Pounds 200m last year. The proposed changes raise the questions of what will be left, and whether the exchange will survive the attack from various quarters in the City? In the wake of Taurus, the exchange's chairman, Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, has fallen back on what he claims is the exchange's core function: running a regulated market which brings together the users and providers of capital. To what extent the exchange's remaining range of activities fulfils this aim  -and whether some functions would better be taken on by other agencies - is an open question. The regulation of the primary stock market (on which companies raise capital by issuing shares) and the secondary market (on which shares which have already been issued are traded) lies at the heart of the exchange's plan for itself. It has been designated as the 'competent authority' for listing companies by the 1986 Financial Services Act, and runs market supervision and surveillance operations to regulate the secondary market. Should it continue to do these jobs? There have been calls from rivals to the exchange for the competent authority role to be handed over to an separate agency, perhaps the Securities and Investments Board, the UK's chief investment watchdog. But despite the superficial neatness of such a move - it would bring the UK into line with other leading markets - there is little apparent need or demand for a switch. Nor is there any sign of pressure for secondary market regulation to be handed over to another agency, such as the Securities and Futures Authority, which has taken on the job of regulating securities companies. But if there is broad consensus that regulating the primary and secondary markets should remain the exchange's core role, there is less accord on what systems it needs to do the job. This is the cause of the disagreement now brewing between the market authority and London's largest securities houses. In theory it needs only a trade reporting system, to monitor transactions in the market, and some arrangement for the publication of market trades (similar to the consolidated market tape in the US) to maintain a level of market transparency. This raises the question of whether the exchange should also maintain the computer base on which Seaq (the market system introduced at the time of Big Bang) runs. This takes in prices from marketmakers - which are obliged to quote prices at which they will buy or sell shares - and consolidates these into pages of prices, which are then displayed to users, the public face of the stock market. These pages of marketmaker prices do much to project the image that London maintains a liquid stock market, the competitive edge which has helped it maintain its international position. The computers on which Seaq runs are being subjected to an overhaul by Andersen Consulting at a cost variously put at between Pounds 40m and Pounds 75m. According to the marketmakers, the exchange should scrap Seaq and buy something off the shelf - probably Nasdaq, the US system on which Seaq was initially modelled in the mid-1980s. This could turn out to be more than a dispute over technology. Seaq lies at the heart of the marketmaking system on which the London stock markets run - both for domestic and international shares. Yet marketmaking has proved an unprofitable business. A change in the market's technological base could also raise the question of how the market operates. The implied threat being made by the big marketmakers is this: if they do not get what they want, they could simply take their business elsewhere. The international bond market, after all, does not need an exchange. Prices are carried by commercial information vendors, and settlement is through separate international clearing houses. To create such a market, it would only take the biggest marketmakers to agree on trading rules between themselves and find a company such as Reuters to carry their prices. Now that really is something to keep the exchange's executives awake at night.</p>

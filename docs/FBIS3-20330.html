			<p>German 26 Mar 94 p 16  <F P=103> AU3003063894 </F> <F P=104>  Frankfurt/Main BOERSEN-ZEITUNG ("German  Industry--Branches, Innovation, and Finance" supplement) </F>   Language: <F P=105>German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt: "Gearing </F> Up for More Employment"]    [Text] Improving employment prospects is the main  challenge that German economic policy faces over the next few  years. To achieve that goal, we must bolster positive trends in  the old laender, promote growth in the new laender, and secure  the international competitiveness of the German economy.  Increasing investment by companies and state investment in the  infrastructure is a priority. This is the only way in which new  and secure jobs can be created. A new boost in investment  assumes that the high level of costs will be reduced and that  more room for maneuver will be created for entrepreneurial  activity.    In the fall of 1993, the government presented an extensive  range of measures with its report on securing Germany's future  as a center for business. These measures are being rapidly  implemented. I need only mention the Law on Facilitating  Investment and Land for Housing Construction, the Old Debt Law,  the removal of fixed rates in the transportation of goods, the  Law on Securing Germany's Future as a Center for Business, and  the guaranteeing of training posts in eastern Germany. The  action program for more growth and employment has allowed us to  make a significant amount of progress.    To improve the employment situation, structural problems in  the labor market also have to be eliminated. Over a period of  many years, especially in times of strong growth and high  employment, structures and patterns of conduct developed that  are only an obstacle to overcoming the crisis rapidly. The key  elements of an employment policy geared toward growth,  employment, and competitiveness are a new orientation with  respect to policy on collective agreements, higher flexibility  in the labor market, as well as the development of effective  labor market policy measures.  <H5>  Collective Agreements Are Often Too Rigid </H5>   The partners to collective wage agreements must find their  way back to wages that are justified in market terms and are  linked to shortages on the labor market. More consideration  must be given to the requirements of the unemployed and weak  companies than has been the case so far. The labor market  situation requires more sharply differentiated wage settlements  based on regions, branches, and qualifications, as well as room  for maneuver for individual company solutions and elements based  on company earnings. Many collective agreements have come to  form too rigid a framework, making it impossible to respond to  new demands and market developments in a flexible enough manner.  The justified interests of the unemployed should no longer be  ignored in negotiations on collective wage agreements. For  example, it should be possible for the long-term unemployed to  be paid rates below those contained in collective agreements for  a limited period of time to facilitate the return of those  people to the labor market. There has been some movement in  this respect, as the settlement in the chemical industry shows.    The policy on collective agreements must also address the  fact that there are people seeking employment whose  qualifications and ability do not correspond to the requirements  of a high-wage economy oriented toward the world market and that  they will not be employed for that reason. The high-wage policy  in the Federal Republic has led to a high level of unemployment  despite there being more than enough work, because there is a  low demand for poorly qualified workers who are paid according  to collective agreement rates. That is why we need an  additional low wage sector. The state, as an employer and  collective agreement partner, must also send out the right  signals during this year's collective agreement negotiations.  That is why the government decided to freeze civil servants'  salaries this year. In the new laender, the issue is above all  one of extending the period over which incomes will be adjusted  to levels in western Germany. This is also an area in which the  state must assume a vanguard role.    To overcome the employment crisis, it is still necessary to  make use of opportunities for employment that have not been  exploited to date. We have a great demand for services in  private households, for example, in areas such as child care,  looking after elderly people, and for part-time jobs. That is  why the government intends to make the creation of employment  opportunities in private households and of part-time jobs easier.    The demand for part-time jobs is much greater than the  supply. This is an area in which companies must overcome their  often unjustified reservations. In many areas, with some  imagination and flexibility, part-time employment would be  possible, and it would often benefit companies in the form of  higher motivation and productivity as well as lower absenteeism.  To assist the move to part-time employment, we will guarantee  unemployment insurance benefits for a fixed period of time if  employees transfer from full-time to part-time employment. In  the public sector, too, the government will issue a clear  signal. A readiness to consider new forms of work organization  is something that I also hope will emerge from the joint actions  of unions, employers, the Federal Office of Employment, and the  government, aimed at creating more part-time employment.  <H5>  Private Employment Agencies </H5>   Additional jobs can also be created if there is more scope  for organizational creativity. This applies to policy on  collective agreements, on working hours, as well as labor market  organizational structures. The government will permit private  employment agencies so that competition between private and  public employment agencies will balance out the situation in the  labor market more quickly and efficiently. This step has been  long overdue, because the monopoly enjoyed by the Federal Office  of Employment, which might have been justified when it was  formed, has not met the demands of a highly technical and highly  industrialized economy for a long time now. Employment will be  further stimulated by extending the duration of limited  employment contracts.    Working hours is a very important area in which the German  economy and labor market must become more flexible. This is an  area in which too many rigid structures, along with constant  reductions in working hours, have developed. This applies to  daily, weekly, and annual working hours as well the length of  working lives. The parties to collective agreements must be  serious about flexible working hours, and they must be ready to  respond to a much greater extent to individual wishes regarding  longer or shorter working hours. There is no general recipe for  making working hours more flexible and work organization more  productive; various forms of work organization are possible.  The government will create a better framework with a new labor  law. The law will create more scope for additional work when  necessary and work on Saturdays and Sundays. With regard to  working lives, we want to and must reverse the trend to  retirement at an increasingly earlier age, if only because of  Germany's demographic development.  <H5>  A Bridge for Reintegration </H5>   In times of high unemployment, labor market policy performs  an important social function. Further training and retraining,  job-creation measures, and wage-cost supplements should assist  the return to normal employment. Since German unification,  these instruments have been used extensively to cushion  structural change. In the meantime, however, we have reached  the limits of what is acceptable in terms of budgetary and  economic policy. Labor market policy measures have to be  financed at the expense of competitive jobs. Germany is already  in the lead with regard to wage ancillary costs. In addition,  it has emerged that the form that some of these instruments take  obscures the way in which in regular jobs differentiate to too  great an extent. The government has introduced adjustments that  consider both economic and social aspects.    Job-creation measures can contribute to easing structural  change in the new laender and to cushioning the effects of the  recession on disadvantaged groups in the west German labor  market. However, it must be clearly seen that this will not  lead to the creation of permanent, competitive jobs, but is only  a social bridge for reintegration into the first labor market.  If such measures are applied extensively for increasingly  longer periods of time, there is a growing danger that private  companies will experience pressure and be disadvantaged. This  is particularly problematic when a medium-sized business is  still in the first stages of development. In addition, those  employed under such measures begin to harbor illusions that they  have normal and permanent jobs. This impression is reinforced  when people employed under job-creation measures are largely  paid according to collective wage agreement rates.    To avoid distorting competition and insufficient motivation  to change to regular employment, the government has called on  the partners to collective agreements to agree on special wage  scales for subsidized jobs in particular. State wage-cost  supplements for job-creation measures will be limited to certain  wage levels in the future. Funds can then be used to assist  more unemployed people. There will also be more incentives to  transfer to normal employment. In those regions in the old  laender that are particularly affected by structural crises,  subsidies for a limited period of time will be introduced under  Chapter 259 of the Law on Promoting Employment. This will allow  wage benefits to be turned into wage-cost supplements for  measures to improve the environment, social services, and the  youth assistance programs. Further, an additional offer will go  out to the unemployed throughout Germany in the form of  community work projects. These will be state subsidized forms  of employment for which pay will not be based on collective  agreement wage scales. It will more often be the case that  unemployed people who voluntarily participate in such schemes  will receive a flat rate of compensation.  <H5>  Framework Conditions Have Been Improved </H5>   Government labor market and employment policy is geared  toward facilitating the creation of additional competitive jobs  through more flexibility and more room for maneuver as well as  reducing regulations and the tax burden. That is because in a  world of rapidly changing technology and increasing  international competitiveness, only he who responds quickly and  flexibly to change will be able to stand his ground. Thus, the  government has improved framework conditions through a series of  important measures. It is now up to the partners to collective  wage agreements, companies, and employees to use this to create  more employment.</p>

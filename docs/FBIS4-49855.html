			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Liu Zhenying (0491 2182 5391) of the Central </F> People's Broadcasting Station and XINHUA reporter Sun Benyao  (1327 2609 1031)]    [Excerpt] Beijing, 10 May (XINHUA) -- While meeting  recipients of the first national award for excellent  entrepreneurs with inventive achievements at the Great Hall of  the People this afternoon, Li Peng, premier of the State  Council, said: This is an era in which people of great talent  come forth in great numbers. The broad masses of people,  including the vast numbers of intellectuals and workers, have a  vast reservoir of enthusiasm and creativity for socialist  modernization; some of these people are very talented. We  should provide them with better mechanism and environment to  show off their talent, and enable them to make greater  contributions to socialist modernization.    Premier Li Peng began by extending his warm congratulations  at the meeting to recipients of the national award for excellent  entrepreneurs with inventive achievements on behalf of the party  Central Committee and State Council.    He said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping said science and technology  are the primary productive forces. Scientific and technological  progress, inventions, and creations decide whether or not an  enterprise flourishes and develops. To flourish and develop, to  consolidate its national strength, to improve its people's  living standards, and to achieve the four modernizations, a  country has to rely on scientific and technological progress  also. Awarding excellent entrepreneurs who have made inventive  achievements is a very meaningful thing to do. You are  inventors as well as entrepreneurs. You have turned scientific  and technological fruits into productive forces, introduced good  products which meet market needs, and brought economic  efficiency to enterprises -- all these greatly deserve  recommendation.    Li Peng said: We have different types of inventions --  great, medium, and small ones. Great inventions can usher in a  new scientific era. To a certain degree, the foundation for  basic and applied sciences, which have great potentials and  bright prospects, has been established in our country. Small  inventions can promote social progress, make things convenient  for the people, and make society efficient. Our country needs  major inventions to scale new heights in science. In addition  major inventions, we should also put a premium on small and  practical inventions.    In his speech, Li Peng expressed the hope to see more  inventions and creations being produced on all fronts, so that  our motherland will thrive and prosper.    Leading Comrades Ni Zhifu, Li Peiyao, Song Jian, and Luo Gan  attended the meeting and the first national award ceremony for  excellent entrepreneurs with inventive achievements.

Brigadier Drago Krpina, head of the ministry's political  department, spoke at the conference. Zoltan Kabok reports:    [Kabok] The claims by Bosnian Minister Hadzihasanovic that  as  many as 15 brigades of the Croatian Army with 30,000 soldiers  were fighting on the soil of their neighbors are a blatant lie  -- according to Brigadier Krpina -- aimed at putting  international pressure on Croatia.    [Begin Krpina recording] The justification of the failure of  the Muslim offensive in central Bosnia and of some defeats of  the Muslim army in the vicinity of Prozor -- as I have already  said -- is an attempt to bring about the lifting of the arms  embargo imposed on the Muslim army. [end recording]    [Kabok] Speaking about the genesis of Croatian-Muslim  relations Krpina said that from the very beginning the  leadership of Croatia advocated a single Bosnian state.  Croatia, Krpina went on, was the first country to establish  diplomatic relations with Bosnia-Herzegovina after the  international recognition of Bosnia-Herzegovina. According to  our information, Krpina said, 2,000 volunteers of Bosnian origin  are currently fighting in the neighboring country  [Bosnia-Herzegovina]. Over 5,000 mercenaries from Islamic  states -- who are encouraging fanaticism and fundamentalism --  are currently fighting on the side of the Muslim army, Brigadier  Drago Krpina said at the end of the news conference, also  denying all allegations by the Bosnian defense minister about  any involvement of Croatian Armed Forces in clashes in the  neighboring state.</p>

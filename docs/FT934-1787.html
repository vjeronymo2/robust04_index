			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / China and Japan skew US deficit The US trade deficit is becoming increasingly unbalanced regionally, with most of the shortfall accounted for by Japan and China, official figures indicated yesterday, writes Michael Prowse in Washington. The overall merchandise trade deficit declined slightly in October, to Dollars 10.46bn (Pounds 7bn), against Dollars 10.62bn in September, roughly in line with analysts' projections. But the deficit with Japan rose 14 per cent to Dollars 6.1bn, the highest since November 1986. That with China rose 8 per cent to Dollars 2.7bn. For the year to date the combined deficit with Japan and China was Dollars 67.6bn, more than two thirds of the overall deficit. By contrast, trade with the European Union is virtually in balance, with a negligible US deficit of Dollars 11m so far this year.</p>

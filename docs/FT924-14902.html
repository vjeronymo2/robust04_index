			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Delors warns on EC political balance MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, last night warned EC governments not to interfere with the delicate political balance of the Community's institutions and not to blame the European monetary system for recent financial turmoil. Mr Delors said that, despite everything, the Community was still the world's most successful example of co-operation between nations. Mr Delors also risked upsetting Mr John Major, the British prime minister, by suggesting that the inconsistency of his comments after the Maastricht summit - claiming 'Game, set and match' for Britain but also backing closer European co-operation - was one example of a 'deficit of behaviour' among some politicians. '(We have to decide) if Europe is going to be a strong union or a field of battle where (each member state) must win,' he said, warning that 'nationalistic vanity' risked damaging the Community. Mr Delors argued that the Commission already applied the principle of subsidiarity - by which decisions are taken at the lowest level appropriate. He conceded there was a need for more subsidiarity, democracy and transparency but warned that any attempt to simplify the EC's complex institutional framework would have to be done carefully. Mr Delors was speaking in Brussels on the future of Europe as part of the Grandes Conferences Catholiques, a series of talks given by world statesmen.</p>

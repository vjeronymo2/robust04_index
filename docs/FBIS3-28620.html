The North Korean ambassador held a news conference at the  North Korean Embassy in Cairo today to mark the 52d birthday of  Kim Chong-il, chairman of the North Korean Defense Committee and  son of the country's leader Kim Il-song. He spoke of the tense  situation in the Korean peninsula and praised the friendly  relations between Egypt and his country. [passage omitted]    On the situation in the Korean peninsula, he said that the  tension has risen to an unprecedented level in the past few days  and that his government is making intensive efforts to reunite  the two parts of the country by peaceful means and through  dialogue. He noted that the United States is not abiding by the  clauses of several agreements it concluded with North Korea in  recent negotiations and at the same time it is demanding that  North Korea fulfill its commitments or face political and  economic pressures.    Kim Yong-sop said that the International Atomic Energy  Agency  [IAEA] continues to use a double standard and although the  United States decided to halt the Team Spirit maneuvers, it  announced it will carry out another major military exercise.    He said: We demand that Washington halt these maneuvers, not  merely change their names, in order to ease the tension and  create an appropriate atmosphere for negotiations.    The ambassador said: The United States has announced it will  deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea, which would escalate the  tension to the point of war, although we want peace. He  asserted that if Washington does not fulfill its commitments,  North Korea will also not abide by its pledges, will consider  suspending its IAEA membership, and transform its current  reactors which are employed for useful purposes into nuclear  reactors [as received].    He added that North Korea will not beg for a resumption of  the negotiations, explaining: We agreed to negotiate in order  to ease the tension. We can live without U.S. aid or  assistance. If the United States resorts to sanctions, we will  adopt the necessary measures in response.    Regarding the position adopted by South Korea and  neighboring  countries on these developments, the North Korean ambassador  said that the South Korean authorities persist in depending on  foreign forces and turn their backs on the Korean people in the  north.    He remarked: We believe that if the problems between us and  the United States are solved, our relationship with Seoul will  automatically improve.    He said: Neighboring countries like China, Japan, and Russia  have different attitudes on this issue. We respect the views of  others and are trying to develop friendly ties with them. We  hope that these countries will not escalate tension in this  region.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / People: Smith benefits from split role at Argyll Argyll, the food retailing group comprising Safeway, Presto and Lo-Cost, is splitting the roles of chairman and chief executive, currently filled by Sir Alistair Grant, and promoting Colin Smith, finance director since 1989, to the chief executive's position. Sir Alistair, who became chief executive in 1986 and added the chairman's role in 1988, will continue as full-time executive chairman. David Webster continues as deputy chairman with responsibility for corporate finance and development and strategic planning. Argyll says Sir Alistair, who is nearly 57, was keen to 'play in' a new executive before he reached the retirement age of 60, and bring in someone else to participate in trading and investment decisions that may have an impact beyond that date. 'We will split the job as you would expect,' said Smith (above right) yesterday. 'It will be my responsibility to conduct operations, while Alistair will be executive chairman. He is the boss at the end of the day.' He added that 'everybody's style is different. Mine will be different from Alistair's, who had a background in marketing, while mine was on the finance side. My style will probably be different from what it was when I was finance director. I will need to get much more closely involved with the operations.' Smith, 46, has a degree in commerce from Liverpool University, and began his career with Arthur Andersen in 1969. From 1976 he spent three years on consultancy assignments, and joined Argyll Foods as financial controller of its meat division in 1979. He was rapidly promoted, being appointed finance director of Argyll Stores division in 1983 and to the board of the Argyll Group in 1984.</p>

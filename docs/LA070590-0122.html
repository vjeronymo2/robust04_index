			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ECONOMICAL HOME 'WORKOUTS'  </P> <P> A series of 12 weekly gym classes for babies can run parents $100 or more, but  there are less expensive ways to "work out" with your child at home.  </P> <P> "There are literally hundreds of things you can do with your child at home to  teach them that physical activity is a fun thing," said Jed Heller, owner and  instructor at Jr. Gym in Sherman Oaks.  </P> <P> Heller suggests that parents set aside a specific period each week, or several  periods a week, to devote uninterrupted time to their child. If parents are  interested in the social aspects of the activity, they should try to hook up  with other parents who can meet at one house for class, he said.  </P> <P> Simple stretches can involve moving the child's legs in a bicycling rotation  and lifting the feet toward the face while the child is on his or her back.  This encourages flexibility in the spine. Similar exercises can be done with  the arms.  </P> <P> "Children love this kind of thing, especially when their parents make a game  out of it," Heller said.  </P> <P> Other activities can be done with simple household items such as a broom handle  or jump rope. A parent can encourage the child to grab the broom handle from  either a sitting or standing position. The parent lifts the broom, letting the  child hang a few inches off the ground. This is an activity that is better for  babies 10 months and older than for younger infants, according to Adrian  Becker, who operates several Gymboree outlets in the Valley.  </P> <P> A jump rope can be tied to two items and stretched several inches off the  ground for toddlers to climb over and under. Babies can be lifted from one side  to the other or held in their parents' arms while the parent hops over the  rope.  </P> <P> "It's important for parents to use their imagination and realize that their  children need stimulation all the time," Heller said. "Even if their child is  participating in an organized class at a gymnasium, it's still important for  them to play with their babies at home." KAREN KINGSBURY  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has announced that the  PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] will not be allowed to take  shelter under the roof of the Assembly. She declared: The time  has come to erase the fact that the PKK is being sheltered under  the Assembly's roof.    Addressing the True Path Party [TPP] assembly group meeting  today, Ciller began with the issue of Sarajevo and said that the  result attained is a first step towards peace. She said:    [Begin Ciller recording] This morning I was pleased to learn  that all heavy weapons have either been withdrawn 20 km outside  Sarajevo, or they have been handed over to the United Nations.  I welcome this development and the official information we were  given. This is what should have been done a long time ago. As  we declared during the NATO summit and in other platforms,  especially as I personally stated during the NATO summit, it is  possible to achieve results without bloodshed if the necessary  force is attached to diplomatic moves. This is what was done  here and it was possible to control the weapons in the hands of  the Serbs or distance them 20 km outside the city without  resorting to bloodshed or conducting any air strikes.    We cannot, however, consider this sufficient on its own.  This is only the first small part of the first step towards  peace. The problem in Bosnia-Herzegovina is very extensive and  the same situation prevails in a series of other regions. The  same determination must be displayed in all these other areas.  The same approach must certainly be utilized urgently in  Gorazde, (Zeba), Srebrenica, Tuzla, and Bihac. The same  situation applies to these security regions. Whatever was done  for Sarajevo must be implemented in full in these areas as well  and under such an atmosphere, the sides must immediately sit at  the negotiating table for a lasting solution in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. We reiterate that this is a topic that  concerns the entire world public opinion. Turkey, for its part,  will immediately appeal for the same approach to be applied and  for the same measures to be adopted in the other regions as  well. I once again declare that we are by the side of the  Bosnians and we stand by their just cause. [end recording]    Commenting on this morning's meeting with Catherine  Lalumiere, secretary general of the Council of Europe, Ciller  recounted that she clearly explained the reason for Turkey's  determination in the struggle against terrorism. The TPP leader  stated:    [Begin Ciller recording] The Council of Europe secretary  general asked me if there was any other way to fight terrorism.  This is what I told her clearly in return: What is this other  way you are talking about? Our people are dying; mothers and  children are being massacred. We are channeling the biggest  investments in the country into this region. We are doing  everything possible to invest in these areas and open the way to  these investments. Moreover, our compassion for the people in  this region is demonstrated in the force used to protect their  lives. Despite all this, if a separatist organization in your  country opposes investment in these regions and vows to stop it;  if it asks for democracy, but still attempts to oust all parties  as well as the press; if it obstructs every service designated  for the region; and if it openly declares its goal as  separatism, then can you ask the same question of your country?  In other words, there is no question of what else we can do at  a time when separatist terrorist wishes are evident. [end  recording]    Prime Minister Tansu Ciller stressed that the government is  exerting efforts to expand human rights and democracy not only  to one region or as a concession to the terrorists, but to the  entire country. Ciller noted that one matter on the public  conscience recently is the widespread belief that the PKK is  being sheltered under the roof of the parliament. Pointing out  that such a thought is as disturbing for the government as it is  for the people, the prime minister continued:    [Begin Ciller recording] Neither the lofty Assembly, nor the  TPP can tolerate the PKK being sheltered by the Assembly. We  will not allow this. If persons, whose hands are still wet with  babies' blood, are being protected in any way by any kind of  immunity, then this does not conform with democracy. [end  recording]    Ciller declared that the immunity files concerning deputies  who act in this way have passed from committees and have been  referred to the Assembly. The Assembly will do whatever is  necessary under the leadership of the TPP, Ciller underlined.    Ciller also criticized Democracy Party [DEP] leader Hatip  Dicle's description of the bombing of Tuzla station as a  consequence of war conditions. At the mention of Dicle's name,  deputies shouted that he was a traitor. In response, Ciller  said: That is correct. That is exactly it.    By targeting the young students attending the Tuzla Infantry  School, Ciller remarked, Dicle has blatantly violated his  parliamentary oath. Ciller said Dicle did not keep his word of  honor given at the Assembly regarding the indivisible unity of  the country and the nation. False actions aimed at eroding the  state and its institutions, hiding behind parliamentary  immunity, cannot be explained through the concept of democracy,  Ciller added. She noted that those who act against sacred  territories and the indivisible unity of the nation will  certainly receive the necessary response from the state. The  government is very determined on the matter, she declared.  Pointing to the people's sensitivity on the subject, Ciller  continued:    [Begin Ciller recording] The time has come to eliminate the  fact that the PKK is being sheltered under the roof of the  Assembly. Be that as it may, I would like to declare that I  regret the bombing of the DEP headquarters in Ankara. We are  opposed to terrorism, whatever the reasons. It is not right to  bomb or try to achieve a goal through terrorism for any reason  at all. Therefore, I am warning all my citizens again: Do not,  under any circumstances, be deceived by any schemes. [end  recording]    Ciller stated that the country's strength lies only in its  unity and solidarity and asked that the necessary response be  given to those who wish to damage this strength.    Referring to the Cyprus question, Ciller announced that the  Turkish side will continue to support the confidence-building  measures. Noting that views were exchanged last night with the  president and prime minister of the Turkish Republic of Northern  Cyprus [TRNC], Ciller went on:    [Begin Ciller recording] I observe that the TRNC will  continue to support the confidence-building measures. Despite  our positive initiatives, it is clear that this matter cannot be  concluded through our initiatives alone. As it is, Greece has  failed to adopt a positive attitude regarding this issue despite  the UN Security Council resolution on the subject. Similarly,  the Greek Cypriot side has failed to display such determination.  Furthermore, while the Turkish side accepted the principle of  not piercing the package, the Greek Cypriots posited certain  additional demands which actually pierce the package. This  again demonstrates to the world our determination on the subject  and the fact that we will not benefit from a lack of solution.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Hearts asks fans for Pounds 1.5m to bolster team Heart of Midlothian is asking its supporters for funds to strengthen the playing squad in an attempt to re-establish the Edinburgh football club as one of the Scottish Premier League's leading lights. Hearts is launching an issue of Club shares, which carry a range of benefits but no voting rights, and aims to raise up to Pounds 1.5m after expenses - estimated at Pounds 350,000 - for fresh players. Any further proceeds will be used for general on-going development of the core business. Mr Chris Robinson, chairman, said that as well as team strengthening 'we believe that the expansion of the commercial activities are key to the future success of the club'. Club shares are available in blocks of 200 at Pounds 250 per block - 125p per share - until November 15. New shareholders will have the right to appoint two new directors to the board.</p>

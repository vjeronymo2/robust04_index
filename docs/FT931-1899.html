			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Yeltsin receives encouraging regional backing MR Boris Yeltsin's weekend break-out from his constitutional dead end yesterday received greater support from the regions of Russia than had been expected by his opponents in the Russian parliaments. Meetings of regional councils are running roughly equally for and against Mr Yeltsin's imposition of 'special rule' and his announcement of a popular vote on the division of powers on April 25. The regional councils in Sverdlovsk, Mr Yeltsin's home base when he was a regional party secretary, Samara, Altai, Kamchatka, Krasnodar and Kurgan Ude said they favoured a popular vote. Mr Anatoly Grebenkin, head of the Sverdlovsk council, called Mr Yeltsin's decision 'courageous' and forecast that 'by raising the stakes, he may mobilise the population in his support'. The Kamchatka council appealed to the Russian Supreme Council to put the people's trust in the body to a popular vote - a barbed request, given the consistently low rating for the Russian parliament in public opinion polls. However, other key areas were no less firmly against, many of them saying they would not organise Mr Yeltsin's proposed vote in their areas. These included the regions or republics of the Kuzbass, Kemerovo, Karelia, Stavropol, Chelyabinsk and Sakhalin. Mr Aman Tuleev, leader of the Kemerovo regional council, a candidate for the presidency and an increasingly ferocious opponent of Mr Yeltsin, said the Russian president had 'practically deposed lawful power in the country'. A few sat on the fence, like the Union of Don Cossacks, whose leader, Mr Vasily Kalegin, said the legislative and executive powers were 'behaving like children, asking who loved them most'. The newly independent states of the former Soviet Union which yesterday reacted to the weekend moves generally supported Mr Yeltsin, though many declined to make their views known. Support for Mr Yeltsin was also evident from the wider, former communist world. Ukraine, the second largest Slav state, with a history of fractious relationships with Russia, came out in strong support of the proposal for a popular vote. President Leonid Kravchuk said: 'I fully support the Russian leadership's course on reforms and am certain it can be carried out only through national consensus.' The Baltic states of Estonia and Lithuania also strongly supported Mr Yeltsin. Latvia's Supreme Soviet chairman, Mr Anatolijs Gorbunovs, was more measured, saying that 'we hope the president elected by the Russian people and the government will efficiently pursue the course of reforms'. Armenia came out for Mr Yeltsin but the central Asian states of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan were reserved, the latter claiming more time was needed to study the situation.</p>

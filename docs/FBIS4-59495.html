			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by HATZOFE's political correspondent in Jerusalem </F> and ITIM reporter Dani Zaqen]    [Excerpt] PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat has recently  contacted senior Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] members,  through PLO men in the territories, and offered them seats on  the Palestinian council which is due to rule the autonomy.    These days, 'Arafat is busy setting up the council, which  will probably be made of 25 members, 15 of which from the  territories. Several PLO officials in Gaza and Jericho have  recently approached Hamas notables with an offer to join the  autonomy council.    The ITIM reporter has learned that Hamas was offered three  seats on the council and one executive post, and later the PLO  expanded the offer to five council seats and two executive posts.    The Hamas members rejected the offer, but announced they  would be glad to participate in the elections, which are to be  held several months after the autonomy is established.    A senior PLO member in Gaza told the ITIM reporter that the  Hamas response gives rise to optimism regarding their  incorporation in the autonomy establishments -- which would  force 'Arafat to call the for elections as soon as possible.  The ITIM reporter says that the PLO members in Judaea, Samaria,  and Gaza favor early elections, often contrary to the stand of  'Arafat and his advisers in Tunis. [passage omitted]</p>

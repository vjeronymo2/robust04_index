			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / People: New flightpath for Curt Ekstrom Curt Ekstrom, general manager of Unisys in Sweden and a founder of Amadeus, one of the two main European airline reservation systems, has been headhunted as the next chief executive of Speedwing Systems. This is the largest division within the Speedwing Group, British Airways' information technology and consultancy services business. He replaces 54-year-old Malcolm Dillingham, who, after three years in the job, is moving to work on the technical aspects of BA's strategic stakes in Qantas and USAir. The division provides reservation, airline accounting and yield management systems to other airlines. Rick Wills, managing director of the Speedwing Group, says that Ekstrom's experience at Amadeus is very valuable as 'the basic technology is very similar; it has given him lots of transport industry contacts and both are international companies'. Amadeus was set up by Air France, Iberia and Lufthansa and is a direct competitor of Galileo, which is owned by BA and KLM. 'Revenue management products in particular are going to be greatly in demand,' according to Wills. The way an airline accounts for receipts from passengers on complicated itineraries using several carriers has a huge impact on cash-flow and hence profits, he argues. Many of the smaller airlines in the eastern block use Speedwing reservation systems, as, closer to home, does British Midland. Austrian Airlines is among those using the accounting system. Ekstrom, 51, also goes on the boards of Bedford Associates, Speedwing's US-based software house, and of Speedwing Logica, a joint venture between Logica and BA. One of the industry's most respected IT professionals, according to BA, Ekstrom worked his way up SAS, to become general manager of SAS DATA, the Scandinavian airline's IT arm. He also spent four years in Bangkok, managing Thai Airways' data processing department. He was a founder and the original president and chief executive officer of Amadeus between 1988 and 1990.</p>

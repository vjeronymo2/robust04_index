			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): A second chance - Investors are missing out by not backing seasoned entrepreneurs more often Steve Curtis started a business, built it organically, merged it with another and sold out for Pounds 4.7m during four heady years in the late 1980s. Yet in spite of the success of Brunton Curtis Outdoor Advertising, Curtis received no calls after the sale from venture capital companies curious about what he planned to do next. 'In the US, venture capitalists are looking at second- and third-time entrepreneurs,' says Curtis. 'In Britain they have a reactive approach. They do not seem to monitor trade sales in specific sectors.' Curtis and his partner began to build a new outdoor advertising company in 1990 and sales grew to Pounds 700,000. 'But for three years we did not hear a dicky bird,' Curtis says. Curtis then raised venture backing when he had the opportunity to buy back part of his business from Mills &amp; Allen, but even then some venture capitalists showed great reluctance to back him. Curtis's experience is not uncommon. According to Ken Robbie, research director of the Centre for Management Buy-Out Research (CMBOR) at Nottingham University, second-time entrepreneurs in the UK are under-utilised by venture capitalists. The lack of interest in a battle-toughened army of footloose entrepreneurs is surprising as they have probably survived the mistakes that would trip up many first-time entrepreneurs. By backing these experienced entrepreneurs in businesses - or using them as co-investors in management buy-ins - venture capitalists should be increasing the chances of the ventures' success. A few accounting firms, such as Touche Ross, follow up or back successful entrepreneurs but on a selective basis. And Mercury Asset Management helped Michael Guthrie, former chairman of Mecca Leisure, to look for opportunities in the food sector when he left Mecca after its takeover by Rank. But it appears to be a piecemeal approach. Even 3i, the UK's largest venture capital company, only keeps an informal eye on entrepreneurs that have left companies it has backed. And it has no systematic way of following up people who have sold businesses they started without venture backing. Of course, the experience of selling a company changes entrepreneurs. Robbie points out from a study* of serial investors undertaken by CMBOR that success does not necessarily breed success. 'Venture capitalists will need to be satisfied that experienced entrepreneurs still have the motivation, ambition and managerial skills to succeed in a subsequent venture,' he says. Another change is that the entrepreneurs know the ropes and how to deal with venture capital investors. John Edmonds is a classic example of a serial investor who got wise to the ways of some venture capitalists and had the muscle to be more discerning second-time around. A partner in a legal practice, Edmonds developed an encyclopaedic knowledge of holiday time-share law. In 1991 he left his firm and bought a US holiday company with Dollars 11m (Pounds 7m) of venture backing. Eighteen months after turning it into a successful timeshare holiday exchange bureau, Edmonds sold it for Dollars 75m. After a week he got bored doing nothing. He began a year-long search to find another business before reading an advertisement that led him to First Information Group, a multimedia software company formerly called Chrysalis. But while he was looking for his next move, no venture capitalists called him - although he did invite himself to lunch at 3i. He also decided not to return to the venture capitalists who backed his time-share company. 'Lloyds Development Capital, in particular, was very anxious to get an exit quickly and they put a lot of pressure on us to do it,' says Edmonds. Instead he turned to 3i because he believed they would not press him for an exit. Yesterday he announced he had sold 25 per cent of First Information Group to 3i for Pounds 4m, to finance production and marketing of its own multimedia titles. If the venture capital industry is in command when entrepreneurs first need capital, there is little doubt the balance of power has changed when they come back a second time. 'The second time around they (entrepreneurs) are much more in the driving seat and more able to bargain,' says Robbie. Take John Laurie, who led a Pounds 2.2m management buy-in at Newport Technology group, a maker of electronic components. Having had experience not only of being backed by venture capitalists but of providing seed capital to small ventures, Laurie was able to structure the acquisition of Newport Technology with very little venture backing. Because Newport Technology Group was relatively lowly geared, Laurie was able to use the assets within the company as security for bank loans, thereby reducing the amount of equity he needed to sell to venture backers. He did this by securing a so-called financial assistance statement from the company's directors. Such financial assistance statements can be granted by private companies being acquired if the assistance does not reduce its net assets by more than the amount it could lawfully pay out in dividends, or if the directors and auditors can confirm the company will be able to pay its debts over the next year. Such mechanisms can reduce the amount of equity an entrepreneur needs to sell to venture backers, according to Richard Kennett, a solicitor at Laytons, who helped Laurie structure the deal. However, many first-time entrepreneurs seeking venture capital may not be aware of this route. This arrangement meant the venture capital backers had to come in as ordinary shareholders with no special rights to dividends or performance ratchets. There is little doubt that investing behind or alongside entrepreneurs who have done it before should increase the chances of a venture's success. There again, if all seasoned entrepreneurs are as good negotiators as Laurie perhaps it is not surprising that venture capitalists prefer greener customers. *Venture Capitalists and Serial Entrepreneurs.

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Clinton-Yeltsin summit is set for early in April PRESIDENTS Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin will hold their first summit on April 4, at a venue yet to be decided. The announcement was made by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, at a joint news conference which followed a three-hour meeting in Geneva yesterday. Mr Clinton had hoped the meeting, which would be his first foreign trip since becoming president, could be held sometime next month. But Mr Kozyrev said the agenda could be so extensive as to require considerable preparation. The president is giving considerable attention both to finding ways of helping Russian reforms and to continue to engage Moscow in global problems, including bringing peace to former Yugoslavia. He has also sought to play down talk in Washington that Mr Yeltsin's own position was becoming increasingly parlous. A holdover Bush appointee at the State Department was this week removed from his post for publicly suggesting that the Russian president might no longer be a reliable partner because of his domestic political difficulties. On Wednesday, Mr Clinton expressed full confidence in Mr Yeltsin. The two men met briefly last summer in Washington when Mr Clinton was still a presidential candidate. Mr Christopher said in Geneva that Mr Clinton had asked him to underscore 'his strong personal support for the reform policies of the Yeltsin administration'. Yesterday, Mr Yeltsin suffered a fresh humiliation in his battle with the parliament chairman, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov. Deputies refused to even discuss Mr Yeltsin's proposals for a constitutional truce after Mr Khasbulatov told them they were designed to limit their powers. Parliament also put off until next Thursday a debate on whether to call a special congress to discuss the plans. Mr Christopher described his meeting with Mr Kozyrev as 'very good and businesslike'. They discussed issues likely to feature on the April summit agenda. Apart from the Middle East, these included the conflict in ex-Yugoslavia, arms control and proliferation, and US support for Russian economic reforms. Mr Kozyrev said they had discussed possible co-operation in trade and investment, the rescheduling of Russia's foreign debt and Russian sales of conventional weapons.</p>

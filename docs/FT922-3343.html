			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Mobil tests demand for sterling paper FIRMER demand for sterling bonds was tested yesterday by a Pounds 110m seven-year deal for Mobil North Sea Oil. The deal was considered aggressively priced to yield 30 basis points more than the comparable gilt issue. Deutsche Bank Capital Markets won the mandate to arrange the issue, after the borrower took bids from a range of banks. Eurosterling bonds are trading at historically tight levels. The World Bank's 10 per cent Eurobonds 1999 are yielding 23 basis points less than the comparable gilt. Deutsche Bank said the pricing was reasonable compared with BP's 9 1/2 per cent Eurobonds due 1998 which are trading at a spread of 32 basis points over the curve, since BP is considered a weaker credit than Mobil. Nevertheless, a 30 basis point spread was considered over-ambitious by some dealers. 'We did sell bonds, but could not have got rid of a large chunk,' said one trader. The deal was quoted at 99.40, fractionally above its fixed reoffer price. Dealers have reported that the Eurosterling bond market has been a beneficiary, to some degree, of the malaise in some other European bond markets. Although the sterling bond market lost some ground after the Danes rejected the Maastricht Treaty, it has held up relatively well, and is one of the higher-yielding European markets still considered relatively secure. Dealers report some funds put aside for the Ecu bond market have been used to buy sterling Eurobonds. In the French franc sector, two new issues emerged on the back of firmer market conditions. Credit Local de France added FFr1bn to its recent issue of 15-year zero-coupon bonds, while Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer Francais, the national railway, issued FFr3bn bonds, split between domestic and international investors. A further French franc deal is expected to add to already heavy supply in the sector this week when Caisse Nationale des Autoroutes, the motorway financing agency, taps the market today. CNA is believed to be preparing a FFr2bn nine-year deal, having cancelled plans to issue in Ecu.</p>

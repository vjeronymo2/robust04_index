			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Regarding the issue of the DPRK's (North Korea)  suspected nuclear arms development, by 9 February, Japan, the  United States, and South Korea had agreed on an understanding  that if there is no change in North Korea's position of refusing  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),  economic sanctions by the UN Security Council would be  inevitable. This was revealed by a government source. The  Japanese Government -- primarily, the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and  the Ministry of Finance -- will soon begin studying taking such  specific measures as restricting trade with North Korea and  stopping remittances to North Korea by Korean residents in  Japan. In the Japan-U.S. summit meeting on 11 February, Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa also wants to confirm that Japan will  maintain close contact with the United States on ways to deal  with North Korea.    Since North Korea declared its withdrawal from the Nuclear  Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) in March last year, Japan has  continued to take a cautious attitude of watching the question  of enforcing economic sanctions against North Korea, hoping the  matter will be resolved through the U.S.-DPRK talks and  South-North Korea dialogue.    But the DPRK-IAEA talks underway since late last month,  which  came on the heels of the U.S.-DPRK talks, again reached an  impasse. The situation is now such that (according to a UN  diplomatic source) it looks as if "there is no choice but to  begin discussions on economic sanctions against North Korea" if  the IAEA, at its Executive Council meeting on 21 and 22  February, decides to move the North Korean question onto the UN  Security Council. Under such circumstances, Japan, the United  States, and South Korea held a working-level meeting in New York  on 4 February to discuss measures to deal with the situation.    If the UN Security Council decides on economic sanctions,  the  Japanese Government will begin revising government rules on  trade control, foreign exchange control, and control of entry  into, and departure from, the country as necessary; it wants to  freeze money remittance channels such as ships traveling between  Niigata and Wonsan (North Korea), and foreign banks in such  places as Hong Kong.    According to trade statistics for 1992, Japan-DPRK trade  included: 28.28 billion yen in exports from Japan of products  like textiles and machinery products, and 22.68 billion yen in  imports from North Korea of textiles, nonmetallic minerals, and  others. It has recently been learned that some Japanese  products including high-tech equipment have been converted to  military use. Concerns have also been raised over the reports  that Korean residents in Japan are sending funds to the tune of  60 to 100 billion yen a year to North Korea.    Furthermore, the Japan-U.S. summit meeting on 11 February is  expected to take up the policy on North Korea, and to confirm  the position: "If IAEA security measures do not transpire, Japan  and the United States should cooperate in deciding on what to do  as the next step." A government source said: "It is clear  `what the next step' means." Thus he indicated that enforcing  economic sanctions will be considered step by step.</p>

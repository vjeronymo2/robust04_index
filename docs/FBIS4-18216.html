			<p>BFN     [Text] Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams today stepped up  pressure on the British government to open talks with his party.    Welcoming the IRA's three-day Easter ceasefire, he insisted  Sinn Fein had a right to be treated in the same way as Northern  Ireland's other political parties.    At a news conference in Belfast, Mr Adams sat alongside  leading Sinn Fein official Martin McGuinness and said the  ceasefire was a move along the road towards a lasting peace.    Mr Adams said he had faxed the Prime Minister at No. 10  asking him to "authorise direct talks with Sinn Fein." These  should be in the context of "clarification -- not negotiation."  But he said Mr. Major was under considerable political  pressure, adding: "We know that he has problems within his own  party but he should take time to reflect on how the situation  can be moved forward.    ``The IRA's initiative creates an opportunity to break this  stalemate which has been created by London's refusal to provide  clarification for Sinn Fein in the same way as it has been  provided to all other parties. There was now an opportunity to  move on and enter into the next phase of the peace process.    ``Mr. Major should see this way to be flexible. To refuse to  talk, to be exclusive, to try to marginalise any section of our  people, may be safe but it will not bring lasting peace,'' Mr.  Adams declared.    He shrugged off criticism that the ceasefire was a cynical  public relations gesture, claiming that reaction was  "predictable." But he stressed the vast majority of people in  Ireland and Britain wanted peace and welcomed all advances in  the peace process.</p>

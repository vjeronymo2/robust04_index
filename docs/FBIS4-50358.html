			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 15 KYODO -- A delegation of the Social  Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ], Japan's second largest  opposition grouping, arrived in Beijing on Sunday [15 May] and  conveyed a conciliatory message to China from Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata.    The eight-member delegation headed by SDP General Secretary  Wataru Kubo met with Ding Guangen, chief of the Chinese  Communist Party's Propaganda Department, and expressed Hata's  assurances that Japan will remain mindful of its past aggression  in Asia, delegation sources said.    The message follows Hata's letter last week to Chinese  Premier Li Peng, in which he tried to repair damage done earlier  this month when then Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano denied  Japan's aggression during World War II and asserted that the  1937 Nanjing massacre was a fabrication. Nagano has since  resigned.    Hata restated in a policy speech on May 10 that Japan  recognizes its "past actions, including aggression and colonial  rule, had caused unbearable suffering and sorrow for many  people."    Ding was quoted as telling the delegation that "a correct  understanding of history is the basis of friendly China-Japan  relations."    He added it is undeniable that the two nations have deviated  from that aim during the 22 years of re-established diplomatic  ties.    The SDP delegation, which will meet on Tuesday with General  Secretary Jiang Zemin, is on an eight-day visit to mark the 10th  anniversary of exchanges with the Chinese Communist Party. The  mission will return on May 22 after visiting Dalian and  Changchun.</p>

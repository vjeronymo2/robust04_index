			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Candidates to lead FAO stress reform THE FOOD and Agriculture Organisation, the United Nations' biggest specialised agency, meets tomorrow to choose a successor to its director-general, Mr Edouard Saouma, who has held the post for 18 years. Mr Saouma's leadership and in particular the FAO's bloated administrative budget have been widely criticised. Several countries channeling aid through the FAO - particularly the Nordic countries - have withheld funds because of their lack of confidence in his leadership. The successful candidate will have a tough job re-establishing the organisation's credibility with its sponsors and most of the nine candidates are campaigning on a reform ticket. The election comes as the FAO is predicting a 0.5 per cent decline in world agricultural production this year. Front-runners stress their willingness to concentrate resources on tackling world hunger and environmental problems, while also shaking up the FAO administration. Mr Geoffrey Miller, who until recently headed Australia's department of primary industries and energy, wants to send more officials out to work in the field rather than in the organisation's huge Rome headquarters, where some 3,000 of the FAO's 5,289 staff are employed. The other two leading contenders come from within the FAO's ranks. Chile's Mr Rafael Moreno is currently assistant director-general and has gained support from most Latin American countries. He highlights the need to tie environmental legislation more closely to the FAO's projects. Mr Maharaj Muthoo from India has been director of the FAO's forestry operations for the past 14 years. He stresses the need to tackle hunger in Africa as a top priority.</p>

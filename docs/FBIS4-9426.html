			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Kiro Gligorov, president of The </F> Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, by Soren Ostergaard  Sorensen in Skopje; date not given]    [Text] Skopje -- More than any other European country,  Denmark has defended the new Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] nation and shown greater courage  and firmness of principle in the country's conflict with its  southern neighbor, Greece. This lavish praise comes from a head  of state 2,500 km from Copenhagen. In an exclusive interview  with BERLINGSKE TIDENDE, Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov gave  the credit to the Danes for the fact that 11 European Union (EU)  countries have now taken Greece to the European Court and have  through diplomatic channels been pressing the Greeks into a  corner to bring to end to the heated campaign against the  Macedonian Government.    The Greeks' blockade is threatening to destabilize not only  the whole of the southern Balkans, President Gligorov said. A  destabilization which in the final analysis could lead to a  bloody new Balkan war. But the present and previous Danish  governments have been the most active in trying to prevent such  a development, the president told BERLINGSKE TIDENDE in the  Macedonian capital of Skopje.    "Denmark is the most encouraging ray of light in the EU. A  small country which courageously remains firm on its principles  and dares voice them internationally. This is something that I  think will be remembered in the EU and to a special extent here  in Macedonia. Denmark shows that you should live up to the  documents you sign, the documents which form the foundation for  the European architecture. At the same time Denmark's stance is  a defense of all small countries and therefore also a defense of  Denmark itself," said Kiro Gligorov, who does not on the whole  think that the EU has done enough to defend Macedonia against  its Greek neighbor.    "Throughout the lengthy period since the conflict with  Greece  started, the EU could have gone to work much more toughly. We  are after all talking about actions undertaken by an EU country.  It is a conflict on the EU's borders, and a serious precedent  will be set if the EU is unable to solve this problem. The  point has now been reached at which the EU had to intervene and  take Greece to court. Such a course of action was inevitable and  hopefully Greece will reach its conclusions and preempt the  trial by lifting the blockade. We would like to avoid the trial  taking place. But if this does happen and Greece is found  guilty, we take the view that the EU must find sufficient means  to pressurize Greece into lifting the blockade," the Macedonian  president said, pointing out that the EU also has an economic  interest in having the blockade lifted as soon as possible,  because Macedonia will confront the organization with demands  for compensation for the enormous losses the small nation is  suffering because of its isolation. President Gligorov  estimates that the loss of income from trade and the  repercussions for industry and agriculture amount to $86 million  per month (more than half a billion kroner).    The conflict with Greece still centers on three main  complaints. The Greeks are demanding that Macedonia should  change its name, its flag and its national symbols, and its  Constitution. All of these are symbols which the Greeks fear  could lead at some later date to the little country's making  territorial demands on northern Greece. The use of the Vergina  star in Macedonia's flag which is thought to have been Alexander  the Great's royal symbol, is viewed in Athens as tantamount to  the theft of Hellenic culture. That is why Athens is demanding  that the flag and symbol must be removed before the blockade can  be lifted.    President Gligorov, who is depicted in Greece as a diabolic  Greater Macedonian nationalist and dictator, sat in the  presidential palace next to the red-gold flag with the sun of  Vergina which he is unwilling to abandon to satisfy the Greeks'  "national hysteria."    ``Throughout this process we have shown the greatest amount  of goodwill vis-a-vis the Greeks' problems. But there has to be  a limit to how far we can go, if we are not to give up our  national identity completely. It can be in no one's interest  that this should happen. It could lead to similar demands from  other neighbors. It could destabilize not only our own country  but the whole region and Greece in the process, if we gave in to  all these demands. We need an agreement which respects our  national identity and creates a foundation for a permanent and  peaceful relationship between our two countries.    "Here in the Balkans where everything is mixed up in great  confusion symbols take on very great significance. But many of  our symbols in this region are common property, and I think that  it is important that in the future we should view with tolerance  and understanding the symbols as common property. The Greek  antique culture is part of the cultural legacy of the whole of  mankind. If the heated atmosphere in Greece continues and  national frustrations remain as they are now it will be  impossible to find a solution," Kiro Gligorov said, stressing  that Macedonia is the only republic which has left the former  Yugoslavia without acts of hostility as a result.    "Instead of always talking about Macedonia as a powder keg  which could explode any minute, Macedonia should be seen as  fundamental pillar of peace and stability in the Balkans.  Despite all the warnings and threat scenarios we have succeeded  in creating a stable and peaceful society. If this had NOT  happened, the war in Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina  would have spread south and would have created an all-embracing  Balkan war," said Kiro Gligorov, who thinks that the biggest  external danger to Macedonia is an explosion of the tense  situation in Albanian-dominated Serbian province of Kosovo. If  it comes to violent clashes between Kosovo Albanians and the  Serbian authorities, this could trigger a flood of refugees to  the south which could threaten stability in Macedonia where  there exists a very fine and difficult ethnic balance between  the Macedonian majority and the large Albanian minority. In  such a situation President Gligorov would expect the countries  of the West to help by taking the perhaps several hundreds of  thousands of Kosovo Albanian refugees.    "There is a danger of a destabilization of Macedonia in the  event of a conflict in Kosovo, and in such a situation the  refugee problem would probably be dramatic. As a small, poor  country we will not be in a position to accept a very large  number of these refugees, quite simply because we cannot create  a life for them here and because we would not be able to  guarantee our own internal stability. Our task in such a  situation would therefore be to collect the refugees at the  border and have them transported on to countries which have a  better chance of taking them on and where there is no political  danger involved in accepting these refugees."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, March 14 (AFP) -- The UN's Human Rights  Commission [UNHRC] should have new powers to punish  uncooperative states and promote democracy, rather than just  react to past violations, its president said Monday [14 March].    Speaking to journalists at the end of the Commission's  annual  six-week session, Dutch diplomat Pieter van Wulfften Palthe  demanded reforms to enable the Commission to encourage  "democratisation in the world" rather than "look towards the  past."    A working group would try to reform the Commission during  1994 to make it more "relevant to the outside world" and cut  down on "long reports and speeches," he told a press conference.    The Commission should also deal "in a much stronger way"  with  states that refused to cooperate with human rights rapporteurs  and the UN system generally, such as Iraq, Iran, Cuba, and Sudan.    "The one thing international law lacks is sanctions," said  Palthe. "It is the same with the Commission on Human Rights  (...) Unfortunately there are no sanctions mechanisms," he  commented.    He singled out Sudan, which had denounced as "blasphemy  against Islam" a critical report by special UN human rights  rapporteur Gaspar Biro.    "The Sudanese attacks against Mr. Biro are quite  unacceptable. I'm glad the Commission condemned this unwarranted  attack," he said.    The group's 53 member states had acknowledged the changes in  South Africa but had not shown enough recognition of the Middle  East peace process, he said.    The disputed Indonesian territory of East Timor had been  less  controversial this year because of Jakarta's cooperation, but  India and Pakistan had "abused the Commission's time" by their  long debates on the "highly political" question of Kashmir.    "The Commission is not a place for bilateral disputes," he  commented.    Palthe said he would be appointing someone within the next  few weeks to take up the newly created post of special  rapporteur on violence against women, who would then be  confirmed by UN headquarters in New York this June.</p>

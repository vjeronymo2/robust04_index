			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Banana sales crisis forces Ecuador to reduce producer prices by 9% IN RESPONSE to a growing sales crisis and international price slump, Ecuador, the world's largest banana exporter, has cut the price of its bananas. The government-regulated price that exporters pay producers is down by 40 US cents a box, or nearly 9 per cent, from last month. Sales in the first four months of this year were down 31 per cent from the same period last year. About 17 per cent of the fall was caused by diminished sales volume (649,000 tonnes this year), while a decrease in price accounted for the rest. With prices having been driven lower by oversupply on the world market, and with the European Community import restrictions likely to cut sales further, Ecuador's price cut is an attempt to boost its competitiveness. Announcing the price cut, Mr Mariano Gonzalez, the minister of agriculture, said it was 'intended to aid our exporters and signal to consumers that we are serious about remaining competitive'. He added: 'We hope the measure will mitigate our sales crisis somewhat in the second half of the year.' The productivity of Ecuador's banana plantations compares unfavourably with that of its competitors. While growers in Honduras produce 2,800 boxes a hectare and those in Costa Rica 3,000 boxes, Ecuador's manage to average only 1,400 boxes a hectare. But lower overall costs have so far enabled Ecuadorian bananas to be more competitive internationally. The Union of Banana Growers and Exporters, an organisation representing producers from Central America and Columbia, blames Ecuador, which has increased its planted area by at least 30 per cent since 1991, for the current oversupply. The EC restrictions are certain to reduce Ecuador's sales volume further and analysts estimate that the country faces a potential loss of Dollars 70m. Mr Jose Riofrio, head of promotion and marketing for bananas in the ministry of agriculture, says that at least 20,000 hectares of banana plantations will have to be destroyed or phased out to compensate for the sales loss resulting from EC import restrictions. He adds, however, that only the least productive fields will be eliminated. Mr Riofrio does not expect the price of bananas to fall much further. 'The price in European markets is stabilising,' he says, 'while floods on plantation and strikes by industry workers in Central America and Columbia are curbing supply in the short-term.' Ecuador will not face the full force of the crisis until late this year when the country's banana harvest reaches its peak and new crop supplies will flood the market. Meanwhile, street vendors in Quito and Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest cities, have begun to sell export quality bananas, usually earmarked for the US or Europe, at bargain prices.</p>

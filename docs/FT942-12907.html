			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Savings help Amdahl return to surplus Amdahl, the US mainframe computer company, returned to profit in its first quarter, following heavy losses last year blamed on restructuring. First-quarter net income was Dollars 7.1m, or 6 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 378.8m. In the same period last year, Amdahl reported a net loss of Dollars 239.7m, or Dollars 2.12 a share, after pre-tax restructuring charges of Dollars 243m reduced net income by Dollars 1.57 a share. Revenues were Dollars 380.7m. Over the past year, the company has cut its workforce and manufacturing capacity to bring expenses and production capabilities into line with poor market conditions. Operating expenses, exclusive of restructuring charges, declined by some 30 per cent against the same period last year. Gross profit margins rose 34 per cent from less than 22 per cent a year ago. Increased demand and improved profit margins on mainframes contributed to better-than-expected first-quarter performance. Mainframe prices appeared to be stabilising, said Mr Joseph Zemke, president and chief executive. 'We regard our return to profitability as a step in the right direction,' Mr Zemke said. However, he cautioned that it was too early to call the improvement a turnround.</p>

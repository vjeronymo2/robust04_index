			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Lec suffers fall to Pounds 1.68m loss Lec Refrigeration, the refrigeration equipment manufacturer, suffered pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.68m for the six months ended June 30 which reflected, it said, 'the persistently disappointing economic climate in the UK'. There were profits of Pounds 320,000 last time. After a tax credit of Pounds 553,000 (Pounds 106,000 charge) losses per share were given as 18.58p against 3.54p earnings while, in view of the relative strength of the balance sheet, the interim dividend is maintained at 4p. Turnover for the six months rose slightly from Pounds 19.34m to Pounds 19.61m. The directors stated that while market share had been maintained, that was only at the expense of reduced gross margins.</p>

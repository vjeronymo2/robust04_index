			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Dahlia R. Dugtong] </F>   [Text] The Department of Trade and Industry is harping on  a $600 to $800 million trade target this year with the People's  Republic of China as a result of the signing of the Protocol on  the Importation and Exportation of Commodities between the two  countries.    The protocol was agreed on last week in Beijing, China  during  the 17th meeting of the RP [Republic of the Philippines]-China  Joint Trade Committee.    Trade Undersecretary Cesar Bautista also forecasts the  narrowing of the trade deficit with China.    Last year, the trade deficit with China was registered at $7  million, the lowest since 1988 when trade deficit was $175  million. Mr. Bautista added that the country expects a balancing  of trade with China as the latter moves towards readmission to  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    Under the protocol, Mr. Bautista said the following export  products from the Philippines are expected to benefit most from  the trade protocol: phosphatic and compound fertilizer, fresh  bananas, chrome ore, mangoes, shelled cashew nuts, copper  cathodes, coconut oil, tin plates, cold-rolled steel, copper  concentrate, manganese ore, phosphoric acid, fatty acid and  alcohol, refined glycerine, copper wire bars, rods, floppy disk  drives, black and white picture tubes, and, processed coffee.    On the other hand, the Philippines will import from China  items like soya beans, light machineries for garment  manufacturers, power generators or mini-hydros, Mr. Bautista  identified.    While the government expects a substantial increase in trade  in China, Mr. Bautista said China's investments in the  Philippines will still "take a backseat," primarily because of  lack of capital.    The Filipino delegation that participated in the negotiation  of the protocol included Peter Chua of the Philippine-China  Trade Council, Victoriano Lecaros of the Philippine Embassy in  Beijing, and officials from the Department of Trade and Industry.</p>

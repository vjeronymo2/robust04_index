			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Chancellor not backed Sir, The first paragraph of Peter Norman's otherwise accurate account ('Cross-party group of MPs backs Clarke's fiscal policies', January 20) of the Commons Treasury select committee's report on the November Budget gives a misleading impression because it implies that opposition MPs backed the chancellor's fiscal policies. In fact, the published minutes of the proceedings of the committee show that we supported two amendments which expressed our fears about the scale of the tax increases announced in the last two Budgets, equivalent, as the chancellor admitted to the committee, to 7p on the standard rate of tax. We were (and remain) concerned that the severity of these rises would not only 'bear heavily on vulnerable sections of society' but also put economic recovery 'at risk'. Giles Radice, Labour MP for North Durham, member, Treasury select committee, House of Commons, London SW1</p>

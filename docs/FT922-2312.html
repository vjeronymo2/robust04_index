			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Gieves plans to raise Pounds 3.9m GIEVES GROUP is selling its Bookpoint book distributor for Pounds 1.4m cash to Headline Book Publishing and raising Pounds 2.5m through a placing of convertible secured loan stock. The group, which has interests in clothing, retailing and publishing and includes Gieves &amp; Hawkes the Savile Row tailor, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.51m (Pounds 428,000)in the year to January 31, after exceptional charges of Pounds 1.71m and taking into account discontinued activities. The sale and placing are part of Gieves strategy of focusing on its core businesses. Roundabout, the motor distributor, has been sold to its management and Redwood Press to the Bath Press Group. Headline is Bookpoint's largest customer, accounting for 27 per cent of sales. Trading profits for the year to end-January were Pounds 441,000, against Pounds 280,000 on turnover of Pounds 3.97m. The consideration was satisfied by the issue of 700,000 shares which have been conditionally placed. Headline is placing a further 100,000 shares to cover acquisition expenses. Its shares fell 3p to 205p. The convertible loan stock has been placed with a wholly-owned subsidiary of USI Holdings, a Hong Kong-quoted company which is controlled by Wing Tai, the Singapore clothing company. The loan is redeemable at par on July 31 2000. USI can convert into shares at its option at any time up to three months before the redemption date at a rate of 2 shares for every Pounds 1 of loan stock. Full conversion would give USI a holding of 26.8 per cent. Wing Tai says it does not intend in the next 12 months to acquire shares that would take its holding above 29.9 per cent allowing for full conversion. It also does not intend to make a full offer without the agreement of the Gieves board. Group turnover was lower at Pounds 48.5m (Pounds 53.7m). The pre-tax figure included losses of Pounds 634,000 (Pounds 1.14m) relating to the sold book and magazine manufacturers and the motor and petrol retailers. Losses per share were 11.1p (3.1p). The final dividend is being passed as was the interim.</p>

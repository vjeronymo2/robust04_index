			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: VW and Ford loosen links in Autolatina Soaring Brazilian car production and increasing rivalry between dealers has forced Ford and Volkswagen to loosen their links in Autolatina, the holding company for their joint operations in Brazil and Argentina. The companies will no longer produce similar-looking vehicles from common production platforms, but instead use the world platforms of their parent companies. However, they have not confirmed local media reports that Autolatina will be disbanded. Autolatina plans to produce the Fiesta model locally because of the growing Brazilian market for small cars. The company intends to invest Dollars 400m in the venture by the end of next year. Autolatina was formed in 1987 during a period of low production and investment in Brazil's car industry. Recent growth and the opening of Brazil's economy led to the decision to use world platforms, according to company president Mr Pierre-Alain de Smedt. Pressure from VW dealers, reluctant to share the platform for the new Golf model with Ford, also contributed. Mr de Smedt said Ford and VW would have more autonomy within Autolatina but the holding company would continue in areas such as purchasing, administration and legal services. The Brazilian car market has been recovering since 1992 thanks to pacts between the industry and the government, which reduced vehicle taxes.</p>

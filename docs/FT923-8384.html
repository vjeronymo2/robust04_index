			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / A taste of one's own medicine: Chile's olive growers have challenged the word of one of Europe's green businessmen There is a far-flung corner of Stephan Schmidheiny's business empire that is not as green as the Swiss magnate's concern for the environment. Schmidheiny, founder of the Business Council for Sustainable Development and voice of enlightened corporations at the Rio Earth Summit, is a leading shareholder in an iron pellet plant which is destroying the livelihood of hundreds of farmers in the Huasco Valley of northern Chile. The valley used to be Chile's leading producer of olives - harvesting some 6,000 tonnes a year, according to local agriculture inspectors - until the pellet plant was built in 1978. Today, the olive harvest barely reaches 1,000 tonnes. Standing in the middle of an olive grove planted by his grandfather, Gregorio Gonzalez points to the cause: the canopies of his sturdy trees are pitch black. The evergreen leaves are encrusted with iron dust. They leap to a magnet like pins. 'Our trees are dying,' says Gonzalez. 'The leaves are choking. The dust withers the flowers. Some years they bear no fruit. In other years, the olives are so badly stained that we cannot sell them.' Many farmers, he says, are being forced to uproot their trees, which are sold for firewood. His warehouse used to hold up to 100 tonnes of olives. It is almost empty now. In a neighbouring hacienda, Julio Cereceda, the foreman, says: 'The owners employ us out of charity. The olive trees are barren.' Yet several years passed before farmers linked their dwindling harvests to the smoking chimneys of the pellet plant. 'The company denied it was emitting iron dust,' says Gonzalez. 'It said the iron came from the sand-dunes.' Lacking scientific evidence to prove the contrary, the farmers lost a lawsuit brought against Compania Minera del Pacifico (CMP), the owner of the plant, in 1986. The dispute resurfaced with Chile's return to democracy, which brought a novel concern for the environment. In March 1990, the Mining Research Council began monitoring emissions at the plant. It was belching more than 37 tonnes of particulate matter, mainly iron dust, a day. If the plant were located in the US, it would have been breaching Environmental Protection Agency norms more than 50 times over. But the dearth of environmental legislation in Chile allowed CMP to claim that it was not polluting the valley. The new political leaders also had to deal with CMP's economic clout. The company is not coy about its importance as the main employer and benefactor in an impoverished province on the fringes of the Atacama desert. 'The Huasco valley lives off CMP,' Luis Villagran, CMP's public relations officer, explains. 'We pay Dollars 24m (Pounds 12.5m) a year in wages. We are everywhere, donating ambulances, fire engines, building schools and sports grounds.' But when Carlos Gonzalez, the new regional governor, first approached CMP about the need to curb emissions, he says the company threatened to close down the plant. Meanwhile, Gregorio Gonzalez was preparing to aim his slingshot at the Goliath of his valley. New evidence, from a study conducted by the Agriculture Research Council, proved that CMP's iron emissions were the same substances that fell on the olive groves. The Huasco farmers filed an injunction against CMP's polluting activities. An appeals court last June found CMP guilty of 'polluting the environment . . . inhibiting the normal development of plant life, and the main farming activity, olive growing, in particular.' It ruled that CMP's emissions violated the olive growers' constitutional right to live in a pollution-free environment. It declared the emissions illegal. CMP, and its parent company, Compania de Aceros del Pacifico (Pacific Steel Company), in which Schmidheiny owns a 30 per cent stake, appealed against the ruling before the Chilean Supreme Court. CMP argued it had curbed emissions since monitoring began two years ago. The company also claimed to have studies showing that poor farming techniques were responsible for the shrinking olive harvests. Last week, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the olive growers. CMP will be forced to curb its emissions drastically in line with new regulations that come into effect in October. 'It is absurd,' says Fernando Dougnac, the farmers' lawyer, 'that we had to fight all the way to the Supreme Court to prove that companies in Chile do not always practise what they preach.' The ruling also sets a precedent for other agricultural communities who feel threatened by the proximity of mining smelters and refineries. 'We believe in sustainable development,' says Erick Weber, CMP's research and development vice-president. 'But the farmers are not interested in technical solutions, they are after monetary compensation.' The farmers are indeed preparing a civil action for damages of Dollars 35m against CMP. They are eager to test one of Schmidheiny's maxims, often mouthed by his executives in Chile: 'The polluter pays'.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Cummins sees quarterly operating loss of Dollars 34.3m CUMMINS Engine, one of the world's leading diesel engine makers, suffered a first-quarter operating loss and warned of a further decline in the North American heavy truck market. Cummins' bottom line was bolstered by various accounting changes, which resulted in net earnings of Dollars 17.2m, or Dollars 1.02 a share, compared with Dollars 8.9m, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier. But sales slipped to Dollars 811.5m from Dollars 861.4m, and there was a loss before the accounting changes of Dollars 34.3m. A new inventory accounting method and an adjustment to the method of depreciating engine production equipment produced a one-time gain of Dollars 26.5m. The company expects to decide within the next month whether to cut its dividend from the present annual rate of Dollars 2.20 a share. This month Cummins said its second-quarter operating loss would be cut substantially provided production volumes hold, but it warned yesterday that a further drop in the truck market is expected over the next few months. North American heavy-truck output has sunk by 45 per cent since the first quarter of 1989 and by 14 per cent since last summer. Cummins said the UK truck market and worldwide orders for off-highway vehicles have also weakened 'significantly'. The company has laid off another 170 workers at its US heavy-truck engine plants this month, bringing the cuts to 3,800 people, or 14 per cent of the worldwide workforce, in the past months.</p>

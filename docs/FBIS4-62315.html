			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov and Konstantin </F> Pribytkov]    [Text] Geneva May 13 TASS -- Foreign ministers from Russia,  the United States and five European countries met on Friday in  the U.S. mission to the UN European headquarters. Andrey  Kozyrev, Warren Christopher and their counterparts from Greece,  Belgium, Germany, France and Great Britain try to elaborate a  common position towards Bosnian settlement and bring the  conflicting parties back to the negotiating table.    According to Kozyrev, the discussion is unlike to be easy.  Speaking to reporters upon his arrival in Geneva, the Russian  foreign minister said that "although everybody understands the  necessity of instant termination of combat actions, every party  (at the negotiations) tries to insert additional demands into  this definition".    Kozyrev estimated chances of compromise, at least over  principal approaches towards the problem, as 50-50, but said  that Boris Yeltsin's recent peace proposals "have a good chance  to become a backbone of possible decisions".</p>

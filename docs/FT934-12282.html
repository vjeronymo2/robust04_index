			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Strong competition pushes Northern Telecom into loss WEAK DEMAND and fierce competition in the North American telephone switch market contributed to a third-quarter loss at Northern Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker. The Toronto-based company continued to predict, however, that it would return to the black in the fourth quarter. Earlier this year Northern announced a reorganisation, including the loss of about 5,000 jobs. The third-quarter loss of Dollars 33.7m, or 13 cents a share, compared with earnings of Dollars 116.2m, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues slipped to Dollars 1.88bn from Dollars 2.02bn. Revenues from central-office switches, cable and transmission products all declined. They were partly offset by 'good growth' in multimedia communications systems. Order input for the quarter of Dollars 2.34bn was 3 per cent higher, while orders on hand rose by almost a third to Dollars 4.41bn on September 30. Northern broke a tradition yesterday by not making its chief executive available to comment on the results. However, Mr Jean Monty said in a press release that the company was encouraged by growth in its international business and by strong revenue gains from its fledgling wireless products. Costs associated with the restructuring, which were taken in the second quarter, drove the company to a Dollars 984.5m loss in the first nine months of 1993, compared with earnings of Dollars 283.3m last year. The third-quarter results were in line with analysts' expectations, and Northern's share price rose 62 cents on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday to CDollars 35.50 at midday.</p>

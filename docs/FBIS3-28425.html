It warns that the DPRK will counter hard line with hard line  and its tough stance will be clearly shown in practice rather  than in words.    Commenting on the creation by the United States of a grave  crisis that may lead the process of the solution of the nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula to a collapse, the analyst says:    Officially urging the DPRK to accept the unjustifiable  demand  of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for a  comprehensive inspection, the United States is threatening  that unless the demand is accepted it will not hold talks with  the DPRK but take "sanctions". Worse still, they are even  crying for a "special inspection" of the DPRK's two military  sites which have nothing to do with nuclear activities.    The U.S. official quarters are blaring that another  military rehearsal targeted against the DPRK will be staged, if  the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises are suspended this  year, that it would take place in other region if not in South  Korea.    And the U.S. hardline conservative forces are promoting in  full scale the supply of Patriot missils to the U.S. troops  present in South Korea under the pretext of coping with the  DPRK's "missile attack."    The U.S. Administration hurriedly dispatched the director of  the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to South Korea at  the beginning of the new year to have a confab for "the  intensification of intelligence against North Korea" and is  operating in South Korea an "intelligence supporting team"  composed of specialists of the CIA and the Defence Intelligence  Agency. This clearly indicates that the new war provocation  moves of the United States against the DPRK have reached a  full-scale stage.    All the facts clearly prove that the United States has no  intention at all to solve the nuclear issue of the Korean  peninsula peacefully and is still pursuing the purpose of  strangling the DPRK and destroying socialism with strength at  whatever cost.    The United States should ponder over the matter, clearly  understanding that with nothing can it frighten the Korean  people.</p>

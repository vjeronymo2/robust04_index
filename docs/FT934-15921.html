			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Survey of Taiwan (8): Important role in PC revolution - Industry TAKE the lid off a personal computer and the chances are very high that the main circuit board inside will have been manufactured in Taiwan. The island now boasts a 70 per cent share of the world market for PC 'motherboards' and is the largest producer of the latest 'notebook PCs', prompting some to rename it the 'Republic of Computers'. Information technology is now the cornerstone of Taiwan's economy, reflecting a rapid shift away from its traditional labour-intensive industries towards advanced technology including semiconductor chips, computers and computer peripherals. Last year, with sales of Dollars 8.7bn, electronics products became Taiwan's biggest export. The personal computer is at the core of Taiwan's emergence as a world player in information technology. Last year Taiwan's exports of PC hardware reached Dollars 6.6bn, according to Dataquest, the market research group, which predicts an 11.7 per cent increase to Dollars 7.4bn this year. PC circuit boards alone accounted for Dollars 980m in exports last year, while exports of computer monitors (displays) totalled Dollars 2.3bn. Taiwan is also the top producer of the computer 'mouse' - the device used to move a cursor around a computer screen - with an 80 per cent share of the world market, according to government statistics. Yet Taiwan's role in the PC revolution has gone largely unnoticed outside the computer industry. With the exception of Acer, Taiwan's largest PC producer, most of the computers made in Taiwan are sold under the names of foreign companies such as IBM or Apple Computer. 'Taiwan is the arms dealer to the warlords of the PC industry,' says Mr Robert Lo, manager of the Taiwan operations of Intel, the leading US semiconductor manufacturer. But why Taiwan? Ironically, IBM, whose original personal computer design gave birth to an industry of 'PC clones', played a central role in the creation of the island's PC industry. IBM established a procurement office in Taiwan in the 1960s, when the island's economy was based on low-cost, labour-intensive manufacturing. Tatung, now one of Taiwan's largest PC manufacturers, was an early partner of IBM , manufacturing parts for its mainframe computers. Following the introduction of the IBM PC, in 1981, IBM chose TECO, a leading Taiwanese television manufacturer, to mass produce personal computer monitors. Other Taiwan companies followed TECO into the monitor market , sparking an export boom and fuelling Taiwanese interest in the PC business. In the same period , the Taiwanese government was actively encouraging the establishment of high technology enterprises through its Industrial Technology Research Institute (Itri). Seizing the opportunity created by the standards-based IBM PC, Itri designed one of the first 'clones' of IBM's PC XT , thus providing a fillip to Taiwan's fledgling PC industry. Over the past 10 years the Taiwan government has continued to play an important behind-the-scenes role in the island's computer industry, representing Taiwan manufacturers in their negotiations with foreign companies, undertaking research and development efforts, and providing training and market research assistance. Taiwan's semiconductor industry, which supplies components to its PC and PC board manufacturers, provides another example of the blend of government-sponsored initiatives and private-sector ingenuity. Its foundations were laid in the early 1970s by K T Li, then the minister of finance and widely known as the 'father' of Taiwan's information industry. A frequent visitor to the US and Japan, Li established a government-funded semiconductor development project in Taiwan under the auspices of the newly formed Itri. 'Without Itri's early involvement, Taiwan's semiconductor industry would probably not exist today,' says Morris Chang, Itri chairman, who credits K T Li with recognising the critical role that semiconductor technology could play in Taiwan's industrial development. In the late 1970s, the Itri semiconductor research and development project was expanded to incorporate a pilot production line which was spun off in 1980 to form United Microelectronics, Taiwan's first - and still largest - semiconductor company. This move was critical, Mr Chang believes, because it demonstrated the commercial feasibility of semiconductor production in Taiwan, encouraging private sector investment. Six years later, another semiconductor producer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, was spun out of Itri to provide production facilities for the island's burgeoning chip design industry. A third Itri semiconductor spin-off is under consideration as the institute nears completion of a five-year advanced 'submicron' semiconductor technology development project which included the construction of an ultra-clean wafer fabrication laboratory with state-of-the-art semiconductor production technology. In addition to these official 'spin-offs', former Itri engineers have populated numerous other chip design and manufacturing companies in Taiwan formed with funding from the private sector, several of them formed by Taiwanese entrepreneurs who returned to their homeland after working in California's Silicon Valley. Typical of these is Miin Wu, president of Macronix, one of Taiwan's most promising semiconductor companies. Mr Wu returned to Taiwan four years ago after over 20 years in the US, where he studied at Stanford University and then worked in Silicon Valley. He brought 40 other Taiwanese engineers back with him from the US to form the core management and engineering team at Macronix. This 'reverse brain drain' is fuelling the growth of Taiwan's electronics industry, says Mr Chang. Chinese American engineers are attracted by the opportunities in Taiwan's burgeoning industry, in contrast to the slow economic growth in the US over the past few years, he notes. 'About two thirds of the 400 PhDs working at Itri have returned from the US. And the people with working experience in the US has also increased dramatically.' The abundance of well-qualified engineers is one of Taiwan's key advantages in the high technology industry, says D C Chien, general manager of IBM Taiwan. 'Even though Korea has a population 30 times that of Taiwan, we have far more engineers.' He also praises the adaptability and responsiveness of Taiwan's relatively small enterprises. 'When IBM wants something made on short notice, they deliver.' IBM, for example, turned to Taiwanese manufacturers for its recently-introduced low-cost Ambra PC product line. For all of its strengths, however, the Taiwanese electronics industry remains heavily dependent upon foreign technology and is subject to the vagaries of foreign markets. As costs rise in Taiwan, its manufacturers are increasingly shifting their operations off-shore, to China and Malaysia. The biggest challenge, says Morris Chang of Itri, is to upgrade Taiwan's own technology base. Until that happens, the Taiwanese information industry will not be the master of its own destiny.</p>

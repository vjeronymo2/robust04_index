			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL GUARD COPTER JOINS COUNTY DRUG SURVEILLANCE TEAM  </P> <P> The California National Guard was called into service by the Los Angeles County  Board of Supervisors on Tuesday to provide a helicopter and pilot to assist  local law enforcement authorities in drug surveillance operations.  </P> <P> The OH-58 chopper is being made available to Los Angeles County at the request  of Sheriff Sherman Block. It will be used only for observing drug suspects from  the air, according to an agreement approved by the supervisors, although there  is a provision in the agreement that allows it to land to assist in  life-threatening emergencies.  </P> <P> The helicopter, based at the Los Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve Center in Orange  County, and its volunteer pilot will be unarmed. A sheriff's deputy who will  ride along to conduct the surveillance will carry a weapon but is prohibited  from firing it from the helicopter.  </P> <P> A guard helicopter has been assisting the Los Angeles Police Department in drug  surveillance for nearly a year under a federal program designed to increase  military involvement in the war against drug trafficking. The federal  government pays for the program.  </P> <P> Last year, a guard helicopter engaged in anti-drug efforts crashed in Imperial  County, killing five deputies from different parts of Southern California and  three guardsmen aboard.  </P> <P> Supervisor Kenneth Hahn has called for deploying military police to ride along  with local law enforcement officers in combating gang violence on the streets.  A spokeswoman for Block said the sheriff opposes the idea because the guardsmen  do not have the proper law enforcement training.  </P></p>

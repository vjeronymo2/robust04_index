			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Castle &amp; Cooke Inc.: The Los Angeles-based holding company for Dole Food  Co. and Oceanic Properties Inc. reported first-quarter net income of $12.5  million, down 49% from the same period a year ago. Revenue inched up 2% to $563  million. The firm attributed the results to a pretax provision of $10 million  for anticipated costs associated with the temporary ban on the sale of Chilean  fruit by the Food and Drug Administration in mid-March, lower residential sales  in Hawaii and higher interest expense due to a combination of higher interest  rates and additional debt incurred to support the company's capital investment  program.  </P> <P> Tables, Page 4  </P></p>

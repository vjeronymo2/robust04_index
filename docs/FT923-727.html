			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: 25% dividend rise from Multitrust Multitrust, the property and securities company, lifted its pre-tax profit from Pounds 70,000 to Pounds 105,000 in the year to June 30. There was a tax charge this time so earnings per share declined to 1.5p (1.61p). But a final dividend of 1p raises the total to 2.5p (2p), at a cost of Pounds 40,000 (Pounds 24,000) after Mr Andrew Perloff, the chairman, waived entitlement on 63 per cent of the capital. There were Pounds 16,000 exceptional costs in connection with the acquisition of equities and investment properties. Over the 12 months to June 30 net asset value declined from 41.9p to 33.2p.</p>

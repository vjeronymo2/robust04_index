			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / All-party warning on depth ofrecession A SHARP warning that the recession could turn out to be more severe than the government has predicted came yesterday from an all-party committee of MPs. The Treasury and Civil Service committee, in its report on this year's Budget, criticises the government for being slow to respond to the economic decline and for getting its forecasts wrong. It also warns of the dangers of a squeeze on credit by banks forcing into liquidation companies which, at other times, would have been viable. The report follows several gloomy surveys of business opinion in the past few days. These have conveyed doubts about the pace and timing of the economic recovery, which the government hopes will start in the summer. The recovery could be delayed, according to the committee, if the UK is unable to continue over the next few months its recent programme of cutting interest rates. 'We are concerned that the recovery is so heavily dependent upon a revival in consumer confidence and consumer expenditure, which may falter if the rising trend in unemployment continues unabated,' the report says. The committee highlights what it calls the 'substantial' discrepancy between the relatively bullish government forecasts at the time of the Autumn Statement last November, and the Treasury's much bleaker set of projections provided with the Budget last month. The revision 'shows how slow the Treasury was to acknowledge the severity of the forces pushing the economy into a deep recession', the report says. It adds that the government might have been better placed to respond to the decline had it known what was happening earlier. Some of the failings, according to the committee, are linked to 'the unreliability of the Treasury forecast and the fact that the margin of error on some of the most important variables (in the projections) is deteriorating'. The report says the Treasury should publish full forecasts four times a year, double the present rate. Ministers should not modify them, but rather leave the job to officials. In a section dealing with the causes of the recession, the report appears to cast much of the blame on past government policies. 'Errors in the official forecast cannot be explained principally in terms of adverse international factors, which have been relatively unimportant in shaping the recession in the UK in comparison with tight domestic economic conditions.' The committee says that the retail prices index, the most widely accepted measure of inflation, is 'becoming increasingly distorted', due to changes in areas such as the poll tax. It calls on the government to prepare a new index of consumer prices which would allow a better comparison with the rest of Europe. Parliament, Page 13</p>

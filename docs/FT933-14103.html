			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Estonia's hunt for identity alarms Russians: Matthew Kaminski, recently in Narva, on a new aliens law IN 1944, Stalin's troops pushed out or deported 30,000 Estonians from Narva. The Russians who took their place now fear a similar fate. The peaceful appearance of the industrial town belies a deep anxiety among its residents who, at least under the law, are now strangers in a foreign country. Earlier this week, President Lennart Meri signed an aliens law that discriminates against the Russian minority, which constitutes around 40 per cent of the population. The law results from Estonia's efforts to assert a national identity after 50 years of Soviet rule and although the new statute was amended to adopt some suggestions made by the Council of Europe and the CSCE, it falls far short of mollifying ethnic Russians or Moscow. Russians must now pass a language test for Estonian citizenship or apply for residence and work permits. Neither is guaranteed. 'I guess I'll have to go back to Russia,' says Valia Solovyova, 21, who sells flowers near the Lenin statue that stands in the town square. Such sentiment has spawned a crisis in Estonia's north-east corner. The cities of Narva and nearby Sillamae, where the Russian population exceeds 95 per cent, will vote on regional autonomy this weekend. 'We'll never agree to alien status in our own country, no matter what it costs or what it takes,' says Vladimir Aleksyev, Narva's trade union leader. 'They want us to leave Estonia,' says Tatyana Yanchenko, 31, who, like many members of her generation, was born in the country. 'When Estonia was destroyed during the war and Russia rebuilt it, nobody called us occupiers like they do now.' Young people, whose parents came to work in Soviet factories after the war, worry their children will not learn Russian in school. Among the older generation, the aliens law only exacerbates the shock they have felt at the collapse of the Soviet Union. Mr Vladimir Chuikin, the town council chairman, is leading the referendum drive with help from Moscow. At his office, which he also used as the local Communist party chief, Mr Chuikin warns ominously of 'another Ulster' if Estonia tries to stop a vote it considers illegal. Ants Liiments, an Estonian who is Narva's assistant mayor, calls Mr Chuikin a dangerous populist who exploits the people's ignorance of the law. But Mr Liiments admits the law is flawed: 'People should be granted Estonian citizenship in a simplified way because it's not their fault they were born here or that their mothers or fathers came here.' The crisis threatens stability across the region. President Boris Yeltsin last week hinged a troop withdrawal timetable from all three Baltic states on improved treatment of the Russian minority.</p>

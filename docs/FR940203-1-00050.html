			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After reviewing approximately 6,420 abstracts of scientific or medical articles and approximately 230 epidemiologic studies, consulting with outside experts, and conducting public hearings, NAS issued a report, entitled ``Veterans and Agent Orange: Health Effects of Herbicides Used in Vietnam'', on July 27, 1993. NAS concluded that there is sufficient evidence of an association between exposure to herbicides used in the Republic of Vietnam and the subsequent development of chloracne, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, Hodgkin's disease and porphyria cutanea tarda. VA was already paying compensation for the first three conditions based upon the statutory presumptions established by Public Law 102&hyph;4, and the Secretary announced that same day that he had concluded that a positive association exists between exposure to herbicides used in the Republic of Vietnam and the subsequent development of Hodgkin's disease and porphyria cutanea tarda. Proposed regulations were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 28, 1993 (See 58 FR 50528&hyph;30).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also announced that VA would review the remaining findings in the NAS report to determine whether a positive association exists between herbicide exposure and any other conditions. That review has been completed and the Secretary has concluded that a positive association exists for multiple myeloma and respiratory cancers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NAS report found ``limited/suggestive evidence''_a category it defined as meaning that evidence suggests an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> association between herbicide exposure and a specific disease, but that chance, bias, and confounding cannot be ruled out with confidence_of an association between herbicide exposure and the subsequent development of multiple myeloma. VA, however, found the evidence concerning multiple myeloma, a malignant proliferation of plasma cells which are derived from B lymphocytes, to be convincing. Most of the studies reviewed by NAS showed an increased risk, although in most cases it was not a statistically significant increase. One occupational study (Fingerhut M.A., Halperin W.E., Marlow D.A., Piacitelli L.A., Honchar P.A., Sweeney M.H., Greife A.L., Dill P.A., Steenland K., Suruda A.J. 1991. Cancer mortality in workers exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. New England Journal of Medicine 324:212&hyph;218) found a relationship between herbicide exposure and multiple myeloma. Although this finding was not supported by the findings of Saracci and colleagues (Saracci R., Kogevinas M., Bertazzi P.A., Bueno De Mesquita B.H., Coggon D., Green L.M., Kauppinen T., L'Abbe K.A., Littorin M., Lynge E., Mathews J.D., Neuberger M., Osman J., Pearce N., Winkelman R. 1991. Cancer mortality in workers exposed to chlorophenoxy herbicides and chlorophenols. Lancet 338:1027&hyph;1032), the Saracci study is flawed as a result of questions regarding exposure. Another study (Pesatori A.C., Consonni D., Tironi A., Landi M.T., Zocchetti C., Bertazzi P.A. 1992. Cancer morbidity in the Seveso area, 1976&hyph;1986. Chemosphere 25:209&hyph;212) showed a clear association between herbicide exposure and multiple myeloma in both males and females. Moreover, multiple myeloma is closely related biologically to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; consequently, the epidemiological evidence concerning non-Hodgkin's lymphoma gives added weight to the association between herbicide exposure and multiple myeloma. Based on this clinical consideration and the weight of the epidemiogical evidence, the Secretary has determined that there is a positive association between herbicide exposure and multiple myeloma that manifests itself to a degree of 10 percent at any time after exposure. We are proposing to amend 38 CFR 3.309(e) to implement the Secretary's decision. This amendment is proposed to be effective the date of publication of the final rule, as provided by Public Law 102&hyph;4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NAS report also found limited/suggestive evidence of an association between herbicide exposure and the subsequent development of respiratory cancers, specifically cancers of the lung, larynx, or trachea. For study purposes, NAS included cancer of the bronchus when it considered cancer of the lung; therefore, we are including cancer of the bronchus within the scope of the proposed presumption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In reviewing the NAS report, which noted that not all studies had fully controlled for or evaluated smoking as a confounding factor, VA gave weight to the fact that the studies found high relative risks for respiratory cancers in production workers (Manz A., Berger J., Dwyer J.H., Flesch-Janys D., Nagel S., Waltsgott H. 1991. Cancer mortality among workers in chemical plant contaminated with dioxin. Lancet 338:959&hyph;964; Fingerhut et al., 1991). The Fingerhut study showed an increased risk with the duration of exposure. VA also noted that despite the failure of some studies to control for smoking, it is unlikely that there were major differences in smoking patterns between the study and control groups. Considering all of the evidence, the Secretary has determined that the credible evidence for an association outweighs the credible evidence against an association and that there is, therefore, a positive association between exposure to herbicides used in the Republic of Vietnam and the subsequent development of respiratory cancers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Bank of America lifts divestitures to Dollars 7bn BANK of America yesterday revised sharply upwards - from Dollars 4bn to Dollars 7bn - the size of divestitures it plans to make in connection with its merger with Security Pacific, the troubled Los Angeles-based bank. Mr Dick Rosenberg, chairman of Bank of America, had said that problem loans and other assets would be placed in a Dollars 4bn 'bad bank' that would be separated from the merged bank and assigned to Bank of America shareholders as a distinct entity. Estimates of this 'bad bank' were contained in merger filings with the Federal Reserve that have now been revised in a new filing to around Dollars 7bn. Bank of America yesterday said the increase reflects revisions it has made in its plans to divest branches and deposits in certain markets in which Bank of America and Security Pacific currently compete. Divestitures are planned in Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. The revised plan would not affect the term of the Dollars 4.2bn merger, the largest in US banking history. Analysts, however, speculated that the increase in the size of the bad bank also reflected the deterioration of Security Pacific's own balance sheet, and possibly Bank of America's as well, in light of the worsening recession in California. Mr George Salem of Prudential Bache, said the Dollars 7bn figure showed that Bank of America's original Dollars 4bn assessment was 'too optimistic'. In earlier filings, Bank of America had said it expects it will take a Dollars 250m restructuring charge in connection with the merger as well as setting up a Dollars 900m reserve for merger-related purposes. The merger with Security Pacific, which is scheduled to be completed by the end of next month, will create the largest commercial bank on the west coast and the second biggest in the US after Citicorp, with Dollars 180bn of total assets and a network (before divestitures) of 2,400 branches.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Once the list of available measures for an area source has been identified, the State must evaluate the technological and economic feasibility of implementing the controls. The State may refer to the technical information documents for procedures to determine feasibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When evaluating economic feasibility, States should not restrict their analysis to simple acceptance/rejection decisions based on whether full application of a measure to all sources in a particular category is feasible. Rather, a State should consider implementing a control measure on a more limited basis, e.g., for a percentage of the sources in a category if it is determined that 100 percent implementation of the measure is infeasible. This would mean, for example, that an area should consider the feasibility of paving 75 percent of the unpaved roadways even though paving all of the roads may be infeasible. Alternatively, the State should consider whether measures which cannot feasibly be implemented in their entirety prior to the statutory deadline for BACM implementation could be completed over an extended period. In that event, BACM might itself be defined to change over time from a more limited set of measures at the initial implementation date to a progressively tighter or more ambitious program at later dates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following example is presented to illustrate how a moderate area program of RACM for fugitive dust control may be complemented with additional BACM after the area is reclassified as serious. Assume that the following control measures were adopted as RACM:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Reduce the speed limit on unpaved county roads to 25 miles per hour.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Treat all unpaved county roads, monthly, with chemical dust suppressants within 500 feet of their intersections with paved roads.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Treat 10 miles of the most heavily-traveled, unpaved county roads with chemical dust suppressants once per month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Pave 4 miles of unpaved city streets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Treat unpaved parking lots in the city with chemical dust suppressants once per month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Clean anti-skid materials from 50 miles of city streets within 48 hours after snow melt begins.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The same area, after being reclassified as serious, may adopt the following BACM examples to complement the RACM program: <FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 40 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Adoption of these types of measures may require coordination with other local governmental entities such as the Departments of Agriculture, Transportation, and/or the Interior.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Pave 10 miles of the most heavily-traveled, unpaved county roads.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Treat 10 miles of unpaved county roads with chemical dust suppressants once per month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

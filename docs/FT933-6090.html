			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / People: Reeves' rehabilitation complete Christopher Reeves, who was chief executive of Morgan Grenfell at the time of the Guinness affair, has seemingly been fully rehabilitated by the City now that he has been promoted to chairman of Merrill Lynch Europe/Middle East. Nearly two years after resigning from Morgan Grenfell in 1987, he had joined the US investment banking group as senior adviser to Jerry Kenney, then president of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets; Reeves later moved on to become vice chairman of Merrill Lynch International. When he first joined, Merrill denied that the Bank of England had blocked his appointment as chief executive of the European operations on account of his connections with the Guinness affair, but at the end of last week a spokesman indicated that 'certain restrictions' on his activities previously in place had now been lifted, and that approval for the current appointment had been secured from both the Securities and Futures Authority and the Bank of England. No-one has held the title of chairman of Merrill Lynch Europe since Stani Yassukovich left two and a half years ago, although Mike Giles, chairman of Merrill Lynch International Bank had taken effective responsibility. Reeves says that his new title means that he will be 'much more executive rather than advisery' and will be allowed 'to do more things', notably chairing the executive committee in charge of the region, a position that Giles had also previously held. He adds that Merrill is 'so much bigger and more active that it is more necessary to have someone in this role'. It has expanded its capital raising activities generally, has applied to become a market-maker in gilts and is growing on the Continent, particularly in France and Germany. Reeves says he himself has developed a special interest in India which, despite his job title, is in fact 'on the extremity' of his region, and he sits on the board of the India Fund and the India Growth Fund.' Asked if he was now receiving the million pound salary that reports suggested he had had to turn down in 1988, he commented: 'Sadly not'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Chen Huanyou Makes an Important Speech at the Eighth </F> Plenary Session of the Provincial Discipline Inspection  Commission, Calling For Deepening the Anticorruption Struggle to  Still Greater Results" -- XINHUA RIBAO headline]    [Excerpts] "Remain sober, resolutely act in accordance  with the plans of the Central Committee and the provincial party  committee, deepen the anticorruption struggle in a sustained and  effective way, and strive to achieve new results stage by  stage." Jiangsu CPC Committee Secretary Chen Huanyou made this  remark at the eighth plenary session of the provincial  discipline inspection commission yesterday when he set some  requirements for Jiangsu's anticorruption work. [passage  omitted]    Comrade Chen Huanyou's speech was divided into three parts:  1. Conscientiously study and implement the guidelines of the  Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection  Commission and have a better understanding of anticorruption  work. 2. Deepen the anticorruption struggle in a sustained and  more effective way and continue to score new results stage by  stage. And, 3. Correctly handle the relationship among reform,  development, and stability and do a good job in safeguarding  social and political stability.    Chen Huanyou pointed out: Generally speaking, we have scored  marked achievements in the fight against corruption. Since late  August last year, party committees and governments throughout  the province have conscientiously implemented the party Central  Committee and State Council "Decision on Some Tasks That Need To  Be Done in Fighting Corruption in the Near Future." [passage  omitted] The spread of corruption has been brought under  control. It should be noted that as a whole, Jiangsu's  anticorruption work has progressed healthily. Basically, we  have met the requirements expected by the party Central  Committee and the provincial party committee. The general  reaction from the public is positive as a whole. Our practice  in the earlier period shows that launching the anticorruption  struggle has been a popular move, which has played a positive  role in promoting ties between the party and the masses,  advancing reform and development, and safeguarding social and  political stability. However, we should be aware that we have  only scored a preliminary success that is far from meeting the  people's expectations and Central Committee requirements. Work  progress in various localities and departments has been uneven.  Some comrades, including leading cadres, do not understand  sufficiently the struggle's importance. As a result, they  lacked initiative and strength in carrying out the struggle.  Discipline was lax in some localities and departments. They  failed to adopt forceful measures in handling cases. Therefore,  we must remain sober, assume responsibility, resolutely carry  out the anticorruption struggle, and strive to score new  achievements.    Regarding the work of combating corruption and promoting  honesty this year, Chen Huanyou said: First, we must continue  to focus on the carrying out of three tasks. Resolute measures  should be taken to encourage honesty and self-discipline among  leading cadres. [passage omitted] Party and government leading  cadres at and above the county and department levels should  examine and rectify themselves. They should rectify whatever  problems occur. They should promptly discover and solve  existing problems by examining themselves, accepting supervision  by the masses, and holding democratic meetings; and standardize  their conduct in line with Central Committee and the provincial  party committee provisions. We should continue to concentrate  on the handling of major and important cases. Great efforts  should be made to thoroughly investigate major cases of  corruption that have been exposed. Under no circumstances  should we let such cases go unhandled. Cases must be thoroughly  investigated and settled no matter who is involved. We should  never become soft-hearted and never allow official protection.  Anyone who tries to protect law-breakers must be subject to  party disciplinary action and punishment by law. [passage  omitted]    Second, we should strive to solve problems by eliminating  their root causes by gradually establishing an effective system  or mechanism for preventing corruption. Various departments and  units should conduct extensive education to promote party work  style, honesty, and professional ethics; vigorously publicize  and commend outstanding party members and cadres who are honest  in carrying out their official functions and who work hard to  serve the people; and encourage healthy trends. [passage  omitted]    Third, we should strengthen leadership over the fight  against  corruption. Party and governments at all levels must take the  fight against corruption as an important long-term task and  always make it an important item on their agenda. [passage  omitted]    At present, the general situation in the province is good.  We have scored new progress in economic development, reform,  and opening up to the outside world. We enjoy both political  and social stability, but we are still facing many difficulties  and contradictions in our advance. He said: We have very  arduous tasks to do this year in pushing forward reform and  development. As reform has entered a stage of tackling knotty  problems, it is unprecedented in terms of its breadth, depth,  intensity, and difficulties. In the course of advancing the  reform, new problems and contradictions will inevitably emerge.  Party committees, governments, and leading cadres at all levels  must bear the responsibility, do their work well, and strive to  consolidate and develop the good situation. [passage omitted]    In conclusion, Chen Huanyou stressed: In combating  corruption, we must heed the overall interest of party work as a  whole; eliminate major problems that affect the overall  interest; set the task and goal for the anticorruption struggle  for each stage; and integrate the fight against corruption with  the implementation of the important party Central Committee and  State Council policies, as well as with the major plans of the  provincial party committee and government. [passage omitted]  Through solid and effective work, we should enable the masses  to realize that the main stream of our party ranks is good, that  our party is determined to take effective action to combat  corruption, and that progress in combating corruption has been,  and is being, made step by step, thereby enhancing confidence in  the fight against corruption and leading to a situation in which  the party and the masses are united and the cadres and the  masses are united and in which all in the province know they are  in the same boat and should work hard together.    Thirty-three provincial discipline inspection commission  members attended yesterday's meeting. [passage omitted]    The meeting concluded yesterday after adopting the  "Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Jiangsu  Provincial CPC Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission."</p>

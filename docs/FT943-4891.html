			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Iata warns Asia on airports congestion - Farnborough Air Show The International Air Transport Association (Iata), the airline industry trade organisation grouping more than 200 airlines, yesterday urged Asian-Pacific countries to convene a summit of transport ministers to address the urgent issue of growing congestion at airports throughout the region. Inadequate ground and air traffic control infrastructure in Europe provoked a crisis in European air transport a few years ago. There was now a risk that a similar crisis could occur in the fast growing Asian-Pacific aviation market, warned Mr Pierre Jeanniot, the Iata director-general, at the Farnborough Air Show in southern England. Air traffic is continuing to grow faster in the Asia-Pacific region than in any other market. Iata as well as the leading aircraft manufacturers, Boeing and Airbus, are forecasting annual air traffic growth averaging around 7 per cent over the next few years in the region, compared with overall world traffic growth of 5 per cent in the same period. Infrastructure both on the ground and the air was coming under 'heavy strain' in some areas of the Asia-Pacific region, Mr Jeanniot said. Although a number of new airports were now opening in the area, he said these investments were already insufficient to cope with the expected growth of air travel in the region. Although Europe had started to address the problem of congestion, more efforts were also needed to harmonise and modernise European air traffic control systems. At the same time, Europe needed more airport infrastructure to cope with an expected increase in European air passenger numbers from 394m this year to 653m by the turn of the century and as many as 1bn by 2010, Mr Jeanniot said. In the longer term, Europe would have to adopt a satellite-based air traffic control management system which would be able to deliver double the capacity and drastically reduce the existing costs of the current European system. Mr Jeanniot also attacked government taxation policies on air transport, and especially the introduction in November of an airport departure tax in the UK. 'This passenger duty will raise Pounds 325m for the UK Treasury. Taxes simply increase airline costs at a time when consumers are demanding lower fares,' Mr Jeanniot said. The new UK airport tax was also attacked yesterday by Sir Colin Marshall, the British Airways chairman, who argued it would distort competition because it did not apply to other forms of transport including road, bus, rail and eventually Channel Tunnel high-speed trains services which will be competing directly against airline services.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Scottish poll puts Tories on 13% The Conservative party has sunk to its lowest level ever in opinion polls in Scotland, a System Three poll in today's Herald newspaper based in Glasgow says. The poll puts Tory support in Scotland at 13 per cent, the party's lowest rating since since the poll began 20 years ago, James Buxton writes. The Tories' standing is only half the 25.7 per cent it won at the 1992 general election and is three points down on its showing at the end of January. It puts the Tories in fourth place for only the second time in the poll's history. Labour support is unchanged at 47 per cent while the Scottish National party has risen three percentage points to 25 per cent. The Liberal Democrats are unchanged at 14 per cent. Mr Alex Salmond, SNP leader, said the poll showed the nationalists were in a position to challenge Labour in the forthcoming local and European elections. News of the poll, based on interviews with 1,035 people between February 24 and March 3, came on the day Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, launched the Conservatives' spring offensive, saying the party would fare well at the elections.</p>

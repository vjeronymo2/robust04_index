			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Markets: The seductive view from the top - Serious Money PRIVATE investors have an unfortunate tendency to buy shares at the top of the market. So news that unit trust sales are close to levels last attained during the third quarter of 1987 (just before the Crash) makes the cynical observer rather uneasy. A survey from Save &amp; Prosper illustrates the problem. S &amp; P found that in June 1991, when the FT-SE 100 index was around 2,500, only 28 per cent of private investors surveyed thought that it was a good time to invest in stocks and shares. In June 1992, with Footsie at 2,700, the figure was 25 per cent. The same survey conducted this year, when the index was around 2,850, found that 54 per cent of investors believed it was a good time to buy stocks and shares. You could argue that investors in June 1992 were fairly shrewd, in that the market fell sharply over the summer reaching its nadir, of around 2,280, just before sterling's devaluation. On the other hand, I wonder whether private investors would have felt confident about the prospects for shares on Black Wednesday, since when the market has rallied substantially. Of course, it is inevitable that when share prices are low, investors will be depressed - their depression is what makes prices low in the first place. And the flood of demand which occurs when private investors enter the share market in numbers helps indices to reach new peaks - look at the US, where interest rates of 3 per cent or so have caused individuals to swap deposits for shares. Nevertheless, the shrewd investor will try to avoid the herd mentality. Just as, when UK interest rates were 15 per cent, it was tempting, but wrong, to hold all your money in cash and forget equities, it would now be foolish to have all your money in shares at a time, when the market, in terms of price-earnings ratios and dividend yields, looks expensive in historical terms. A balance of cash, gilts and shares is the answer. ***** Foreign &amp; Colonial's latest investment trust is an unusual animal. For a start, it is the first split capital trust launched by F &amp; C, which has traditionally been associated with the 'keep it simple' school of trust management. Secondly, although the trust is investing in utilities, it is concentrating on a particularly recondite part of the sector - the former statutory water companies. These groups are not the same as the privatised water companies such as Severn Trent. The 'statutory companies' are responsible purely for water supply, not for sewage; many date back to the 19th century, and they were so named because, until recently, their profits and dividends were set by statute. For many years they were a neglected corner of the stock market until the French water companies started to buy stakes in the late 1980s. Share prices shot ahead, and did so again when statutory controls were lifted - according to F &amp; C, the dividend of the Chester company, set at 3p for many years, is now 225p per share. One particular private investor, the Australian-based Duncan Saville, was clever enough to profit from all this and became one of the largest holders of water supply stocks. He approached F &amp; C with the idea of swapping his holdings into investment trust shares - and the idea for the trust was born. Its name will be the Special Utilities Investment Trust, or SUIT for short. Depending on how much the trust raises, between 44 and 80 per cent of the portfolio will be in water supply stocks. The remainder will be in other utilities such as electricity, gas or telecommunications. F &amp; C argues that the water supply companies are attractive investments. They supply water to nearly a quarter of the population, have lower capital expenditure plans, high cash generation and a good relationship with the regulator. The income shares will be entitled to all the fund's income and the first 60p of assets, when the trust is wound up in 10 years' time. They will be offered at 60p each and will have an initial dividend yield of 7.75 per cent. If dividends grow at 5 per cent per year, the expected gross redemption yield will be 9.4 per cent. The capital shares, sold at 40p each, will get no income but will get all the assets of the trust after the income shares have been repaid. If the assets grow at 5 per cent per year, the expected gross redemption yield will be 8.5 per cent. However, it is worth noting that if the trust's assets do not grow at all, investors will lose money. Saville will be taking capital shares for his holding. There will also be package units (at 100p) which can be converted into one income and one capital share at any time. The initial yield will be 4.7 per cent, and the minimum investment for package investors is Pounds 500. All the various shares are Pepable. Potential investors should realise this is a highly specialised trust, the investments of which will be concentrated in a politically sensitive and (perverse though it sounds) illiquid sector. It is certainly not a fund for the first time investor, who would get a much better spread from F &amp; C's flagship investment trust. But larger investors might find the income shares attractive as part of a wider income-seeking portfolio.</p>

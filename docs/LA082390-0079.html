			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: BRUNSWICK STEW: A SQUIRREL-LESS MEAL  </P> <P> In more than a few parts of this country, when you talk about barbecue you're  also talking about stew: Brunswick Stew.  </P> <P> From Maryland all down through Virginia, Georgia, the Carolinas to Mississippi,  some form of a rich, thick hearty soup called Brunswick Stew is a standard  first course when cooking for a crowd at most any kind of cook-out.  </P> <P> According to most authorities, Brunswick Stew was first prepared in -- and got  its name from -- Brunswick County, Virginia. And, according to most  authorities, squirrel is the essential meat of any true Brunswick Stew. There  are today, however, several variations on the basic theme, probably because  squirrel is a little hard to come by in some counties.  </P> <P> In most parts of the South, where "Q" and stew are a standard twosome, chicken  has replaced squirrel as the basis for Brunswick. But chicken, according to the  folks in Mississippi, "is a feeble substitute for squirrel meat." They are more  apt to use rabbit when squirrel is unavailable, or a combination of chicken and  rabbit.  </P> <P> In North Carolina, where Brunswick Stew and hush puppies are standard  "side-kicks" to their famous "pig-pickin's," chicken is combined (quite  understandably) with country ham. They produce more country ham in North  Carolina than any place else in the country. In other parts of Dixie, beef,  veal or pork are combined with chicken in recipes for "authentic" Brunswick  Stew.  </P> <P> Once the meat is decided on, there are still decisions involved in making a  Brunswick Stew. Which vegetables to use? Corn and tomatoes are a must, but what  else? Some Southern cooks put okra in their stew; butter beans are a must for  others.  </P> <P> Then there's the thickening to think about. I like Brunswick to be the  consistency of a rich soup, sort of a Southern version of a good minestrone,  but a lot of folks in the South like a thicker consistency. Some use a roux,  some use fine bread crumbs, many try mashed potatoes or white beans or both and  add them to the pot for thickening. In Louisiana, Brunswick is considered to be  "kissin' cousin" to gumbo; many cooks there will thicken it with file powder.  </P> <P> As you can see, Brunswick Stew, squirrel or no squirrel, is a serious subject  in the South, and one worthy of study. The recipe that follows is the result of  my studies on the subject. I have cooked it at charity barbecues all across the  country from California to Connecticut, and I have it on good authority from a  lot of folks -- from the owner of the San Francisco Giants to a chef from the  Cordon Bleu -- that "it's a good stew."  </P> <P> Try it, but after you have, change it to suit your taste. No cook in the South  will agree that you have an authentic Brunswick Stew, so what else is new? That  has been true for centuries. No two cooks in all of Dixie have ever agreed on  what is a real, true Brunswick Stew, so join the crowd.  </P> <P> This recipe makes a lot, eight quarts, but rather than cut it back I would  recommend that you invite in many friends. Brunswick Stew, whatever it is, is  not -- nor has it ever been -- a "family meal." It does, however, keep  wonderfully well, so package any leftovers for the refrigerator or freezer.  Like most stews, Brunswick gets better from having spent a day or two in the  refrigerator or some time in the freezer.  </P> <P> BRUNSWICK STEW  </P> <P> 1 chicken, cut in quarters  </P> <P> 2 pounds ground chuck  </P> <P> 1 pound country ham, chopped  </P> <P> Water  </P> <P> 1 (1-pound) package Great Northern beans  </P> <P> 6 large potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes  </P> <P> 4 large onions, sliced  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes  </P> <P> 1 (14-ounce) bottle catsup  </P> <P> 2 quarts canned tomatoes, crushed  </P> <P> 1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste  </P> <P> 1 (10 3/4-ounce) can condensed tomato soup  </P> <P> Dash Worcestershire sauce  </P> <P> Dash hot pepper sauce  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> 1/2 pound butter  </P> <P> 2 (10-ounce) packages frozen corn  </P> <P> 2 (10-ounce) packages frozen butter beans (limas)  </P> <P> 1 (10-ounce) package frozen green beans  </P> <P> Combine chicken, ground chuck and ham in large, heavy stockpot. Add enough  water to cover. Cook over medium heat about 40 minutes or until chicken is  tender. Add more water if necessary.  </P> <P> Remove chicken from pot. When cool enough to handle, bone chicken and cut meat  into small pieces. Return chicken meat to stockpot.  </P> <P> Add beans, potatoes, onions, pepper flakes, catsup, canned tomatoes, tomato  paste, soup, Worcestershire, hot pepper sauce, salt, pepper and butter. Cover  and cook over low heat 1 hour. Add corn, butter beans and greeen beens, cover  and cook 1 hour more, stirring occasionally. Makes about 8 quarts.  </P></p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: Never again, vow weary negotiators - Where now? The likes of the Uruguay Round, mother of all trade negotiations, may never be seen again. In fact, the very idea of a future trade round has now been ditched. There will be further talks on such issues as agriculture and services, where many trade barriers remain. New issues, certainly the links between trade and the environment, will be debated. But they will not be harnessed to each other in a global negotiation. Arguably, in 1986 the sprawling and unwieldy Uruguay Round agenda was necessary to secure the support of all Gatt members to launch the talks, from the US with its emphasis on new issues such as services and intellectual property, to developing countries which wanted more open markets for their exports of farm and textile products. But the sheer breadth and complexity of the Round, coupled with the huge number of countries involved (117 by the end), came close to being its undoing. With 'nothing agreed until everything is agreed', the talks were hostage to every blockage along the way. Officials have vowed never to repeat the gruelling experience of the past seven years. Throughout the Uruguay Round agreement, provisions exist for further reviews and negotiations on fixed timetables in different areas, none of them linked. In agriculture, the Uruguay Round deal is seen as part of a continuing process to cut farm subsidies and protection. The present agreement calls for cuts over six years, before which there must be another negotiation to decide what happens next. The services accord requires countries to begin a new round of talks within five years of coming into force and 'periodically thereafter'. The present accord is seen as the start of a long process of services liberalisation, in the same way as Gatt has progressively reduced trade barriers for goods over 45 years. All this will be welcome news to proponents of the many new issues now being pressed onto the international trade agenda. They have less risk of running into the sand because some other Gatt member has not got its own pet concern on the slate. Topping the list of the new World Trade Organisation's future concerns will be the interaction of environmental and trade policies, and how to promote sustainable development and ecological well-being without resorting to protectionism. Environmental groups have waged a noisy campaign to 'green the Gatt'; most industrialised countries admit, with hindsight, this area should have been tackled earlier. But the highly complex issues involved in the environment/trade debate could not have been adequately tackled in a round dangerously overloaded with other matters. Gatt members have agreed to draw up a work programme on trade and the environment to be approved by ministers next April when they sign the Uruguay Round accord. The work programme will include the possibility of changes to international fair trade rules to accommodate environmental concerns. Many other areas exist for possible action by the WTO, but a common theme is 'levelling the playing field' by requiring certain minimum norms in domestic policies that impinge on economic competitiveness. This follows naturally from the Uruguay Round which broke new ground by introducing rules covering the previously sovereign area of domestic policy-making. Proposed new areas include: Competition policy: in 1992 Sir Leon Brittan, then EC competition commissioner, proposed a strong role for Gatt in drafting and enforcing international competition rules covering subsidies, cartels, merger policy and public monopolies. This proposal was taken up more recently by Mr Karel Van Miert, the EU's current competition supremo. As tariff and non-tariff barriers are cleared away, these 'private barriers to trade' are increasingly the most important obstacle to corporate expansion, Mr Van Miert said in October. Like the new rules agreed on intellectual property in the Uruguay Round, the idea would be to have common minimum standards for handling restrictive business practices, effectively enforced, with the WTO as an international forum for handling disputes. 'One should not even dream about a worldwide and independent competition agency at this stage', Mr Van Miert acknowledged. Investment: foreign direct investment now drives international trade flows. Multinationals now account for a third of total world trade. The limited Uruguay Round agreement on trade-related investment measures presages the possibility of complementary rules on investment and competition more generally. A Gatt for investment would lay down basic fair trade principles and might require countries to grant establishment rights to foreign companies. This idea was anathema to developing countries when the Uruguay Round started but they have since competed to attract overseas investment; some have become big foreign investors in their own right. Worker rights: the US has repeatedly and unsuccessfully pressed for discussion of common international standards on worker rights, an idea strongly opposed by poor nations who fear another excuse for protectionism. France and Mr Jacques Delors, EU president, have voiced support for a Gatt agreement on social issues. But confusion exists about whether such talks would focus on economic standards such as minimum wages or basic human rights ones, such as freedom to form unions and bargain collectively. Developing countries: Poor nations are keen on new rules to help prop up commodities prices. They want more liberalisation of trade in labour services. Rich nations have so far agreed only to freer movement for managerial and highly-skilled workers, but further talks will be held.</p>

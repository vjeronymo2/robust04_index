			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Survey of Sheffield (3): New road a priority - Sheffield's transpennine links HOWARD WOODCOCK, owner of an eponymous travel company, reckons he has found the consistently fastest route by car from Sheffield to Manchester Airport. Sheffield Chamber of Commerce gives copies to members. The route goes through the Peak District national park over Winnats Pass and via Chapel-en-le-Frith, Pott Shrigley and a myriad of Cheshire country lanes, passing through a farmyard and over a stretch of cobbled road. The distance of 38 miles takes 65 minutes. The alternative and more obvious main routes take in either the Snake or Woodhead Passes, converging on a notorious series of bottlenecks. With heavy lorries on the roads the journey can take up to twice as long as Woodcock's Trail. With Manchester airport's increasing importance to the northern economy, South Yorkshire is increasingly feeling isolated from it. The Coalfields Communities Campaign this year pointed to the problems this created in impressing potential inward investors. There is now a growing clamour for an all-weather dual-carriageway between Manchester and South Yorkshire, even though this would mean 15 miles of it passing through the national park. The favoured route is the A628 over Woodhead. Conservation groups are unhappy, but the economic and politcal case is growing, especially after the latest pit closures programme. Mr Mike Bower, leader of Sheffield City Council, says: 'We certainly don't get the number of relocations we could reasonably expect. We need a better road link to Manchester. This is a pretty high priority.' Mr William Cook of Andrew Cook, a steel castings specialist, has many US customers to service - 'we've learned to live with the airport problem, but how can we possibly expect inward investors to put up with it?' he asks. Mr Cook thinks a spur to the airport from the Sheffield-Manchester railway line would also help, but the road is critical. 'It's geographically, technically and environmentally simple. What difference could it make to a few sheep if traffic moves fast or slow?' he says. 'It's a burning issue,' agrees Mr John Hambidge, chief executive of Sheffield chamber. 'Which pollutes more, fast or slow lorries? They crawl over the Woodhead belching black exhaust fumes in low gear. It must be cleaner and more economical to move them through faster. We should certainly study this scientifically. 'Good landscaping of a well-designed road can actually protect the environment. The A628 has been defined by the Department of Transport as the worst transpennine route. There are few walks in that part of the park, so few recreational walkers would be inconvenienced,' adds Mr Hambidge. Indeed, one argument is that improving the Woodhead route and banning heavy goods vehicles from the longer Snake Pass would protect the national park better than now. Even Mr Hugh Sykes, chairman of the Peak Park Trust, insists: 'The balance of advantage to all interests lies in developing better transpennine links.' Mr Sykes and others also see the issue as wider than mere access to Manchester Airport. Greater Manchester's economic hegemony over the transpennine belt makes easier access to its financial and professional service sector increasingly important. THE north's main wealth-generating areas straddle the Pennines. The M62 has already created a potential European super-region by linking Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire. A 'dualled' A628 would add South Yorkshire, thus increasing the northern economy's central critical mass and improving three-way commercial links between Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds. Mr Sykes points to Japan, which now groups towns and cities into strong, intra-trading regional economies - 'we need to strengthen the intra-trading northern economy,' he adds. Perhaps Professor Alan Hay, head of geography at Sheffield University, has the answer to resolving the clash between economic and environmental interests, however - 'there are two problems on transpennine links, so why should there not be two solutions, one for lorries and one for cars?' he asks. A new link is planned in about five years time between the M1 and M62 to 'cut the Leeds corner.' This will will save traffic between the two motorways having to travel to Leeds to interchange. 'This is the route most heavy goods vehicles should use. The Woodhead pass could then be upgraded but confined to cars and light goods vehicles only,' Prof Hay suggests. Many will see this as common sense. In the meantime, the scenic Woodcock Trail looks the best means of ensuring Sheffielders do not miss their flights.</p>

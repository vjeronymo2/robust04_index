			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marina Denisova, IZVESTIYA: "The Television </F> Business in Russia"]    [Text] Skeptics who think that the television business in  Russia is not profitable and sometimes operates at a loss are  wrong. Of course, on the scale of the television company, a  gigantic, almost uncontrollable business, it is not easy to find  a gold mine. Filling many hours of air time is still too costly  a luxury.    A more rewarding occupation for those who have decided to  get  in on the ground floor of the television business is to create a  television agency. In essence world information journalism has  been supported by such agencies for many years now. The largest  television agency, Reuters, for example, serves more than 600  television companies of the world. But for our country such a  practice is a rare exception to the general rule.    Journalists Mikhail Beglov and Andrey Korotkov, who  previously worked at the Main Editorial Office for Audiovisual  Information of TASS, two years ago left state service and  organized their own agency. At first, of course, things were  tight--they borrowed money from acquaintances, friends of  acquaintances, acquaintances of friends of acquaintances, and  they took out unsecured credit in order to buy their first video  camera. But now RTA, the only private independent television  agency in Russia, is flourishing: It has complete independence  with no sponsors, it has its own equipment, and two clipping  rooms. It has a total of 20 staff correspondents and five film  crews. RTA actively recruits stringers to cooperate, but it has  no editors or correspondents in the usual sense. It has  producers who can combine jobs and work as sound operators,  lighting men, and even drivers, in spite of their ambitions. So  as distinct from a film crew of state television, which  consists, as a rule, of three or four people, the private agency  can allow itself the luxury of maintaining two workers for one  camera--otherwise, it would be threatened with ruin.    RTA is experiencing no shortage of clients who are thirsty  for information and the "footage" that goes with it. More  frequently they have to make a choice of whom to give preference  to: a German company or an American one. No television company,  even the wealthiest Western ones which have four to five film  crews in Russia, can cover all the events in our turbulent  country. All the conditions are stipulated ahead of time--each  television company has its own style for presenting video  materials.    RTA works not only on order, but also on its own initiative.  Early in the morning in the RTA office there are reports from  large information agencies (like INTERFAX and RIA). It also has  its own personal sources of information--wherever they are  possible and necessary. The producers determine where to send  film crews and why. On busy days they can shoot up to 20 hours  of video film. This was the case, for example, during the  elections and the putsches. But it sometimes happens that they  all sit in the office for a whole day smoking and looking at one  another because nothing is happening and there is no news. As  distinct from state structures, nobody forces anybody to work  just to keep busy: There is no plan for the quantity of material  produced during a day or quarter. On the other hand, there is no  such concept as a regular day off either. If it is necessary to  film on Sunday night then they do it, in spite of the fact that  the day before they had returned from a week-long trip and had  not slept for two days in a row. RTA never refuses its clients,  even if the orders seem crazy at first glance.    Once in the Crimea against the background of Lastochkinoye  Gnezdo an RTA crew filmed a meeting between Yeltsin and  Kravchuk. The operator told the correspondent where to stand,  but he suddenly disappeared from the frame. It turned out that  he took a step backwards and fell, fortunately, not into an  abyss but down a steep slope. But according to responses from  German television viewers, who had seen the clip later, it was  very emotional and brought some people to tears. It was apparent  how excited the correspondent was about the negotiations between  the leaders of Russia and Ukraine. The work of RTA workers is  dangerous--not only in zones of combat activities when you fly  in a helicopter and where you can be fired at by a Stinger at  any moment or when you are filming material at the Semipalatinsk  test site where the Geiger counter is registering off the dial,  or where you go to film the headquarters of a fascist  organization where they might simply punch you in the face and  break the camera at the same time. Therefore all agency workers  are insured for large amounts.    It cannot be ruled out that the producer will offer video  materials to clients and all of them will refuse it. Some have  shot their own film on a particular subject and some are not  interested. The French, for example, prefer to use their own  film. But such cases, even though they obviously cause losses,  do not hit the overall pocketbook especially hard. They are  individual cases. And then RTA has a group of permanent clients.  Foreign television companies pay two to three times more for  video news than ours do. This certainly does not mean that RTA  does not want to deal with Russian television companies whose  finances are constantly on the downturn. On the contrary, RTA is  prepared to offer its video materials and services even free of  charge. But our companies have still retained a certain inertia  of thinking--both Ostankino and the Russian channel have become  accustomed to relying on their own forces. And it is not even  that they do not trust others. It is simply necessary to give  their own staff correspondents something to do. Although  materials with the RTA mark will show up on "Vesti" once in a  while. A daily morning program on the Russian channel "Formula  730" is also being created on the basis of the RTA agency. But  this is episodic so far.    "Journal of Main Events of the Day" is enjoying minimum  success. The most costly materials and the ones most interesting  to the clients are exclusives. Such as interviews with wives of  members of government (how they met their husbands, how they  fell in love, where they lived and on what) with the title  "Kremlin Wives." This "commodity" immediately found consumers.  The RTA producers are trying to film outside Moscow as much as  possible--any information from outside the capital sells like  hotcakes. For example, a piece on a nuclear missile silo or a  report on diamond mining in Yakutia. It is not easy to get  permission to film such things. Agency workers--who are in  principle against bribes which open all doors--have been trained  not to give them. Therefore the main asset of any producer is  not a personal bank account but the connections he has developed.    The reaction to video topics is unpredictable. Once a piece  was filmed for ZDF on refugees from Kazakhstan. In the words of  the bureau chief, the German public was struck most by a  restless cat which the owner had abandoned in an empty  apartment. They were immediately flooded with offers from people  who wanted to bring the cat to Germany. The foreigners did not  feel as sorry for the Russians who were forced to flee their  homes as they did for the unfortunate animal. Or there was the  piece about Moscow Siamese twins Masha and Dasha that affected  everyone in Germany so much that the German television company,  under pressure from phone calls from television viewers, brought  the sisters to Berlin for treatment at its own expense.    The political independence and the reliability of RTA have  led to a situation where its news is a marketable commodity.  Mikhail Beglov and Andrey Korotkov, the founders of RTA, working  with the producers, think that their brainchild has found its  niche in the video news market and they feel comfortable there.  So much so that the agency is expanding the sphere of its  activity: from assisting television companies in creating  studios to buying interesting programs from foreign production  firms.</p>

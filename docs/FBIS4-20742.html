			<p>CSO     [Text] Economics Division. The transportation and shipping  network, the construction of connective roads in the country and  the shortfalls and achievements in these areas is the topic of  this installment of "A Look at the Achievements of the Islamic  Revolution," which is an interview with the minister of roads  and transport [Akbat Torkan].    Engineer Torkan began by discussing the responsibilities of  the Ministry of Roads and Transport. He said: This ministry's  responsibility is the shipping and transportation of goods and  passengers, which is done by land, sea, and air. The building of  infrastructure and investment in infrastructure affairs is  really done to create transportation and shipping. We continue  this interview below.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What is your assessment of the success  of  the officials of the Ministry of Roads and Transport in  fulfilling these responsibilities?    [Torkan] My assessment includes the performance of this  ministry's former officials, such as Martyr Kalantari, Dr.  Nezhadhoseynian, and Engineer Sa'idi-Kiya, whose performance was  completely positive.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] In the First Five-Year Plan, did the  Ministry of Roads and Transport reach its goals?    [Torkan] Transportation depends on the nation's economy. The  more the gross domestic product increases, the more  transportation increases. The more a nation develops its  exports, the more its transportation increases. These things are  connected together like a chain. In my view, the Ministry of  Roads and Transport developed successfully during the First  Five-Year Plan.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What is your detailed assessment of this  success?    [Torkan] The most important thing I must mention with regard  to transportation is that its goals and strategies change under  the influence of environmental conditions. When you talk about  transportation and shipping in Iran in the year 1367 [21 March  1988-20 March 1989], we had need and demand for transportation.  When we talk about transportation and shipping in the year 1370  [21 March 1991-20 March 1992] when the Central Asian nations are  liberated and have set out to enter international markets, wish  to trade with the world and have gotten past their dead end,  then there is new demand for transportation and shipping, and  following that, based on estimated demand, planning goals are  being set for transportation and shipping.    With the independence of the Central Asian nations and their  membership in the ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization], this  organization has 10 members instead of just its former three  members, Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, so that Afghanistan,  Azerbaijan, and five Central Asian nations have joined this  organization. Because these nations have high potential in terms  of transportation and shipping and wish to connect with  international markets, and the world also wishes to trade with  these nations, it appears that the path for travel and  transportation and shipping to these countries will be the  Islamic Republic of Iran.    On the other hand, before the year 1368 [21 March 1989-20  March 1990] the idea of transportation and shipping on the Sea  of Mazandaran had no meaning and was very limited. From this  year on, however, the idea became quite meaningful and underwent  development. Consequently, we are now building new ports on the  Sea of Mazandaran.    The idea of building new ports in Faridunkenar and Amirabad,  of developing the ports of Anzali and Bandar-e Nowshahr and  reviving Bandar-e Torkman and Bandar-e Gaz was a goal that was  raised in the Ministry of Roads and Transport after these  nations in Central Asia became independent, and this ministry  has made plans for these ports.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Were these short goals? That is, were  they limited to the First Five-Year Plan?    [Torkan] These programs were added in the middle of the  First  Five-Year Plan.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Then by this reckoning, the goals of the  Ministry of Roads and Transport changed during the First  Five-Year Plan. In view of these changes, were you able to make  use of existing potentials in such a way as to reach the above  goals?    [Torkan] Of course, in general I must say that the answer is  affirmative.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Could you please discuss what you did in  detail?    [Torkan] We have four border cities with Turkmenistan, the  cities of Sarakhs, Lotfabad, Bajgiran, and Pol. After the  Central Asian nations became independent these border points  were opened. It likewise became necessary to develop the border  at Astara, and consequently roads were built and improved to  gain access to these borders. The roads between Mashhad-Sarakhs,  Emamqoli-Quchan, and Emamqoli-Darrehgaz are examples of the  projects that connect us to the Lotfabad border. They have now  been completed and traffic is traveling on them.    There is also the Bajgiran-Emamqoli road that is now under  construction and is more than 50-percent complete.    The construction of the Mashhad-Sarakhs railroad was really  proposed after the independence of the Central Asian nations. It  is now under construction and we hope this railroad will be  complete by the end of the year 1374 [20 March 1976].    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Have we had as much road development as  this in the rest of the country?    [Torkan] These roads that were mentioned are the ones that  connect us to Central Asia. In other parts of the country,  during the time of Engineer Sa'idi-Kiya a total of 20,000 km of  roads was built over a period of eight years, and this figure is  quite significant.    Also during the tenure of Mr. Sa'idi-Kiya, the Bafq-Bandar  'Abbas railroad was put into operation up to the Tazraj station,  190 km from Bandar 'Abbas. We are continuing to work along the  route from Tazraj to Bandar 'Abbas, and we hope that this  railroad will go into operation in the second half of the year  1373 [23 September 1994-20 March 1995].    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] We have connected the roads in Central  Asia and the Caucasus to the roads in our country via the border  points you mentioned. Along with that, have we also been able to  develop the nation's other roads?    [Torkan] In the process of continuing these same transit  roads, one task is connecting Mashhad to the southern shores.  Our main road now goes from Mashhad to Torbat-e Heydariyeh, from  there to Birjand and then to Zahedan and Iranshahr and  Chahbahar, and this road has very high quality in terms of  transit.    Another road that was completed this year, which we hope to  put into operation during the 10 Days of Dawn celebration, is a  road called Dihuk-Ravar, with which it will no longer be  necessary for you to go from Tabas to Na'in and Yazd. You will  be able to go from Tabas to Dihuk, and from there to Ravar, and  then to Kerman, and then finally to Bandar 'Abbas, and this road  has been presented in ECO as one of our transit roads.    It is necessary to explain that another valuable task that  was accomplished in the time of Mr. Sa'idi-Kiya is the part of  the road from Yazd to Tabas. Of course, Yazd is now connected to  Tabas, but this road goes through the middle of the desert.    Another road that exists that has not yet been completed and  is under construction is one of our very important desert roads  called Jandaq-Mo'aleman, which really finally connects Semnan  and Damghan to Na'in, on which you can cross Iran's central  plain on an asphalt road.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Despite the development of the roads you  mentioned, it still appears that we have a shortage of  connective roads in the country. Have you estimated this  shortage at all?    [Torkan] These shortages will always exist because we need  to  develop roads everywhere in the country. However, under these  conditions one must observe priorities. We need 355 billion  tomans to complete the roads now under construction, meaning the  roads that have been given to the contractors, while in the  Second Five-Year Plan we have 155 billion tomans credit for road  construction. We are now at a place where a decision must be  made, for we must stretch 155 billion tomans through 355 billion  tomans in construction work. We must either advance all the  roads some, or delay some and finish some others, and we have  chosen the latter.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] In developing the nation's road  construction, are we faced with a technological problem, in  addition to the problem of allocating credits?    [Torkan] Fortunately our contractors are quite capable in  terms of construction capability. Our contracting capability far  exceeds the development credits for road construction. If we do  not think about our contractors, these people will be faced with  unemployment and stagnation.    We now have about 300 contractors in the country, of whom  about 20 are major contractors. We must be able to find work  outside the country for these 20 major contractors so that the  other small contractors in the country will be able to find work  and continue to survive.    Two projects in Pakistan have now been turned over to  Iranian  contractors, and they are contractors for the Ministry of Roads  and Transport (these two companies are named Stratus and General  Mechanic).    We have also encouraged several other contractors to go  outside the country and seek work, and we are supporting them.    Because our contractors participate in international  bidding,  they have problems that we must solve. We are therefore seeking  to create a financial and credit fund with the participation of  the Syndicate of Shipping and Transportation Companies, which  will support Iranian companies outside the country, grant them  loans wherever necessary, and issue them letters of credit. In  reality, by supporting contractors, we will be able to bring  them into the international market and use their significant  engineering capacity to generate revenue for the country.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Will we advance to the point where we  will also be paying them subsidies?    [Torkan] I do not think they will need subsidies, because  they are capable in terms of engineering technology and they can  compete on international markets at the lowest price.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] If the price is low, yes, but if their  costs get so high that they cannot compete, then what will  happen?    [Torkan] In any case, Iranian contractors can complete a  task  at half the cost of foreign contractors.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Then why can't our contractors win in  international bidding?    [Torkan] Because we have just begun doing this. Our  contractors won the bidding in Pakistan, i.e., we did not  believe that we were capable and we have just become aware of  our capabilities.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] In view of the credits they have  announced, we may be able to procure something less than half  the credits needed from government resources. To achieve the  objective in road building, can we use private sector or foreign  resources?    [Torkan] We certainly can. We have placed numerous  advertisements in domestic and foreign media seeking financial  and monetary resources we will be able to use to carry out large  projects. We will have to use nongovernment resources to build  the freeway from Tehran to the north. With the help of bank  credits, we are now building the Qazvin-Zanjan freeway.    This freeway must continue from Zanjan to Tabriz and then to  the Bazargan border. Turkey also wants to build a freeway from  Ankara to our border. This transportation superhighway will be a  road for ECO and Central Asia.    We are now building the Tehran-Saveh freeway with credits  from the nation's banks and from commerce. This year we decided  to extend that same freeway to Solfchegan and then from there to  Arak.    In Khuzestan Province we are also hoping to build roads from  Ahvaz to Abadan and from Ahvaz to Andimeshk with war region  reconstruction credits. Ultimately, we want this to become a  national freeway connecting Tehran to Khorramshahr and Abadan.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] To some extent the nature of domestic  participation is clear. What will be the nature of foreign  participation in this matter?    [Torkan] This can be done in two ways. One is they can make  us a loan, which must be at a low price. We will repay the loan  with tolls we will collect on the freeway.    The other way is that they can do the work on the BOT  [Balance of Trade] basis. That is, they themselves will build  the road and then operate it for a period of time. After their  period of operation ends, they will turn it over to us and  leave. We are conducting negotiations now on both procedures.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Do you think the BOT form of investment  will meet needs in Iran?    [Torkan] Definitely. Imam Khomeyni Airport, the freeway from  Tehran to the north and the Mazandaran coastal road are meeting  our needs in this way.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Have you proposed these procedures to  foreigners?    [Torkan] Yes, this has been proposed both to Iranians and  foreigners.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] One of the important responsibilities  assigned to the Ministry of Roads and Transport came after the  expansion of ECO, when the ECO center of transportation and  shipping was moved to Iran and Iran became recognized as one of  the countries responsible for transportation and shipping for  ECO. In view of this, what will the policies of the Ministry of  Roads and Transport be?    [Torkan] When one speaks of transportation and shipping, it  is necessary to divide the subject into various categories, such  as transportation and shipping by road, railroad, sea, and air.  These must be considered separately.    With regard to air transportation and shipping, we are  seeking ECO control. As you know, there are routes in the air  just as there are routes on land. If these routes have radar  coverage, they are like the freeways we have on land. Therefore,  the air freeways are air routes with radar coverage.    We therefore paid attention to air routes after the triumph  of the Islamic revolution, just as we bought aircraft for the  Islamic Republic of Iran's airline companies HOMA [Iranian  National Airlines] and ASMAN [National Airline Services  Company]. Nongovernmental airlines such as Kish Air, Mahan Air,  Caspian, and Safiran were established and began doing  transportation and shipping work. These are airlines. We have  also given attention to air bases. We have built many airports  and many are also under construction, but what has not received  attention is the matter of air routes.    Of course, air routes do not come to mind very much. Most  people do not think that roads must also be built in the sky.  They think roads do not exist in the sky and that everyone goes  wherever he wants to go. The respected Majles deputies and the  nation's political and regional officials all want to build  airports, but no one wants to build those roads. It is one of  our weaknesses, and we are now investing to develop air routes.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What have you done with regard to  maritime routes?    [Torkan] The Ministry of Roads and Transport's main policy  is  to develop transportation and shipping on the Sea of Mazandaran.  We are now building two ports, Mirabad and Fereydunkenar, which  will expand our transportation and shipping capacity on the Sea  of Mazandaran.    Our problem is that our railroad is on the east side of the  Sea of Mazandaran but our main port is on the west side of it.  By order of the president of the republic, we are to build docks  at Bandar-e Torkman and Bandar-e Gaz in order to connect the  railroad to the Sea of Mazandaran.    With the development of Bandar-e Torkman we will bring  maritime transportation and shipping to our own railroad. Thus,  in this way from ports such as Makhach Qel'eh, Astarakhan,  Kerasnavask, and Bakuvaktav we will be able to put our railcars  on ships, bring them to Bandar-e Torkman and put them on our own  rails to go to Bandar 'Abbas.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Is the development of the southern  maritime routes also on your agenda?    [Torkan] Our ports in the south have good capacity. In  Chabahar we have two large commercial ports. One is Martyr  Kalantari and the other is Martyr Beheshti. At Jask there is a  port, at Bandar 'Abbas are the Martyr Bahonar and Martyr Raja'i  ports, we are building a port at Kangan, we are building the  Bandar-e Emam port at Bushehr, and finally, the reconstruction  of the port at Abadan has been completed and the reconstruction  of the port at Khorramshahr is underway, but transportation and  shipping and trade are already taking place there.    Many small fishing ports have also been built in the  southern  part of the country. In Sistan va Baluchestan Province since the  revolution several ports, including Baris, Ramin, Haftom-e Tir,  and Tays have been built. By the end of the year [20 March] we  will complete Pasa Bandar, and there is another port at Kalak,  where a fishing dock must be built.    Of course, since the revolution the ports at Hormoz Island,  the multipurpose dock at Qeshm and several old ports at Abu Musa  have been rebuilt.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] You have mentioned the railroads in our  country. In the last few years the railroads have tried to  separate themselves from the government budget in order to  operate as a company, and there are problems in this area.  First, tell us what the fate of the railroads will be. Can they  manage themselves? Second, tell us your plans for developing the  railroads, because the railroad does not currently meet all of  the nation's needs.    [Torkan] The railroads have already been separated from the  government budget. The main task before us is to try in the  second half of the year 1373 [23 September 1994-20 March 1995]  to complete the Bafq-Bandar 'Abbas rail line, and then to  complete the Mashhad-Sarakhs rail line by the end of the year  1374 [20 March 1996].    We have several bottlenecks in the Tehran area that we need  to eliminate. One is Aprin, which is the largest freight  unloading facility in south Tehran. Then there are the two rail  lines, one that connects Aprin to Maleki, between Tehran and  Karaj, and the one that connects Aprin to the Bahram station  between Tehran and Varamin. These two lines really make it  possible for us to do shipping and transportation between the  west and east parts of the country without going through Tehran.    Another project, now under way, is to make the Tehran-Qom  line, which is a bottleneck in the southern part of the country,  into a two-way line. Parts of that will be finished by the end  of the year [20 March].    These are tasks that are being implemented. We also have  projects in the Second Five-Year Plan. One is the Bafq-Mashhad  railroad, and one is the Kerman-Zahedan railroad. The  Bafq-Mashhad line will make it possible for us to go from  Sarakhs to Mashhad, from Mashhad to Bafq and from Bafq to Bandar  'Abbas.    The direct line from the eastern part of the country to  Bandar 'Abbas, Kerman, and Zahedan is the bottleneck in the rail  connection between Singapore and Paris. The India and Pakistan  railroads go to Zahedan, and the European railroads come through  Iran to Kerman. When we connect Kerman and Zahedan, this  international network will be connected.    Several other projects are also being discussed such as the  Tehran-Mashhad and Tehran-Esfahan high-speed rail lines. We want  to complete this project with nongovernmental investments. We  are seeking an investor for these tasks, and we are negotiating  with foreign companies in this regard.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Our railroads are quite old and  worn-out.  Unfortunately, they have become weaker in terms of safety. What  is your view concerning this?    [Torkan] I do not completely accept this. Our railroads are  old, but they are good. They have also been rebuilt in the years  since the triumph of the Islamic revolution.    For example, the rails have been changed on our  Tehran-Mashhad line from Tehran to the other side of Shahrud,  which is the Bokran station, and it has new ties. This line is a  new line. The line from Tehran to the south has been rebuilt and  the rails have been welded together. The parts of the railroad  and the rails are no longer separate. The rails have been welded  together with new technology and the vibrations and shaking on  the train have been reduced along the entire route.    Our railroads are a great investment. Although the  locomotives are worn out, fortunately, during Mr. Sa'idi-Kiya's  tenure, 120 locomotives were purchased from Canada, of which 44  have come into the country so far. God willing, the rest will  also come into the country, and the locomotive power in our  railroads will be reinforced.    Likewise, with the start-up of the rail passenger car  production line at Pars Wagon, we are buying these cars and they  are being produced for us at full capacity. The passenger cars  you now see on our lines are the domestically produced products  of Pars Wagon.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Unfortunately the operation of railroads  in our country is done with very old technology. Today, such  railroads are not used in the world. They have powerful radio  communications lines and much more powerful controls. What is  your view on this?    [Torkan] No, we have these kinds of communications and  controls. It is not as you say. We now have electronic controls  on the Tehran-Tabriz line. We have remote controls on the  Tehran-Yazd line. There are computer controls on the Bafq-Bandar  'Abbas line, and these are among the newest controls in the  world.    Of course, I agree with what you say about the  Tehran-Mashhad  line, which is an old line. We have now signed a contract with a  foreign company, and with the transfer of the technology to the  country, the equipment will be rebuilt from Tehran to Bekran  under this contract. We ourselves will rebuild the line from  Bekran to Mashhad with equipment we have already built ourselves.    One line that is still old and for which we have no plans is  the Tehran-Sari-Gorgan line. Of course, this line has old line  controls and I also agree with what you say concerning this line.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] There been several railroad accidents  recently. In studies that have been done it has become clear  that we have had these accidents solely because of the lack of  technology. There is also the fact that our rail intersections  are on the same level, especially in the major cities such as  Tehran. What is your view in this regard?    [Torkan] There is a problem, and unfortunately it is  reflected in the major media. When a train jumps a rail, we call  that an accident. Formerly these incidents were not recorded and  the problems were solved at the site itself. Now, however, we  send the Accident Investigation Council to study the cause at  the site. These things we call accidents and are shown in our  monthly statistics are not solely collisions between two trains.    We have required the railroads to report on these kinds of  accidents with these same details so that we can resolve the  defects.    Of course, the railroad officials are worried and they do  not  want these reports to appear in the media. They are asking me  not to report these problems on paper, and leave it to them to  deal with them themselves, but I do not agree. I believe that  these things must be fully reported and investigated by the  Accident Investigation Council.    One problem we have concerning accidents is that they take  place in the cities. If you travel by train on the  Tehran-Qa'emshahr-Sari line, you will see that the people have  trespassed on the railroad's right-of-way all along the route.  Most of the people have made the doors to their homes open  facing the railroad, and even in these right-of-way areas and  along the rails they have built many homes. These problems cause  various accidents, especially involving children. We must  therefore prevent accidents by not trespassing on the railroad's  right-of-way.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Of course, as you said there are many  problems like this in the north, but this problem has also  spread now in Iran. As you know we had an accident with a police  car and a train, and a train collided with an automobile in  Rabat-e Karim. Eyewitnesses say that the traffic control  equipment was not working or the control bar did not come down  in time. Railroad officials claim that they do not have the  budget. My view is that one of the real problems with railroad  development is that we must increase railroad safety.    [Torkan] We must create an atmosphere in society where they  do not trespass on the railroad right-of-way, and whoever does  must bear the responsibility for his own blood. We are now  widening the railroad right-of-way from Tehran to Saveh. We are  now also designing and building bridges and making the lines  two-way. The entire route from Tehran to Aprin is being made  two-way, and we are protecting the two directions with guard  rails, although the people are breaking down these rails and  going back and forth, and this struggle continues.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] In view of the light administration of  the railroads, will this company be able to meet its costs?    [Torkan] No, the railroad cannot manage itself at these  rates.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Are subsidies being paid now to the  railroads?    [Torkan] Unfortunately the railroad is now eating out of its  own pocket. That is, it gets its spare parts from its own  warehouses, because the government does not give it foreign  exchange. Thus the railroads are using parts without buying  parts. They are not restocking the items consumed in the  warehouse. This is a great problem and we will have to revise  the railroad transportation and shipping costs.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Will this revision show up in next  year's  budget?    [Torkan] Of course, this revision has been applied to the  railroad company's budget.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] How do you assess the air rates for  transportation and shipping?    [Torkan] In Europe, air transportation costs $80 per seat  per  hour, and we now collect $8 per seat per hour. The unregulated  lines such as Iran Aerator get $15 per seat per hour. So far,  the government has paid subsidies to us so that this year we got  13 billion tomans in subsidies. This subsidy will be eliminated  next year, and we will be forced to revise our rates. I think  $30 per seat per hour is a suitable rate (the fare is $30 per  person to fly from Tehran to Mashhad).    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Do the private companies that now  operate  for $15 make a profit? Are subsidies paid to them?    [Torkan] No, they do not make a profit and subsidies are not  paid to them. They are now losing money and if we do not change  their rates, they will not be able to continue operating next  year.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] In view of this, how have you been able  to persuade them to provide their services?    [Torkan] The Economic Council has decided that we will not  increase rates before the end of this year [20 March 1994], and  we are observing this decision.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Will you also increase the number of  aircraft?    [Torkan] We will definitely increase the number of aircraft.  However, we are still discussing whether to buy the aircraft,  lease them, or buy them on a lease-purchase arrangement. We  think that in view of the worldwide recession in transportation  and shipping, it is not entirely wise for us to pay cash to buy  aircraft. We should either lease the aircraft or buy them on a  lease-purchase agreement.    The aircraft manufacturers are seeking to sell the aircraft.  We think they should provide us with low-cost loans to enable us  to buy the aircraft from them.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] It is noted that the country needs more  airlines and aircraft. We are still short on transportation and  shipping during some seasons. Is the private sector volunteering  to help in this area?    [Torkan] We have given agreements in principle to about 20  private sector companies to enable them to operate air  transportation and shipping lines. Of course, if they are unable  to operate an airline within six months we will cancel their  agreements in principle, but a number of them have begun  operating.</p>

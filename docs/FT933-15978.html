			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / International Company News: More job cuts at Groupe Bull GROUPE BULL, the troubled French computer company, plans to cut its worldwide workforce by 6,500 by the end of next year in the hope of returning to profit in 1995. The bulk of the job losses, which involve reducing Bull's 35,175 workforce by 18 per cent, will come from operations outside France. Bull, a state-controlled company targeted for privatisation by the new centre-right government, plans to cut its domestic workforce by 2,850 from the present level of 13,600. Bull said the cuts would come 'across the board in every country and in every area of activity including research, manufacturing and marketing'. It has already implemented more than 1,000 of the 6,500 job losses since the beginning of this year. The latest round of rationalisation follows years of cost-cutting by Bull, which has been hit badly by the difficulties of the international computer industry. The group has shed staff steadily since 1988, when its worldwide workforce peaked at 45,500. However, the cuts have failed to resolve Bull's financial problems. It recently reported a net loss of FFr4.7bn (Dollars 820m) for 1992, after losing FFr3.3bn in 1991 and FFr6.8bn in 1990. The group's financial condition is so precarious that analysts were shocked to see its inclusion in the government's list of privatisation candidates. Bull is seen as one of the longer term contenders for sale to the private sector. Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister, has made clear that the new government will take a tough line on lossmaking state companies, such as Bull. He recently said he expected Bull to stem its losses, and warned he would be much more stringent about injecting new capital than his predecessors. Bull said it hoped to return to the black 'as soon as possible', and that break-even by 1995 was the present target.</p>

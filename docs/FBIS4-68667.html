			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yaram Mamadayev, former leader of Dzhokhar </F> Dudayev's cabinet, head of a government of national trust of the  Chechen Republic in exile, by Mikhail Ivanchikov; place and date  not given: "All Prophets Prefer To Live Outside Their Fatherland]    [Text]    [Ivanchikov] Mr. Prime Minister, you were together with  General Dudayev, the present president of Chechnya, at the  sources of the independence of the Chechen Republic. Why did  your ways part?    [Mamadayev] I would not reduce everything merely to our  personal relationship. We should, perhaps, proceed from the fact  that General Dudayev is unquestionably by nature an  authoritarian individual. And anyone who expresses even the  slightest disagreement with him automatically becomes his  personal enemy. And I am no exception in this case.    I remember well my last conversation with the general last  May, when I found myself in the literal sense looking down the  barrels of automatic weapons in my office. Armed people had not  come to see me at that time of their own free will,  naturally--they had been sent by Dudayev. Although he later  called me personally and said: "I swear! I sent no one." But he  is not, after all, a little boy to be maintaining such things!  With us Muslims the words "I swear" are sacred. Dudayev's older  brother once told me, incidentally: "I would never swear for my  brother on the Koran." This is a very telling remark yet again  characterizing the present president of Chechnya.    [Ivanchikov] Do you have support, financial included, inside  and outside of Chechnya? On what, after all, do you live,  work....    [Mamadayev] I have never concealed the fact that I am given  financial support by Chechen entrepreneurs in Moscow. As far as  an evaluation of my activity within the Chechen Republic is  concerned, we need to return to the moment when the government  of national trust in exile was formed. A specific feature of  Chechen society is that public opinion takes shape in the  process of a dialogue between the teyns (a teyn is an ancestral  clan--NYG note). Thus the Government of the Chechen Republic  that I head was formed with regard to the wishes of the teyns  and the opinions of religious figures, the Chechen  Industrialists' Union, and the local administration chiefs. But  President Dudayev, who in fact debarred this government from  power, thereby flouted the will of the people. And this is in  itself dangerous.    It is hard to reproach me, at least, with personal ambition.  It would have given me more pleasure to have been involved in  enterprise than in political activity. But I was forced to take  account of the wishes of my people. As long as the population of  the Chechen Republic considered me its prime minister, I was  such. Nonetheless, I am looking to the future. The Caucasus  Transnational Corp (KTK), whose activity is aimed entirely at  the restoration of interregional economic relations and movement  toward the world level, was formed to this end. As far as the  latter circumstance is concerned, I can report not without  pleasure that we are even today attempting to win the support of  influential Western financial structures.    [Ivanchikov] You mentioned interregional cooperation,  referring to certain regions of Russia also. How do you see  Chechnya's future in this connection: as part of Russia or as a  totally independent state?    [Mamadayev] The wishes of the Chechen were expressed  unequivocally: total independence. And, I repeat once again, I  am on the side of my people. If, therefore, the union of teyns  ever supports membership of the Russian Federation on these  terms or others, I would not object.    I would like in this connection to add the following. Those  who believe that Chechnya needs Russia more than Russia needs  Chechnya are wrong. And the other way about also. It is not a  question of who can live without whom, and who, not. We have  historically been neighbors. The situation in the Caucasus  depends on Chechnya to a large extent, and the Caucasus, in  turn, influences the situation in the south of Russia. As you  can see, therefore, Chechnya and Russia have a mutual interest  in one another.    Also fruitless, in my view, are any attempts to isolate the  Chechen Republic, as were made recently by President Yeltsin,  declaring an economic blockade of Chechnya, virtually. Who needs  a new focal point of tension in the Caucasus, which, were it to  arise, would be comparable with the Near East or Balkan  conflicts? Yet the economic blockade of the Chechen Republic on  the part of Russia with the virtual withdrawal from Chechnya's  jurisdiction of Sunzhenskiy and Malgobenskiy Rayons is merely  contributing to the appearance of such conflicts. In addition,  such a situation is merely to the benefit of General Dudayev's  criminal regime. The gang of looters he heads is flouting the  laws and pillaging the republic and destabilizing the situation  in the south of Russia. And everything is being ascribed here to  the consequences of the economic blockade declared by Russia and  to "the Kremlin's imperial policy."    But Moscow, unfortunately, is persisting in its desire to  keep Chechnya as part of Russia at all costs. Not long ago I was  speaking with Sergey Filatov, chief of staff of the president of  the Russian Federation, and he confirmed yet again that the  Kremlin had no intention of revising its policy of isolation in  respect to Chechnya.    [Ivanchikov] The release of Ruslan Khasbulatov from  Lefortovo  has made certain adjustments to the alignment of political  forces in Chechnya. Could he become the new leader of the  Chechen Republic?    [Mamadayev] Whatever you think of him, Ruslan Khasbulatov is  undoubtedly a politician of world stature. He has both weight  and authority in Chechnya. In addition, Khasbulatov comes from  the most influential Chechen teyn--the Kharachay. But his  political views are contrary to those that have been expressed  by our people.  <H5>  NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA Explanation </H5>   Boris Yeltsin once told Russia's regions to "Take as much  sovereignty as you can." Chechnya took the maximum. Everyone  knows full well what this has resulted in for it. The power  structures of this republic were unable to agree among  themselves, and one leader was forced to give way. This was  Yaram Mamadayev. The other--General Dudayev--is, in fact, both  the leader and master of Chechnya, although his authority has  begun to decline as of late, and he can no longer count on full  support at home. To hold on to power, therefore, he will  evidently have to appeal increasingly for support, primarily to  Moscow.    Considering the traditions of Chechen society, it has to be  observed that the sovereignty of the Chechen Republic, as a  supreme and undoubted value of the republic, may be determined  only in the event of all the teyns being able to agree on this  score. In addition, it is essential also to take account of the  opinion of the Russians who live in Chechnya and who belong to  no teyn.    Reflecting on the subject of the sovereignty of the Chechen  Republic, the sociologist Abdurakhman Avtokhranov, another  prominent representative of the Chechen people, observes: "Our  people have never known statehood and have for this reason acted  regardless of all states. They have always been intrepid for  their self-preservation. Consequently, the self-preservation of  the Chechen people is not made directly dependent on the  acquisition of sovereignty and statehood. And the present  Chechen politicians, in the republic or in exile, should take  account of this fact also.</p>

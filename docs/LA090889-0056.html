			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Congress should not yet close the books on the Iran-Contra affair, the former  chairman of the House committee that investigated the scandal said. In a letter  to Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles),  Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.) asked that the committee begin "a continuing  investigation" of new documents and other evidence that may have surfaced in  the trial of former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North or which may surface during  other upcoming trials of Iran-Contra figures. "Most importantly, we still do  not understand precisely what were the roles in these events of (Ronald)  Reagan, (then) Vice President Bush and other top Reagan Administration  officials," Hamilton said in the letter.  </P></p>

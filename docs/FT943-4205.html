			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Transnational combines star as Paris gains 1% A strong recovery in bond markets, flirting with the idea that the Bundesbank may have another interest rate cut up its sleeve, took equities up with it, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS mixed its bond market impetus with a mostly positive bag of company news, and the CAC-40 index responded with a rise of 19.20 to 1,983.40 in turnover of FFr3.1bn. One French/UK combine, the Carnaudmetalbox packaging group, provided the star turn of the day, rising FFr12.30, or 7.5 per cent, to FFr176.40 following news of better than expected first-half profits. Another, Arjo Wiggins, did well in the London market for similar reasons; in Paris this lifted Saint-Louis, which owns 39 per cent of Arjo, by FFr44 to FFr1,580. Carrefour rose FFr35 to FFr2,131 on strong first-half results and the retailer's forecast that it could match last year's profits growth. Company chairmen came to the fore. Among the water companies, Lyonnaise des Eaux's Mr Jerome Monod told a business conference that his company's 1994 net attributable profit would be 'clearly higher' than that of 1993, and saw its shares up FFr13 to FFr528 after a period of relative weakness. Weak spots included Peugeot, down FFr9 at FFr835 as Mr Jaques Calvet said that he was merely less pessimistic about 1994. Meanwhile, Schneider, the electricals group whose Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne was jailed for 11 days in Belgium some three months ago, dropped 5 per cent at one point on news that a Belgian judge has issued an international arrest warrant for its chairman, before recovering to close FFr7.70 down at FFr399.50. FRANKFURT reflected gains in the December bund future, with the Dax index a modest 8.55 higher at 2,172.37, improving to an Ibis-indicated 2,178.10 at the end of the post bourse. Turnover eased from DM5.4bn to DM5.3bn. Financials and, to a lesser extent, carmakers responded most consistently to the improved bond market atmosphere. Deutsche Bank rose DM7.80 to DM722.80 on the session, and another DM7 to DM729.80 after hours. At Merrill Lynch, Mr Ian McEwen said Deutsche had been relatively strong against the sector for the past two weeks, but that this had followed relative weakness against the sector and the market for upwards of a year. Underperformers included Metallgesellschaft, down DM1 at DM183 on the downgrading of some of its debt ratings. However, the hope of a break even 1994 for engineering concern KHD took the latter up DM6.30 to DM128.80. MILAN saw a technical rebound as some buyers returned after five consecutive days of losses which had taken the market 4.7 per cent lower. The Comit index finished 6.77 higher at 665.16, although the mood remained constrained by an absence of news about government action on the budget. BCI rose L125, or 3.5 per cent, to L3,685 as its L2,400bn rights issue continued to heighten volatility. The insurers also put in a strong performance in the wake of Wednesday's remarks by Mr Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister, who said that funds set aside for severance pay should be channelled into private pension funds. Generali rose L550 to L41,350, Ras picked up L450 to L24,150, and Ina added L65 at L2,250. Foreign interest helped the telecommunications stocks to rally, with Telecom Italia up L70 to L4,440 and Stet finishing L85 ahead at L4,835. Volatility in Benetton continued with the stock losing another L450 to L22,100. ZURICH finished little changed in thin trading after a firm opening encouraged some investors to take profits during the session. The SMI index edged up 1.6 to 2,664.1. Ascom, the telecommunications group, rose SFr80, or 5.3 per cent, to SFr1,590 after news that the company had swung back to a first-half pre-tax net profit after last year's loss. Saurer, the textile machinery maker, was SFr20, or 4.3 per cent, lower at SFr450 after announcing that first-half net profits plunged by 75 per cent. Georg Fischer, the foundries and engineering group, climbed SFr50 to SFr1,700 as investors continued to react to the company's positive earnings forecast for this year. MADRID, closed today for a public holiday, galloped ahead in late trading on strong gains in the bond market and its banking and utility sector beneficiaries. The general index rose 6.91, or 2.3 per cent, to 305.18, with a raft of major gains among the banks from BBV, up Pta95 or just over 3 per cent to Pta3,095, to Santander, Pta265 or 5.3 per cent better at Pta9,260. Endesa led utilities with a gain of Pta180 to Pta5,530, but dealers said the market would have looked more healthy if it had shown less volatility on the downside, prior to yesterday's recovery. AMSTERDAM saw some late foreign demand which helped the AEX index to end 0.67 higher at 415.84. Fortis Amev, the Dutch-Belgian insurer, fell Fl 1.70 to Fl 73.00 after first-half results failed to match expectations. Some late US demand took Unilever Fl 2.20 forward to Fl 203.00 and VNU up Fl 2.50 to Fl 192.00. DSM, the chemicals group, put on Fl 2.90 at Fl 146 in further response to Wednesday's news that it planned a new polypropylene plant. HELSINKI was virtually flat, the Hex index losing only 1.8 at 1,942.6, but the forestry sector fell 2.2 per cent on profit-taking on Kymmene's news that it may decide on a rights issue in November. Kymmene fell FM7, 4.8 per cent, to FM138. ISTANBUL was rescued from a deep downtrend as the main Turkish parties agreed on a new privatisation bill. The composite index closed just 147.69 down at 24,200.29 after a fall of 7.4 per cent to a low of 147.69 at one stage of the day. TEL AVIV came back refreshed after two day's holiday for the Jewish new year, and the Mishtanim index rose 6.29, or 3.3 per cent, to 198.48. WARSAW rebounded strongly after five sessions of heavy losses as investors, encouraged by bargain hunting on Wednesday, stepped up buying to cash in on an expected rally next week. The Wig index rose 753.3, or 8.1 per cent, to 10,027.7 but turnover fell 39 per cent to 624bn zlotys.

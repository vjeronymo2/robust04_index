			<p>BFN     [Text] On the subject of Rwanda, Belgium, the Netherlands,  Portugal, Spain, and Germany said today that they are ready to  give logistic or humanitarian assistance to the French  operation. Great Britain is also reported to be ready to  provide logistic assistance. Italy, for its part, says it is  ready to provide support in the form of troops, but with certain  conditions attached. The French 60-man detachment, which  arrived yesterday afternoon in Cyangugu, in the southwest of  Rwanda, is continuing to supply the humanitarian needs of the  civilian population of the region this morning, while violent  fighting continued between the government forces and the rebels  of the Patriotic Front in the capital, Kigali. A mortar shell  hit the operating theater of the Red Cross hospital, and sick  people may well have been wounded.    The United Nations High Commission is expecting a further  exodus of hundreds of thousands of Rwandans into neighboring  countries, if the soldiers allow them to cross the border.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Wolfgang Schaeuble, head of the CDU/CSU </F> [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] Bundestag  caucus, by Konrad Handschuh and Friedrich Thelen; place and date  not given: "`Extremely Kind'--Tax Discussion in Bonn,  Restructuring the German Economy, Government Strategy"]    [Text] [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Mr. Schaeuble, at the moment,  things do not look good for the coalition government in Bonn.  How do you intend to come up from the depths by the elections?    [Schaeuble] As with the economy, the trend is more important  than the absolute figures, and if the trend continues, things  will not look so bad on election day. The more we succeed in  nailing down the Social Democratic Party [SPD] and in explaining  a few contested measures that were taken this year, the better  our chances will be.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] The unusual thing about this campaign,  however, is that it is the government that must attack, not the  opposition.    [Schaeuble] In fact, the opposition should be calling  attention to alternatives to the government's policies. It has  been Scharping's strategy thus far--not without success--to  refuse to do precisely that.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Your former secretary general, Heiner  Geissler, is of the opinion that one should be the aggressor  when one is behind. Where do you intend to stir things up?    [Schaeuble] I hold the same view as Heiner Geissler. Is it  not strange, that Mr. Scharping wants to pursue the government's  family policies and external security policies in a seamless  fashion? Continuing to pursue our own policies is something we  can probably do better than the opposition.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Now, the election will be decided on  other  fronts, especially with regard to the question: who can create  the most jobs? The SPD seems to be credited with greater  competence in that area.    [Schaeuble] The most recent polls give us a definite  advantage in the area of economic competence. True, we would  have to lead in that area by a ratio of 10. We cannot solve  everything overnight, in a dramatic fashion with a dose of  medication, which appears to be what the SPD is offering. These  matters require a long, sustained effort to address the  structural problems that have crept into the economy of western  Germany. We shall dismantle our structural disadvantages. That  is the way to assure long-term growth and employment. There is  no easier way.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] How do you intend to create jobs, given  predictions of economic growth rates of 1.5 to 2 percent?    [Schaeuble] We shall create them if we cut back on this  overheated trend of spiralling wage and wage-related costs.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] [Nursing-care] benefits are not exactly  the best place to achieve reductions in wage-related costs    [Schaeuble] No, they are not increasing. In this case, we  have achieved, arduously and imperfectly enough, full  compensation, in principle, of the costs incurred by the firms.  Of course, one could haggle over details.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Originally, this was intended as a means  of assuring greater self-sufficiency for the citizenry.    [Schaeuble] That was a victim of the cross-fire between the  opposition, the majority of the Bundesrat, and the major  economic associations. The fact that the unions did not support  this was known, but their tumultuous opposition really amazed  me. Now we shall provide the care, and we shall introduce  greater self-sufficiency and participation in the next  legislative session.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Will the topic of continued wage payments  in case of illness be on the agenda?    [Schaeuble] It makes little sense, four weeks after the end  of the discussion of these benefits, to revive the topic once  more. But I guarantee, we shall address the topic of "more  responsibility for oneself" once more.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] The issue of benefits insurance would  make  Ludwig Erhard turn over in his grave. How does it come about  that Erhard's party has evidently taken one step ahead of the  economically predictable next generation? Is the internal  climate within the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] an unhealthy  one for economic policymakers?    [Schaeuble] No, not at all. In the person of Rainer Haungs,  we have an outstanding economic policymaker. It is true that  Klaus Toepfer is the minister of the environment, but no one  disputes his high degree of competence in the area of economic  policy.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] The firms used the recession to  restructure and they have achieved great increases in  productivity. Has the political world also taken advantage of  the opportunity of the crisis?    [Schaeuble] In this legislative session, we went to the  limit  of the politically possible. This path must continue to be taken  in a consistent manner in the next session, for which reason, a  Red-Green alternative in the next four years would be  irresponsible.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] There could be a social-liberal coalition  as well.    [Schaeuble] Any theoretically conceivable constellation,  other than the present-day coalition, would be less suitable. We  could have saved a few billion [German marks] more by now if the  SPD Bundesrat majority had not hindered our savings measures.  And if you take a look at Mr. Scharping's program, you will find  a shortfall of about 50 billion between the claim and reality.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] You had better recheck your figures.    [Schaeuble] Is it more?    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Yes.    [Schaeuble] You see, I try to be nice to those who cannot  quite grasp the difference between gross income and net income.  In any case, the country can ill afford a worse government.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Will this coalition, if it is reelected,  increase taxes again?    [Schaeuble] We want to reduce the state's share as a whole,  and thus, the quotient of taxes and other levies. There will be  no further increases, beyond those tax increases that have  already been enacted, and the solidarity supplement.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] And the subsistence minimum that  Karlsruhe  [Supreme Court] insists upon?    [Schaeuble] Of course, as the situation continues to shift,  there is the possibility that in an individual instance,  increased levies could be assessed, but on the whole, there will  be no increase of overall taxation.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Will you repeal the tax on labor, and  rely, instead, more on indirect taxes?    [Schaeuble] For a long time, I have been saying, over and  over, that, in the long term, we must assess lower levies on  labor and business earnings. Private consumption and private  assets pose a means of offsetting this.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Are you slowly getting the feeling that  you cannot implement everything you want?    [Schaeuble] I keep trying to keep the proper balance between  the requisite confidence and a sufficiently sober assessment of  the situation that is rooted in reality. Of course, after 12  years of governing activities, signs of wear start to show. I  would not like to place my confidence purly on the sympathy  vote. But when, on 16 October, a decision is reached concerning  the concrete decisions and realistic proposals of both sides, we  shall manage it.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Are you not also harboring the hope, just  a bit, that events in world politics will help you? For example,  on the premise that f the world all around us, especially  Russia, is getting to be an ever more dangerous place, the  Germans want the experienced Helmut Kohl once more.    [Schaeuble] We are placing our bets on the discussion in the  fields of economics, finance, employment, and social policy. Of  course, external security will remain a topic of central  importance, but not in the sense that we hoped for crisis-laden  developments. Such a price would be too high. To state the case  somewhat informally: Better Scharping in Bonn than Zhirinovsky  in Moscow.</p>

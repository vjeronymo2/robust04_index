			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Germans press on with defence cuts MR Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, yesterday unveiled details of a first round of budget cuts in defence spending which will save an estimated DM700m (Pounds 300m) over the next few years. The expected cuts are part of the post-unification decision to reduce the German army to 370,000 men by 1995 and lower its budget to under DM50bn by the end of the year. Additional rounds of cuts are expected after the federal government recently raised 1993 defence savings to DM863m. The cuts are part of the federal government's attempt to cut spending and find revenues to rebuild eastern germany. It had originally set this year's cut at DM300m but decided to raise this amount rather than go ahead with an unpopular move to means test children's allowances. The planned cuts will reduce or close down 35 garrisons in both the eastern and western parts of the country out of the 745 garrisons of the German Bundeswehr. The largest savings, set at DM350m, will come from the scrapping of a large military exercise area in Wunsdorf, near Berlin. The military base there is currently still occupied by Russian soldiers, who are due to return home by the end of next year. Other cuts include the closure of one of the four main naval bases in the country. The naval base, in Opelnitz, in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, will be gradually closed down, with its fast petrol boats transferred to the marine base of Warnemunde near the east German town of Rostock. The cuts do not include an immediate reduction in army personnel. A spokesman at the defence ministry in Bonn said that the military personnel posted in garrisons due to be closed would be transferred to other bases. But the defence ministry will continue seeking additional ways to make cuts. Mr Ruhe is due to review staffing levels in the Bundeswehr after Chancellor Helmut Kohl announced last weekend that personnel cuts could be made below the planned level of 370,000 men by 1995.</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: Better margins lift Canadian Imperial Bank IMPROVED lending margins helped Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce post an 11 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings, in spite of a rise in loan loss provisions. Canada's second biggest bank lifted earnings to CDollars 221m, (USDollars 187.2m) or CDollars 1.01 per share from CDollars 199m, or 98 cents a year earlier. Return on common equity fell to 13.5 per cent from 14.2 per cent due to increased preferred share financing. Return on average assets rose to 0.71 per cent from 0.67 per cent. Net interest income rose to CDollars 922m from CDollars 818m, reflecting a widening in interest rate margins to 3.05 per cent from 2.8 per cent. The protracted domestic recession has led the bank to raise loan loss provisions to CDollars 188m from CDollars 128m. CIBC estimated loan losses for the year at CDollars 750m, against CDollars 613m in fiscal 1991.</p>

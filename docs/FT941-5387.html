			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Breathing space for the trade giants: The rift between the US and Japan President Bill Clinton's revival of the 'Super 301' trade provision last week looks like a blunt threat designed to pave the way for sanctions against Japan unless Tokyo opens its markets. Yet the underlying plot is more subtle. For at the same time as tightening the screws, Washington wants to give both sides more breathing space to reach a settlement. This follows last month's failure by prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Mr Clinton to conclude an accord on reducing Japan's record trade surplus, more than Dollars 50bn with the US alone last year, and liberalising its markets. To many trade partners of the US and Japan, Washington's decision to up the ante is unwelcome. It reinforces what many see as a tendency for the world's two largest economies to negotiate on trade in an exclusive bilateral manner. The risk of bilateralism has already provoked warnings from the European Union to Japan and forms the core of Tokyo's broadside against the US decision to reinstate 'Super 301' - the US trade law which permits Washington to identify by name 'unfair traders' and makes possible the imposition of American sanctions. Neither Washington nor Tokyo is, however, behaving as if it wants a trade war. The US has indicated that it will apply 'Super 301' even less aggressively than by previously mild standards. 'Super 301' has never led to sanctions since its introduction by the Reagan administration in 1988 and is even less likely to do so on this occasion. The US administration has given itself until September 30 to name 'priority foreign country practices' - but not necessarily countries - which obstruct US exports. The aim is to 'spare embarrassment' to suspected offenders, a senior US official says. Washington will only then consider sanctions after 12-18 months of inquiry and an appeal to the World Trade Organisation, the successor body to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, if it believes multilateral rules are being infringed. 'The president did not really let Japan off the hook,' says Mr Harry Freeman, a US trade lobbyist. 'He let the line out.' The concessions the US is fishing for in Japan include a permanent income tax cut instead of the one-year reduction recently decreed by Tokyo, measures to boost consumer spending, and more radical deregulation than the moderate steps proposed by the Hosokawa government. The Japanese government and business community are, meanwhile, in a mood to give significant ground to Washington. Although Japan's bureaucrats and politicians know that trade sanctions are unlikely, they sense that the current trade dispute with the US is unlike previous ones. The fear in Japan is that the outcome will go beyond economic relations and damage Tokyo's strategic partnership with Washington. Mr Hosakawa's government is unsure exactly how, or even if, Washington's attitude to Tokyo has changed as a result of the end of the cold war; this dilemma is one of the central unanswered questions facing Japan's foreign ministry. Officials believe now that Japan has less strategic value to Washington as a buttress against communism in Asia, trade rows with the US might not be as easily containable as in the past. The foreign ministry in Tokyo, chief advocate of caution against saying 'no' too loudly to Washington, believes that the trade dispute might harm long-term political and security ties with the US. At the very least, officials fear that the traditional comfortable link between trade and political co-operation in US-Japan relations has been broken. Meanwhile, as Japan's export-dependent manufacturers have discovered to their heavy cost, the US does not need to resort to trade sanctions if it wants to apply economic pressure on Tokyo. Washington has only to talk up the yen, the strength of which is one of the biggest constraints on Japan's hopes of recovering from its worst recession since the second world war. The Japanese government is, therefore, likely to accede to US demands. But two big factors are likely to limit the extent of Tokyo's concessions. First, Japan's seven-party ruling coalition is weak and divided and its capacity to deliver on anything has been sharply reduced. The second factor is the strength of feeling in Tokyo against binding import quotas. These numerical targets on imports are what the US appears to be seeking as a first step towards reducing Japan's bilateral trade surplus, as embodied in last summer's economic framework agreement between the two countries. Tokyo is under strong domestic and international support to face down Washington on numerical targets, the one area where it can demonstrate more assertiveness than previous Liberal Democratic party administrations. This support was one reason why Mr Hosakawa was more direct with Mr Clinton at their summit last month than any LDP prime minister had ever been towards a US president. Yet even on the sensitive subject of numerical targets, officials in Tokyo and Washington have started to sketch out a compromise. Evidence of the Japanese government's eagerness to assuage the US came at the weekend. Mr Hosokawa called an emergency cabinet meeting for Wednesday to discuss market-opening measures; the prime minister intends to present proposals to Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, when the two men meet for talks on Thursday. The private sector is also responding. At least two car producers, Toyota and Mazda, are preparing 'voluntary targets' for the purchase of US components this year. IDO, the Japanese telecoms group, is close to agreement on improved market access for Motorola, the US telecoms multinational which in recent months has been the focus of a row over access for American mobile telephones in Japan. Yet the government's ability to tackle the fundamental economic problems underlying Japan's persistent trade surpluses is limited by the coalition's current disarray. Mr Hosokawa's ability to make economic policy decisions is looking shakier than ever after he was forced last week to scrap plans for a cabinet reshuffle to strengthen his economic team. One side effect of the abortive reshuffle has been to weaken the position of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, an important influence on economic policy. Mr Ozawa is also a valuable behind-the-scenes negotiator with the US, having recently suggested the adoption of non-binding 'effort targets' for a cut in the trade surplus, an obvious step towards compromise. However, the prime minister has risked alienating Mr Ozawa by turning down his demand for the removal of Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the chief cabinet secretary, who upset a package of Ozawa-inspired tax reforms in January. Any signs over the next few weeks that Mr Ozawa is losing patience with the prime minister could bode ill for economic policy. The muddle in government and the absence of a strong opposition will no doubt reinforce US suspicions that foreign pressure is the only way to get results. Mr Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics and a renowned US trade hawk, says: 'The unfortunate reality is, the Japanese tell us, in every single case we have to threaten sanctions because that's the only way they move.' What makes the current row unlike previous tiffs, is that it is still unclear how much ground Japan's government can give and what might be the wider non-economic consequences of its failure to do so.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUPER 301: THE ORIGINAL TRADE SINS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Japan:  government procurement of foreign satellites and         superconductors; and imports of wood products. Deals concluded         on all three, and US exports of these products have increased. Brazil: import bans and other import-licensing restrictions. Pact agreed         and Brazil has since liberalised. India:  trade-related investment measures and insurance market barriers.         India refused to talk about changes. No sanctions were imposed,         but the issues were referred to the Uruguay Round talks. South   avoided a listing after agreeing to liberalise measures for  Korea: foreign investment, and lifting import bans and other         measures to protect local production. Taiwan: avoided a listing after agreeing to open its markets, largely         through reductions in tariffs on manufactured goods.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

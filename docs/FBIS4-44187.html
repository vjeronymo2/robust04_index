			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by "J.J.": "Dollar Turbulence"] </F>   [Text] Less than two weeks before the world economic  summit in Naples, it looks as if, unexpectedly, the  international monetary situation could move into the foreground  again. The year 1994 has not become the year of the dollar, as  many had expected. On the contrary -- the dollar rate is  dropping surprisingly steeply. It is true that central banks  have intervened, but this has apparently not solved the problem.  Nervousness and uncertainty continue to dominate the markets,  as our reports have shown. There are many explanations for the  weakness of the dollar -- speculative assumptions and quite  acceptable considerations on interest rate implications,  cyclical developments, investment behavior, the problem of  derivatives, and growing distrust of the U.S. Administration and  its policy. All this is not funny, as U.S. President Bill  Clinton says in a relaxed way, especially not for the Americans,  whose exchange rate stability depends on the capital influx.  Fundamental data and political intentions are one thing,  expectations and reactions on financial markets, another.  Whether the central banks will get this development under  control remains to be seen. For the time being, there is  intense speculation on a possible U.S. key interest rate  increase. Any attempt to make policy against the markets now  would be disastrous.</p>

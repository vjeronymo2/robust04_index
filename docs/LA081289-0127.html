			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOME DESIGN;  </P> <P> A SPECIAL ISSUE OF ORANGE COUNTY LIFE;  </P> <P> FRENCH DOORS USHER IN A TRADITIONAL LOOK TO HOMES  </P> <P> Homeowners who have grown weary of that old aluminum sliding glass door leading  to the patio or balcony are finding an easy way to turn their view of the world  from blah to beautiful.  </P> <P> They are replacing that old slider with French doors or a French slider, which  has all the beauty of traditional wooden, multiple-pane French doors.  </P> <P> Retrofitting patio doorways with these more traditional looks is a hot trend in  home remodeling.  </P> <P> When you consider what remodeling costs these days, changing a door is pretty  reasonable. Double French door sets are available from $500 up to $1,800,  depending on options, and sliders range from $800 to about $1,500.  </P> <P> These systems are designed to go into openings of existing five-, six- and  eight-foot patio doors. Installation averages from $270 to $500, and all doors  are installed unfinished, which means you must paint or stain them or hire  someone to do it for you.  </P> <P> "I've been selling French doors myself over 10 years," says Donna French, sales  manager for Fine Finish in Huntington Beach. "But of course, they've become  more and more popular." She says Fine Finish had to expand to meet the demand  and now has stores in Irvine and Anaheim.  </P> <P> French says Fine Finish added sliders about three years ago because "we saw a  need for it. There (were) a lot of people who wanted a sliding door. . . . It  looks as good as your traditional door."  </P> <P> The easiest and best way to improve your home "is to change your doors and  windows," says Keith Powell, chairman of Atlanta Door and Window in Laguna  Hills and Orange. "It's not that expensive. It adds tremendous value to your  house, and it makes you feel like you live in a whole different house."  </P> <P> Irene Lamb agrees.  </P> <P> When she moved from Boston to a 20-year-old tract house in Fountain Valley four  years ago, she longed to add a more classic look to her home. The sliding glass  door in her family room was practical, yet she preferred the romantic look of  French doors so popular on the Eastern Seaboard.  </P> <P> Eventually, Lamb solved her dilemma. She chose a French slider and replaced a  window in the same room with a French bay window with beveled glass.  </P> <P> She originally planned to stain the wood frames, but her "East Coast  traditionalism brought me back to that Cape Cod look." They were painted white  in the true classic style.  </P> <P> "I like looking in at it when we go outside," Lamb says of her transformed  family room, to which she also added new carpeting, paint and furniture.  </P> <P> "I like looking through those windows and through the door with the lights on.  It gives it a beautiful look. I would say it's a very relaxing look."  </P> <P> George Vizmeg of Mission Viejo chose French windows and doors because he  thought it would give his four-year-old Spanish-style house a different look.  </P> <P> "Believe me, it did," Vizmeg says. The style looks "beautiful in the type of  home we have."  </P> <P> He had his whole house retrofitted with French doors and windows, including a  front entry with a double French door topped with half-circle windows matched  by half-circle windows in the three-car garage. He also had a French door  installed to replace an aluminum slider leading from a breakfast nook area to  the back yard.  </P> <P> It's more common for people to replace one or two doors at a time as they  upgrade their houses, according to Roger Cerny of Roger Cerny Door Co. in  Anaheim.  </P> <P> "The largest percentage of people can afford maybe one thing at a time," says  Cerny. "They want to have something nice because they can't afford to go out  and buy that big house."  </P> <P> He says there's "something serene" about the French-door look that makes a  house special, even if you change only one door.  </P> <P> Powell says his customers tend to retrofit one section of a house at a time  over a couple of years.  </P> <P> "When we begin the conversation," he says, "they're certainly interested in the  patio doors. A lot of the times they're surprised at how inexpensive this is  compared to how they expected it to be. And, within their budget, they may  decide they want to replace all the patio doors upstairs and downstairs, or  maybe they want to get a bay window."  </P> <P> Changing sliders is also a good portion of the Pella Window Store's remodeling  market, and cost is a factor for many of those customers, according to Wendy  Williams. Williams is advertising and promotion coordinator for the firm, which  has stores in Fullerton, Santa Ana, Huntington Beach and Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> She says that her company offers both sliders and French doors but that the  French slider is probably more popular because of the lower price. The base  price of both Pella doors is around $1,300, but the slider includes hardware  and a screen, and the true French door does not. That means an additional $200  for hardware and $330 for optional screens, Williams says.  </P> <P> Pella's doors are different from most of the wood French doors on the market.  The exterior frames are covered with aluminum cladding in white, brown, tan or  gray, while wood shows on the interior side of the door. Pella does this for  "low maintenance to protect the wood against the elements," according to  Williams.  </P> <P> When considering French doors or sliders for your house, there are several  things to think about besides the cost.  </P> <P> Most French doors don't come with screens over the doors to keep out mosquitoes  and flies. If this is a problem, you might want a slider with a screen.  </P> <P> However, Pella does make a unit with two French doors that open in and matching  screens that swing out. Atlanta will soon offer a six-foot unit that has one  fixed door (really a large window) with another door hinged to it and a sliding  screen.  </P> <P> And there are other options to consider. For a six-foot opening, you might want  two French doors or a single French door with two side panels with screens. The  panels can be opened manually or with a crank. Eight-foot units have two French  doors and two side panels.  </P> <P> Space is another factor in selection. French doors can open in or out, but  there must be enough clearance whichever option you choose. So if space is a  problem, a slider may be preferable.  </P> <P> It's also helpful to understand the terms grids and true divided light. Pella's  standard doors are either one large window or have grids sandwiched between two  panes of glass to give the look of individual panes. The doors at Fine Finish,  Pella's custom doors and most of those at Atlanta are "true divided light,"  composed of individual panes of glass. Cerny offers both styles.  </P> <P> And if security is a concern, it's just a matter of a proper lock for French  doors, most installers say. They suggest a double-keyed lock because it  requires a key to open it. Even if a burglar broke out a pane or two in the  door, he would still be unable to open it.  </P></p>

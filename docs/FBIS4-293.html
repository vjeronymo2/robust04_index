			<p>BFN     [Text] Kigali, 7 Apr (AFP) -- There was total confusion in  Kigali tonight, according to correspondents interviewed by AFP  following reports indicating that the Rwandan presidential plane  crashed this evening. (In Paris, the Quai d'Orsay announced  that there were reportedly "no survivors.")    The Rwandan national radio did not broadcast any report more  than three hours after eyewitnesses reported heavy weapons  firing was heard around the airport shortly after 2100 local  time (1900 GMT), a military official of the UN Assistance  Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] has stated.    The prime minister, Mrs. Agathe Uwilingiyimana told AFP that  she has learned from UNAMIR Commander General Romeo Dallaire  that the plane bringing the president back from Dar es Salaam,  Tanzania, had crashed but she could not get any official  confirmation.    UNAMIR has sent a team to the area to get more information,  it was stated at the UNAMIR headquarters. All the Kigali  inhabitants remained at home for fear of violent incidents in  the capital, a Radio Kigali reporter said.</p>

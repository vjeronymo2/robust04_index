			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Geneva, 7 Jun (TANJUG) -- Late this evening  Srpska republic president Radovan Karadzic said after yet  another round of talks with special envoy Yasushi Akashi that  the Muslim side wanted war and not peace. "It is also obvious  that someone is supporting them from the outside," he pointed  out.    Before leaving the UN headquarters, Karadzic said that the  Serb delegation would remain in Geneva until tomorrow to see if  the Muslim-Croat delegation would soften its stand according to  which it would accept only a four-week cease-fire.

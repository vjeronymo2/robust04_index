			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Second Friday sermon by Ayatollah Mohammad Emami-Kashani, </F> spokesman of the Guardian Council, in Tehran on 25 March --  recorded]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] In this sermon, God willing, I  will be discussing last year's events, as well as what we  witnessed and observed across the globe, and finally what  experiences were gained by the Islamic world during the course  of the year 1372 [ending 20 March 1994]. I will also be  discussing the policies and decisions that must be made in  social and political realms in the current year, 1373.    Last year, we observed the architects of the new world  order.  We saw how they put forward a new order for the world.  However, we also saw that the so-called new order was in fact a  new tyranny. There are times that the tyrant indulges in  injustice and oppression, but the victims do not realize what is  being done to them. This is because the tyrants justify their  oppression. This new order proved to be a new mode of tyranny,  injustice, and crime. They imposed such tyranny, and committed  crimes at will in different parts of the world. However, they  invariably gave different names to their deeds.    We only need to look at a number of Muslim countries, such  as, for instance, Bosnia-Herzegovina. We saw what  justifications they constantly provided for merely observing the  continued genocide of Muslims by the Serbs. The sad thing,  however, is that nations are in a deep slumber. World radio and  television stations control the ebb and flow of the public  opinion. This is an ugly and very dangerous phenomena. For  instance, when they chose to condemn someone, they do it in a  way that people readily accept their words. [passage omitted]    When one looks at the situation in the world, and when one  sees nations in their deep slumber, one realizes that these  nations resemble children, trying to remain in their happy  slumbers. [last phrase in Arabic from an Islamic tradition] Like  children, until they reach their puberty, they can easily be  fooled. They can be given a dummy or a bottle and yet believe  that it is the mother's milk which they are being given.  [passage omitted]    One only needs to look at Palestine. What can one understand  from viewing as a whole the issue of Gaza and Jericho on the one  hand, and all the crimes committed by the Zionists in an  ever-increasing manner, on the other hand? What should the  world understand from all this? The world is able to  understand, but refuses to do so. This is because people listen  only to a particular brand of propaganda. They fail to  understand that Zionism is an entity which, as the revolutionary  nation of Palestine have found out, can only be confronted by  resorting to fire and bullet. The Palestinians have grasped  this issue very correctly. [Crowd chants in support of the  Islamic revolution and its leaders, and in condemnation of U.S.,  Israel and counterrevolutionary elements].    Of course such is the nature of falsehood. But falsehood  cannot always hide its nature. One day it will show its ugly  nature and what it has done to people. They said: Come and sit  at one table. They propagated this across the world. The  Islamic Republic stood up and announced this as a trick. The  revolutionary forces in Palestine too came together and said  they would not accept this. At the time maybe many people and  nations asked: Why don't you accept this and put an end to the  conflicts? But now they look and see how vicious a wolf Zionism  is. It is a vicious wolf. The crimes it has committed in the  world. There is no time now. But I have read in books that  even the distortions in the four Bibles, and I found the  evidence, were made by Zionists. It was they who distorted the  Bible. Whereever they penetrated and whatever political and  economic affair they involved themselves, their criminal hands  were greater than the rest. Such is the new world order and  repression.    When some one attacked another, the latter would say: Oh,  oppressor why are you attacking me? But now they attack and  plunder the wealth of Muslim nations and exploit Muslim nations,  but the latter do not say: Oh criminals why are you doing this  to us? This is except for a group, a handful, including the  Islamic Republic, and some others here and there. This is  unfortunate and the only solution is the awakening of nations.  And I have to tell the designer of such oppression led by  American arrogance -- although you might bot believe it but we  do -- that the Koran states that infidelity will be destroyed  and oppression will be destroyed.    As the honorable prophet [Muhammad] graciously said: A  government may survive if blasphemous, but not if tyrannical.  [last sentence in Arabic] The tyranny of the West will collapse  as did the tyranny of the East [the former Soviet Union]. We  hope that [Western tyranny] is uprooted by the Lord of the Age  [12th Shiite imam]. That does not mean that we should sit and  wait for him to come. The wait means that we should also make a  move. Exactly as we have, the way we have determined our path,  guided by our eminent imam [Khomeyni]. The same path which is  followed by the honorable leader of the revolution [Khamene'i],  supported by our officials, the system, and the nation. That is  the way it should be and that is the path.    Let not the unbelievers think that our respite to them is  good for themselves. We grant them respite that they may grow  in their iniquity. But they will have a shameful punishment.  [Koranic verse, in Arabic].    Masterminds of the new world order, we pray to the Lord of  the Age that your establishment is turned upside down, God  willing, God willing. We hope: Leave them alone, to enjoy the  good things of life and to please themselves. Let false hope  amuse them. Soon will knowledge undeceive them. [Koranic verse,  in Arabic].    Another issue I would like to talk about is this year's  hajj.  From this great base of Friday prayers I convey this wish of the  Iranian nation to the Saudi Government. As the dear leader of  the revolution said, the Saudi Government must not make trouble  for the people's pilgrimage. Creating problems would be harmful  to nations and beneficial to the enemies of Islam. You,  yourselves, know that arrogance really wishes harm for Islam.  But Islamic countries are all brothers and united. I hope  that, God willing, the Saudi Government gives a positive  response and, God willing, stops creating problems.    Another thing I would like to say is to pray for the souls  of  the passengers of the aircraft that crashed in Karabakh. We say  to the Russian Government: You must correct this fault in your  air traffic control system. That is a very regrettable  situation. [passage omitted]</p>

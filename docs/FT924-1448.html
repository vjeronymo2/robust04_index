			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Bundesbank resists cut in interest rates A CUT in German interest rates now would fuel inflation and lead to even sharper monetary restrictions in future, the Bundesbank warned yesterday. It said domestic economic conditions had worsened and admitted that relaxation of its policies might temporarily help counter the effects of the slowdown on production and employment. But any easing would come at the cost of accelerating inflation later. Experience showed monetary policy served economic development best when it provided stable monetary conditions, the bank said in its latest monthly report. Domestic criticism of the central bank's stance has increased as recession has hit production, employment and company profits. But while the report acknowledged the mounting difficulties, it said it was up to the government, unions and employers to find the new answers necessary for a return to 'lasting, inflation-free growth'. The bank accepted that the public sector's attempts to control spending were being hampered by the deteriorating economic climate, but noted that inflation was still 'stubbornly high'. Total public-sector deficits this year were expected to be higher than in 1991 and to account for almost 4 per cent of Gross National Product, or 6 per cent if the borrowings of the Treuhand privatisation agency and the post and railway authorities are included. The federal government's deficit was expected to increase in 1993 as tax revenues fell and social welfare and unemployment payments increased, the report noted. The bank reminded the Bonn government it still had to find cuts to compensate for next year's planned supplementary budget of DM12bn (Pounds 4.9bn) in development aid for the east. The Bonn government, which is aiming to produce its spending cuts proposals by the end of January, is also under pressure to deliver its mooted 'solidarity pact'. The Bundesbank showed concern about recent decisions by Lander (state) governments to increase their 1993 spending by up to 6 per cent and an average 4.5 per cent. While this marks a slowdown in the rate of growth, it is still far wide of Bonn's demand that regional budgets should increase by an annual maximum 3 per cent for the next few years. The bank said the forthcoming public-sector pay negotiations would be especially important this year.</p>

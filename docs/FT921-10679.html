			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / UK Company News: European expansion holds back growth at Fyffes FYFFES, the Dublin-based fresh fruit and vegetable wholesaling group, recorded a pre-tax profit of IPounds 27.1m (Pounds 25m) for the year to October 31 1991 compared with IPounds 26.3m. Earnings per share were unchanged at 6.73p and a final dividend of 0.8162p (0.742p) is proposed for a total of 1.1388p (1.0353p). The results were marginally lower than market expectations of about IPounds 30m, with earnings closer to 7p. The dilution of earnings by last year's IPounds 61m rights issue was offset by the lower tax charge of IPounds 6.03m (IPounds 6.78m). Tough trading conditions in the UK market, and the ongoing costs of Fyffes' expansion into the European market were blamed for a set of results which one Dublin-based analyst described as 'slightly disappointing'. Mr Carl McCann, finance director, said that the main factor affecting profitability in the past year 'has been the setting up of our international banana operation, sourcing bananas from Central America for the continental European market'. He said the company had lost volume in the first half of the year, due to a settlement agreement with Chiquita International to end the commercial war that broke out in 1990 when Fyffes began buying bananas in Honduras. Seasonally weaker prices in the second half of the year, when volumes picked up, then kept margins low for the year as a whole. 'Operationally though we have made huge progress. We have extended our source of supply in Central America, with a major new source in Guatemala and we have opened a new office in Florida to manage the tropical end of the business' said Mr McCann. 'While the timing of the return on our investment in this division is not easy to predict, we are building an important new business which we believe will make a positive contribution in the future', the company said. Turnover advanced by 9 per cent to IPounds 608m (IPounds 557m). COMMENT Fyffes can reasonably argue that a tough recessionary year in the UK, its main market, and the ongoing costs of its nascent expansion strategy into continental Europe with Central American-sourced bananas, has held back earnings to levels lower than market expectations. To establish itself firmly in the highly-competitive continental market, the group will need to move downstream by acquiring ripening and distribution assets there, which has been the key to its success in the UK and Ireland. However, it does not seem to be much closer to negotiating an acquisition than it was in June last year when the rights issue was made. Its IPounds 100m cash hoard makes the company a financially solid business, but the market may get impatient if the continental expansion does not bring the expected rewards in terms of higher earnings. The company, however, shows no signs of being rushed into a hasty decision.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 61m buy for Tops Estates Tops Estates, which in January paid Pounds 14m for two shopping centres in Lancashire, yesterday announced the acquisition of the Bond Street shopping centre in Leeds from Guardian Properties for Pounds 61m. It also reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 1.69m to Pounds 2.37m in the year to March 31. Rental income expanded to Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 10.6m), while property outgoings rose to Pounds 720,000 (Pounds 499,000). The centre was opened in 1977 and occupies a 2.5 acre site in the centre of the city. The consideration is to be financed initially through new bank facilities 'negotiated for the purpose', the company said. Most of the centre will be retained for investment giving a current rental income of about Pounds 3.5m but a part, valued at about Pounds 12m and providing income of Pounds 680,000, will be sold. The pre-tax figure included Pounds 494,000 of profits from the sale of a property acquired during the year for disposal. Interest took Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 7.49m). Earnings per share rose to 4.53p (4.4p) and the final dividend is lifted to a proposed 1.6p (1.5225p) for a total of 2.2064p (2.1p), a rise of 5 per cent. The group's investment portfolio was independently valued at Pounds 234m at the period end, compared with a valuation of Pounds 191m 12 months earlier.</p>

A case in point involves two young women who won a law suit  last year for illegal body search by a shopping center which  suspected them of shop-lifting.    According to Cao Xiaoqi, deputy secretary-general of the  China Consumers Association, with the support of governments at  all levels, a consumer protection network now covers the whole  country, embracing about 40,000 organizations.    Meanwhile, the country's first consumer law came into force  at the beginning of this year, which stipulates that a consumer  may claim for compensation doubling the amount of the goods  bought if the goods were found to be false or not up to  standards.    Now more and more consumers are learning to fight  encroachments on their rights, such as short weight, defective  or shoddy goods, and poor service, Cao said.    He said that since the association was established in 1984  such organizations have spread all over the urban and rural  areas.    In addition, some far-sighted companies have also set up  their own consumer-protection units so as to earn a good  reputation.    So far, China's industrial and commercial units have set up  25,000 stations to deal with consumers' feedback on their  products.    Meanwhile, consumers associations closely co-operate with  the  news media. As a result, a number of enterprises, which have  severely damaged consumers' interests while refusing to pay for  losses, have been exposed to the public.    In line with the nationwide campaign to stamp out shoddy and  false goods, the associations make spot checks on a wide range  of goods, covering electrical appliances and food, Cao said.    During the past nine years the country's consumers  associations have handled 1.6 million complaints from consumers,  over 95 percent of which have been settled with nearly 600  million (about 67 million U.S. dollars) in compensation for  consumers. Offenders have been fined a total of 40 million yuan  (about 4.5 million U.S. dollars).</p>

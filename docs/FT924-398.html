			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Leading Article: No room at Europe's inn THE NATIONS of western Europe should not be celebrating Christmas with too much gusto this year. It is after all a Christian festival in which the scenes of compassion and solidarity are traditionally emphasised. The story being retold this week by Christians around the world depicts God in a state of self-imposed human helplessness and homelessness - even as an infant refugee fleeing the organised violence of a ruthless state and finding hospitality in a foreign land. It is a story all too topical in today's world, and this year it has become especially so for Europe. Three years ago refugees were almost exclusively a third world problem - people of the third world, most of whom stayed in the third world. Few of them sought asylum in Europe. Even then, they did not get a very Christian reception. More often than not they were accused of being 'economic migrants' in disguise. Now, however, the problem has become an internal one for Europe. War in the former Yugoslavia has driven up to 3m people from their homes. Several hundred thousand have already reached western Europe, by far the largest number being in Germany - the EC country with the most liberal asylum policy but also the most overtly ethnic citizenship laws, and perhaps a relatively low threshold of social tolerance towards foreign residents. To be fair, Germans are sympathetic to the Croat and Moslem victims of 'ethnic cleansing', and there is no evidence that the xenophobia even of extremists in Germany is directed specifically at these particular refugees. But the sheer size of the latest wave of refugees adds to the pressures which extremists are exploiting, and which have produced such an agonised debate on the asylum issue. Necessary distinction All European governments seek to distinguish between economic and political migrants - or, more strictly, between voluntary migrants and refugees who are forced to leave their countries. This is a real and necessary distinction. The right of asylum belongs to genuine refugees and should not be undermined by being used as a cover for voluntary migration. But governments are deluding themselves if they imagine that any procedure for establishing this distinction, however miraculously fair and swift, will by itself reduce the refugee problem to manageable proportions. That could only be done by tackling the source of the problem, namely the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and those elsewhere in eastern Europe which have the capacity to produce many more millions of refugees before the decade is out. Having so badly mishandled the Yugoslav conflict up to this point, governments must now face up to the probability that only military action in Bosnia can put a stop to the ethnic cleansing there. That might at least lend some credibility to the preventive diplomacy which may yet succeed elsewhere, if it is undertaken with sufficient speed and vigour and backed with significant resources - carrots, as well as sticks. More generosity Such action is needed to prevent the problem becoming completely unmanageable. It will not make it vanish. European governments must also face the fact that they already have on their hands by far the worst refugee problem in Europe since the mid-1940s, and that for the next few years it is virtually certain to get worse rather than better. They cannot hope to manage it successfully if they stick to their present attitude, under which every country seeks to minimise its exposure and push the refugees back to their last port of call. Most Europeans are rightly disgusted at the way 415 Palestinians have for a week now been turned into a human ping pong ball between Israel and Lebanon. But they themselves are doing something similar to much larger numbers of people, against most of whom there is not even an accusation of involvement in political violence such as Israel has made against the Palestinians. Under the Dublin Convention, asylum applicants are regularly sent back to the first EC country they arrived in; and under the resolution on 'host third countries', adopted by EC immigration ministers last month, they are to be sent back whenever possible to the country from which they arrived in the EC, so long as it is not the one from which they were originally fleeing. In the case of refugees from Bosnia or Serbia, this 'host third country' will most often be Albania, Croatia, Hungary, Macedonia or Slovenia, all of which are far less equipped to cope with the influx than any EC state, and are already desperately overloaded. Most likely this will contribute to a breakdown of order in one or more of those states, and so to even larger flows of refugees westwards. Thus a more generous west European attitude and an agreement to share the burden more equitably within the EC is not merely a matter of Christian ethics. It is a requirement of enlightened self interest, essential if the westward spread of chaos and violence is to be avoided.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / North-south council divide widens: The growing trauma over criteria for sharing Treasury grants FEBRUARY heralds the annual local government budget trauma. As in past years, there are daily reports - yesterday from Birmingham - of imminent and massive cuts in services and staff, blamed on government spending caps and inadequate Treasury largesse. With capping far tighter this year than last, the reports could turn into reality when budgets are finalised next month. But this year's budget round is novel for the degree of ill-feeling between councils over the criteria used for sharing out Treasury grants. Government grants, and capping levels for total spending by each authority, are based on 'standard spending assessments' (SSAs), calculated each year, which is the Environment Department's view of the spending needed 'to provide a standard level of service consistent with (its) view of the appropriate amount of expenditure for all authorities.' It takes account of 'social, demographic and geographical characteristics'. It is the way it does so that is causing the fuss. A particular source of grievance this year is the so-called 'area cost adjustment' (ACA), which is supposed to compensate councils in the south-east for higher than average wage costs. But authorities further north say it is an unfair device for siphoning funds to areas that are already cash rich. In 1988, the ACA was only Pounds 418m; this year it is Pounds 1.3bn - about 3 per cent of total standard spending (the aggregate of all SSAs) for England. Mr Bruce Stevenson, chief executive of Labour-controlled Cleveland, says the ACA 'has in effect become a redistributive mechanism moving sums of money from the rest of the world into the south-east.' He described it as 'a response to a political difficulty' - keeping council tax bills down in politically-sensitive London. He claimed that if ACA distributed resources fairly his council would be Pounds 5m better off - equal to a reduction of Pounds 31 in average council tax bills. Shropshire County Council has been leading a national lobby against the ACA. Though the county, in which no party has overall control, has a Labour administration, the lobby includes Tory-controlled Hereford and Worcester. Mr Tony Preece, the county's senior assistant county treasurer, said the objections to ACA were not political. 'We acknowledge the formula must reflect the higher costs in London and the south-east, but our reservation is that the way the formula is applied at the moment more than compensates authorities in that area.' Derbyshire County Council, which is also lobbying, points to the rise in its standard spending assessment compared with that of Hertfordshire, a beneficiary of ACA. The county treasurer says Derbyshire's SSA rose by 28.9 per cent between 1989 and 1992, whereas Hertfordshire's increased by 43.8 per cent. Derbyshire and other ACA critics want to see it eliminated for services like education, police, and the fire service, where pay rates are determined by national bargaining; and, for other services, to remove private-sector wage rates as a basis of calculation. None of that cuts much ice in Hertfordshire, a staunch defender of the status quo. Mr Bill Ogley, county treasurer says his county 'has among the highest housing costs in the country, the heaviest traffic and the highest car ownership.' The Environment Department also insists that the ACA is intended to reflect real cost differences. Counties are also united in opposition to metropolitan areas, particularly London, over rules for calculating standard spending assessments for social services and 'additional educational needs' - which determine about a fifth of the education element of government grants to councils. The grant for additional education depends upon the proportion of an authority's children living with lone parents, the proportion in families dependent on income support, and the proportion born outside the UK, US or Old Commonwealth, or with heads of household born there. Derbyshire cites research showing there to be 'little if any' relationship between those factors and the performance of pupils in national tests and examinations, and thus the real demand for resources in schools. It claims that the criteria simply channels resources to London and away from county councils. When introduced in 1990, SSAs were intended to be a simpler and fairer basis for distributing government grants to councils than the previous system comprising 63 components. Alas, in local government simplicity and fairness are uneasy bedfellows.</p>

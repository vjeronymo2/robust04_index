			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> MAN CITED IN THEFTS SHOWS UP IN COURT  </P> <P> A former used-car wholesaler facing extradition from Arizona on charges of  selling Ventura County dealers vehicles with rolled-back odometers stunned the  county district attorney's office Thursday when he unexpectedly appeared in  Superior Court with his attorney, authorities said.  </P> <P> Gregory W. Larsen, 34, was being held in a Mojave County, Ariz., jail following  his arrest last week on a fugitive warrant. Extradition proceedings were not  scheduled until Jan. 11, but Larsen posted bail and came to California of his  own accord, said Charles R. Roberts, senior attorney in the district attorney's  major fraud unit.  </P> <P> "He strolled in with his lawyer and placed himself under the jurisdiction of  the California Superior Court," Roberts said.  </P> <P> The Ventura County grand jury on Oct. 26 indicted Larsen on 27 counts of grand  theft stemming from deals his now-defunct La Brea Auto Sales in Los Angeles  made with five Ventura County used-car dealers in late 1989 and earlier this  year.  </P> <P> A state Department of Motor Vehicles investigation showed that Larsen was  buying high-mileage, late-model cars and vans from other wholesalers, rolling  back their odometer readings by about half and selling them to used-car  retailers, Roberts said. The practice of reducing the officially logged miles  from, for example, 80,000 to 40,000, increased Larsen's prices by an average of  $2,000 per vehicle, Roberts said.  </P> <P> "The dealers were livid," said Roberts, adding that most of the vehicles were  previously leased 1987 and 1988 American cars and vans. "They had to either buy  back the cars they had sold or give big discounts," he said, because the cars'  true mileage was unknown.  </P> <P> Larsen's lawyer told Judge Frederick A. Jones on Thursday that his client has  been living in Bullhead City, where he owns a concrete company, Roberts said.  Larsen was allowed to remain free on the bond he posted in Arizona after being  ordered to appear in court Jan. 25. CHRISTOPHER PUMMER  </P></p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Refinery hit by fire to reopen next month The Milford Haven refinery that was damaged by fire last month will resume partial operation next month and full production in October. Texaco, the owner, said yesterday that most of the damage was confined to the units involved in an explosion, with other parts little affected by the fire that followed. Initial investigation has established that the fire was caused by the failure of a pipe in the flare gas system which caused a release of vapour and the subsequent explosion. The Health and Safety Executive and the company are still clearing damaged areas for a full inspection. The environmental group Friends of the Earth said 11 of the UK's most hazardous industrial sites had failed to satisfy the Health and Safety Executive over their plans for dealing with large industrial accidents.</p>

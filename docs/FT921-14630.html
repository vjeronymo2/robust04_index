			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: Lenders to Italian group set out strategy FOREIGN bank lenders to Federconsorzi, the Italian farm services group whose collapse triggered a major financial squall in the capital markets last year, have defined their strategy before a crucial court meeting later this month. Federconsorzi's creditors are due to meet in Rome on January 29 to ascertain whether there is sufficient support to approve the Concordato Preventivo - a judicial composition among creditors  - initiated in principle last July. Foreign banks are owed around L300bn (Dollars 251m) by Federconsorzi, to which the Italian government appointed special commissioners last May. Although not state-owned, the company was widely perceived abroad as being guaranteed by the state. The refusal by the Italian authorities and public-sector banks to compensate foreign lenders led to severe friction and a partial boycott of Italian borrowers on the Euromarkets. Some steps to liquidate Federconsorzi's assets are already under way. A conditional offer worth L55bn was accepted for Fedital, the group's milk and dairy products subsidiary, in late December. Under the strategy now agreed by Federconsorzi's foreign bank lenders, those banks which lent to the company under English law will give their proxies at the January 29 meeting to Banca Nazionale del Lavoro and Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino. However, the foreign banks concerned have not yet revealed how they intend to vote, triggering speculation that the meeting could still prove stormy. The meeting will establish whether holders of at least two-thirds of Federconsorzi's borrowings approve of the judicial composition procedure. Under the composition rules, Federconsorzi's government-appointed management gained temporary protection from creditors last July. The meeting this month will determine whether a sufficient number of creditors are prepared to ratify that strategy.</p>

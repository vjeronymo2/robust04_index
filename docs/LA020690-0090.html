			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIGHT TO SUE PAROLE OFFICER IS SOUGHT;  </P> <P> JUSTICE: STATE SUPREME COURT HEARS ARGUMENTS IN A PIVOTAL CASE. AT ISSUE IS A  VICTIM'S RIGHT TO SEEK REDRESS AGAINST THOSE WHO FAIL TO WARN OF DANGER.  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court was asked Monday to allow a parole officer to be sued  for allegedly assuring a woman she was in no danger just before she was killed  by a paroled murderer who had threatened her life.  </P> <P> The lawyer for survivors of a San Jose woman told the justices that the parole  agent's "grossly negligent" assurances had lulled the victim into a false sense  of security.  </P> <P> The parolee, released after serving 12 years for the slaying of his wife, had  told the agent he intended to kill the woman, with whom he had been  romantically involved, argued attorney Cliff Weingus of San Francisco.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Weingus said, the parole agent subsequently told the woman: "I  don't think you have anything to worry about. He's not going to come looking  for you."  </P> <P> "It was foreseeable the woman would rely on (the parole officer's) assurances,"  Weingus said. "His remarks carried the imprimatur of the authority of the  state."  </P> <P> But Deputy Atty. Gen. Wayman M. Robertson argued that the parole agent could  not be held legally responsible for the woman's death. The officer had no legal  duty to warn the woman and could not have reasonably envisioned her murder, he  said.  </P> <P> Besides, Robertson noted, the victim previously had been threatened and  assaulted by the parolee. "She already was aware of the risk," he said.  </P> <P> The arguments were heard in a pivotal case that could make it easier for  victims of violent threats to sue persons who fail to warn them of the  potential for danger. A decision is due within 90 days.  </P> <P> In past rulings, the justices have permitted such suits only in limited  circumstances -- for example, when a psychiatrist failed to alert the target of  threats by a patient. Generally, law enforcement officials have been protected  from being sued over crimes committed by parolees.  </P> <P> In a brief filed with the court, the 18,000-member California Correctional  Peace Officers Assn. warned that a ruling allowing a suit against the agent  would interfere with the broad discretion that authorities need to perform  their duties.  </P> <P> Parole officers, the association said, would never know when a good-faith  action involving a parolee might later subject them to personal liability if it  resulted in death or injury. Because virtually any parolee may commit violence,  officials would be encouraged to revoke paroles as the only means of guarding  against liability, the group said.  </P> <P> In the case before the court, Grace Morales was kidnaped and shot to death in  April, 1986, by Napoleon Johnson, a parolee with whom she had been romantically  involved before ending their relationship.  </P> <P> Morales' surviving children charged in a subsequent wrongful-death suit that  Johnson told his parole officer, Michael Ybarra, that he was angry over being  abandoned by Morales and would kill her if he found her. Ybarra had Johnson  temporarily committed to a mental health facility.  </P> <P> But later, after Johnson's release from the facility, Ybarra telephoned Morales  in an attempt to reconcile her with Johnson, telling her that Johnson was still  in love with her and asking her whether she really wanted to break up with  Johnson, the suit said. As a result of the agent's assurances, Morales failed  to take steps to protect herself, the survivors charged.  </P> <P> A Santa Clara Superior Court judge dismissed the claim, and in July, 1988, a  state Court of Appeal in San Jose agreed that Ybarra could not be held liable,  finding that there was no "demonstrably close connection" between Ybarra's  ill-advised assurances and Morales' death.  </P></p>

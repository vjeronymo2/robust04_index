			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling stages late rally A BUOYANT start to the dollar in London was reversed when the Federal Reserve unexpectedly added funds to the money market in the US. Earlier reports that Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, was to face a vote of no confidence pushed the dollar up, but the US currency slid sharply after the Fed's actions, which signalled a cut in its target funds rate to 3- 3/4 per cent from a previous 4 per cent. The dollar fell from a level of DM1.6230/40 ruling before the Fed's operation to close in London at DM1.6180. Later in New York it finished at DM1.6164/70 and Y132.02/12. The US unit remained easier against the yen but by no more than before the Fed added funds to the money market. Traders said there was still little interest rate differential between the dollar and yen and the market was more inclined to forgive a rate cut if it helped bolster the US recovery. Fears of repatriation of funds by Japanese investors continued to dominate yen trading. Further sharp declines in Tokyo stocks today could well see the dollar test Y132 and lower, traders said. In late Asian trading the dollar slipped against the yen but remained firm against the D-Mark, with sales of D-Marks for yen dominating. The dollar closed in Tokyo at Y132.70 and DM1.6360. Later in European trading the D-Mark was also hurt by investors switching into yen. The German unit ended at Pta63.38/41, down from Pta63.53/56 on Wednesday, but was fairly steady against the French franc at FFr3.3876/79, after FFr3.3872/74 the night before. Many of London's trading rooms packed up early to leave traders fresh for late night and early morning business. 'We have got it all mapped out,' said one trader. 'It will be a couple of pints and a curry first, then at the desk for the exit polls and all eyes on the marginals. It is going to be seat of the pants, minute by minute trading.' During the day the pound staged a rally. News that the Conservative party had made ground against Labour in Wednesday night's opinion polls encouraged speculation of a Tory win. Sterling rose against the D-Mark by about a pfennig to stand above DM2.85 throughout the day after opening at DM2.8419. It closed at DM2.8575. The UK currency picked up to Pta180.92 from its EMS floor of Pta180.59, where it has been in recent days. A full set of parities for the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System after the admission of the Portuguese escudo is published in today's FT. The table includes the rates at which central banks are committed to buy and sell every other currency in the system, together with the bilateral central rates.

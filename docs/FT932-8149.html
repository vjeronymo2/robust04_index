			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Jostling around Major's cabinet table - Political Notebook LIFE AFTER Maastricht. Denmark's endorsement of the treaty has provided the occasion for predictably jubilant talk among ministers about lines now drawn under a dismal past, the promise of new beginnings. They half believe it. They will be more convinced when they can see also life after the reshuffle. With the bulk of the Labour party abstaining, the government is promised a comfortable majority when the Maastricht bill's third reading wraps up its tortuous progress through the Commons today. In spite of the promised thunder in the House of Lords from Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit, the finishing post is now in clear view. The court cases threatened by the Euro-sceptics may prove more of a nuisance than the government will admit. So too might action in the European Court to challenge the validity of Britain's opt-out from the social chapter. But barring unexpected accidents - an essential caveat when writing about the present government - by the end of July Britain should have caught up once again with its European partners and ratified the treaty. In spite of the venom of his attack on Mr Major, even Lord Tebbit sounded yesterday as if he knew in his heart that the game was up. The split in the Tory party over Europe will not go away. The arch-Eurosceptics - Mr Major's very own Militant tendency - have detached themselves from the Conservative mainstream. Sterling's exile from the European exchange rate mechanism means that the destructive choice between the slow and fast lanes of European integration has been deferred, not removed. The DM/Franc link has survived everything the speculators have thrown at it. It provides the basis for a monetary union among the Community's core countries. Mr Major underlined yesterday that there was no prospect in the medium term of the pound's return to the system. Those in Whitehall who remember the sterling crises which punctuated life before the ERM understand the risks of remaining outside. The prime minister has more immediate problems. His own authority has been much diminished. His cabinet is deeply unsettled. His supporters on the backbenches are ready to be tipped into panic again by the threat - albeit at this stage slim - of defeat in the Christchurch by-election. He is also being pressed to move quickly to remake his government. The official line - that Mr Major is determined not be pushed into a reshuffle by the media - is either understandably disengenuous or deeply misguided. It is true that some Fleet Street editors would be happy to claim the scalp of Mr Norman Lamont. The chancellor's sometimes aloof manner and his habit of writing nasty letters of complaint have left him few friends in the press. But this time the pressure from the media understates the manouevering in the cabinet. If Mr Major decides against changes he will be ignoring the advice of a majority of his colleagues. It must be assumed that Mr Norman Fowler, the party chairman, and Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, have told him so. It is not a question of malice. Mr Lamont has been a shrewder, braver chancellor than his public image allows. But in the words of a colleague, he has been at the scene of too many accidents. Mr Lamont does not want to go. He sees no reason why he should be the scapegoat for the recession or for Maastricht. There are dark - unsubstantiated - rumours that Mr Major's role in the ERM debacle would not bear the scrutiny of Mr Lamont's memoirs. The uncertainty is damaging the cabinet. Ministers are jostling for position in case Mr Major opts for wholesale changes. Resentments are building up. Mr Kenneth Clarke has emerged alongside Mr Douglas Hurd as an independent force in the government. But the home secretary's habit of re-interpreting economic policy during early morning chatshows has enraged Mr Lamont. Mr Hurd is accused - unfairly - in the bars of Westminster of plotting against the chancellor while his protege Mr Clarke bids for his job on television. Other relationships risk being soured by constant speculation about who is on the way up and who might be on the way out. Mrs Virginia Bottomley's trouble-free year at the health department has caused resentment among less fortunate colleagues. The right is asserting Mr Michael Howard's candidacy for No 11. Others, such as Mr John Patten or Mr Tony Newton, have been unsettled by the inclusion of their names alongside that of Mr Lamont on reshuffle 'hit-lists'. Discord ripples through the middle and junior ranks of the party. It cannot make for good government. One way or the other, Mr Major will have to end the uncertainty soon.</p>

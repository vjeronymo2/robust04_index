			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: UK equities steady in sluggish trade A LONDON stock market lacking a lead from either Wall Street or the UK bond market held steady yesterday as the new equity trading account opened. There was little sign of selling pressure but investors were cautious ahead of this week's heavy list of trading statements from British companies, which will include Glaxo, British Gas, Fisons and RTZ. The FT-SE 100 Index moved within a narrow margin, gaining 2.4 and then falling by 7.6 from Friday's close before ending 1.7 up on the day at 3,059. 'It was really a nothing day,' admitted the head trader at a leading securities firm. Wall Street's closure for Labor Day left London traders to wait for further clues as to the precise direction of US fund investment towards European stock markets. Some US securities analysts have advised clients to look to Germany and France for short term equity growth. UK investors hope that the Bundesbank will cut rates soon, perhaps on Thursday. A slight fall in domestic consumer borrowing in July did nothing to damage confidence in the progress of economic recovery, which was encouraged by an optimistic report from the Institute of Directors (IOD). The Institute's bi-monthly survey said that 65 per cent of members were 'more optimistic' about the UK economy, and the IOD said this provided 'clear evidence' that recovery is on track. Sluggish trading was borne out by a sharp fall in equity turnover as reported through the Seaq electronic network; Seaq volume fell from Thursday's 727.4m shares to only 421.1m yesterday, with non-Footsie business making up about 66 per cent of the day's total. Retail, or customer, business, which is a sounder guide to underlying investment trends than the daily Seaq reported figure which does not distinguish between intra-market and customer investment deals, remained strong on Friday, recording a total worth of Pounds 1.49bn. This followed daily totals of Pounds 1.73bn, Pounds 1.45bn and Pounds 1.06bn earlier in the week. There was an end-of-summer mood in the stock market which is aware that the coming months could provide it with new tests of confidence. The impending flow of corporate results will be scanned, not just for profits performances, but for evidence of the recovery in the economy. October has already been dubbed 'the worry month' in the market which also realises that November will bring further nervousness ahead of the autumn budget from Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer. However, while many analysts appeared prepared to admit that some form of market correction is likely this month, there were few sellers in the market yesterday. Sector analysts were very busy, urging clients to shuffle portfolios away from the capital goods stocks which have led the market ahead and into the consumer-orientated issues which are expected to respond with increasing strength if evidence of economic recovery accumulates. The pharmaceutical and oil stock sectors which have attracted good US interest recently, lay calm yesterday as investors waited for Wall Street to return to business. But the domestic consumer issues were firmer, albeit in modest trading.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [ By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmilal Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 25 Feb -- My dream is that, pushing on from  such an important moment in the Bosnian crisis as the initiative  of the Russian president, a democratic consensus will start  taking shape in the sphere of foreign policy, which would sever  all extremist attempts, Vitaliy Churkin, the deputy foreign  minister and the special representative of the Russian president  in the conflict zone, said. Commenting at the request of an  ITAR-TASS correspondent on today's decision of the Federation  Council to allocate an additional military contingent for the UN  forces, the diplomat stressed that we do not need confrontation  and war, but we need a strong foreign policy based on a  democratic consensus. Today's parliament decision, adopted at  Yeltsin's request, will make it possible, he says, to hope that  that is exactly how it will be.    Churkin reported that for the time being the issue of  expanding the presence of Russian troops in other places is not  on the agenda. In general, he thinks that the crisis over  Sarajevo -- the behavior of the Russian side and of our Western  partners, who are NATO members -- needs to be analyzed  seriously. During the crisis our attempts to solve issues  amicably with them did not always produce a response, the deputy  minister noted. That is why now, he believes, we need to  formulate our position more precisely and to defend it in an  equally precise way.</p>

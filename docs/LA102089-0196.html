			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> CAL GAME IS ON -- AT BERKELEY  </P> <P> Just four days after the Bay Area was hit by a catastrophic earthquake, the  Washington Huskies and the California Golden Bears will meet Saturday at  Berkeley's Memorial Stadium on the Cal campus.  </P> <P> The stadium at Strawberry Canyon was not damaged by Tuesday's 6.9 quake, and UC  Chancellor Ira Heyman announced Thursday that the Washington-Cal game was  officially on.  </P> <P> The Cal stadium was designed 15 years after San Francisco's 1906 quake and was  built with earthquakes in mind. It was constructed in sections with expansion  joints to withstand earth movements.  </P> <P> After the quake, the location of the game had been in doubt. Mike Lude,  Washington's athletic director, called Cal Athletic Director Dave Maggard and  offered to move the game to Husky Stadium in Seattle.  </P></p>

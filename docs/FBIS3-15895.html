Speaking at the council's meeting, the president stressed  that this program did not contradict the Declaration on  Independence and Sovereignty of Moldova and the results of the  sociological poll on the sovereignty of Moldova. "These  documents provide for cooperation between all countries of the  world in many ways," he emphasized.    Snegur also pointed out that the intention of Moldova to  neutrality must not isolate it before possible political or  other cataclysms. According to him, the signing of the NATO  program did not mean that Moldova would immediately reorientate  itself to the West. "Our economic and political priorities will  remain the same -- enlargement of mutually beneficial relations  with all countries of the world, including the CIS republics,"  the president reassured.</p>

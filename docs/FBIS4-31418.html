			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Slovak Defense Minister Pavol Kanis gave a news  conference this morning at the Turecky Vrch military training  area. Milan Velecky reports:    [Velecky] [passage omitted] Neither journalists nor  high-ranking officers present at the news conference liked what  Defense Minister Pavol Kanis had to tell them. According to  him, the Slovak Republic does not have the financial means to  maintain even the kind of army allowed by international  agreements. But the defense minister was not a pessimist. He  said that defense decisions are made in line with our foreign  policy. Contemporary European armies are open and therefore  under international control, and our Army, not being an  exception, does not enjoy finances received through special  channels. Pavol Kanis hinted at a new possible means of  income--participation in the arms trade. For example, the Army  would claim a share in the privatization of the Slovak arms  industry, and the defense minister hopes to see arms production  restored to at least 25 percent of the 1988 level.    Improving the Army's internal economic management indirectly  constitutes another source of income. Soldiers, too, must be  financially accountable.    Defense Minister Pavol Kanis admitted that the time allotted  to him is not enough to carry through fundamental organizational  changes. His two priorities are a clear orientation on  transatlantic structures and preparation of the basic legal  documents of the defense doctrine.    Kanis is convinced that the Partnership for Peace project of  cooperation with NATO will ensure Slovakia's defense guarantees.    Social issues remain unresolved due to the limited finances.  The defense minister said that the length of conscript service  could be shortened, but this would require extra expenses  because men would have to be replaced with more effective weapon  systems.

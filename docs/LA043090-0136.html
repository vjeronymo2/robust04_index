			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> COURT REFUSES $1-MILLION AWARD  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court today refused to reinstate an award of nearly $1 million  won, then lost, by former professional basketball player Ron Behagen against an  amateur basketball group. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that  threw out Behagen's award.  </P> <P> Behagen, who sells insurance in the Atlanta area, has been battling in federal  court since 1982 with the Amateur Basketball Assn. of the United States and its  executive director, William Wall. The organization is now known as USA  Basketball.  </P> <P> Behagen said the association violated federal antitrust law and his  constitutional rights by playing a pivotal role in ending his career with a  Sienna, Italy, team after he left the National Basketball Assn.  </P> <P> A federal jury in Denver agreed and awarded him $684,000. A federal judge  tacked on $180,476 in attorney's fees and court costs, plus interest.  </P> <P> But the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the award, prompting  Behagen's appeal to the high court.  </P></p>

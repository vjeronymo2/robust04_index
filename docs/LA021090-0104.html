			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Angeles Corp.: The Los Angeles-based investment management firm reported a  second-quarter net loss of $835,000, contrasted with a $777,000 profit a year  ago. Revenue declined 7% to $9.4 million. The firm said that, as predicted, the  loss was due primarily to heavy costs during the early stages of development  and rent-up in Angeles' relatively new businesses of congregate-style housing  for the independent elderly and factory-direct shopping malls.  </P> <P> Tables, D8  </P></p>

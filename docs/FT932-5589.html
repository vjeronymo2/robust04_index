			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / EC may ban precious-metal symbols A 900-YEAR tradition of using crowns, anchors, lions, roses and castles to guarantee the quality of British gold and silver is likely to be banned by the European Commission, say UK precious-metal workers. The symbols are among the hallmarks that must be used under British law to protect consumers from 'under-carat' gold or adulterated silver. They are applied by assay offices in Birmingham, Edinburgh, London and Sheffield after independent tests. Other EC countries say the symbols restrain trade in the single market by forcing tougher British quality guarantees on foreign competitors. But the Association of British Cutlers and Allied Trades says their removal would open the UK market to cheats. Gold items can be sold in Britain at weights of nine, 14, 18 or 22 carats. Silver has only one standard denoted by the mark 925, which means the item is 92.5 per cent silver, alloyed with 7.5 per cent copper. European competitors often use 80 per cent silver. The association says draft EC proposals to harmonise European marking methods will allow substandard gold and silver items to be sold. Mr John Price, association president, said yesterday: 'If we are going to harmonise, everyone should adopt the British system.' Mr Price, chairman of Arthur Price of England which makes traditional silver, silver-plated and steel cutlery, said draft proposals would allow marking by manufacturers but the onus would be on consumers to check they had not been cheated. EC officials had said unique British hallmarks, such as the lion for sterling silver, the castle for Edinburgh's assay office, Sheffield's rose, Birmingham's anchor and London's crown would be banned. Mr Price added: 'There will be some traders in Britain who will welcome this. The profits are enormous if you can pass off 15-carat gold as 18-carat.'</p>

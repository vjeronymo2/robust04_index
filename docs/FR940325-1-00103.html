			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Beginning in the year 1998 and thereafter the fee shall be computed using the grazing fee formula specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) In the absence of the issuance of criteria pertaining to qualification for the incentive-based fee reduction provided in &sect;4130.7&hyph;2(b), and beginning with the start of grazing year 1997, a base value of $3.50 shall be substituted in the formula provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the grazing fee shall be calculated as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> Grazing Fee per AUM for 1997=$3.50&times;FVI <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Beginning in the year 1998, and until the first grazing year after the issuance of final regulations prescribing criteria for qualifying for an incentive based fee become effective, the grazing fee shall be computed using the formula specified in this paragraph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Any annual increase or decrease in the grazing fee occurring after the 3-year phase-in shall be limited to not more than 25 percent of the fee in the previous year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, the full fee shall be charged for each animal unit month of authorized grazing use. For the purposes of calculating the fee, an animal unit month is defined as a month's use and occupancy of range by one cow, bull, steer, heifer, horse, burro, mule, 5 sheep, or 5 goats, over the age of 6 months at the time of entering the public lands or other lands administered by BLM; for all such weaned animals regardless of age; and for such animals that will become 12 months of age during the authorized period of use. No charge shall be made for animals under 6 months of age, at the time of entering public lands or other lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management, that are the natural progeny of animals upon which fees are paid, provided they will not become 12 months of age during the authorized period of use, nor for progeny born during that period. In calculating the billing the grazing fee is prorated on a daily basis and charges are rounded to reflect the nearest whole number of AUMs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) A surcharge shall be added to the grazing fee billings for authorized leasing of base property to which public land grazing preference is attached, or for authorized grazing of livestock owned by persons other than the permittee or lessee except where such use is made by livestock owned by sons and daughters of permittees and lessees as provided in &sect;4130.5(f). The surcharge shall be over and above any other fees that may be charged for using public land forage. Surcharges shall be paid prior to grazing use being made as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) 20 percent of the grazing bill for the permitted grazing use that is attached to a leased base property by an approved transfer, or that was leased and attached to another party's base property through an approved transfer;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) 50 percent of the grazing bill for pasturing livestock owned by persons other than the permittee or lessee under a grazing authorization; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) 70 percent of the grazing bill when base property is leased and a transfer has been approved and livestock owned by persons other than the permittee or lessee are pastured under a grazing authorization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) The authorized officer may bill in advance for multiple-year grazing use based on the grazing fee in the initial year of such authorization, the results of annual fluctuations in the fee to be reconciled through a supplemental billing at the end of the billing period, when:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The permittee or lessee has agreed to multiple-year billing;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

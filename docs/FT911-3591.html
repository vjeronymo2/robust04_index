			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Bankers Trust suffers from weak dollar BANKERS Trust, the highly- regarded US banking group, suffered a 19 per cent fall in first-quarter earnings. A strong advance in trading income was more than offset by higher non-interest expenses, lower foreign exchange revenues and write-offs on investments in highly-leveraged companies. Net earnings slipped to Dollars 160m, or Dollars 1.85 a share, from Dollars 198m, or Dollars 2.36, a year earlier. Interest income fell only slightly to Dollars 213m. The company blamed an 8.4 per cent rise in non-interest expenses partly on the weaker dollar, which accounted for about a quarter of the increase. Staff severance costs jumped by Dollars 40m. Trading revenues almost doubled to Dollars 304m, thanks largely to a strong performance by the capital markets business, which includes interest rate, currency and equity derivative products. But corporate finance fees tumbled by 23 per cent. Loans on the bank's books continue to fall sharply, reflecting the policy of the past four years of distributing a higher proportion of loans to other financial institutions, such as regional and foreign banks, insurance companies and pension funds. Its total loan portfolio stood at Dollars 19.6bn on March 31, down from Dollars 29.2bn in 1986.</p>

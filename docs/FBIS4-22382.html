This Agreement applies only once to each resettler.    The Signatories consider any coercion of persons to resettle  intolerable.  <H5>  Article 2 </H5>   The terms used in this Agreement have the following  meanings:    a) a "resettler" is a person who voluntarily leaves the  state  of his permanent residence and moves to a permanent place of  residence on the territory of a different state;    b) "members of the resettler's family" are the wife (or  husband), parents, and underage children as well as other  relatives or disabled dependents who live with the resettler and  keep a common household with him;    c) the "state of exit" is the former state of permanent  residence;    d) the "state of entry" is the new state of permanent  residence.  <H5>  Article 3 </H5>   This Agreement does not apply to the following:    a) refugees;    b) migrant workers;    c) persons convicted of committing a crime who have served  the time;    d) persons whose departure will damage the security of the  state of exit, until the circumstances preventing the departure  cease to be in effect;    e) persons whose departure has been postponed until they  fulfill property obligations to state, cooperative, public, or  other organizations or institutions or private persons;    f) persons temporarily on the state's territory in  connection  with studies or private or business trips;    g) military personnel who are on active military duty and  members of their families.  <H5>  Article 4 </H5>   Permission to resettle is granted to resettlers by the state  of exit in accordance with international law norms and its own  laws.  <H5>  Article 5 </H5>   On their territories, the Signatories provide protection of  resettlers and members of their families from any actions in the  form of violence, threat, or intimidation or other actions based  on gender, race, nationality, language, religion or beliefs,  political or other views, ethnic or social origin, or economic,  property, or family status either on behalf of state officials  or on behalf of private persons, groups, public associations, or  other organizations.  <H5>  Article 6 </H5>   The Signatories' migration services offer the resettlers and  their families the following essential information:    a) the content of this Agreement;    b) their rights and obligations in the state of entry;    c) conditions of job placement and the possibility of  receiving education, vocational training, retraining, and  vocational guidance, as well as other conditions of residing in  the state of entry (natural-climatic, housing and domestic,  sociocultural, and other conditions).  <H5>  Article 7 </H5>   Resettlers and members of their families have the following  rights:    a) to take out all personal property which they personally  own that is declared before they leave the state of exit, with  consideration of the restrictions applicable to removing  cultural treasures which the laws of the state of exit recognize  as national treasures;    b) to sell or in some other way dispose of property which  they personally own and take out of the state of exit or bring  into the state of entry the monetary capital received following  the announced procedure in any currency and in an unrestricted  amount;    c) to transfer monetary deposits and assets placed in  banking  institutions of the state of exit to banking institutions of the  state of entry;    d) to leave personal property, real estate, monetary  deposits, and assets belonging to them with the rights of  ownership on the territory of the state of exit and execute the  right of possession, use, and disposal.    The state of exit assumes the expenditures for transferring  monetary deposits and assets through banking institutions  authorized to do so.    Personal property and real estate may not be alienated by  the  authorities of the state of exit on the basis of the fact that  the owner of it is a person who permanently resides outside the  state's borders and is not a citizen of the state of exit.  <H5>  Article 8 </H5>   The Signatories grant the right of ownership of this  property  to resettlers who are members of housing, housing construction,  dacha, or garage construction cooperatives, orchard and garden  partnerships, or other cooperatives who have made their full  share contribution for the apartment, dacha, garden shed,  garage, or other premises or structure offered to them to use.    In the event the house, dacha, garden shed, or other  structure is sold or transferred to another physical or legal  person, the right to use the land parcel passes completely to  the new owner.    Resettlers are granted the right to pay the share  contribution for property offered for use ahead of time and  perfect their right of ownership of this property.  <H5>  Article 9 </H5>   In relation to state, municipal, or departmental housing,  the  state of exit grants the resettlers and members of their  families the right to make deals with physical and legal persons  to use the housing occupied by the resettlers.    Capital obtained as a result of the deal is the property of  the resettler.    The resettlers realize the possession, use, and disposal of  property under their ownership in full.    Civil law disputes regarding property located on the  territory of the state of exit between resettlers and members of  their families, on the one hand, and concerned persons, on the  other, are resolved in a legal proceeding on the territory of  the state of exit and in accordance with its laws and this  Agreement.    The competent organs of the state of entry consider the  decisions of the courts of the state of exit on these disputes  to have gone into legal effect, including for the purpose of  execution on the territory of the state of entry.  <H5>  Article 10 </H5>   The Signatories ensure that resettlers and members of their  families are exempted from restrictions on the import and export  of their personal property (with the exception of objects which  are prohibited from being exported by the law of the state of  exit and objects prohibited from being imported by the law of  the state of entry), customs duties, taxes, and charges related  to this.    Monetary capital removed and monetary deposits and assets  transferred are exempted from charges and duties, with the  exception of those which represent payment for transfer services.  <H5>  Article 11 </H5>   The state of exit does not prevent resettlers and members of  their families from selling or in any other form disposing of  housing or other property which they own.    The state of entry provides assistance to resettlers and  members of their families in setting themselves up to live in  the new place of residence.    The Signatories do not prevent the exchange of housing  between resettlers done in accordance with procedures  established by the laws of each state.  <H5>  Article 12 </H5>   The state of entry may set a yearly resettlement quota by  which resettlers and members of their families are given  permission to move to this state. The sizes of the quotas are  determined by the state of entry independently.    The Signatories recognize the right of persons to  independently resettle on the territory of one of the states  without obtaining permission to move. The provisions of this  Agreement do not apply to persons who resettle independently.  <H5>  Article 13 </H5>   The Signatories entrust coordination of work to resettle  persons and monitoring of compliance with this Agreement to the  following bodies:    the Russian Signatory charges the Federal Migration  Service of Russia with doing so;    the Kyrgyz Signatory charges the Kyrgyz Republic Ministry  of Labor and Social Protection with doing so.  <H5>  Article 14 </H5>   The Signatories may open a migration service office in the  Russian Federation or the Kyrgyz Republic, as is appropriate. If  necessary, authorized migration service centers of the  Signatories may be opened on the territories of both states.    The functions of the migration service offices include the  following:    a) realization of resettlement programs;    b) annual determination and reconciliation of the  Signatories' potential to accept resettlers (formalized by a  protocol);    c) exchange of information and mutual consultations;    d) proffering of information envisioned in Article 6 of this  Agreement to resettlers and members of their families;    e) registration and rendering of aid to resettlers and  members of their families in carrying out the required  formalities and procedures related to departure and moving.  <H5>  Article 15 </H5>   The procedure for resettlers and members of their families  to  realize rights to social security is regulated by individual  agreements.  <H5>  Article 16 </H5>   In the event the laws of the Russian Federation or the laws  of the Kyrgyz Republic envision regulations other than those  contained in this Agreement, the norms of this Agreement apply.  <H5>  Article 17 </H5>   The Signatories may make additions or amendments to this  Agreement by signing the appropriate documents, and they will be  an inseparable part of this Agreement.    These documents go into effect in the manner envisioned by  Article 19 of this Agreement.  <H5>  Article 18 </H5>   Questions not regulated by the organs indicated in articles  13 and 14 of this Agreement will be resolved through diplomatic  channels.  <H5>  Article 19 </H5>   This Agreement is subject to ratification, goes into effect  the day ratification documents are exchanged, and operates for 7  years. The Signatories may extend the period of operation of the  Agreement through mutual agreement.

			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> D.A. WARNS RESTAURANT IN PROBE OF HIT-RUN DEATH  </P> <P> The Ventura County district attorney's office has warned a restaurant chain  that it may prosecute the chain's security manager for interfering with the  investigation of an employee charged with manslaughter after she allegedly got  drunk at work and drove into a highway laborer.  </P> <P> But an attorney for the firm, Restaurant Enterprises Group of Irvine, said  security manager Chuck Collins has cooperated fully with the investigation of  Lyzah Trost, a cook at Reuben's Restaurant on Moorpark Road in Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> Trost, 29, of Malibu has been charged with one count of felony vehicular  manslaughter and one count of felony hit-and-run driving in connection with the  April 5 death of David Ewing, a 27-year-old highway worker.  </P> <P> The complaint against Trost alleges that she consumed "a number of drinks" at  the restaurant and drove away soon after midnight "despite the protestations"  of fellow workers that she was too drunk to drive.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Closing Off Lanes  </P> <P> Ewing, one of two workers closing off lanes for construction crews on the  eastbound Ventura Freeway, was run over soon after midnight near Moorpark Road  by a driver who fled the scene. Trost was arrested the next day after Reuben's  employees told authorities that she had admitted over the telephone to them  that she had killed the highway worker. She has since been freed on $10,000  bail.  </P> <P> Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, who was out of town Monday and could not be  reached, said in a June 29 letter to Restaurant Enterprises executives that  Collins "in an apparent concern over corporate liability has lied to  investigators, manipulated employees and blatantly obstructed the  investigation" of Trost. He said Collins could be charged with obstructing  justice, which carries a maximum term of three years in state prison.  </P> <P> Bradbury said his office had to subpoena the telephone numbers and addresses of  Reuben's employees to interview them because Collins was uncooperative.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Instructions to Employees  </P> <P> He said Collins lied to investigators by telling them that he had provided the  information to officers from the California Highway Patrol. Bradbury also  stated that Collins told employees "not to talk with anyone" regarding the  incident and that at least one employee felt that his job would be in jeopardy  if he did not follow Collins' instructions.  </P> <P> Robert E. Weiner, an attorney for Restaurant Enterprises, said Collins and  other company representatives have cooperated fully with Bradbury's staff. He  said Collins told employees not to discuss the case among themselves or with  the press, but to cooperate with authorities.  </P> <P> Weiner said the district attorney's investigators have "an ax to grind" with  Collins. He would not elaborate.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Joe Buckalew said prosecutors will decide whether to charge  Collins by the end of the month.  </P></p>

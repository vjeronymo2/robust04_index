			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Japanese warm to vin ordinaire: Cheap French wine is one pleasant consequence of the strong yen, but there is also pain While the world's leading central banks agonise over the yen's historic leap through Y100 to the dollar this week, ordinary Japanese people are having a ball. A Japanese consumer might celebrate by treating himself to a prime US steak for lunch, washed down with a bottle of French wine or Belgian beer. He could then step into his new Cherokee jeep for a drive to the local travel agent, where he might book a beach holiday in Hawaii, likely to cost less than a golfing trip to Hokkaido. These are examples of the formerly expensive foreign treats being snapped up by consumers, enriched by a currency that has risen 35 per cent, in trade weighted terms, since the start of last year. Imports of beef, mostly US and Australian, rose by a third in the year to March; beer imports multiplied fivefold in the first four months of this year, and wine imports doubled. Car imports rose by nearly half last month, the seventh monthly rise running, to gain a record 8.6 per cent market share, led by US cars with a 60.6 per cent volume rise. Meanwhile, a record 5.2m Japanese travelled abroad in the first five months of this year, nearly 16 per cent more than the same period of 1993. Their appetites sharpened by more than three years of economic decline, Japanese people have acquired a taste for a bargain. Some - but by no means all - the consequences of the yen's strength have been good for the economy. A discount shopping spree, for example, was thought to be a factor in a jump in private consumption, by an annualised 5.8 per cent in the first quarter of this year. This spree helped import volumes grow by 16.1 per cent in the year to last month, the main cause of a sharp 15.9 per cent drop in the trade surplus over the same period. It was the first clear sign that the politically troublesome current account gap - a factor in the yen's rise - is starting to shrink. 'The boon to consumers will go much further this time than in the previous round of yen appreciation, because people have become genuinely more value oriented,' says Mr Dick Beason, senior economist at James Capel Pacific. Evidence that Japan's new taste for French wine and US cars could have some way to run is that foreign goods still only represent just over 14 per cent of domestic demand - well below the OECD average of 24 per cent. So Japan's consumers can be expected to reach for their corkscrews and propose a toast if the yen should rise again. There is, of course, a painful side to the yen's fluctuations. Nowhere is the anguish worse than in the boardrooms of Japan's manufacturing companies. They have seen the yen value of overseas earnings squeezed since the 1985 Plaza accord to restrain the dollar's value started the yen's rising trend. Another turn of the screw is unwelcome, when Japan is in the fragile early stage of a recovery from its longest economic downturn in postwar years - 37 months according to the government's Economic Planning Agency. It is even less welcome when the minority coalition government is facing a no-confidence motion, paralysing attempts to resolve the dispute with the US over barriers to imports, and casting doubt on the substance of the package of deregulation and tax reforms, due to be published on Tuesday. 'The yen's extraordinary sharp appreciation could not only nip the recovery in business conditions in the bud, but also destroy the country's manufacturing industry,' warns Mr Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Nikkeiren employers' federation. Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the Keidanren employers' federation, estimates that, if the yen sticks around Y100 to the dollar for the next year, gross domestic product will shrink 0.8 per cent over the same period. That compares with the government's target of GDP growth of 2.4 per cent this year. A similar, but stronger jump in the Japanese currency this time last year killed signs of a recovery then. The yen rose by 17 per cent from January 1993 to last year's high of nearly Y100 in August, receding to Y110 by the end of the year. By yesterday it was at Y101.1, 12 per cent above its 1994 opening rate. Each Y1 fall against the dollar over a year slices 3.4 percentage points from manufacturing industry's taxable profits, according to Nikko Securities. The Economic Planning Agency reckons that only one in 200 of Japan's exporters can break even at Y100 to the dollar. Yet foreign economists - and some Japanese companies - believe that Mr Toyoda and Mr Nagano are exaggerating slightly. For one thing, they do not believe the yen will stay at this height, because the current account surplus appears to have turned the corner. This year's signs of a general economic recovery are also stronger and more widespread than last year's. Gross domestic product rose by an annual 3.9 per cent in the first quarter of this year, by comparison with the 1 per cent rise in the same period of 1993. This might explain why the stock market does not believe that the strong yen is as as bad for corporate Japan as managers sometimes claim. Mr Robert Feldman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers Asia, the securities company, points out that share prices have risen in each of the seven years since 1970 in which the yen has appreciated by more than 10 per cent: 'It suggests that the yen's strength is linked to the strength of the economy.' Japanese industry has, moreover, had nearly a decade since the Plaza accord in which to sharpen its competitiveness in response to the rising yen, by trimming costs and shifting capacity abroad. Clearly, the yen's strength reduces such companies' foreign costs as well as foreign revenues. Today, 7 per cent of Japan's industrial production is overseas, according to the Tokyo office of Morgan Stanley, the investment firm. The move caused the loss of 70,000 Japanese manufacturing jobs at the latest count in 1991. But that is tiny in relation to the 62.5m workforce, so unemployment remains far lower than in Japan's leading competitors, at 2.8 per cent. This indicates that industry can continue the shift abroad without breaking its taboo against making redundancies - the constraint on foreign investment most commonly cited by managers in Tokyo. Another high-yen survival technique has been to contain the rise in export prices by sacrificing profit margins and keeping a lid on labour costs. They have been helped by the fact that Japan's working hours and total wages are more flexible than international competitors'. But Japanese companies have been unable to squeeze labour costs indefinitely. These have been allowed to rise since the turn of the decade above those in the US and Germany. As a result of Japanese companies' decreasing ability to pass on the costs of the high yen to their workforces, the country's loss of export market share 'could begin to be severe', warns the latest OECD report on Japan. The lesson, as if Japanese companies did not already know this by heart, is that wild currency fluctuations are a long-term fact of business in Japan. Consumers can, at least for the time being, continue to drink cheap French wine, reasonably secure in the knowledge that their hard-pressed employers will not throw them out of a job - yet.</p>

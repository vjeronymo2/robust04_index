These rules were submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on September 14, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 3, 1978, EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 (1977 CAA or pre-amended Act), that included the Los Angeles-South Coast Air Basin. 43 FR 8964, 40 CFR 81.305. Because this area was unable to meet the statutory attainment date of December 31, 1982, California requested under section 172(a)(2), and EPA approved, an extension of the attainment date to December 31, 1987. 40 CFR 52.238. On May 26, 1988, EPA notified the Governor of California, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the pre-amended Act, that the SCAQMD's portion of the California SIP was inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Pub. L. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. In amended section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas fix their deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone and established a deadline of May 15, 1991 for states to submit corrections of those deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre-amended section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amendment guidance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA's SIP-Call used that guidance to indicate the necessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas.

This document addresses EPA's proposed action for SCAQMD Rule 1106.1, Pleasure Craft Coating Operations, and for SCAQMD Rule 109, Recordkeeping for Volatile Organic Compound Emissions. SCAQMD adopted Rule 1106.1 on May 1, 1992 and Rule 109 on March 6, 1992. These submitted rules were found to be complete on November 20, 1992 pursuant to EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR Part 51 Appendix V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and are being proposed for approval into the SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA adopted the completeness criteria on February 16, 1990 (55 FR 5830) and, pursuant to section 110(k)(1)(A) of the CAA, revised the criteria on August 26, 1991 (56 FR 42216).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 1106.1 requires the use of low VOC coatings for marine pleasure craft coating operations and coating application methods with high transfer efficiencies, and Rule 109 sets out general recordkeeping requirements for regulating volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions for a variety of source categories. VOCs contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. The rules were adopted as part of the district's efforts to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to EPA's SIP-Call and the section 182(a)(2)(A) CAA requirement. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for these rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation, Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 1. Among those provisions is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique Guideline (CTG) documents. The CTGs are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive norms for what is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents, as well as other Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182(a)(2)(A). Rule 1106.1 controls emissions from a source category for which EPA has not issued a CTG and Rule 109 is a general recordkeeping rule and therefore does not have a corresponding CTG. Further interpretations of EPA policy are found in the Blue Book, referred to in footnote 1. In general, these guidance documents have been set forth to ensure that VOC rules are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SCAQMD's submitted Rule 109, includes the following significant changes from the current SIP:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Adds a definition for Exempt Compounds,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Removes Executive Officer Discretion from sections (c)(2) and (c)(3) as prescribed in the Technical Support Document (TSD) (dated January 15, 1992), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Adds EPA-approved test methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SCAQMD Rule 1106.1 is a new rule which was adopted to regulate emissions for the coating of marine pleasure craft.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has evaluated the submitted rules and has determined that they are consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations, and EPA policy. Therefore, SCAQMD Rule 1106.1 and Rule 109 are being proposed for approval under section 110(k)(3) of the CAA as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and Part D.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

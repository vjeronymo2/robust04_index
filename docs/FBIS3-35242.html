Musa said if the work to lift the siege of Sarajevo  succeeds,  it is necessary and desirable that this also be done at other  besieged towns. Thus, several aspects of Serb aggression can be  dealt with and a settlement process can begin in a better  atmosphere.    Musa added that Egypt is closely watching the situation. It  will continue its contacts with the states concerned. He  explained that Egypt is maintaining contacts with the European  states. It is also maintaining contact with the Islamic state  [Bosnia Herzegovina] within the context of the Islamic  Conference Organization's interest in this issue.</p>

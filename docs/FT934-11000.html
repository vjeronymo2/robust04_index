			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Labour faces setback in Jerusalem THE Labour party of Israel's prime minister Yitzhak Rabin appeared to have suffered an electoral setback in Jerusalem yesterday as Israelis voted across the country in the first test of public opinion since the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. According to exit polls by Israel television, Mr Teddy Kollek, the 83-year-old Labour mayor of Jerusalem, was defeated by his Likud challenger, Mr Ehud Olmert, by 55 per cent of the vote to 41 per cent. Elsewhere in the country, political analysts predicted before voting that Labour would marginally increase its control over local government, reducing the power of the right-wing Likud party which controls more councils than Labour. In Tel Aviv, where Mr Ronni Milo was aiming to retain Israel's commercial capital for Likud, exit polls showed the two parties running neck-and-neck with 45 per cent of the vote each. Mr Kollek had headed the administration of Jerusalem, centre-point of the battle with Likud, for 28 years. Mr Olmert, an MP who opposes the peace accord, delivered a last-minute blow by cutting a deal for the support of the city's ultra-orthodox community. Under it, an ultra-orthodox candidate, Mr Meir Porush, agreed to drop out of the race and swing his votes behind Mr Olmert. Forecasters had said that to win re-election Mr Kollek would need a heavy turnout from the city's 80,000 Palestinians living in Israeli-occupied Arab east Jerusalem. But turnout was reported by Israel radio at less than 1 per cent among Palestinian Jerusalemites. Mr Kollek is a standard-bearer of peaceful co-existence between Arabs and Jews while Mr Olmert had campaigned on an aggressive policy of Jewish settlement throughout Jerusalem, including neighbourhoods which under Mr Kollek were reserved for Palestinians. Palestinian politicians said yesterday a defeat for Mr Kollek would seriously set back talks between Palestinians and Israel on the future of the Holy City, due to begin within two years. But many Jewish voters believed Mr Kollek was too old to lead the city again.</p>

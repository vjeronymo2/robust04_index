			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CENTURY LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> VILLA PARK GIVES FOOTHILL ANOTHER LONG DAY, 15-1  </P> <P> Foothill High School's slide in the Century League baseball standings continued  Friday as Villa Park pounded the host Knights, 15-1.  </P> <P> Foothill committed nine errors and three pitchers gave up 16 hits as Villa Park  enjoyed its highest run total of the season.  </P> <P> It was the fourth loss in the past six league games for Foothill (8-12-1, 5-5-1  in league play), which has lost three starters with injuries, including one of  the county's best pitchers, Kent Donnelly.  </P> <P> "I feel sorry for (Foothill Coach) Gerry (Sedoo) after this one," Villa Park  Coach Dave Ochoa said. "He's got one of the best high school pitchers in  Southern California and can't use him."  </P> <P> Donnelly is suffering from a lower back strain and Sedoo said the senior  right-hander won't pitch again this season. Sedoo used Donnelly as the  designated hitter and he struck out twice and doubled.  </P> <P> Villa Park starter Kurt Luhrsen (3-3) allowed only four hits and struck out  eight, losing his shutout in the fourth inning when Jason Martian misplayed a  fly ball.  </P> <P> Villa Park (13-7-1, 6-5) will play two games against league-leading Canyon next  week, and Ochoa was encouraged with Luhrsen's performance going into the big  series.  </P> <P> "Kurt got more aggressive on the mound as we got more aggressive at the plate,"  Ochoa said. "The last time we played Foothill, they hammered Todd Blyleven for  10 hits. I thought Kurt pitched a great game today."  </P> <P> Leadoff batter Aaron Boone, son of Kansas City Royal catcher Bob Boone, led  Villa Park with three hits and scored four runs. Martian had three hits and  drove in three runs.  </P> <P> Villa Park broke open a close game with six runs in the fifth inning and added  five runs in the sixth, when Foothill committed four errors.  </P> <P> Afterward, Sedoo tried to explain a promising season that has gone sour.  </P> <P> "We started losing players before the spring break, and then compounded our  problems during the break with fielding errors and mental breakdowns," he said.  "We haven't played well since the break. I'm just hoping we can snap out of  it."  </P> <P> Santa Ana 6, El Modena 5 (10 innings) -- El Modena scored a run in 10th but  host Santa Ana (10-11, 6-5) rallied back for two runs with the help of three  errors.  </P> <P> Canyon 3, Santa Ana Valley 2 (10 innings) -- Mike Casagranda singled with one  out in the 10th and was replaced by pinch-runner Chuck Nickerson, who later  scored the winning run on a single by Bob Thompson. Greg Tippin (2-3) pitched  10 innings with 10 strikeouts for the victory. Scott Crosby hit a solo home run  for Santa Ana Valley in the third.  </P></p>

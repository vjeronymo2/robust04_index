			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Clarification of Purpose and Applicability of Section 3_Providing Preference When Economic Opportunities Are Generated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before discussion of the issues and suggestions raised by commenters, the Department wants to clarify the purpose and applicability of section 3. Certain questions and issues raised by several commenters made the Department aware that there is some confusion about the purpose of section 3 and when the training, employment and contracting preferences of section 3 are applicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters stated that they did not have the funds to initiate job training and apprenticeship programs, and they did not need to employ additional personnel or contract for work. Section 3 does not require the creation of economic opportunities for low- and very low-income persons, or for anyone, simply for the sake of creating economic opportunities. Section 3 requires that when employment or contract opportunities are generated because a project or activity undertaken by a recipient of HUD financial assistance necessitates the employment of additional personnel through individual hiring or the awarding of contracts for work, the recipient must give preference in hiring to low- and very low-income persons, and must give preference in contracting to businesses owned by these persons or that substantially employ low- and very low-income persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When the need to employ additional personnel or to contract for work occurs (which is frequently the case when HUD financial assistance is expended), the recipient or contractor will be recruiting individuals, and soliciting contractors, for these economic opportunities. Section 3 requires that recipients not only include low- and very low-income persons in these recruitment and solicitation efforts, but that, in fact, extra or greater efforts be undertaken to make these persons aware of the existence of the economic opportunities, encourage their application for these opportunities, and facilitate the employment of, or award of contracts to, these persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If, however, the section 3 covered assistance is awarded and the recipient has no need for additional employees or trainees, or the recipient has no need to contract for work, then the section 3 preference requirements are not triggered because the recipient is not recruiting any individuals for jobs, or soliciting any business concerns for contracts. Again, the section 3 preference requirements are triggered by the need for new hires (whether individual employees or contractors or subcontractors) for work on a project or activity assisted by HUD financial assistance covered by section 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Overview of the Interim Rule and Discussion of Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section of the preamble provides a summary of the significant changes made to the October 8, 1993 proposed rule by this interim rule in response to public comment, and discusses the public comments that prompted these changes. This section also discusses those provisions of the proposed rule for which substantial comments were received requesting change, and for which the Department declined to adopt the recommended change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Simplification of Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters stated that the rule was unnecessarily lengthy and complex, and contained sections and subparts that seemed simply to duplicate the same information. Other commenters stated that one of the reasons for the complexity of the rule was that uniform standards were not applied to all recipients and contractors. The commenters stated that, under the October 8, 1993 proposed rule, the standards imposed on recipients and contractors depended upon the program source of HUD funds received. These commenters stated that the distinction of effort required to be undertaken by recipients on the basis of the source of the HUD financial assistance was inappropriate, and that all HUD recipients and contractors should be required, as the statute mandates, to provide, to the greatest extent feasible, economic opportunities to low- and very low-income persons. Other commenters stated that the rule was lengthened by the long list of examples of efforts that recipients may, but were not required to, undertake to comply with the section 3 preference requirements. The commenters stated that the rule should provide for the minimum requirements that recipients and contractors must meet, and that options, suggestions, and recommendations should be provided in a notice, handbook, or other form of guidance, but not in the rule. The Department agrees with all of the above commenters, and has made changes to the proposed section 3 regulations in response to these comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Consolidation of Rule Sections <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department has eliminated the separate subparts for implementing section 3 in public and Indian housing programs, housing programs, and community development programs. The Department agrees with the commenters that much of the information in these three subparts was duplicative. The interim rule provides one subpart that addresses the implementation of section 3 in all covered programs, and this subpart makes distinctions for individual program features or requirements where such distinctions are necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Application of One ``Effort'' Standard to All Recipients and Contractors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The interim rule requires the same level of effort to be undertaken by all recipients and contractors, regardless of the source of HUD financial assistance, to comply with the section 3 preference requirements. That level of effort is one consistent with the statute's ``to the greatest extent feasible'' requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The distinction in effort in the proposed rule imposed on public and Indian housing recipients on the one hand, and recipients of funds from ``other'' programs (i.e., housing and community development programs) on the other hand, was based on statutory terminology. The Congress used two different terms in describing the level of effort to be undertaken in each of these two broad categories of HUD programs. The Congress used the term ``best efforts'' in connection with the efforts required of public and Indian housing authorities, and ``greatest extent feasible'' in connection with the efforts required of recipients of ``other program'' assistance. The different use of terms raised a presumption that the terms have different meanings. However, on further consideration, the Department recognizes that there is very little difference in the common meaning of these terms. Additionally, the Department determined that the statute contemplates that every recipient and contractor that generates economic opportunities from the expenditure of section 3 covered assistance, regardless of the HUD program from which the assistance is derived, must provide these economic opportunities to low- and very low-income persons to the greatest extent feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Removal of Examples of ``Best Efforts'' and ``Good Faith Efforts'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the list of efforts in each of the three subparts in the proposed rule were examples of efforts that could be undertaken by a recipient or contractor to comply with section 3, and not efforts required to be undertaken, the Department has removed these efforts from the interim rule. The Department agrees that the inclusion of these efforts added to the length of the interim rule and gave the appearance that the regulations are more cumbersome than they are. The list of efforts has been moved to an appendix that accompanies the interim rule, and therefore remain an available source of guidance to those recipients and contractors that found the list of efforts helpful.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters provided examples of additional activities that may be helpful in soliciting the participation of low- and very low-income persons in the job application and procurement processes, and these activities have been included in the appendix to part 135. A few commenters stated that as certain efforts or activities undertaken by recipients, and not currently included in the list of examples, prove to be successful, the Department should add the activity or activities to the list of examples. The Department will amend the appendix from time to time to include additional activities, or publish a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or in an industry trade periodical to advise of activities that a recipient or recipients have determined to be successful in encouraging and facilitating the participation of low- and very low-income persons in the job application or procurement process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

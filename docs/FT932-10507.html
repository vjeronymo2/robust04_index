			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Election quotes John Major: People were determined to give the government a bloody nose, and that in practice is what they did. Norman Lamont, chancellor, during the by-election campaign: Je ne regrette rien . . . Sir George Gardiner, Tory MP for Reigate: Whoever thought of sending Norman Lamont to Newbury should be given a revolver on a silver tray. Michael Howard, environment secretary: As the recovery gathers momentum we shall see a marked change in the political climate and I am sure we can reverse the results of yesterday. Lord Tebbit: I think the elections have shown that the people want to give the government a very, very hard kick indeed. Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary: On Thursday night Tory chairman Sir Norman Fowler lost more counties than Group 4 - of which he is a director - has lost prisoners. Government official to reporters about Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary: If he's asked about Newbury he will turn and walk away.</p>

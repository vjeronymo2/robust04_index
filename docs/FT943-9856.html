			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Buy-outs take a tumble Management buy-out activity was considerably more robust last year in continental Europe than it was in the UK, according to a review* published today. While the total number of deals - including those below Ecu10m (Pounds 7.87m) - fell marginally to 374 deals in 1993, the value increased by 5 per cent to Pounds 3.1bn, according to the report produced by Initiative Europe and the Centre for Management Buy-out Research at Nottingham University*. By comparison, the volume of UK deals fell from 506 to 477 deals and the value fell by 14 per cent to Pounds 2.85bn. France, the most mature continental market, saw the sharpest decline, with deal volume and value down from 1990 peaks as the largest deals dried up. But Initiative Europe says that the country's tax laws which make it punitive for family controlled companies to be passed from one generation to another - the issue of transmission d'entreprises - should provide a steady flow of opportunities for management buy-outs and buy-ins. Overall in continental Europe, the recession has not led corporations in financial difficulty to shed non-core assets to repay borrowings at the speed seen by their UK counterparts. But the recession has led to fewer small deals being financed and investment houses concentrating on doing fewer larger deals. This helped buy-out activity to remain roughly constant despite the deterioration in the economies of continental Europe. While buy-outs were flat, the volume of management buy-ins increased by 60 per cent in the first half of 1994. The review finds that the technique is particularly appropriate where incumbent management of a family-owned company is not capable of leading a buy-out. *Europe Buy-out Review.

			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MINOR REPORT SWINGS LOTS OF WEIGHT IN BOND MARKET  </P> <P> In its endless search for the most up-to-date signpost on the economy's  direction, the bond market has alighted on a minor regional report that has  sent markets reeling upon release.  </P> <P> The report, by the Purchasing Management Assn. of Chicago, provides a snapshot  of local business conditions in the month just ended and has the distinction of  arriving before all others.  </P> <P> In the first indication of the economy's performance in May, the Chicago group  said Thursday that its index rose to 56% from 54.2% in April. A reading above  50% points to an expanding economy.  </P> <P> Despite the regional nature of the report, bond traders took it as a sign that  the economy was picking up, easing the pressure for lower interest rates.  </P> <P> Treasury bonds fell on the news, with the benchmark 30-year U.S. bond down  about a fifth of a point.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department on Thursday released a factory orders report showing a  downturn in the manufacturing economy, but the data was for April -- ancient  history as far as the financial markets are concerned.  </P> <P> The key to the Chicago report, economists said, is that it provides the first  indication of manufacturing activity for the month just ended.  </P> <P> The index reflects conditions of about 200 industrial businesses in Northern  Illinois and Northwest Indiana.  </P> <P> It is "one measure of what is going on right now and comes out early, which is  very, very good," said Samuel Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities Inc. in  Chicago.  </P> <P> The nearly 50-year-old report gained international stature last year when its  monthly release date was fixed ahead of a similar but unrelated national  survey, prepared by the National Assn. of Purchasing Management.  </P> <P> The National group's index will be released Friday, the same day as the Labor  Department releases the influential U.S. employment report for May.  </P> <P> Some economists say the Chicago report has had an uncanny ability to call the  most recent shifts in the economy's direction.  </P> <P> Comparing data between 1970 and 1987, John Hoagland, a professor of management  at Michigan State University, found that the Chicago data predicted a shift in  the economy's direction sooner than comparable government figures.  </P> <P> But many economists caution against reading too much into the data. The  report's sample size is comparatively small and does not contain the detail of  related U.S. economic reports.  </P></p>

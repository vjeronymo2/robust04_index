			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Shevardnadze retracts threat of attack: President sees no progress in efforts to end his army's battle with Abkhazian separatists FIGHTING intensified in Georgia yesterday as President Eduard Shevardnadze said efforts to end his army's battle with Abkhazian separatists were going nowhere. However, the Georgian president retracted a threat by his regional commander to attack the Abkhazian stronghold. Georgian officials yesterday said about 1,500 separatists and northern Caucasian volunteers had attacked the town of Gagra, near Russia's southern border, in the worst fighting so far in the two-week conflict. Both sides reported minimal casualties among their own forces, but claimed to have inflicted dozens. Mr Shevardnadze said he was speaking daily by telephone with the leader of the uprising, Mr Vladislav Ardzinba, and with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, whom both sides see as a potential mediator. Yesterday, Mr Shevardnadze sent an envoy with a Russian parliamentary delegation to Mr Ardzinba's stronghold of Gudauta. The delegation aims to narrow differences between the sides prior to planned talks on September 3 between Mr Shevardnadze and Mr Ardzinba, to be overseen by Mr Yeltsin. Mr Shevardnadze also backed away from an ultimatum issued on Tuesday by the Georgian commander in Abkhazia, Colonel Gia Karkarashvili. Col Karkarashvili made the threat - he said he would attack Gudauta directly if Mr Ardzinba did not surrender by 1pm yesterday - after the Abkhazians killed two Georgian negotiators during talks on Monday. 'Ultimatums do not work practically,' Mr Shevardnadze said. 'The commander-in-chief of the guards reacted this way because two of his men were killed. The only part of the ultimatum that I approved was that if they stopped blowing up bridges and railways, if they stopped all this, 'we would no longer be facing you'.' Mr Shevardnadze made it clear that he accepted a major role for Mr Yeltsin in ending the conflict. He said Mr Yeltsin had promised to try to seal up the mountain gorge of Bzipi, through which more than 1,500 forces from sympathetic northern Caucasians regions, such as Chechenia, have joined the Abkhazian side.</p>

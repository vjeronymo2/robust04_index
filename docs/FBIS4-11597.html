			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] We are going to start by repeating what we have  time and again said here over the past few days: We are going  through a tense social situation, which is marked by not  entirely successful attempts to set up roadblocks. There is,  above all, an atmosphere of uncertainty and insecurity. Workers  have clashed with government forces on the streets using the  technique of organizing in cell-style picketing groups. There  are talks under way aimed at starting negotiations between the  government and the Bolivian Labor Federation [COB], but no  progress has yet been made in addressing substantive issues.  While the situation is not new, it is worrisome just the same.    Violence took hold on the streets of La Paz this afternoon.  Union leaders, policemen, and even common criminals participated  in acts of violence.    The COB rally scheduled for this afternoon in San Francisco  Square was not held. Police took positions over the entire city  of La Paz, and prevented every form of street protest. As soon  as a group of workers began to convene, police were already  dispersing them.    Demonstrators moved toward the northern part of the city,  where they continued to fight police personnel. Dozens of  people were arrested.    The situation was altogether different at the Lima police  precinct. There the ones who were surrounded were the  policemen. The actions there were in no way related to the COB  social struggle, let alone with the struggle waged by the unions  of rural and urban teachers, who in recent times have often  taken to the streets of La Paz. In this case, common criminals  surrounded the Lima precinct to release their fellow criminals  who were being held at the precinct. [passage omitted]    The criminals managed to open the cell, but there was only  one prisoner there. Their next move was to try to hang the  policemen, who locked themselves up in the precinct office.  [passage omitted]    Finally, reinforcements managed to rescue the Lima precinct  police personnel.    Disturbances in La Paz continued until very late. The  demonstrators damaged several buses. You are now watching a  clip of (Higuino Square), where the police dispersed one of the  many groups of demonstrators and cleared the street for traffic.    No one was spared from the acts of violence on Peru Avenue,  not even reporters. Three journalists and a press car were  attacked this afternoon by rural teachers on Peru Avenue, where  window panes were shattered and the windshields of cars and  buses were broken. [passage omitted]    This time the demonstrators acted in small groups, giving no  quarter to police. The clip you are watching took place near  the court house, where the air was filled with tear gas. In the  meantime, the last eight people still under arrest for breaking  windshields and windows during the rural teachers demonstration  on 22 April requested that the Fourth Criminal Court judge set  them free during a habeas corpus hearing. Judge Lidia Molina  upheld their request, and ordered that they all be released.  [passage omitted]    The rural teachers have announced that they will file  another  habeas corpus petition to obtain the release of those arrested  this afternoon.</p>

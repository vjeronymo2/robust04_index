			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> COASTAL COMMISSION APPROVES PIER PLANS  </P> <P> To the jubilation of city officials, the powerful state Coastal Commission on  Thursday unanimously approved the city's plans for razing its old,  storm-damaged pier and replacing it with a new one.  </P> <P> "This was very important," said Mike Adams, the city's director of community  services.  </P> <P> "This now gives us the green light for proceeding with contracts. We can keep  right on schedule."  </P> <P> The Coastal Commission, meeting in Long Beach, voted 11 to 0 to approve the  pier plans after a presentation by the city. No one spoke against the city's  plans.  </P> <P> The old pier has been closed since July, 1988, when engineers deemed it unsafe  for use because of age and multiple storm damage. The end of the pier,  including a new restaurant, was broken off and thrown into the ocean by a storm  in January, 1988.  </P> <P> The city plans to tear down the remainder of the old pier shortly after the  Sept. 3 Labor Day holiday. Construction of a new pier, estimated to cost $12.8  million, is to begin in late November or early December.  </P> <P> The Coastal Commission approval was necessary because it is the state agency  that governs land use of the coastal areas.

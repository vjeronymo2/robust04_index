			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Popular Party ideologue Rocco </F> Buttiglione by Maurizio Caprara in Rome; date not given:  "Buttiglione: This Right Does Not Know How To Govern"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [Passage omitted] [Caprara] Mr.  Buttiglione, now that the election campaign is over, we do not  need to pretend any longer. Tell me, do you really believe in  the possibility of reviving the center?    [Buttiglione] I believe that the line set out by [Italian  Popular Party, PPI, Secretary] Mino Martinazzoli is basically  correct.    [Caprara] What does "basically" mean?    [Buttiglione] That the way in which we have implemented it  has proved inadequate. We did not succeed in making the country  understand it.    [Caprara] What is your interpretation of that line?    [Buttiglione] In a democracy in which rotation occurs, there  is normally a left-wing force and a center force. The Right is  smaller. We began amid a strong anti-DC [Christian Democratic  Party] tide that disqualified the center. There was Bribe City,  and for too long the center has been an entity without ideas.  An entity for joint administration, chiefly with the Left.  However,...    [Caprara] However, what?    [Buttiglione] ...however, we should have laid the  foundations  for a major center force that would have the Left as its  antagonist. Because of our own shortcomings, the center vote was  swallowed up by the Right.    [Caprara] Are those all the faults?    [Buttiglione] We committed a serious fault in the past by  failing to expel certain crooks promptly.    [Caprara] Could you name some names?    [Buttiglione] A number of crooks.    [Caprara] Where does Martinazzoli stand in this analysis?    [Buttiglione] He made a major contribution, especially in  the  final stage of the election campaign. But evidently it was  insufficient.    [Caprara] Pardon me, Mr. Buttiglione, but are you mourning  the DC now that it is dead? Some of its adversaries are doing  so.    [Buttiglione] I was never a member of the DC, though I  always  voted for it. Be that as it may, the verdict of historians will  be different from that given by the newspapers now. The DC  guaranteed the country the longest period of peace in its  history, a certain level of development, and great tolerance. I  think that some of the anti-DC sectarianism is ungenerous.    [Caprara] If often comes from former Christian Democrats.    [Buttiglione] Yes. The turncoats are asserting themselves by  stabbing their brother in the back.    [Caprara] After Martinazzoli's resignation, you said that  you  feel more isolated. Are you looking for new friends?    [Buttiglione] Friendships are built by means of an exchange  of views on history and by establishing ideological common  ground on the basis of this exchange. I hope that history will  enable us to find many friends.    [Caprara] Berlusconi maintains that while the PPI asserts  Christian values, your program embodies "the same emphases" and  that some of the Pact's proposals are "the same" as some of  Forza Italia's. Do you agree?    [Buttiglione] Certainly, and I am pleased. Martinazzoli used  to point out, in order to curb my academic enthusiasm for  ideology, that although programs are important in politics, so  too are the individuals and the forces that advocate them. We  will discover through legislative activity whether points of  contact exist.    [Caprara] The PPI's Forleo says that you will take care of  providing Berlusconi with a majority in the Senate.    [Buttiglione] I have heard some rumors that I am supposedly  jumping on the Forza Italia bandwagon. Many people have also  asked me to do so, and I am grateful for their esteem. But I  have always had an irresistible love for lost causes. I would  find it difficult to jump on the victor's bandwagon.    [Caprara] The Left of your party is not afraid of your  leaving. It is afraid of your taking the party with you.    [Buttiglione] We must not jump on the victor's bandwagon. I  believe we must stay in opposition for a while.    [Caprara] Precisely: They are afraid that you will hang on  to them until the congress. Then, everyone over to Berlusconi.    [Buttiglione] No, so that it becomes obvious that this  Right is incapable of governing. It must be broken up by  shifting some parts of it to the center. Meanwhile, we must  build the party. This means bringing together many people who  are bound by a common ideal and who trust each other.    [Caprara] That is a wonderful picture. It is a shame that  the PPI is at present the opposite of that -- not many people,  and almost nobody who trusts anyone else.    [Buttiglione] I agree with you. But the renewal could not  have been carried out properly under the blows of an aggression  and with such frequent elections. Keep in mind that if someone  embraces a lost cause it is because he is convinced that it can  prove victorious.    [Caprara] Immediately after Martinazzoli's resignation, Rosa  Russo Jervolino said that she tried to contact Martinazzoli but  that she did not manage to speak with him. Did you try to  contact him?    [Buttiglione] That is my own affair, if I may be permitted  to  say so. Politics must be transparent, but everyone has the  right to a private sphere of personal relations.    [Caprara] I did not consider that an embarrassing question.  Be that as its may, yours is a political reply. In his  farewell message Martinazzoli described the MSI [Italian Social  Movement] Right as "encumbered by the burden of its origins and  its ideology." Do you consider that an intolerable burden?    [Buttiglione] [National Alliance leader] Fini made a good  decision when he decided to dissolve the fascists. And he made  a mistake when he failed to do so. This, perhaps because he  achieved good results in the municipal elections. My friend,  Fisichella, and many other National Alliance voters are not  fascists. But it is others who are in charge of the MSI. Real  changes are painful and entail a certain residue being left out.    [Caprara] Could [former President] Cossiga have a role to  play in a party such as the PPI, which cites Catholic principles  and which some people consider liberal?    [Buttiglione] I think that he has carved out a different  role  for himself. It is partly an institutional or  semi-institutional role, as a resource to turn to at times of  crisis. I am not talking about a party but about the entire  democratic system.</p>

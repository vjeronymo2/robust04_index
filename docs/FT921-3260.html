			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Australia embroiled in racism debate AUSTRALIA, one of the strongest supporters of sanctions against apartheid in South Africa, is embroiled in a debate over the extent of institutionalised racism against its Aboriginal minority, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney. Race relations have rarely been smooth since the first white settlers arrived in Sydney 204 years ago. But two incidents in recent weeks suggest that official prejudice against blacks remains widespread. The most striking was an amateur video broadcast on ABC television which showed policemen at a charity function cavorting for the camera with blacked faces and nooses around their necks. The officers identified themselves as David Gundy and Lloyd Boney, both Aborigines who died in police custody. Mr Gundy was shot dead in Sydney in 1989; Mr Boney hanged himself in a police cell in 1987. The screening of the video followed a documentary in which police in the Sydney suburb of Redfern were filmed harassing Aborigines, some of whom were arrested for using 'offensive' language which also formed a prominent part of the police vocabulary. Both incidents have been condemned by political leaders of all parties. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, said the video was 'a national disgrace'. He urged Australians to 'expunge racism from every corner of this country'. The officers, who belong to the New South Wales (NSW) state police, have been placed on restricted duties, and are being investigated by the force's internal affairs department. A separate inquiry is taking place into the events in Redfern. Aborigines reacted to the video with outrage. Mr Paul Coe, chairman of the Aboriginal Legal Service in Redfern said the video was indicative of racism 'in all institutions throughout the states and the Commonwealth (federal government) of Australia.' Ms Irene Moss, the federal Race Discriminations Commissioner, said the 'outrageous' behaviour exposed in the broadcasts reflected 'widespread involvement of police in acts of racist violence, intimidation and harassment of Aboriginal people'. Police officers appeared to be less concerned. Mr Tony Day, president of the NSW Police Association, said it was a disgrace the video had been sensationalised.</p>

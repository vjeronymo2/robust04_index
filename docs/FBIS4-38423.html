			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 31 TASS -- The Russian Press Committee  warned the ZAVTRA newspaper on Tuesday that some of its  materials are incompatible with operating legislation.    Committee Deputy Chairman Sergey Gryzunov said in an  interview with ITAR-TASS later in the day that "the warning was  prompted, in part, by the article `World Villainy' containing  downright propaganda of war and violence".    He said that an application was filed with the Russian  prosecutor-general's office on instituting an investigation  against the newspaper.    The committee also sent warnings to St. Petersburg-based ZA  RUSSKOYE DELO and RODNYE PROSTOPY newspapers about their  violations of the mass media law. Some of their articles  contained calls for overthrowing the present constitutional  system by force as well as ideas of racial strife and  anti-semitism.    The committee intends to review, in the near future, a  decision by the former Press and Information Ministry on the  registration of the AL-KODS newspaper, which was done with a  violation of the mass media law: a foreign subject acted as the  publication's founder.    Gryzunov also said that he started receiving telephone  threats from the so-called Russian patriots.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOROUGHBRED RACING;  </P> <P> TRAINER FACING ACCUSATIONS AFTER DECEMBER RAID  </P> <P> Trainer Bruce Headley is facing an accusation by the California Horse Racing  Board that syringes and an unauthorized medication were found in his Santa  Anita barn during a multi-agency raid last Dec. 11.  </P> <P> Headley also faces misdemeanor charges in Santa Anita Municipal Court for the  possession of 13 fighting cocks discovered in the same raid, which was  conducted by the Arcadia Police Dept., agents of the State Humane Assn. and  CHRB investigators.  </P> <P> After five pre-trial postponements requested by defense attorneys, Headley has  a court hearing scheduled today in Monrovia on the misdemeanor counts. It is  unclear, however, why the CHRB has waited nine months to take action on the  alleged discovery of syringes and unauthorized medication, which was said to be  Filybol, an anabolic steroid not known for use in racehorses.  </P> <P> Unless given permission from the board of stewards -- as in the case of a  diabetic requiring insulin shots -- no one other than a licensed veterinarian  is permitted to possess a syringe in a California race track stable area.  </P> <P> CHRB Executive Secretary Dennis Hutcheson, who assumed his post in August, said  he expedited the accusation as soon as the full facts of the case came to his  attention.  </P> <P> "It's possible that my predecessor (Leonard Foote) was waiting for the case to  be completed in the courts before bringing a CHRB action against Mr. Headley,"  Hutcheson said. "I wanted to deal with it as soon as possible."  </P> <P> Headley, one of the best-known trainers on the California circuit, claims no  knowledge of the birds or the items listed in the CHRB accusation.  </P> <P> "I didn't buy them, I don't own them, I know nothing about them," Headley said.  "Unfortunately, though, the trainer-insurer rule holds me responsible for  anything found in my barn. It's just a shame that something like this comes  along when I've had such a clean record."  </P> <P> Headley has had no significant rulings against him in 31 years as a trainer,  during which time he has handled such major stakes winners as Variety Road,  Johnica, Stylish Winner and Silveyville while training for such respected  clients as Kjell Qvale, Buddy Johnston and John Mabee. Files of the Assn. of  Racing Commissioners International show Headley with only one minor medication  violation, occuring in 1982.  </P> <P> "If anything, Headley goes to the other extreme when it comes to medicating his  horses," a local track veterinarian said. "He's always been very reluctant to  even use much Bute."  </P> <P> Hutcheson said the case would be presented before an administrative law judge,  and that a hearing date would be set soon. Penalties for such violations  usually carry some kind of suspension or, in extreme cases, revocation of  license.  </P> <P> Attorney Robert Forgnone will represent Headley in the racing board case.  </P> <P> "I'm still investigating the statements made in the accusations," Forgnone  said. "However, Bruce has assured me that he is innocent of any of the charges  in the accusation. I trust that we'll be able to establish evidence to support  his position."  </P> <P> Thad Ackel is giving Great Communicator another chance to prove he still  belongs in major league racing.  </P> <P> Ackel, trainer and part owner of the 1988 Breeders' Cup Turf hero, has shipped  the gelding to Shreveport, La., for Saturday's $200,000 Louisiana Downs  Handicap at 1 3/8 miles on the turf.  </P> <P> Ackel has given the mount to Chris McCarron, who replaces Ray Sibille, Great  Communicator's jockey in his last 23 starts. Their last winning collaboration  came in the Hollywood Turf Handicap in May 1989.  </P> <P> "I've been loyal to Ray for a long time, but it was time for a change," Ackel  said from Louisiana. "I just hope Chris rides him with a lot of faith and  doesn't pay too much attention to his recent past performance lines. He's  hitting the ground sound all the way around, his coat looks magnificent and  he's working better than I ever remember."  </P> <P> Great Communicator, 7, is North America's leading active money-winner with a  bankroll of more than $2.8 million. However, he has lost all three of his 1990  starts without displaying a trace of the fight that characterized his  victories. In his most recent outing, the Del Mar Handicap on Labor Day, he  finished last in the field of 12.  </P> <P> "He tore off a front shoe in that race," Ackel said. "I'm sure that's when he  lost his rhythm. Of course, I didn't know it until afterwards. When I saw him  coming through the stretch, I thought, 'Uh-oh, he's hurt himself again.'  </P> <P> "As far as I'm concerned, school's not out yet on the old boy. I spent $6,000  to ship him here because I think he's still got a winning race in him."  </P> <P> Eddie Delahoussaye will be in New Jersey tonight to ride Silver Ending in the  $300,000 Pegasus Handicap at the Meadowlands. Saturday, he will ride Gorgeous  in the $200,000 Ruffian Handicap at Belmont Park, and Sunday he will be at  Louisiana Downs to ride Cee's Tizzy in the $1-million Super Derby.  </P> <P> "They're gonna have to catch me to beat me," Delahoussaye said of Cee's Tizzy,  the precocious son of Relaunch who turned in two near track-record performances  during the Del Mar meeting.  </P> <P> "There may be people who say he can't go the mile and a quarter, but he doesn't  know that."  </P> <P> McCarron also will have a high profile in Louisiana this weekend. In addition  to riding Great Communicator in the Louisiana Downs Handicap, he has the mounts  on Haskell Handicap winner Restless Con in the Super Derby, Nikishka in the  $200,000 River Cities Handicap Saturday and Fit to Scout in the $125,000 Marie  DeBartolo Oaks Sunday.  </P> <P> Del Mar Oaks winner Slew of Pearls, Native Twine and Nijinsky's Lover will  challenge Fit to Scout, and defending champion Pleasant Variety and Escondido  Handicap winner Rial are among those facing Great Communicator.  </P> <P> The California Horse Racing Board could have a ruling on the Del Mar Derby  appeal next week.  </P> <P> After listening to testimony on the disqualification of victorious Tight Spot  for interference in the Aug. 19 race, hearing officer Steve Schwartz submitted  his proposed decision on Sept. 11.  </P> <P> The seven commissioners can vote to accept or reject his recommendation or  remand it for further hearing. In the meantime, the $300,000 purse has not been  paid.  </P> <P> Trainer Eddie Gregson reports that Sunset Handicap winner Petite Ile has  recovered from an irritated shin and is nearly ready for her first workout  after losing a month of training.  </P> <P> "There's still a chance she could make it for the Yellow Ribbon," Gregson said.  The $400,000 Yellow Ribbon, Nov. 4 at Santa Anita, could end up an Eclipse  Award showdown between Petite Ile and Reluctant Guest, winner of the recent  Beverly D. Stakes in Chicago.  </P> <P> Strub Stakes winner Flying Continental will be shipped to New York for the  $750,000 Jockey Club Gold Cup on Oct. 6, according to trainer Jay Robbins.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Seventh installment of the "basic contents" of the Hanoi </F> 20- 25 January Mid-Term Party National Conference Resolution]    [Text] What were the policies and measures put forth by  the conference to continue building the law-governing Vietnamese  state?    -- Practising socialist democracy and strongly developing  the people's collective mastery are the most important tasks and  the fine characteristics of our state. To develop democracy, we  must satisfactorily carry out the following: Protect human  rights and other basic civil rights already inscribed in the  constitution; scrupulously consider and resolve complaints and  denunciations by the people; make arrangements for the people to  participate in public affairs; contribute views to the  formulation of party policies and important government bills,  and improve electoral activities. To effectively achieve this,  party organizations must firmly grasp the party's conceptions  and policies, evaluate the actual situation, and devise plans  and measures to get every job done. In practicing socialist  democracy, we must resolve to fight bureaucracy, officialism,  corruption, wasteful spending, and the abuse of privilege. We  must fight manifestations of extreme democracy and adopt  dictatorial measures against elements committing acts of  betrayal against the fatherland, undermining national security,  and violating the people's interest.    -- We must step up and improve the quality of legislative  work, build a uniform and consistent legal system, and  institutionalize party lines in all areas of the social life.    -- We must intensify our didactical dissemination of laws,  improve the people's knowledge of and their sense of respect for  the law, ensuring that the law is complied with scrupulously,  uniformly, and fairly.    -- We must continue to streamline and renovate the state  working apparatus, ensure a unified authority and clear-cut work  distribution, and develop the effect of the three rights  [quyeenf] -- legislative, executive, and judicial. We must act  in accordance with the principles of democratic centralism. The  political report puts forth the orientations for improving the  working quality of the National Assembly, undertaking  administrative reform, continuing to strengthen the judicial  system organizationally and renovating its activities to develop  the efficiency of the state working aparatus.    8. We must renovate and rectify the party, broaden the  all-people great unity bloc, and consolidate the close  relationship between the party and the people.    As initial efforts to review various aspects of  party-building work have just been undertaken, there are issues  which we must continue to study and review with more depth if we  are to draw on correct experiences. The political report raises  the following main points in party building:    a. "We must strengthen political and ideological work and  ensure the political and ideological unanimity of the entire  party. We must keep party cadres and members constantly aware of  the party's conceptions and policies, improve their knowledge,  and help them remain firm on the path toward socialism. We must  creatively apply and develop Marxism-Leninism, Ho Chi Minh  thought, and all the intellectual quintessences of our time,  sensitively take hold of new things and correctly handle  everything arising from reality."    Intensifying political and ideological activities is an  urgent and fundamental duty arising from our party's leadership  requirements in the present stage. It is important that the  party must raise its knowledge to the level required of it by  its tasks if it is to lead our national revolution to develop  its advantges, seize opportunities, overcome all dangers, and  surmout all ordeals. Because of the disintegration of the  socialist system in the Soviet Union, confidence in the  socialist path has somewhat wavered among certain segments of  party cadres and members. Worse, certain people have opted for  another path. They have propagated their erroneous conceptions  that are at variance with party lines. We must intensify  political theory indoctrination to consolidate the revolutionary  stance of our party cadres and members, and attempt to "iron out  erroneous viewpoints, illusionary conceptions, and idelogical  vacillations. We must struggle against manifestations of  opportunism, rightism, dogmatism, and conservatism. Party  cadres and members must scrupulously comply with all party  resolutions and directives and the state law and must not abuse  democractic liberties to propagate view that are contrary to  party lines."    "Party members, especially party cadres at various levels,  must constantly steel their revolutionary qualities and ethics,  and study harder to improve their knowledge."    b. "We must strengthen the unity and unanimity within the  party and must adopt organizational principles for party  activities, especially the principles of democratic centralism,  collective leadership, and individual responsibility. We must  steel our revolutionary ethics and build for ourselves a  wholesome lifestyle against wasteful spending, corruption, and  illegal dealings. We must guard against individualism,  indiscipline, arbitrariness, despotism, departmentalism, and  nepotism. We must attach importance to the safeguarding of the  party and must maintain internal and national secrecy. We must  guard against all the schemes and tricks aimed at causing cadres  to deviate ideologically. We must increase our control over the  implementation of the party's lines, policies, and regulations."</p>

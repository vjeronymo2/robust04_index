			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOCIAL SECURITY: WHOSE BURDEN?;  </P> <P> HENS MAKE OUT, HOGS GET SLAUGHTERED;  </P> <P> THIS TAX IS LIKE A HAM-AND-EGG SANDWICH. IT LOOKS LIKE EQUAL CONTRIBUTIONS, BUT  THE CHICKEN WALKS OFF AND THE PIG LOSES A LEG.  </P> <P> Among other things, America was founded on the idea of fair taxes. At the  Boston Tea Party, we fought a revolution against a system of unjust taxation.  </P> <P> A fair tax is based on the ability to pay. But the current tax system is  backward and irrational, filled with illusions and tricks for the unwary.  Today, as our tax system's most perceptive critic, multimillionaire Leona  Helmsley, told her former housekeeper: "Only the little people pay taxes."  </P> <P> This year, Congress faces a crucial test. By passing President Bush's plan to  cut taxes for those who have capital and are already making gains, it could  return to the dried-up wells of trickle-down economics. This would be a major  mistake for the American people.  </P> <P> Alternatively, Congress can move forward to a fair tax policy for all Americans  by passing Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's proposal to roll back Social Security  taxes. This plan would reduce the tax burden on 110 million working Americans  by $55 billion next year and begin to restore fairness to our tax system.  </P> <P> A high Social Security payroll tax is especially unfair because it taxes all  employees, whether they are earning $10,000 or $1 million a year, at the same  flat rate, now set at 7.65%.  </P> <P> This George Bush approach is what I call ham-and-egg economics. It looks as if  everybody, the hens and the hogs, are contributing equally to make the  sandwich. The ham and the eggs, after all, are both between two slices of the  same bread. The smell is blended and they are jointly advertised.  </P> <P> But the hens and the hogs are really giving up very different things. While the  hen lays an egg and keeps on squawking, the hog gives up a leg and then stops  walking. One drop for the hen, a total sacrifice for the hog.  </P> <P> With the Republican ham-and-eggs payroll tax, the hens are making out like  bandits while the hogs are getting slaughtered. The unfairness and backwardness  of the flat tax is made even worse by the fact that the tax is imposed only on  the first $51,300 of wages. This means that someone earning $51,300 a year and  someone earning $10 million a year each pay $3,924.  </P> <P> Moynihan's bill is responding to the fact that the revenues from the federal  payroll tax, which are supposed to be dedicated to the Social Security trust  funds, are in fact being used to pay the general expenses of government.  </P> <P> To correct the misuse of the payroll tax, Moynihan proposes that Congress  repeal the recent rate increase and then cut the rate effective Jan. 1, 1991,  to 5.1% (6.5% including Medicare). This plan would preserve the integrity of  the Social Security system and place it back on the pay-as-you-go basis under  which it operated for decades before 1983.  </P> <P> This proposal is fiscally sound and morally right. It is neither sensible nor  just to steal from Social Security, which is the solemn promise of one  generation to the next, to pay for government services or military technology  that we do not have the will to pay for honestly or the courage to do without.  The working people of America should not be giving up their hard-earned wages  to pay for the government's own fiscal irresponsibility.  </P> <P> And yet, we cannot stop there. If the Moynihan proposal goes through, we will  have to make up the difference between government revenues and expenditures  that the Social Security surplus has been used to hide. The Reagan and Bush  Administrations have used the trust fund surpluses to mask the true size of the  federal deficit. In 1989, for example, President Bush said that the deficit was  $152 billion but, without all of the Social Security reserves, it was really a  staggering $248 billion. Cutting the capital gains tax now for fewer than 10  million Americans who already have capital, as President Bush proposes, would  simply swell the deficit and compound the present irresponsibility.  </P> <P> To bring the deficit down, we need to preserve only necessary military spending  and require wealthy Americans and corporations to pay their fair share of  taxes. In the 1980s, the Reagan-Bush Administration cut taxes on the wealthy  and raised taxes on working- and middle-class families by systematically  shifting the tax burden. This was a fraud on the majority of the American  people. As Moynihan recently observed, "The United States almost certainly now  has the most regressive tax structure of any Western nation."  </P> <P> But there are ways to close the gap. We can restore the 1987 income tax rate on  the top 600,000 taxpayers to 38.5%. We can impose luxury taxes and a securities  transfer excise tax. We can tax corporate polluters, limit the business meals  deduction to 50% and close other corporate loopholes. If we combine sensible  tax measures like these with at least a freeze in real military spending, we  can stop the destructive cycle of deficit spending.  </P> <P> We need a new democratic direction for our fiscal policy, and Moynihan's  proposal is a step in the right direction. Congress should decide to take a  stand with the working people of America and put and end to ham-and-egg  economics.  </P></p>

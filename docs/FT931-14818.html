			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: BOC sounds warning over UK economy BOC, the industrial gases group, yesterday warned the UK economy was 'dead in the water'. Growth would be very low during the year, the group believed. Sales of the group's gases are a sensitive barometer of industrial activity. Speaking to shareholders at the annual meeting, Mr Patrick Rich, chairman and chief executive, added that it was too early to assess the impact of the change in economic policy following the devaluation of sterling last September. The group's first quarter would be reasonably strong compared with last year, but he warned continued improvement would be dependent upon currencies and recovery of the world economy. Mr Rich said the weakness of sterling - which helps the group through translation benefits - and continued cost containment would enable the group to continue to sustain its results.</p>

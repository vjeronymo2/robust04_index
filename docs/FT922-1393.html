			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Indonesian project helps Philip Harris to Pounds 1.76m PHILIP HARRIS, the pharmaceutical and scientific equipment supplier, yesterday reported a sharp increase in profits helped by a turnkey project in Indonesia. The company also announced it is paying Pounds 1.64m for nine retail chemists in Oxfordshire. The move will improve its pharmaceuticals distribution network, but Harris has no plans to become a big retail operator, according to Mr David Newcombe, chief executive. Pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 871,000 to Pounds 1.76m in the year to March 31. Turnover increased 17.5 per cent to Pounds 79.1m (Pounds 67.3m). The Indonesian contract, for the supply of scientific equipment, added about Pounds 6.5m to turnover. The company would not give an indication of the contract's profitability. Earnings per share increased to 14.58p (10.03p). The company is recommending a final dividend of 4.25p (3.75p) to make a total of 6.25p (5.75p), an increase of 8.7 per cent. Harris is buying Proctor's pharmacies and HM Brooks, which operate nine pharmacies in and around Oxford. This brings to 15 the number of retail of retail outlets owned by Harris. Harris is issuing Pounds 1.29m of three year, guaranteed loan notes and will pay the balance of Pounds 350,000 in cash. Following the purchase, Harris's debt will rise to Pounds 4.6m with gearing increasing from 28 per cent to 48 per cent.</p>

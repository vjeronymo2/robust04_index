Khamidov, Biochemistry Institute of the Uzbek Republic  Academy of Sciences, Tashkent; UDC 577.112.5.087]    [Abstract] The issue of comparing homologic protein  molecules in order to construct a philogenetic tree and the  shortcomings of the methods used for this purpose are outlined,  and known attempts to define and measure the distances for each  pair of amino acid sequences of the proteins under study are  reviewed. The outcome of computer methods of comparing the  proteins under study on the basis of the pairwise distance are  used to classify proteins by their main function, identify new  proteins, and reconstruct the evolutionary history of the  proteins under comparison in the form of philogenetic trees  using any existing algorithm. For illustration, sea anemone  toxins are compared to other toxins separated from the snake  venom and equine, duck, rat, and human proinsulins. Based on the  maximum total scores, Radianthus macrodactylus toxins  are closest to long neurotoxins whose classification scoring  points are analyzed on the basis of the pattern recognition  theory. Pair Euclidean distances for 22 proteins from four  groups, the concentration of informative amino acid residues and  classification scores for snake toxins, and a comparison of  Radianthus macrodactylus toxins RTX-I and RTX-V to  snake neurotoxins and cytotoxins are summarized in a tabular  form. The sample of ten A2 phospholipases is divided into two  groups according to the organisms they represent using the newly  introduced distance. An original application software package  developed by the authors for comparing the proteins by their  amino acid composition is described. It is available for  purchase from the developers.

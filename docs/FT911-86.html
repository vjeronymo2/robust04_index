			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Paper to NatWest board was rewritten, jury is told A PAPER on County NatWest's handling of the parcels of Blue Arrow shares taken by advisers to the September 1987 rights issue was rewritten within the parent bank to make it 'softer and vaguer' before being presented to the NatWest board, the Blue Arrow trial heard yesterday. The purpose of the re-drafting was to put the paper into a form that could be considered by the board, which included non-executive directors, Mr Leslie Collett, former secretary to the County chairman's committee, agreed with Mr Alun Jones QC. Changes made while the paper was in the office of Mr Thomas Frost, the NatWest group chief executive, had the effect of making the problems facing County after the stock market crash seem much less urgent, Mr Jones, for Mr Stephen Clark, a County director, said. Mr Collett agreed with him that the changes had made the paper softer and vaguer, and made it appear that the discussions over the future of the holdings were not too far advanced. Although the paper finally presented to the NatWest board on December 8 was signed by Mr Jonathan Cohen, the former County chief executive, it had been very carefully rewritten 'at the behest' of people at NatWest, including Mr Frost and Mr Terence Green, the former NWB deputy chief executive, he agreed. Between November 23, when a number of County executives met to discuss the holding, and December 8 1987, a strategic planning department within the parent bank was involved in the redrafting of the paper, he said. Mr Collett also agreed that the legal advice given at the meeting on November 23 by Mr Alan Keat, a defendant, and Mr Nigel Campion-Smith, solicitors from Travers Smith Braithwaite, was that no immediate disclosure of the holdings was necessary. He was questioned later by Mr Anthony Hooper QC, for Mr David Reed, a former County director, over the legal advice given by Mr Campion-Smith at a meeting held on September 23, before the issue closed, at which County's possible buying of shares was discussed. 'Mr Campion-Smith didn't say 'Watch it, that is a conspiracy to defraud if you do what we have discussed'?' Mr Hooper asked. Mr Collett replied: 'I don't think he said anything akin to it at all.' County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities and seven individuals, including Mr Clark, Mr Cohen, Mr Keat and Mr Reed, deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the outcome of the Pounds 837m issue. The trial continues today.</p>

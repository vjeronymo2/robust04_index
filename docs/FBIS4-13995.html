			<p>BFN     [Text] India intends to restore preferential tariff margin  on Sri Lankan clothes. The two-day meeting of the Indo-Sri  Lankan Joint Commission held in New Delhi was told that this  will be done as early as possible. An External Affairs Ministry  press release said that both the countries decided to hold  intergovernmental meetings on expansion of bilateral trade, as  also the Sri Lankan request for increased market access for some  of its products. Sri Lanka appreciated India's decision to  extend a new line of credit to implement infrastructural  development projects in that country. The two countries agreed  in principle to collaborate in setting up an institute of  technology and management in Sri Lanka.</p>

ITV's documentary series Murder Squad (9.00) is concerned with an explosion at a hairdresser in London's New Cross. That is followed by the first episode in a new batch of That's Love (9.30) a rather superior comedy starring Jimmy Mulville and Diana Hardcastle as a middle class couple dealing with the vicissitudes of marriage in the 90s. Today Tony Slattery appears for the first time, playing a marriage guidance counsellor. Viewpoint 92 tells the story of journalist Geoffrey Lean who went into hospital for a minor operation last year and woke three weeks later paralysed and unable to speak.

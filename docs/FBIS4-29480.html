			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Thailand yesterday said it would follow the UN  decision on proposed sanctions against North Korea but made  clear its preference for a negotiated solution to Pyongyang's  refusal to allow nuclear inspections.    "Thailand will follow the United Nations resolution,"  Foreign  Minister Prasong Sunsiri said. "But we hope that the situation  will be resolved through negotiations." [passage omitted]    Foreign Minister Prasong confirmed that Thailand's  ambassador  to the UN in New York, Nit Phibunsongkhram, was in consultation  with counterparts from other ASEAN states on the matter.    Thailand and ASEAN partners always follow the UN Security  Council resolutions, a Bangkok-based Asian diplomat said.    But ASEAN member states "are not for the confrontational  style of Western countries," the source added.    "Maybe we should give quiet diplomacy a chance. Methods of  the West may not always be the best," the source said    Because of China's position, the UN Security Council is  likely to find it more difficult than usual to forge a  resolution on North Korea, the source added.</p>

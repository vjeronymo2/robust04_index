			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava June 7 (CTK) -- The Slovak parliament  today passed an amendment to the Election Law with 69 deputies  of those present voting for the law, 51 deputies against it and  2 deputies abstaining from the vote. The amendment does not  change the basic provisions of the federal Election Law which  has thus far been valid in Slovakia. For example, it preserves  the requirement of 5 percent public support for a party and 7  percent for a coalition to enter parliament.    The government coalition prevented the inclusion of a  provision into the amendment according to which parties' lists  of candidates should be sent to voters three days before  elections as this would create the danger of manipulation.  Parties' slates will be available at election rooms and only  information about candidates will be sent to voters.    The amended Election Law was passed in something of a hurry  as can be seen from the fact that an hour's break was taken  before the final vote during which the parliament leadership  looked for ways to replace "Czechoslovak Republic" into "Slovak  Republic" in the law. The amendment does not allow election  campaigning on commercial radio stations.    Deputy Pavel Hrusovsky from the Christian Democratic  Movement  (KDH) said that the amended law did not give an unambiguous  answer to whether a Slovak citizen living abroad can vote in  Slovakia. The contradiction between the provision which allows  voting only by citizens with permanent residence in the Slovak  Republic and that which allows voting by citizens without  permanent residence in Slovakia will apparently be solved only  by the Interior Ministry or an election commission.    "Slovak citizens with permanent residence in the Czech  Republic could be stripped of their active voting rights,"  Hrusovsky told CTK. However, other deputies believe that it  will be enough for a Slovak citizen living in the Czech Republic  just to come to Slovakia during the election to be able to vote.    The amendment sets down that parties that receive at least 3  percent of voters support will get from the state 60 crowns for  each voter instead of the initial 15 crowns.</p>

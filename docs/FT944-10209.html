			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Sales expansion buoys Oxford Instruments Strong sales growth and further margin improvement helped Oxford Instruments, the advanced instrumentation group, report a 54 per cent increase in interim profits. The pre-tax figure rose from Pounds 5.07m to Pounds 7.81m during the six months to September 25 on turnover up 13 per cent at Pounds 55.1m (Pounds 48.6m). Sales in Japan, where the group set up marketing operations in July 1991 and now employs 35 people, grew strongly and accounted for 10 per cent of the first-half total, against 6 per cent last time. Earnings per share increased to 10.4p (6.6p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 1.7p (1.5p). The shares rose 20p to 329p. Mr Peter Williams, chairman, said the outcome reflected 'a continuation of the steady improvement in trading conditions in most of our markets. New orders have increased consistently over the last 18 months suggesting that a soundly based recovery may be in prospect.' Operating profits in the seasonally weaker first half more than doubled to Pounds 4.02m (Pounds 1.9m) as margins expanded from 4 per cent to 7.3 per cent. Mr Williams noted that the analytical systems businesses were now making a material contribution alongside continuing strong performances from operations in its core technology of superconductivity - Research Instruments, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Instruments and Superconducting Technology. 'In the second half we expect this trend to continue,' he said, 'and in the operations most affected by recession - Plasm Technology and Medical Systems - there are also encouraging signs of recovery'. Income from the 49 per cent stake in Oxford Magnetic Technology, the magnetic resonance imaging joint venture with Siemens, increased to Pounds 3.43m (Pounds 2.81m). Despite funding additional working capital requirements, the group ended the period with net cash of Pounds 14.3m, compared with Pounds 7.85m at March.</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Redundancy for head of Lloyd's agency Mr Terry Hayday is parting company with Sturge Holdings after three years as chief executive of the Lloyd's agency's insurance operations. Mr Hayday's departure follows the appointment of Lord David Poole as group chief executive early last month, and the decision of Mr David Coleridge, the chairman and former chairman of the Lloyd's market, to retire next February. 'Both the company and Mr Hayday have agreed that it is in their mutual best interests if Mr Hayday left the group,' the company said. 'He has accordingly accepted that he is made redundant effective from 16 September 1994, on which date he will resign all his directorships with the group.' Mr Hayday originally became a director at Sturge when his own underwriting agency was taken over by the larger group in 1990. His tenure in office has coincided with a difficult period for Sturge, with the capacity managed by its underwriting agency falling from over Pounds 1bn to some Pounds 660m after losses at a number of syndicates. Sturge, under Mr Coleridge's direction, grew rapidly in the late 1980s. But it closed eight of its 22 syndicates early last year, including two - 206 and 210 - which had generally been regarded as 'flagships' in the market. The closures and dismissal of 40 staff were part of a rationalisation geared to improve efficiency.</p>

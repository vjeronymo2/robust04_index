We are  especially pleased by President Clinton's strong support for the  withdrawal of Russian troops in early 1994. Meeting its  international commitment to do so is, in my opinion, the best  way to demonstrate Russia's sincerity in respecting Estonia's  sovereignty and independence. After all, what country can be  called sovereign and independent if foreign troops continue to  be based on the territory against its will. On the issue of  human rights, another topic to come up in the meetings between  the two Presidents, Estonia is pleased to agree with the  findings of the United States Department of State in its report  of January 1993 as well as of the CSCE Commission of the United  States Congress in its exhaustive study of the issue published  in September 1993. Those reports found, along with over a dozen  other international organizations, that Estonia belongs to that  group of free nations where human rights are not violated.    I quite agree with the comments by President Yeltsin that  double standards should not be applied to the question of human  rights. We of course know that Russia has used human rights as  a political tool. President Yeltsin's comments are clearly an  attempt to sway international public opinion against Estonia  and, as such, have nothing to do with the actual situation of  Russians living in Estonia.</p>

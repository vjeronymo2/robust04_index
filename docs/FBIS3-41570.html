Suwan Ngamsutthi, the chief of Ayutthaya's public health and  environment office, told THE NATION that water from the Chao  Phya River in Ayutthaya province was almost unusable.    The bio-oxygen demand (BOD) level, which measures oxygen  depletion, of the river in Ayutthaya was currently three.    If the BOD reached level four the water became unusable.    He said the main source of pollution was waste water  draining  from communities.    All factories were required to have a waste treatment  systems, and officials from the Department of Industry checked  to ensure that industrial waste did not drain into rivers or  canals.    Communities were much more difficult to control, Suwan said.    He said residents had complained that the NMB [expansion  unknown] company was draining its waste water into the Chao Phya  River.    However, checks showed that the company's discharge was  within safety limits.    His office had suggested that NMB recycle its treated waste  water through washrooms before discharging it, and the company  had complied.    There were 11 water testing laboratories in Ayutthaya and  BOD  levels in the province were tested every three months. In  previous years the BOD levels in Ayutthaya had never been higher  than two.    This year the pollution level during the crisis months --  February, March and April -- had peaked at five.    At this time the river was fit only for transportation.    Suwan said his office had to carefully manage the water  quality of the Chao Phya, because from Ayutthaya it flowed to  Bangkok and would worsen the problems in the capital if it was  already badly polluted.    For this reason, the Ayutthaya province had launched a  public  relations campaign urging people to understand the problem of  water quality.    Pathum Thani Governor Sirat Harirak also blamed the poor  condition of the Chao Phya river on urban drainage.    Srirat said it was not practical for each house to install a  treatment system, because of the cost and size of a plant.  Instead, communities should install large treatment plants to  handle urban and village waste.    Pathum Thani province had this year begun building community  water treatment systems in Kukot and Prachathipat municipality  and Klong Luang.    Once the provincial government building plans were  completed,  the problem of water quality in his province would be resolved.    Thepphanom Muangmaen, a specialist in environment at Mahidon  University told THE NATION that water treatment would certainly  improve water quality, but officials must also be honest in  evaluating the plants' efficiency.    Wichan Wongwiwat, the director of the public health  engineering division and the Public Work Department's office of  water treatment, said the condition of water in southern section  of the Chao Phya was very poor, especially in the dry season.    He warned that the pollution could extend up the river to  the  northern section unless something was done about it.    Wicham said even sea water was showing signs of pollution.    Bacterial and heavy metal pollution along the eastern coast,  the upper south eastern coast and the western coast of Phuket  was higher than normal.    Wichan said the Public Works Department had been studying  the  problem of waste water disposal in big cities, such as Chiang  Mai, since 1981.    The department was building water supply, drainage and  treatment systems and garbage disposal systems in 41 areas.    These projects would be extended to 40 more areas next year.    Dr. Nattha Hingsanarumon, a lecturer of the Thammasat  University's Faculty of Science and Technology, said water  treatment systems would effectively lower pollution from urban  sources, but they must be built in a suitable site.    Water treatment plants should also be built in agricultural  areas.</p>

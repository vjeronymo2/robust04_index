			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Business Travel (Update): Courtesy on roads Teams of youngsters positioned themselves at road junctions around Belgium on Saturday, urging drivers to apologise to fellow road users instead of blasting their horns. It was part of a national 'courteous driving day'. The campaign, sponsored by an insurance company, aims to reduce noise generated by irate drivers, and to tackle one of western Europe's highest road-accident fatality rates. New statistics show an annual death rate from road accidents of 45 people per 100,000 vehicles in Belgium. Within the European Union, only Portugal, Greece and Ireland have worse rates.</p>

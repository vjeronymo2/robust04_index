			<p>BFN     [Text] In the course of the discussion on the draft  Agreement on public accord held by the State Duma several  factions spoke against its signing.    In particular, leader of Russia's Agrarian Party Mikhail  Lapshin called it unacceptable. As he said, according to  Agrarians, the draft Agreement "goes astray from the  Constitution" because it negates the opportunities to introduce  changes into the Basic Law, contained in it, and the  opportunities for holding early elections. Lapshin compared the  agreement with "a tough bridle" for political parties. He also  qualified the present situation with peasants in Russia, their  "humiliation and oppression" as unacceptable for a civilized  society.    On behalf of the Yabloko faction Vyacheslav Shestakovskiy,  co- chairman of Russia's republican party, expressed doubt with  respect to "the expediency of signing these documents which  cannot really lead to any accord." In his opinion, the proposed  agreement is a means "to divert the Duma and the government from  the real politics and real reforms." At the same time  Shestakovskiy underlined that his faction is not against accord  and is ready to start a search for it "in practical deeds and  parliamentary work."    Representative of Russia's Democratic Party faction Aleksey  Leushkin pointed out that his position with respect to the  agreement would be determined after the national congress of the  Democratic Party of Russia scheduled for Saturday. However, as  he said, this document has the aim "to drive everyone into a  trap," because the president and the government "who can do  nothing to draw the country out of the crisis intend to place  the responsibility for this on other people."    Some time earlier leaders of the Communist Party and Russian  Pan- National Union Gennadiy Zyuganov and Sergey Baburin were  very critical about this document; and chairman of the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia Vladimir Zhirinovskiy set forth a  provision that the party would support the agreement only in the  case that Andrey Kozyrev, Viktor Yerin, and Anatoliy Chubays  resign.    In the course of the debates leader of Russia's Choice bloc  Yegor Gaydar declared about his readiness to sign the proposed  draft agreement. In his estimate, the agreement says that the  public forces take the obligation to act in the framework of the  Constitution and the acting legislation and not to act in a way  inducive to violence and confrontation. At the same time Gaydar  noted that "we understand that there exist certain restrictions  when we want to reach accord with those who again want to  introduce rationing tickets, to create long lines, and to again  pull Russia into a Cold War."    Meanwhile, the presidential aide Georgiy Satarov believes  that the agreement "proposes mechanisms ensuring political  stability in society" and helps "to remove conflicts" in the  relations between the authorities and political forces at the  earliest stages.</p>

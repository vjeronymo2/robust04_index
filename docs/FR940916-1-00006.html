			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Agreement States <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The proposed amendment would apply to all NRC licensees. Agreement States must establish and maintain compatible regulations and programs. Although the radiation protection provisions in 10 CFR Part 20 are normally Division I matters of compatibility, this rulemaking defines minimum procedures needed to ensure health and safety. As such, an Agreement State should have the flexibility to keep the 12-month frequency or to impose an alternate frequency of examinations if considerations in their State warrant such an approach. The proposed rulemaking is therefore a Division II matter of compatibility. The proposed change was not provided to the Agreement States in advance of this notice because the change has nominal impact on materials licensees and because the change is a relaxation of the current regulatory requirement. However, this proposed rulemaking was discussed with representatives of Agreement States at the Organization of Agreement State Managers Workshop and Public Meeting on Rulemaking in Herndon, VA, on July 12, 1994. No comments or objections were offered by the States. Agreement States have the opportunity to comment on this proposed change during the public comment period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Description <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The provisions of 10 CFR Part 20.1703 (a)(3)(v) would be changed to require determination by a physician prior to initial fitting of respirators, and periodically thereafter, either every 12 months or at a frequency determined by a physician, that the individual user is medically fit to use the respiratory protection equipment. Frequency of reexamination is changed from ``at least every 12 months,'' to ``either every 12 months thereafter or periodically at a frequency determined by a physician,'' with guidance from ANSI on recommended frequencies provided in this statement of considerations. Guidance on the scope of the medical examinations is provided in ANSI Z88.6&hyph;1984.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Commission believes that these proposed changes will constitute a reduction of regulatory burden and an increase in flexibility for licensees, without any significant reduction in worker health or safety. The medical profession contributed significantly to development of the reduced frequencies recommended by ANSI and it is therefore expected that physicians performing examinations will be guided by the ANSI recommendations. ANSI recommended a frequency of reexamination based on age: every 5 years up to age 35; every 2 years up to age 45; and annually thereafter. A change in procedures or license conditions would likely be needed to implement a change in frequency of reexamination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The respiratory use medical examination is estimated to cost approximately $150 per examination. The number of examinations performed during an outage at a nuclear power plant is estimated to be 500. If 60 plants have outages each year, the current cost for annual medical examinations is at least $4,500,000. An examination of the demographics of the nuclear workforce (1/2 &lt;35 years; 1/3 >35 but &lt;45; 1/6 >45) suggests that the number of medical examinations could easily be halved thus saving $2.25 million each year just during maintenance or refueling outages at nuclear power plants. Clearly, considerable savings can be realized by this change freeing resources for more effective health and safety efforts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certain materials licensees such as fuel cycle facilities, some research facilities including broad scope academic licensees and some manufacturing groups also have respiratory protection programs. The impacts on these licensees are minimal because the number of respirator users is small. The proposed rule is expected to result in a reduction in costs due to a reduced frequency of medical reexamination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although some costs would be incurred by licensees in making revisions to procedures and license conditions, these costs would be offset by the increased flexibility and savings resulting from reduced reexamination frequency. Income to the medical profession would be reduced somewhat in those areas where significant respiratory programs are in place. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The NRC has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 51, that this rule, if adopted, would not be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and therefore, an environmental impact statement is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC has not prepared a separate draft environmental assessment. The following discussion in conjunction with the regulatory analysis which follows constitutes the assessment. Performing a medical examination to determine that a worker is medically fit to use respiratory protection equipment generates minimal waste, results in small recordkeeping burden, and has no other identifiable environmental impact. The effect of this rulemaking would be to allow a reduction in the frequency of such examinations, thus reducing any conceivable environmental impact even further.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Paperwork Reduction Act Statement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This proposed rule does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval number 3150&hyph;0014. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

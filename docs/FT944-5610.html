			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Rowlinson Securities up at Pounds 1.2m Pre-tax profits at Rowlinson Securities, the Cheshire-based property group, advanced from Pounds 1.11m to Pounds 1.21m in the six months to the end of September. The result was helped by increased profit on property sales of Pounds 228,000 (Pounds 41,000) and lower finance charges of Pounds 542,000 (Pounds 617,000). Gross rental income was unchanged at Pounds 1.87m and contracting almost doubled to Pounds 4.39m (Pounds 2.39m). However, the company said it had taken a prudent approach to the recognition of profits on unfinished contracts and operating profits were lower at Pounds 1.52m (Pounds 1.69m). Earnings were 4.27p (5.96p) and the interim dividend is raised to 0.31p (0.24p).</p>

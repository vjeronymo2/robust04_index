Small  industries develop the private sector, depend upon local  resources, and do not require specialized skills. The revival in  those industries satisfies the essential needs of society and  provides it with job opportunities.    There are successful examples of small industries in the  advanced and developing countries; indeed, the prominent role of  large-scale and giant industrial projects is the result of the  development in production equipment produced by the contemporary  scientific and technological revolution, and the accompanying  evolution in industrial methods and management. None of this has  affected the role played by small industries, which still help  to achieve industrial development in particular, and  comprehensive development in general, in most successful  experiences in the world.    The successful role of small industries in some industrially  advanced countries such as Japan and Korea had a noteworthy  effect on these countries' economic growth; in fact, attention  to these industries was the engine of comprehensive development  in the industrial sector.  <H5>  Small Industries and Technological Development </H5>   There are three major dimensions affecting the technological  development of small industries:    1. Small industries and intermeshed sectors.    The intermeshing of sectors in industry is achieved by  "reciprocal credit" relations between large and small industries  at the technological and technical aspect, this is, the main  level, including integration relations, most importantly  subcontracting.    2. Small industries and the question of industrial and  technological penetration, production equipment, which allow  small- and medium-sized industries to take part in achieving  this mission by the manufacture of electrical tools and  appliances in general, and machine tool industries.    3. Small technological industries suitable for  self-sufficient development. Small industries can be  incorporated into them through integrated science and technology  courses starting with technological research and development  (R&amp;D), including the primary and secondary industrial and  engineering planning process, and ending with the manufacture of  technological goods. The course would focus on innovation,  adaption, and development.    This can be illustrated by three basic concepts:    Subcontracting.    Machine Tool Industries.    The role of research, planning, and manufacturing.  <H5>  Subcontracting </H5>   Subcontracting consists of one company seeking out another  to  produce, at its expense, certain parts or components, or to do  assembly or partial assembly of some of these parts and  components, with the aim of incorporating them into a given  product to be sold by the primary contractor. This usually  occurs between large installations on one hand and small ones on  the other. This provides a high degree of specialization, based  on cooperation in production and investment decisions. From this  relationship, the parent installation can exercise a large  amount of control over its contractors through technical,  financial, marketing, and other links.    There are four types of subcontracting:    1. Contracting for the manufacture of components, with the  parent company concentrating on specializing in a limited number  of phases to produce a certain final product,  technology-intensive, with assembly, marketing, and after-sale  services, on research and development. This type of operating  industry is for minerals, equipment, and appliances.    2. Subcontracting for certain productive activities and  operations in their entirety. This occurs, for example, in the  cotton textiles industry, where large plants do the spinning,  with other plants paid to do the weaving; the textiles then go  to a specialized plant for printing the fabric.    3. Subcontracting for assembly operations, with small and  family projects taking on the assembly of a final product in a  labor-intensive and skill-intensive way. Examples would be the  electronics industry, with large plants specializing in the  production of high-technology components and intensive  scientific research, such as microchips and transistors, with  small plants assembling the final product.    4. Product subcontracting, with the subcontractor  manufacturing the entire product, with the role of the parent  company confined to marketing. This is closer to commercial  contracting, prevalent in many industries such as the  ready-to-wear apparel, shoes and leather goods, small motors,  and some electrical appliances. It is clear from these systems  that there is a principal base it rests on, which is the  division of industrial labor, with small plants specializing in  cheap labor-intensive activities and products, while large  plants provide the small ones with information, technical  assistance, and technological know-how, in addition to  financial, administrative, and marketing facilities.    Thus it is possible to link reciprocally industries of  diverse scale to participate in achieving a high degree of  integration, particularly through the technological and  production ties reflected by technical operations.  <H5>  Merits of the System </H5>   1. The supply of the goods necessary to complete a  productive  and technological course by providing production elements, with  the aim of producing an unfinished or final product, or  assembling it, with marketing opportunities, after the provision  of a funding opportunity and planning requirements, and perhaps  spare parts and applicances.    2. Raising the living standard by:    a. Providing additional job opportunities    b. Helping to improve competence at the economic level.    c. Producing lower-priced basic commodities.    d. Generating extra income.  <H5>  Small Industries in Japan </H5>   The Japanese experience with small industries has had a  crucial role in Japanese industrial development. Large plants  had an effect on small industries, providing them with  technological know-how, and the needed administrative and  material assistance. Hence opportunities to adhere to high  technological standards, quality control, and the assimilation  of primary technology transfer specifically in providing  research facilities, and the supplies and equipments themselves,  the reception of trained people, and sending out of the  technological leaders of the small projects. After the major  justifications for subcontracts had revolved around the benefits  of low wages and production costs, these justifications have  receded and been replaced by purely technical justifications:  the benefit from specialized equipment and skills of  subcontractors, and covering the gap in parent companies'  productive capacities. This has led to the technological  development of small industries to decrease costs and the  improvement of practical management methods such as quality  control and stock regulation.    In Japan, subcontracting has spread to the point where two  thirds of small- and medium-sized plants in conversion  industries consist of plants subcontracted by larger plants. The  total number of plants is estimated at 46,500, with 80 percent  of them in the ready-to-wear apparel and textile and tool  industry, with 49 percent of these subcontract plants using  mechatronic devices, and 36 using computers, and 15 percent  using robots.    Small industries have expanded in India, and strengthened  their links with large industries. India has made a great effort  towards an integrated policy to achieve this, with tax  exemptions for small projects and expanded credit with low  interest. The specific types of products are limited to small  projects and the encouragement of "positive buying" of tools and  equipment, help with raw materials, the offer of special sites  in industrial zones, and various administrative and consulting  aids; all this led to an increase in small industries. Therefore  the number of small projects rose from 60,000 in 1950 to more  than 1 million in 1983. The productivity of these factories rose  by five times between 1973 and 1983, the workforce doubled, and  exports rose six times.  <H5>  International Subcontracting </H5>   International subcontracting means an agreement between  plants located in the advanced, industrialized world, which are  the primary contractors, and plants located in the Third World,  which are the subcontracted firms, for the latter plants to  perform certain operations or activities for the first plant,  whether by manufacturing certain components or parts, assembling  a finished product, or producing a whole product with the  objective of marketing it in the parent company's country.    The reason for the spread of international subcontracting is  the benefit of the cost differential between the advanced  industrialized countries and the countries of the Third World;  in other words, benefit from cheap labor for the production of  "commodity items" for specialized consumption, usually in the  industrial world. This process relies upon an unequal formula  for the division of global industrial labor, with the plants of  the advanced capitalist world specializing in the more  technologically advanced industries and operations, with the  transferring out of the less advanced industries and  operations--the labor-intensive and energy-intensive ones. The  United States uses this method, and is followed by the countries  of Western Europe and Japan. Thus these three have developed  export-directed activities in some Third World countries:  starting with electronics (such as communications, radio tubes,  and controlling devices in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and  Mexico, as well as the manufacture of automobile components in  Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico, Thailand, and India).    In summation, this part of international subcontracting  leads  to an increased dependency on foreign countries,  technologically, financially, and commercially, with the  accompanying weakening of the ties between local economic  sectors.  <H5>  Machine Tools </H5>   This is based on tools or capital goods, chiefly electrical  and non-electrical tools. Machine tools fall into the subsector  of non-electrical tools, chiefly tools producing chemical goods,  machine tools, wood manufacturing tools, foodstuff preparation  tools, agricultural tools and engines, and building and  construction tools. The major industries necessary for these are  the iron and steel industry and the engineering industries,  including electrical and non-electrical tools. And so  subcontracting has spread in this industry, with the machine  tool industry divided into two broad sections, one of which is  metal parts tools and the other being metal shaping tools. Parts  tools accounted for 75 percent of global production of machine  tools, and according to the nature of the use, there are  multi-use tools, multi-purpose tools, universal machines, and  special-purpose machines.    It is clear that the first is used in several industries  such  as delivery equipment, heating and cooling equipment, and  others, while the second in basic, agricultural industries. For  example, if we wished to produce a certain tool or device, we  must manufacture parts by thermal treatment of iron, steel, and  other materials. The assembly of these parts follows. After the  manufacture of the parts by machine tools, the most important  parts of the manufacturing process, both in terms of  manufacturing steps or the workshop, forms the basis of a  mechanized society. No manufactured commodity comes out of the  foundry, turning, screening, metal working, and surface stamping  and coating processes. If you have mastered industrial  operations, you are able to produce whatever commodity you want.  <H5>  Research, Planning, and Industrialization Units </H5>   This is the third axis of development and the technological  development of small industries.    The core of manufacturing is industrial operations, and the  heart of industrial operations is the building of production  equipment, or the making of capital goods or equipment. The  joint equipment components are: motors, generators, energy,  control and measuring devices, metal and non-metal frameworks.  To do this, one must have a prior concept of each one, as an  integrated system, an automated system, capable of being  assimilated into the major system, which is the production line  in the factory. Is it feasible to manufacture without planning?  Is manufacturing activity possible without know-how? And so  planning is essential to conduct scientific research, whether  basic or applicative.  <H5>  The Importance of Small Industries to the Kingdom </H5>   This part of the study explains the role that small  industries play in the Kingdom, and which we summarize in the  following points:    1. The Saudi private sector enjoys great financial  resources,  exceeding current investment opportunities. The funds are  seeking new investment opportunities both at home and abroad.  Small industries represent an investment alternative for the  absorption of these funds, and can also provide job  opportunities for job seekers, especially for local technicians  who have sufficient experience in the field of traditional and  artisan industries which usually require semi-skilled workers,  such as the cloak, veil, and carpet industry. In addition, the  use of private funds toward the establishment of small  industries provides job opportunities for seekers of employment  independence, representing gradual progress toward  industrialization for the Kingdom.    2. Subcontracting is a widespread arrangement in the  Kingdom,  and, as is well-known, subcontracting happens when a plant moves  to support production or manufacture specific other parts, and  the plant uses them to produce a commodity and sell it. It is  widespread in the Kingdom; one of the most important  characteristics is the achievement of the best use of capital  and labor, by benefitting from foreign economies of scale. After  the establishment of small industries, the helper role of the  large industries are of the greatest importance to the Kingdom,  especially in the case of foreign investments. The lack of a  sector of auxiliary industries--in this case--leads foreign  investors to bring in contractors from abroad, and this trend  could weaken the integration among the various productive  sectors and lead to an increase in foreign workers. This outcome  is not in line with the Kingdom's development plans, whose  purpose is to boost the rate of "Saudization" and transfer  technology; the competitive capability of large industries'  products depends upon the sector being supplied with parts in  the needed variety and quality, produced by the small  industries. In the Kingdom, one may be acquainted with three  cases, in which the small industries--through subcontracting--to  play an auxiliary and integrative role for the large industries.    The first case: when the large industries face a lack of  specialized skills or abilities domestically for the production  of specific parts. Of course it will seek the help of small  industries in producing some of the parts.    The second case: a large organization may have the necessary  ability and skills to produce the needed parts. But  this--because of the wide disparity and and required  quantity--makes the production of them in-house "through the  organization" an economically unfeasible process, leading to the  use of small industries to perform the task.    The third case: the large industry may have a shortfall in  productive capacity as the result of an unexpected rise in  demand for its products. It will turn to small industries to  help meet the increased demand.    3. With the constant growth the Saudi economy has achieved,  which has led to a marked increase in individual income, we find  there is a change in the type of consumption among individuals  in society, towards products which have financial quality. This  change, of course, provided new investment opportunities that  small industries can exploit. It is not difficult to define or  identify a number of consumer goods that small industries can  manufacture and achieve an economic benefit, "reduced cost."    4. The small industries can set up in rural areas, where  there are raw materials, especially agricultural ones, such as:  the growing and packaging of dates, and storing vegetables. What  encourages this is the fact that the small industry profits do  not depend upon long-term production, meaning that they can  produce some seasonal commodities for local sale.    5. Small industries in the Kingdom play a significant role  in  procuring and adapting to technology in some specialized fields.  So international companies might be more prepared to transfer  technology to small-scale industrial companies, which do not  threaten their stake in regional markets, as would be the case  with large industries. The best example of this is what is  occurring in the electronics industries and personal accounts,  and the medical instruments industry.    6. There are a number of traditional and artisan industries  which are still widespread in the Kingdom, such as the  manufacture of cloaks, veils, and ceramics, whose production  requires uncomplicated methods which, to a large extent, suit  the capabilities and capacities of small sectors. Thus the best  way of preserving these industries is to see that small  industries produce them.    7. Small industries, because of the small scale of  investment  in them, may be owned by family members or local individuals, as  it preserves the extended family system, which is one of the  good traits of Saudi society, and becomes more important when we  realize that social values and cultural traditions are  priceless. They are a trait of personality, or national identity.    8. Self-sufficiency in some commodities is still low,  despite  the availability of production elements for most of these  commodities, thus providing investment opportunities for small  industries.    9. The performance level of the free economies influence, to  a large degree, global economic changes, and possibly small  industries--through the flexibility they enjoy--can resist the  fluctuations in economic conditions, adapting better to market  conditions, compared to large industries, with the expansion of  the small industry base in the Kingdom. This can gain the Saudi  economy the ability to withstand global economic upsets.  <H5>  The Problems of Small Industries </H5>   Despite the economic distinctions and characteristics and  the  role played by small industries in the economy of any country,  the severity and effect of these problems are greater and  harsher for small industries, compared to large ones. These  problems might result from the nature of small industries  themselves, or of the general environment in which the small  industries function. A glance at the small industries in the  Kingdom permits us to learn some of the most important problems  they face. We must note here that these problems are the outcome  of some field studies, the practical experiences of some  businessmen and personal interviews conducted by researchers  with some businessmen and chamber of commerce and industry  officials. Some of the major problems are:    1. The management of some small industries is centered in  one  person, the "owner-manager." He is responsible for management  and production, marketing and funding. While this person may be  qualified and brilliant in a position and branches of  management, he is usually lacking the technical skills for other  management positions, making his decisions prone to error at  times. These problems are not limited to the Kingdom alone; many  countries share them.    2. There are no defined programs for the development of the  small industries, but there are some efforts in the Kingdom to  seek to develop small industries and give them attention. These  efforts are exemplified in the Ministry of Industry's policy of  gathering small industries, by encouraging chambers of commerce  to prepare a program explaining the benefits from which small  industries may benefit, and the areas that are relevant, instead  of explaining the ways in which this industry must act; in  addition to that, many conferences have been held to explain the  role of the industries and small plants in development, and the  problems they face, without these actions leading to the  enactment of a specific program with goals and a method.    3. The policy of investment in the private sector--regulated  by the Investment Encouragement Statute of 1406H [Hijra]  [1986]--makes no distinction between small and large industries,  but is based on the offering of customs exemptions and financial  concessions for all industrial sectors, regardless of the size  of the industry. The result of this situation is that the  statute to encourage investment helps to draw investments into  large rather than small industries.    4. There is insufficient protection for the products of  small  "infant industries." This is due to the current Saudi ecnomic  philosophy of free competition, though the policy does not  necessarily negate the enactment of an appropriate level of  temporary protection for these industries by directing aid along  the lines of countries with free economies, such as the United  States, or Britain, which has specific programs aimed at  developing small industries.    5. Despite the fact that funding may not be a large obstacle  for Saudi investors in the industrial sector, the method for  obtaining it is surrounded by obstacles. The Industrial  Development Fund, for example, is a major source of funding for  the industrial sector. Some studies have shown that the Fund's  measures and the steady drop in loans offered was often forced  by the facilities various industries can obtain. In light of  small industries' limited financial capability, and the  guarantees they must provide, these industries are more  affected. In addition to that, the small industries have less  ability to wait very long to obtain lesser funding, compared to  large industries in 1409H [1989]. Turning to commercial banks,  their funding is usually limited to short-term funding--"working  capital." This bars small industries from the funding they need  for long-term investment. In addition, the guarantees that  commercial banks demand might exceed the small industry's  capabilities. And in addition to that, commercial  banks' interest rates may be high on one hand, and, on the  other, could cause small industry owners to hold off from  dealing with them for religious reasons.    6. Most small industries tend to be traditional in founding  their establishments, with diversification, and this could lead  to a focus on some areas rather than others, and without taking  into consideration the absorptive energy of the local and  regional market. This is the result of the absence of defined  industrial priorities in conformity with the industrialization  process, and of the newness of industrialization in Saudi  Arabia. Example: shops for metalsmithing, carpentry,  measurement, and decor.    7. Small industries lack a specialized national workforce in  development, innovation, and upgrading. If it existed, owners of  small industries would be slow to hire for several reasons,  chiefly the fact that the financial costs might not be in line  with scale of the plant. (1410H [1990])    8. The weak links between the various industries, due to the  trend, common until recently, of covering the consumer market  with finished products. This costs the small industries  investment opportunities linked to production and manufacturing  to meet the needs of the industrial market, especially in areas  where primary and intermediate materials are available--the  petrochemical industry, for example.    9. Many small industries function independently in  production, instead of integrating with large industries. This  situation could lead to their not benefitting from those  industries' available raw materials, failure to exploit their  whole productive capacity, the danger of new brands coming in,  increases in marketing and transport costs, and failure to  benefit from the expertise and abilities of large firms. This  situation could harm small industries by exposing them to  unequal competition, in terms of size. (1411H [1991])    10. Some have started to plan for small industries, on the  basis of using low-cost non-Saudi workers. This has resulted in  the majority of small industry employeess being foreign, which  is not in conformity with the goals of Saudization development  plans.  <H5>  Summary </H5>   The experience of developing and industrial countries  confirms the effective role played by small industries in this  field. The prominent role of large-scale or giant industrial  projects is the result of the development in production  equipment produced by the contemporary scientific and  technological revolution, and the accompanying matching  evolution in industrial methods and management. None of this has  affected the role played by small industries, which still help  to achieve industrial development in particular and  comprehensive development in general in most successful  experiences in the world.    Small industries have kept their clear and bright role in  the  experience of some advanced industrial countries such as Japan  and Korea. Attention to small industry is the core of  comprehensive development in the industrial sector, and  attention begins with a practical tendency with all support and  protection given to the parts and components industry, as these  are the manufacturing activities which naturally lend themselves  to the scale of small industries.

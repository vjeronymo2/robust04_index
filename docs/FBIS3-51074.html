			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Navy will install complementary artillery  systems in seven warships this year. It involves 10 guns that  were purchased in 1993. Two of these guns will be installed in  each of the three frigates of the Sea Force and the rest will be  installed in the four Navy minesweepers, one gun in each boat.    The frigates were manufactured in France, as were three  other  light patrol crafts manufactured in 1981 at Uruguay's request.  These patrol crafts have design problems and suffer constant  cracks in the rudder. A decision has thus been made to sell  them and the proceeds would be used to improve Navy salaries.    The Navy has four minesweepers from the former German  Democratic Republic's disbanded Navy, four minesweepers based in  the Uruguay River, two support ships that usually run to  Antarctica, the training ship Capitan Miranda -- which is  currently under repair in Spain, a buoy tender, a tugboat, and  three amphibious craft.    The Navy is also studying the possibility of adding a new  helicopter to the Naval Aviation fleet of three helicopters,  various maritime patrol planes, and training planes.    The weekly "BUSQUEDA" yesterday published a report stating  that between 24 December and 2 January the Navy released  personnel "to generate savings that (...) will alleviate a  difficult economic situation."    Naval sources said that between 24 December and 2 January  "there were no meals for personnel" in an "unprecedented lack of  foresight" in the Navy.    The sources explained that guard services like those at  weekends were posted, but the situation returned to normal early  this week when the 1994 budget funds became available. Defense  Minister Daniel Hugo Martins subsequently confirmed this report  to Radio Carve.</p>

The Serbian military consider this an  unauthorized interpretation of the UN peace forces' mandate.    According to information obtained by TANJUG from  highest-level military sources of the republic of Srpska, the  Serbian side has gathered considerable evidence to conclude that  these individuals are Muslim soldiers involved in reconnaissance  of Serbian units' positions under the protection of UNPROFOR  personnel.    "During the reconnaissance" the weapons of the "Blue  Helmets"  are turned toward the Serbian positions, though this is not  supposed to happen.    The military of the republic of Srpska point out that  UNPROFOR's mandate is not to establish peace, but only to  provide security for the humanitarian aid convoys on land. This  excludes any armed reconnaissance.    The Serbian side points at the fact that UNPROFOR has  started  building a watchtower north of Kalesija on Muslim-controlled  territory, though they have no right to do so.    The Serbian military warns that the Serbian side will  destroy  the tower if the construction does not stop. Reacting to all  the events taking place in the Kalesija region, the Serbian side  has issued a strict warning demanding that the UNPROFOR command  observe the mandate of the peace forces in the former Bosnia and  Herzegovina to the letter.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CREATIONISTS EVOLVING  </P> <P> It is difficult to believe that Phillip E. Johnson ("Unbelievers Unwelcome in  the Science Lab" Opinion, Nov. 3) is a law professor, in view of some of his  assertions, e.g., "Nobody doubts . . . ," "Most Americans are . . . " and "Most  people believe . . . "  </P> <P> How did he arrive at those conclusions?  </P> <P> Anyway, it is interesting to note the evolution of Creationists in this country  as depicted by Johnson.  </P> <P> As science has somehow managed to educate some Creationists, they have been  compelled to progress from embracing the six-day construction project dogma to  acknowledging that maybe it took a bit longer.  </P> <P> It is not clear whether God has worked a substantial amount of undisclosed  overtime or fashioned a program that executed the plan over the course of  millennia.  </P> <P> Whatever the case, the closest Creationists come to accepting evolution,  apparently, is to claim that God created that too, maybe on the seventh day.  </P> <P> B. PATRICK LANE  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA May 14 -- Former heavyweight world boxing  champion Muhammad Ali is now in Vietnam as goodwill envoy  accompanied by five other Americans in a mission of researching  Americans missing in action (MIA) during the Vietnam war.    Ali, 52 and suffering from Parkinson's Disease which impairs  his motor control, refused to carry out military service during  the Vietnam war and was therefore stripped of the crown he had  won in 1964, however, he successfully fought the US Government  in court and regained the title in 1974.    In Hanoi, Ali met with Vietnamese sport officials and  representatives of the State Committee for Cooperation and  Investment and the Finance Ministry. He was also received by  cabinet minister in charge of a number of government affairs Ha  Quang Du.    Ali said that he came to Vietnam with a view to improve the  mutual understanding between the peoples of Vietnam and America.  Yesterday Ali went south for a tour of Hue, Da Nang and Ho Chi  Minh City.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Information Minister Michel </F> Samahah in Beirut by unidentified Radio Monte Carlo reporters in  the studio--live]    [Text] [Reporter] Mr. Michel Samahah, it is feared that  free expression in Lebanon might be curbed. What can you say in  this regard to dispel these fears?    [Samahah] Nothing in the decision made necessitates fear for  the media and freedom of expression in Lebanon. Lebanon has its  own traditions as embodied in its people, heritage, and system.  Lebanon is a parliamentary democracy. The measure taken is  temporary and extraordinary. It is dictated by the current  extraordinary circumstances of our country. This is evident in  the plotting against the unity of Lebanese territory, the unity  of the Lebanese people, and the unity of Lebanese institutions.  Within the framework of the measures taken by the Council of  Ministers, a media measure was taken regarding only the illegal  and unlicensed audio and visual sector, pending the issuance of  the audio and visual media law. The written means of  expression, i.e., the Lebanese press -- dailies, weeklies,  monthlies, and periodicals -- continue to exist. They are  safeguarded by the Lebanese press law. The newspapers are  issued daily, as normal. All opinions expressing the political  and trade unionist reality of Lebanese society are being  published.    As for the audio and visual media, the Council of Ministers  will study and endorse the draft law in its extraordinary  session on Tuesday [29 March] and then refer it to the Chamber  of Deputies. I would like to stress here that when the Chamber  of Deputies receives the government opinion as expressed in its  draft law, it will make the decision. It will be free to study  this law, ratify it as it is, or amend it in a manner that  expresses the opinion of the Lebanese. The people's opinion is  expressed through the Chamber of Deputies within the framework  of the democratic parliamentary system.    [Reporter] May I say that the al-Hariri government decision  was not taken to gag mouths or silence every opposition voice,  and consequently leave the media arena only for the official  voice?    [Samahah] Absolutely, absolutely. Opposition voices do  exist. They have the opportunity to express themselves on  Lebanese television, on official Lebanese radio, and in the  national news agency, starting last night, after the closure of  all -- sorry, not closure, but suspension of -- the transmission  of news over radios sand televisions.    [Reporter] Mr. Minister, have private audio and visual media  abided by the ban, especially the dissolved Lebanese Forces [LF]  news media?    [Samahah] All Lebanese audio and visual news media operating  on Lebanese territory have fully abided by the government  decision since midnight on 23 March 1994. I had a series of  meetings with officials in charge of these outlets, the latest  of which ended two hours ago. We are working together in full  harmony in order to implement this temporary arrangement,  pending the ratification of the law regulating audio and visual  media.    [Reporter] Can you say when the new law regulating private  media will be issued?    [Samahah] I cannot anticipate the time the Chamber of  Deputies will take to study and ratify the law. However, I will  work from my position so the period will be the shortest  possible.    [Reporter] I would like to refer to the government decision  to dissolve the LF. Some say it was an attempt by the  government to liquidate this party. LF Commander Samir Ja'ja'  said yesterday that three of the suspects accused of the church  explosion, who belong to the party, have been residing abroad  for a long time. How were arrest warrants issued against them?  Can you explain this point?    [Samahah] I would like to clarify two points. There is no  retaliation between the government and the LF. The security and  political facts gathered on the general situation and the LF  activities dictated that the Lebanese Government make a  decision, upon the recommendation of the interior minister. As  for the judicial aspect, arrest warrants were issued by the  examining magistrate in this regard. No one can wade into the  details of this subject before the end of the investigation. We  should all respect the disengagement of powers between the  executive and judicial estates. According to Lebanese laws and  all international investigation laws, it is the examining  magistrate who, based on available facts and figures, forms a  judicial conviction, issues arrest warrants, and interrogates  suspects upon their apprehension, in a legal manner and in the  presence of a defense lawyer. The examining magistrate will  then issue an indictment prior to trial. We expect this  indictment to be issued once the investigation is over. The  trial will be held publicly in the presence of the defense  counsel.    [Reporter] Do you think the Government of Lebanon's  adoption of these political, security, and media decisions came  at the right time, in light of local and regional circumstances?    [Samahah] I think it was the right time, otherwise, the  Lebanese Government would not have made these decisions at this  time. Consequently, I think if we had not taken, or if we had  delayed taking, these measures, we would have regretted it and  our citizens would have accused us of delinquency.    [Reporter] In the government statement two days ago, you  explicitly accused Israel of being behind the explosions in  Lebanon. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday spoke  about the resumption of negotiations between the Arabs and  Israel at the end of next month. Will these accusations have  any reflections on the negotiations between Israel and Lebanon?    [Samahah] The facts available to the Lebanese Government  from  the security angle, as well as political information and the  proceedings of the negotiations, led us to directly accuse  Israel. We are convinced of this accusation, based on the facts  available to the Lebanese Government. As for negotiations,  since the first day of negotiations in Madrid we have been  sitting and talking to an enemy. We did so in solidarity with  the Arab brothers. Together, we went to the negotiations,  proceeding from the principles of Madrid conference. We all  seek a just and comprehensive peace. Consequently, we will not  be affected by the ongoing aggression on Lebanon -- land and  people -- in the south through occupation, shelling, and the  coercion of our people in the occupied Lebanese strip in  southern Lebanon and the western al-Biqa'. We will not be  affected by Israeli moves inside. This means we will continue  our march toward peace, proceeding from the principles I have  mentioned, at the negotiating table. Once the judicial  investigation is over and real incriminations based on facts are  made of Israeli involvement in explosions in Lebanon and  [plotting] against the unity of Lebanon, the unity of authority  in Lebanon, and the unity of people in Lebanon, the Lebanese  Government, as its statement said, will take a position that  will demand that the international community and the cosponsors  of the conference deter Israel and prevent it from continuing  all these aggressions, whether in occupied south Lebanon and the  attacks on unoccupied southern Lebanon, or in the explosions and  criminal hands that plant bombs in places of worship, as  happened in the case of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq  [Mikha'il] and the fasting worshipers in it.    [Reporter] Your Excellency Lebanese Information Minister  Michel Samahah, thank you for this direct telephone interview  from Beirut. Is there anything else you would like to add at the  end of this interview?    [Samahah] I would like to thank Radio Monte Carlo and appeal  to all friends of Lebanon and all those who care for Lebanon's  unity, its independence, sovereignty, and independent decision  to help Lebanon eliminate the Israeli occupation and its  repercussions for Lebanon's unity and the unity of the  government in Lebanon. Thank you.    [Reporter] Thank you.</p>

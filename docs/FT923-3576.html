			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: A provisional success There are two ways of looking at BTR. One is to focus on its undoubtedly well-honed skills in industrial manufacturing. The other is to put it in the category of companies which cannot resist the blandishments of acquisition accounting. Yesterday's 5 per cent rise in the share price suggests the market prefers the former view, and not entirely without justification. First-half operating profits in BTR's traditional businesses fell only 7 per cent despite fierce recession in some of its most important markets. Yet the rest of the story is marred by the extent to which provisions are being made and used against last year's Hawker Siddeley acquisition. Hawker's contribution to pre-tax profits was probably not much more than Pounds 120m. Yet BTR drew Pounds 90m from the Pounds 270m of provisions taken through the balance sheet following the purchase. Yesterday it announced a further provision of Pounds 110m, bringing the total to roughly a quarter of the Hawker price. BTR is, of course, perfectly entitled to behave in this way. It is also scrupulously explicit. Still, its recourse to provisions is large enough to raise questions over its quality of earnings. It would be a comfort if the company were generating more cash. BTR has instituted a squeeze on working capital, though that means the second half is unlikely to see the usual seasonal improvement. Meanwhile it is heavily dependent on disposals to finance capital spending and reduce gearing. Perhaps BTR will generate more cash after the integration of Hawker which is going ahead at commendable speed. But investors might prefer to wait and see before pushing the shares much higher, especially since margins on the Hawker business are unlikely to rise much further.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Teachers back local strikes over jobs THE NUT teachers' union yesterday voted for local strikes to resist threatened teacher redundancies, but drew back from endorsing a national strike to protest at job losses. After the failure of attempts by the executive of the NUT - Britain's largest and most militant teachers' union - to soften the line, delegates at the union's annual conference in Blackpool voted to support immediate strikes should members in a local area vote for industrial action. The prospect of disruption is real, since employers estimate that several thousand redundancies are virtually certain at the end of the academic year. Most local education authorities in England and Wales face tight spending constraints. The impact on jobs will be exacerbated by the introduction of local management schemes - under which schools gain full control of their budgets, including recruitment, with funding tied to pupil numbers. The NUT conference also called for a salary increase of 35 per cent over two years, to spread the 10-point teachers' pay scale between Pounds 14,000 and Pounds 25,000. It backed a campaign of industrial action to pursue the claim. Unlinke the other teachers' unions, the NUT opposed the establishment last year of the teachers' pay review body, which awarded a 7.5 per cent increase for this year. That was considerably more than was gained by the rest of the public sector. Mr Malcolm Horne, for the NUT executive, said the award was 'a massive step backwards', and justified the NUT's claim as necessary to restore relative pay to the level of 1974. Later, Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, appeared to tone down the threat of action on pay. 'If the government is seen to put cash limits on what our pay review body can award then we would need to test our members' attitudes,' he said, adding that it was too early to say what form action might take. The conference of the NASUWT, the third-largest teachers' union, unanimously deplored the lack of support for schools faced with growing levels of pupil disruption. Delegates, meeting in Scarborough, claimed that disruption caused by violent and unruly pupils was being 'swept under the carpet' with parents unwilling to control their children and authorities unable to fund special facilities.</p>

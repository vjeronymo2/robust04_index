			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Turkic states grow closer Turkey and central Asia's Turkic republics yesterday ended a two-day summit in Istanbul with pleas for negotiated settlements to regional conflicts and improved trade and infrastructure links. Leaders from Turkey and the five Turkic states of the former Soviet Union signed a declaration reaffirming the need for regional political consultation but did not mention Turkey's earlier idea of creating a Turkic federation reaching from the Mediterranean to China. They were also careful not to antagonise Russia, insisting that the summit was not an attempt to undermine the CIS. Moscow has criticised Turkey's attempt to strengthen its presence in the region, but President Suleyman Demirel said his objective was 'not to create a sphere of influence but a zone of co-operation'. Representatives from Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkey emphasised instead the need to strengthen trade links and improve the region's poor transport infrastructure. They said a new Silk Road should be built to connect the region's markets. Turkey also used the forum to press that the proposed oil and gas pipelines between the Caucasus and Europe should cross its territory rather than Russia.</p>

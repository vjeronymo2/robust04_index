			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, January 27 (BTA) -- The Podkrepa Labour  Confederation (Podkrepa) thoroughly disapproves the draft budget  proposed by the government, mainly because it has provided no  guarantees for the collection of revenue, Dr. Konstantin  Trenchev, president of Podkrepa, said at a briefing today. The  budget version submitted to parliament has been proposed by the  cabinet off its own bat without even showing it to the trade  unions, Dr. Trenchev said. According to him, the draft budget  assigns health care, education and culture the role of beggars.  The Podkrepa Coordinating Council is categorical that the state  will by no means be able to do well with such a budget in 1994,  Dr. Trenchev stressed.    One of the demands made by the Confederation of Independent  Trade Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB) on the government is that the  budget be revised after the first half of the year, Prof.  Krustyu Petkov, president of KNSB, said at yesterday's briefing  of the other influential trade union amalgamation. In his  opinion, the budget update is necessary because on the one hand  the draft budget framework is artificial, and the government has  done nothing to match projected expenditure to actual  requirement on the other. Further on, there is nothing to  guarantee that the collection of revenue would be most  successful than last year; in addition, the projections of  parties, trade unions, the government and the International  Monetary Fund concerning this country's financial prospects are  entirely different, the KNSB leader said. Following the budget  update, income policy negotiations should be opened again.  Otherwise the whole system of incomes adjustment to inflation  will collapse and the KNSB will have to resort to forcing  methods, the trade union functionary said.    The people of the miners federations may use "unconventional  methods" of protest to defend their very biological survival,  Dr. Trenchev told the participants in today's briefing.  Podkrepa is not inclined to accept, as a member of the National  Council for Tripartite Cooperation (comprising representatives  of employers, trade unions and the government), a rise in  electricity prices before the government signs the general  agreement with the trade unions on salaries in the  state-financed sector and other social issues which has been  worked on since December last year (when miners staged  nation-wide strike actions), he said. Podkrepa may decide to  launch new strikes, but the government is on the wane anyway and  will probably fall by the end of February, the trade union  leader said.    If Prof. Lyuben Berov's cabinet ignores the KNSB stand on  the  government-proposed increase of the prices of energy sources, at  its meeting on February 3 the KNSB Coordinating Council will  adopt a decision for nation-wide protest actions, including  civil boycott of the new prices, KNSB President Krustyu Petkov  told journalists yesterday. "I don't like those threats in the  least," he said, commenting on yesterday's statement by Deputy  Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev who said that the government  would not tolerate any civil disobedience and would sue  instigators. The cabinet may fall, but the KNSB will not  contribute to it, being concerned over the possible consequences  for the population, Prof. Petkov stressed.    No political force is interested in new elections at the  moment, Prof. Petkov said, commenting on Prime Minister Berov's  statement of January 25 that if the budget was not passed by  mid-February, early parliamentary elections would be inevitable.  However, the KNSB would be compelled to agree to the holding of  early elections by purely economic considerations, the KNSB  leader said.    A caretaker cabinet can blow up political life in the  country, Dr. Trenchev observed at today's briefing. The  Podkrepa leader believes that parliamentary elections are the  sole democratic and reasonable way out of the present situation  in the country.</p>

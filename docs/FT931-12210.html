			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Chairman conjures a compromise THE LABOUR MP who brokered the uneasy compromise at the heart of today's report had expected to spend last Tuesday evening at the Whitbread Book of the Year awards. Instead Mr Richard Caborn was in Commons committee room 16 chairing a heated meeting of the trade and industry committee. The collaboration between backbenchers, ranging from old-fashioned knights of the Tory shires to diehard Labour leftwingers, proved so difficult that the bearded Yorkshireman at one point indicated that he would resign if a compromise could not be concocted. But just before 11pm on Tuesday, the most important select committee report in years was carried 'nem con'. The outcome spoke volumes for the Sheffield Central MP's negotiating skills. The formula may not suggest a reprieve for as many pits as he would have liked, but it leaves the government with little choice but to scale down significantly the closures announced last October. The high-profile inquiry into coal is a far cry from the unhurried examination of trade with the rest of the EC which Mr Caborn thought would be his priority when elected chairman last July. The 49-year-old Mr Caborn's roots lie solidly on the Labour left. In 1981 he backed Mr Tony Benn for the party's deputy leadership, and plumped for the Bryan Gould-John Prescott ticket in last year's leadership contest. During the bitter 1984-85 coal strike he was a staunch supporter of the miners, serving as a trustee of the Miners' Solidarity Fund. He is a past chairman of the soft-left Tribune Group and a vigorous opponent of apartheid. He has drifted into the party mainstream on a range of issues. Once an out-and-out Euro-sceptic, he is now content to espouse the leadership's pro-EC stance. An MEP for five years to 1984, he believes his familiarity with Brussels procedures will prove an asset in his present job. Regional devolution is an issue on which he sees little room for compromise. The strength of his views - he has proposed cutting mortgage tax relief to raise money for regional development - is widely blamed for the loss of his Labour frontbench place in 1990 after just three years. He confirms that he then refused a job on Mr Prescott's transport team because he believed regional policy - for which it was proposed he retain responsibility - should remain part of the trade and industry portfolio. Still militant enough to be an early signatory of this week's Commons early-day motion expressing no confidence in Mr Eddie George, the incoming Bank of England governor, Mr Caborn mixes earnest discussion with occasional bursts of humour. He says chairing a Commons committee reminds him more of being a convener of shop stewards than a politician. 'You have got to get a solution to the problem, so you have got to be pragmatic,' he adds. Observer, Page 15</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Consultations on Skopje [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Yugoslavia--FYROM] continued today at the top level  in UN Headquarters, where Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou met  with the UN secretary general. Our New York special  correspondent Roula Kambouryianni reports.    [Begin recording] [Kambouryianni] No specific positive  developments can be discerned on the Skopje issue. However, UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali did not ask for Security  Council intervention, and the mediation effort by Cyrus Vance is  continuing. This is what Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said  after his 40-minute meeting with Butrus-Ghali in the presence of  Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and Mr. Cyrus Vance. Before  the meeting, Mr. Butrus-Ghali held consultations both with Mr.  Vance and with Matthew Nimetz, State Department special  coordinator on the Skopje issue.    In addition to the Skopje question, the Cyprus and Bosnian  issues were also discussed. As the prime minister said, however,  we did not touch on matters of substance. After the failure of  the talks on the confidence-building measures, the Greek side  expressed its regret for the deadlock in the Cyprus issue  because of the Turkish intransigence.    [Papandreou] We expressed our regret for the course of the  Cyprus issue. There have already been 20 years of occupation,  and the process should change so that we end with a solution  acceptable to the people of Cyprus, a solution that will be just  and lasting.    [Kambouryianni] Responding to a Turkish correspondent's  question on relations with Turkey, the prime minister said that  we hope they will improve, and we are doing all we can in this  direction.    Coming out of UN Headquarters, Mr. Vance described the  meeting as very positive. He said: We have cooperated with Mr.  Papandreou in the past; let us hope that progress will be made  soon. The prime minister and members of the Greek delegation  will leave for Athens today. [end recording]</p>

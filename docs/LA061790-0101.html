			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VOTER SURPRISE  </P> <P> Well, Orange County voters did it again. I do not understand how they do it,  but they never fail to amaze me at every election.  </P> <P> This time it was Propositions 108 and 111.  </P> <P> Anybody who was paying attention to these propositions knew that 108 could not  take effect unless 111 also passed. Nevertheless, 108 was passed in Orange  County, and 111 was defeated. Thank goodness that the rest of the state had  more brains.  </P> <P> Come on, Orange County! Read the election material. Inform yourself before  going to the polls. It is our responsibility to vote intelligently. An  uninformed vote does more harm than good.  </P> <P> VALERIE McNAMARA  </P> <P> Tustin  </P></p>

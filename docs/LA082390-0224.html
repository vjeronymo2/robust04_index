			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUMMER SUN GENERATES ADDED HAZARDS  </P> <P> For many people summer is the time for swimming, sailing, picnics and outdoor  recreation. However, summer heat and sun can be treacherous.  </P> <P> Older people should be wary of food poisoning and heat strokes, two potentially  fatal illnesses associated with summer.  </P> <P> These days, most people do not give much thought to food poisoning. Modern  methods to preserve food and retard bacteria should make the food we eat safe.  Bacteria such as salmonella, botulism, staphylococcus and campylobacter are  presumed to be fears of a former generation.  </P> <P> In fact, most people would be surprised to learn that about 2 million cases of  food poisoning occur each year in this country due to improper handling of food  in the home.  </P> <P> Food poisoning can become epidemic at picnics or other events where food is  left unrefrigerated for a long time, when power outages cause refrigerators to  shut down and from canning procedures that fail to kill bacteria.  </P> <P> Diminished taste and smell also may be significant in determining if food is  spoiled. Older people who live on a fixed income may be wary of throwing food  away. And, in order to hold utility bills down, refrigerators often are kept  above the recommended 40 degrees.  </P> <P> The following precautions can eliminate most sources of bacteria and prevent  food poisoning:  </P> <P> * Refrigerate food at 40 degrees; freeze it at 0 degrees Fahrenheit.  </P> <P> * Freeze raw meat and poultry that will not be used within two days.  </P> <P> * To thaw food, place it in the refrigerator, not on the counter, where  bacteria can grow quickly.  </P> <P> * Make sure food and utensils are clean.  </P> <P> * Wash hands with soap and water before preparing food.  </P> <P> * Cook food thoroughly, including food prepared in a microwave. Avoid recipes  that call for raw eggs or raw fish.  </P> <P> * Freeze or refrigerate leftovers promptly.  </P> <P> * Never leave a perishable food out of the refrigerator for more than two  hours.  </P> <P> Symptoms of food poisoning include diarrhea, abdominal pain and nausea.  Sometimes it is accompanied by fever and general discomfort.  </P> <P> The U.S. Department of Agriculture has established a toll-free number to  respond to consumer questions about safe handling of meat and poultry. Call  (800) 535-4555 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays for information on proper food  handling.  </P> <P> Heat exhaustion and heat stroke are other potentially dangerous conditions  associated with hot weather. Many people become needlessly ill each year  because they do not take simple, preventive steps.  </P> <P> Heat exhaustion is a warning that the body is getting too hot. Symptoms include  thirst, giddiness, weakness, nausea and profuse sweating. If not attended to,  heat exhaustion can develop into a more serious condition known as heat stroke.  </P> <P> Some medications such as diuretics, sedatives and tranquilizers, and certain  heart and blood pressure drugs, may affect the way an individual copes with  heat. Don't discontinue medication, but discuss potential problems with a  doctor.  </P> <P> Diseases that require special diets also may make a person more vulnerable to  heat stroke. People with high blood pressure, for example, generally reduce the  amount of salt in their diet, making temperature regulation more difficult.  However, a person should not take salt tablets without consent of a doctor.  </P> <P> Avoid heat exhaustion and heat stroke by following some simple steps:  </P> <P> * Drink plenty of water and juices.  </P> <P> * Wear light-weight, light-colored and loose-fitting clothing.  </P> <P> * Avoid activity during the hottest part of the day.  </P> <P> * Keep meals simple and light. Keep oven use to a minimum.  </P> <P> * Use air-conditioners liberally or, if none is available, plan trips to cool  places such as shopping malls, theaters and libraries.  </P> <P> Anyone suspected of suffering heat stroke should receive immediate attention.  Victims of heat stroke have a body temperature of 104 degrees or higher. The  pulse may be rapid.  </P> <P> Other symptoms may include flushed skin, a faint feeling, confused and bizarre  behavior and combativeness. If symptoms are mild, get into a cool place, drink  non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated fluids, and sponge off with cool water or take a  cool bath or shower.  </P> <P> If symptoms are severe, get emergency medical assistance immediately.  </P></p>

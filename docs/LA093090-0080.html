			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHORT AND SWEET  </P> <P> It's difficult to imagine any woman dressed in shorts, or a short unitard, on a  winter day in New York or Paris. But the idea makes such good sense here, it's  as if designers worldwide had Southern California in mind.  </P> <P> In Paris, Emanuel Ungaro and Jean Paul Gaultier offer distinctly different  versions of winter-weight shorts. Ungaro's sporty, cuffed styles are mid-thigh  length, made of menswear fabric and worn with an ultra- feminine velvet jacket,  floral-print vest, silky blouse and tall, protective suede boots. Gaultier  mixes a thigh-high bodysuit in Fair Isle patterned sweater knit with a sporty  anorak. And he shows it with clunky leather ski boots, a footwear idea born in  the city streets.  </P> <P> In Italy, Giorgio Armani pairs short shorts of menswear wool plaid with  slouchy, oversized jackets. He adds deep-brimmed fedoras to soften the look.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, Holly Sharp's stretchy cycle shorts go with peplum jackets.  Melivier's tailored silk Bermudas have a long, narrow silk jacket. And for  evening, Pepito Albert's red satin hot pants travel to dinner and dance clubs,  topped by floor-sweeping bathrobe-style coats. MARY ROURKE  </P></p>

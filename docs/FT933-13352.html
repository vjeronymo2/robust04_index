			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Pru chief urges talks on fees disclosure MR Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurance company, has called on the Office of Fair Trading to have direct discussions with the life insurance industry on disclosure. In March the OFT attacked a proposal from the Securities and Investments Board and other City self-regulatory organisations for the life insurance industry, saying it contained seriously anti-competitive elements. The OFT urged that independent financial advisers be required to disclose the amount of commission they will earn from prospective customers, that life insurers should spell out the surrender value in each year of a policy's life until maturity, that the effect of costs in investment returns be demonstrated by using each company's own charges, and that low-cost sales outlets be allowed to charge less for the same product than high-cost outlets. In a seven-page letter to the OFT last week Mr Newmarch took issue with its proposals and said the self-regulating organisations should have no role in deciding on disclosure rules. 'The primary relationship needs to be with the industry - represented by leading practitioners and its trade associations - not with the regulatory bodies,' he wrote. He said the price comparison data which the OFT sought would probably be of little use. 'The provision of comparative performance data is less important to saver protection than transparency on the terms which will govern the build-up of value in the product, and the policyholder's access to the funds built up,' he said. Mr Newmarch proposes that sales agents be required to disclose the customer's contractual obligation to pay premiums, the terms governing the build-up of policy proceeds and customer access to them, the charges which apply to the separate elements of the contract such as investment management or life insurance premiums, and the basis for determining charges.

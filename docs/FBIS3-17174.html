The former director general of the state-owned Latbiofarm  pharmaceutical factory, Ilmars Penke, was convicted for grave  abuse of service status and large scale keeping and trafficking  narcotic drugs in acquisitive purposes.    Penke was sentenced to seven years imprisonment with  property  confiscation, except his summer house. The charges on Penke's  deputy, Vyacheslav Kulikov, were the same, his sentence is seven  and a half years imprisonment with property confiscation. The  third accomplice, the former central laboratory chief Janis Osis  was convicted for three and a half years with property  confiscation. The court maintained that Penke and Kulikov were  driven by covetousness but Osis -- by other personal motives.    The Criminal Police Department was commissioned to destroy  the material evidence of 1 million pills of amphetamine group  stimulants of the central nervous system, which were produced  illegally under the disguise of flu medicine. The defendants'  defense lawyers said they would appeal.    In total, Latbiofarm made 16 million pills of MDA  amphetamine  drug between July 14, 1992, and Dec. 1, 1992, against a contract  with a Slovakian firm.    Fifteen million, or 4.5 tons of the drug, were sent to  Frankfurt am Main, Germany, under the shield name of  remantadine. The German police detected more than 3 tons of MDA  tablets in the city airport in December, 1992. One third of the  pills was never found, police reports.    The investigation proved that Penke and Kulikov received  from  the Slovakian Weinwurm &amp; Co. firm 198,000 Dutch guilders and  196,500 German marks. Penke and Kulikov divided the money and  kept it at home. At court, they testified that they would have  used the resources to pay bonuses to workers.    The convicted manufacturers deny their guilt saying they did  not know they produced a narcotic drug. The court said the  defendants had substantially undermined the international  prestige of Latvia as an independent country.</p>

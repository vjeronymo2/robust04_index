			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Orlando Cano Vallejo] </F>   [Text] Presidential candidate Antonio Navarro Wolff has  just made some remarks on the election. Navarro, also former  health minister, said the candidates who lead in the 29 May  elections have phoned him. Navarro said Colombians acted  decently in the election by voting for him in a larger number  than anticipated, considering the complications that his  campaign encountered regarding the other leading candidates,  Ernesto Samper Pizzano and Andres Pastrana Arango. Tacitly  responding to the media, Navarro Wolff admitted that Samper and  Pastrana are ahead of him, and that on 2 June, he will make  specific remarks on the course he will set for his political  campaign, whether he will join any of the two candidates or  remain an independent candidate, what he describes as a pebble  in the shoe. Navarro said he has received numerous calls from  his followers, who also [words indistinct] one of the two  candidates, whose name he withheld.    The official report says Navarro Wolff will meet with his  party's leadership on 2 June, when he will announce whether or  not he will back one of the two candidates. He told Caracol  Network that both Samper and Pastrana have phoned him but that  any decision for either of the two candidates will be announced  on 2 June in a closed-door meeting with the directors of his  political campaign.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] St. Petersburg April 18 TASS -- Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin today addressed the opening session  of the board of directors of the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development [EBRD], which is holding its  third annual meeting here today.    Viktor Chernomyrdin told the EBRD leaders and prominent  statesmen and business people from the bank's fifty-seven  stockholding countries that the forum in St. Petersburg is "a  weighty testimony to the fact that the anxiety and uncertainty  felt by our international partners about the fact of economic  reforms in Russia, so pronounced at the beginning of the year,  are now giving room to other sentiments and different  expectations".    For his part, the Russian prime minister said "quite  definitely and responsibly" that the policy of financial  stabilisation, further reforms and restructuring of the national  economy will remain the pivot of the Russian economic policy.  Chernomyrdin pointed to the results of the first months of this  year as bearing out his statement. In February and March, the  inflation growth rate fell beneath ten per cent and the April  figures will not differ considerably. The federal budget for the  end of 1994 has been drafted with a deficit of about nine per  cent of the gross product. It means that given the steady main  parameters, the inflation growth rate will dwindle to seven per  cent before the year is out.    The discussion of the draft budget in the Federal Assembly  is  proceeding with difficulties, Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed. The  draft has been approved as the basis, and "we shall take into  account any modifications approved by the deputies in line with  the overall logic of the reforms carried out in Russia.    Political and financial stabilisation has already yielded  its  first fruit -- demand restrictions have begun to work. Although  the production slump has been increasing since the beginning of  the year, it has acquired a clear-cut structural character.    "We are now at the deepest point of the crisis," the prime  minister said. The Russians have come quite close to the  frontier beyond which U-turn can occur in the main negative  tendencies which determined our development in the past  two-three years. But the U-turn can occur only if investments  liven up", Chernomyrdin said. The Russian premier appealed to  the representatives of the European bank for reconstruction and  development and the delegations from industrialised countries  and international financial organisations to step up their  activities on the Russian market.    Annual meetings of the board of directors of the EBRD  traditionally examine the results of the bank's activity for the  preceding year and determine guidelines for the next year. As  concerns Russia, central bank officials told ITAR-TASS that the  European bank has approved loans to fund 21 projects in Russia,  including major ones, such as the development of the oilfield in  the Arctic area of the Pechora basin, worth 300 million USD. By  the end of this year, the number of approved projects, which are  now being prepared, may reach fifty.</p>

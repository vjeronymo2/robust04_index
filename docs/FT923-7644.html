			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Parcels sell-offs may be linked THE GOVERNMENT is considering co-ordinating aspects of the sale of the two parcels businesses that it is to privatise. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, are to discuss the timing of the disposals, which will transfer both Parcelforce, the Post Office's delivery service, and British Rail's parcels division to the private sector. The level of co-ordination, however, is thought unlikely to extend to appointing the same teams of advisers to handle both sales. Though nothing has been ruled out, it is expected that traditional inter-departmental rivalries may limit the extent of co-operation. British Rail is primarily Mr MacGregor's responsibility, while the Post Office is Mr Heseltine's.</p>

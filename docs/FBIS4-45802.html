			<p>CSO     [TEXT]The environment and ecology are in spite  of the economic crisis firmly lodged in the consciousness of  broad sections of the German public. On an ecology consciousness  scale of one to ten, Germans had the high score of 7.8. Eighty  percent of Germans claim that they contribute to environmental  protection through their own behavior and that they are willing  to buy environmentally friendly products. But only half of them  are willing to spend more money to do so. In fact, 80%  reject  higher gas prices, according to a poll taken by the research  institute of Axel Billig &amp; Partner in Cologne and  commissioned  by the Berlin Office of the Environment.    The ecologically aware person has become a statistical norm,  environmental consciousness is no longer dependent on age, sex  or education. Yet in spite of the pronounced ecological  awareness of the Germans, individual behavior meets its  limitations when it comes to [imposing] personal restrictions.  Thus, over half of the respondents were ready to dispose of  batteries separately or to buy energy saving appliances, but  every second person rejected higher prices for environmentally  friendly products. Fewer than 20% would limit their  driving and  only 12% would keep the heat lower. For 15% the  "pain  threshold" for modifying driving behavior was a gas [price of]  two German marks per liter.    Only 6% believe that the government and business are  doing  everything necessary for the environment--60% by contrast  are  of the opinion that either nothing or practically nothing  decisive is being done. Yet almost 60% say that not only  could  the government and business do substantially more, every  individual could also contribute more as well. Appeals alone are  not enough to increase willingness on the part of individuals,  according to the Ministry for the Environment. Instead,  environmentally acceptable behavior must be made easier and, if  possible, be rewarded. For example, offering environmentally  friendly products at prices which are less expensive than the  others and not, as is often the case, more expensive.</p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Venezuela bails out ailing banks Four Venezuelan financial institutions are receiving government aid because of liquidity problems, Mr Julio Sosa, Venezuela's minister of finance, said yesterday. Testifying before a congressional committee on the state of Venezuela's financial system, he said three of the troubled entities were commercial banks. Venezuela's financial system is still reeling from the effects of the failure of the country's second largest bank, Banco Latino. The government took control of Banco Latino in the middle of last month. With the help of several large banks, it has provided Latino and other troubled banks with over Dollars 1bn. Bankers in Caracas say privately that more than four financial institutions are in trouble and that a series of government measures announced this week are not sufficient to confront the financial system's problems. These measures included a determination to re-float Latino, a government demand that banks receiving official financial assistance increase their capital bases and improve performance, and a plan to strengthen the country's bank regulatory system. Last month, the central bank reportedly had eleven financial institutions on its 'watch list'. President Rafael Caldera said yesterday he was replacing Roger Urbina, the superintendent of banks, which regulates and supervises the system, and Esperanza Martino, president of the Deposit Insurance Fund.</p>

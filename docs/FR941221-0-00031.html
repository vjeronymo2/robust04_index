			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. In Iowa rule 567&hyph;22.4, the state previously adopted by reference 40 CFR 52.21, as amended through February 3, 1992, with respect to special requirements for major stationary sources located in areas designated attainment or unclassified (PSD). The state now updates this adoption to include the modeling guidelines and PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  increments specified in the June 3, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  document and changes in &sect;52.21 which became effective June 3, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. In Iowa rule 23.3(2)d (3) and (4), the state previously allowed use of the Ringelmann Chart or an opacity determination in regulating diesel-powered vehicles and locomotives. Since the state has adopted Test Method 9 for opacity as found in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A (also in this April 20, 1994, adoption), the state hereby ceases to use the Ringelmann Chart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. In subrule 23.4(6), the state amends a typographical error in a rule concerning emissions of particulate matter in sand handling and surface finishing operations in metal processing. The rule itself is unchanged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. In subrule 25.1(9), the state previously outlined its test methods and procedures by adopting those specified in 40 CFR part 60, appendices B and F through February 11, 1991. The state now updates its adoption to include appendix A of part 60 and include amendments through May 17, 1993. This adoption includes Test Method 9 for opacity as outlined in 2. above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> EPA Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is taking final action to approve revisions submitted May 15, 1994, for the state of Iowa.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, EPA certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (Union Electric Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. E.P.A <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Office of Management and Budget has exempted these actions from review under Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by February 21, 1995. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review, nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent notice that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Air pollution control, Carbon monoxide, Hydrocarbons, Incorporation by reference, Intergovernmental relations, Lead, Nitrogen dioxide, Ozone, Particulate matter, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Sulfur oxides, Volatile organic compounds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: October 20, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Dennis Grams, P.E., <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Regional Administrator. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

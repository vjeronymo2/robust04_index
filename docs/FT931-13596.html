			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / The Property Market: Long haul from bottom of the abyss - Signs are growing that the US property market may be about to turn Will the 'new season of American renewal', promised by President Bill Clinton to the US people this week, signal a revival of its battered property market? While the problems of the US property industry remain daunting, some commentators believe that this will be the year when the long decline in values bottoms out. '1993 looks to be a turning point for the economy, and for the real estate industry, too,' says Mr Hugh Kelly, head of economic research at Landauer Associates, the US real estate advisers. 'By many measures, the worst of the cycle is behind us.' Mr Sol Rabin of TCW Realty Advisers, a Los Angeles-based company of property advisers, agrees. 'Although there is no sign of improvement yet, there are growing signs that we are at the bottom.' The fate of the property industry is bound up with the policies of the new US president. Issues such as trade policy, strengthening the banking system, increasing tax revenues and the possibility of pump-priming measures 'will affect the real estate industry sooner rather than later', says Mr Kelly. 'Economic expansion and renewed optimism are necessary preconditions for real estate to work its way out of its long purgatory,' he says. But not even the optimists believe that the climb out of the abyss will be quick or easy. The US real estate market is labouring under the weighty legacy of the 1980s, when tax breaks and easy money stimulated a big increase in construction. Some 40 per cent of all the property in the US was built in the 1980s, according to TCW. The result was a steep rise in vacancy rates, reaching an average of nearly 20 per cent in downtown office markets. Property analysts calculate that there is enough vacant office space to give every unemployed person in the country his or her own 8 ft by 7 ft office. The result has been a sharp fall in property values of at least 30 per cent in the last four years, as investors have shied away from the market. Investment in property has been sharply reduced from Dollars 21bn in 1988 to less than Dollars 4bn in 1992. However, potential investors complain that prices are still being kept artificially high. This has led to a stalemate between buyers, who have waited for prices to fall further, and sellers, who have been waiting for them to go back up. 'If the banks were to write down property values enough, investors would come in,' says Mr Rabin. 'Some of the banks are being unrealistic about prices.' The US property market - as in the UK - ultimately depends on demand from tenants; and demand depends on the strength of the economy. Landauer's economic projections for this year include a 3 per cent real growth in gross domestic product, and a net gain of more than 1m jobs. However, there are significant variations in the prospects for different markets and regions: The office market saw rents fall by 4.4 per cent and values fall by 7 per cent in 1992. Prospects are still weak, but there is scope for encouragement in the decline in supply, which has slowed to a trickle, and improved demand prospects. Landauer estimates that an additional 1.38bn office jobs will be created across the country by 1997. It concludes that 47 per cent of the current vacant space could be absorbed in the next five years. The best-placed cities are those with the greatest potential for job creation in the 1990s. Landauer uses its Office Momentum Index to rank US cities in terms of supply of and demand for offices: this puts Orlando, Houston, Seattle and Atlanta as the best markets for the 1990s, although it rates their prospects as no more than acceptable to good. The likely resurgence of the Houston property market, which has long been notorious for a high vacancy rate, is particularly significant. At the other end of the scale are most of the US's largest markets, such as Chicago, Washington, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and New York, which are 'bogged down with immense inventories of empty space and feeble economic expansion prospects through mid-decade'. New York, which has lost more than 100,000 office jobs since 1990, is the worst placed of the 24 US cities monitored by Landauer. 'The weakness in office rents and values will be a persistent feature here through the latter part of the decade,' the company says. The retail market - fears of unemployment and heavy debt burdens are continuing to restrict consumer spending and depress the retail property market. This is in spite of low interest rates and hopes of economic recovery. The decline in retail property capital values has been far less marked than for offices, although income returns have lagged nearly every other sector in the market. Dallas, Seattle and Tampa offer the best prospects, according to Landauer; among the worst are in Hartford, Richmond and Memphis. The industrial market has been badly affected by the contraction of companies such as General Motors and IBM and by reduced military spending, which has particularly hit the Californian economy. Nonetheless, there is some comfort in the industrial sector. A Federal Reserve banking survey last October suggested that manufacturers' optimism is picking up and, despite continued closures of large plants, the number of small factories is on the rise. The warehouse market shows some sign of recovery, particularly in Seattle, Houston and Dallas. The residential market - although values are still falling, apartments are the best-performing sector in the property market, as it does not suffer from the oversupply plaguing other parts of the market. Average vacancy rates declined from 7.4 per cent to 6.8 per cent in 1992. 'If these rates continue to fall, significant spikes in average rents should be expected,' says Landauer. Falling prices and cheaper mortgages helped the single-family housing market rebound in 1992, with a 4 per cent rise in volume and a slight increase in prices. Prospects for a continued improvement in 1993 are modest, however. The hotel market is probably the hardest hit of all the US commercial property markets. 'While an office building can harbour an above-market lease that represents a potential threat to cash flow, hotels must go to market every night. It is hard to hide problems in this business,' says Landauer. It adds that 1993 is expected to be another bleak year. An examination of the prospects for different states and sectors demonstrates how widespread and severe are the problems facing the US property market. Hopes of a recovery are fragile and could easily be dashed by events such as a rise in interest rates. Probably the best that can be said for the US property industry is that, for the first time in years, the market runs a chance of being in a better, not worse, state by the time the year is over.</p>

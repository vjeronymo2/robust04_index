			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Pressure on Nadir as bank shuts HQ THE POSITION of Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive Turkish-Cypriot businessman, appeared to be weakening yesterday. Britain stepped up its diplomatic pressure on northern Cyprus and Mr Nadir's privately owned bank announced that it was closing its headquarters - the first indication of serious trouble in his financial empire on the island. In the strongest warning to northern Cyprus from the UK government so far, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, Foreign Office minister, yesterday warned that sanctions had not been ruled out and that northern Cyprus's interests could be badly damaged if it failed to return Mr Nadir to England. Mr Garel-Jones said: 'The Turkish Cypriots should appreciate the damage it could do to their interests if they were to acquire a reputation as a refuge for fugitives.' He added that if Mr Nadir travelled to Turkey then Turkey's reputation could suffer similarly. Mr Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader, yesterday said that he had no intention of returning Mr Nadir to Britain. Instead he urged the British authorities to prosecute Mr Nadir in northern Cyprus. In the first indication that Mr Nadir's troubles are affecting his private businesses on the island, Kibris Endustri Bankasi, Mr Asil Nadir's privately owned bank in northern Cyprus, is planning to close its Nicosia headquarters. It told its landlords at the end of April that it intended to vacate the premises. It has reportedly had problems meeting its rent payments. The northern Cyprus government has already put a general lien on all the assets relating to Mr Nadir. This follows the failure to pay social security and other official dues of 35bn Turkish lira (Pounds 2.28m) and TL40bn, related to his personal debts to the government. It is possible for Mr Nadir to be prosecuted in northern Cyprus because, according to a provision in the criminal law of northern Cyprus, a citizen can be tried and convicted in the local courts for a crime committed outside the territory. The UK's Serious Fraud Office has refrained from initiating such action because the territory is not formally recognised by the UK. Such a move would require the SFO to provide the information to proceed. Meanwhile, BDO Binder Hamlyn, the accountancy firm, last night clarified the work it had conducted on behalf of Mr Nadir in northern Cyprus. Mr Nadir said on Friday that the firm had shown that monies allegedly stolen by him were accounted for in the books of Unipac, the packaging company based in northern Cyprus. Mr Adrian Burn, managing partner in London, stressed that his firm had been commissioned by Mr Nadir's former solicitors in 1991 to conduct a limited review which reconciled bank statements with book entries for certain specific transactions. He said: 'We were not asked, and did not form an opinion on the whole picture. The transactions were consistent with the bank statements and cash entries.'</p>

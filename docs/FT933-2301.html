He said the move was seen as necessary 'to establish clearly Australia's identity as an independent nation. I outlined to Her Majesty the various steps that would be involved in such a process, including the need for a referendum to approve constitutional amendments. . . the Australian government's view was that if approved by the Australian people at a referendum, it would be appropriate for Australia to become a republic by the centenary of federation in 2001.' Mr Keating said he had informed the Queen that in such a situation Australia would remain a member of the Commonwealth and that Australians would warmly welcome visits to Australia by the Queen as Commonwealth head.

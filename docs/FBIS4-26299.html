			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cai Hong: "UN Gives `Security' a Global Definition"] </F>   [Text] Security as used by the media often conveys  protection from external aggression -- protection from nuclear  annihilation, for example -- or it suggests blue-helmeted  peacekeepers of the UN whose job it is to keep warring factions  apart.    In a more fundamental sense, however, security means safety  from some more common threats to human existence: hunger,  disease, crime and repression. It means protection from sudden  and damaging disruptions in the pattern of our daily lives  whether the disruptions strike our homes, jobs, communities or  the environment.    This is the wider concept of "security" embodied in the  Human  Development Report '94 of the United Nations Development  Programme (UNDP).    At a recent UNDP workshop on the report held in Dhaka,  Bangladesh, some 50 participants from East and South Asia  maintained that the search for human security lies in  development, not in arms.    Participants, including delegates from Bangladesh, China,  India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Pakistan, Vietnam,  Cambodia and Thailand, discussed the new role of the United  Nations in meeting humanity's agenda not only for peace but also  for development.    According to the report, development co-operation, which has  tended to be limited to financial aid, should be broadened to  include technical assistance and marketing strategies.    Dr. Mahbub ul Haq [name as published], special adviser to  the  UNDP administrator in New York, said the report is aimed at  widening the UN's attention from only economic development.  <H5>  Soaring Population </H5>   In consideration of the graver challenge threatening human  security, a new development pattern is required that puts people  at the centre of development and regards economic growth as a  means, not an end.    According to the report, despite all of man's technological  breakthroughs, he still cannot meet primary needs in many parts  of the world. A fifth of the developing world's population goes  hungry every night, a quarter lacks access to potable drinking  water and a third lives in a state of abject poverty.    With these massive problems unresolved, the critical  question  of humanity's ability to survive on an environmentally fragile  planet has become ever more urgent. The world's soaring  population only adds to the urgency.    Demographers forecast in the report that by the middle of  the  next century, the world population may double while the world's  economy quadruples.    At the same time, it is estimated that productivity of food  production needs to triple since the source base for sustainable  agriculture is being eroded.    The world's increasing energy requirements also must be met.  But even at today's level of usage, the burning of fossil fuels  threaten the global climate. The devastation of the world's  forests and the loss of fauna wealth and diversity continue  relentlessly.    "Against this backdrop of human distress" the report says,  "we must seek a new concept of human security in the decades  ahead."    The report attempts to propose a new model of sustainable  human development that can guard the expanding frontiers of  human security and provide a new framework of development  co-operation that unites humanity with a more equitable sharing  of global economic opportunities and responsibilities.    The report also put forward suggestions for the World Summit  for Social Development scheduled for March 1995 in Copenhagen,  Denmark.    The establishment of an Economic Security Council within the  United Nations is a new, ambitious idea of UNDP.    Further, the UN agency "urges the international community to  undertake a comprehensive review of the existing framework of  international development, and, in this connection, to undertake  studies on the practicability of such measures as establishing a  global social safety net, introducing a world income tax, and  creating a tax on foreign exchange movements as a potential  source of financing for a more effective United Nations."    According to a UNDP official in India, China has made the  most rapid progress in human development in Asia, followed by  India and Bangladesh.    Over a long period of time, China has invested considerably  in human development. Despite China's relatively low per capita  income, it falls into the medium human development index (HDI)  -- ranking 94th in the world in 1992. HDI takes longevity,  education and standard of living into account in its evaluation.    Yang Qingwei, a Chinese participant in the workshop, said  that the picture of social development in developing countries  is more or less the same.    "The solutions to their problems, however, is not  necessarily  the same," said Yang, deputy director of the Social Development  Department under the State Planning Commission.  <H5>  Robust Growth </H5>   The poorest of nations should depend on their own domestic  economic reforms, supported by foreign aid.    Alluding to China, Yang reported that the past 15 years of  reform and opening to the outside world have witnessed robust  economic growth. The social sector, unfortunately, has  developed slowly. Regional economic imbalance has increased.    Furthermore, the access to education varies from region to  region. On average, 97 per cent of the nation's school-age  children go to school. But the figure is low in the remote,  poverty-stricken areas.    "China's social development mechanism fails to facilitate  the  transition to a market economy," Yang said.    He maintained that carefully directed State intervention  will  be required to ensure steadier human development and equitable  distribution of social services because the market often doesn't  do a good job directing resources in the social sector.    Yang called for reform of such social sector systems as  pensions, unemployment compensation and industrial injuries  compensation in order to achieve an improved level of social  integration in the market economy.    China is sketching a blueprint for social development from  1995 to 2000. Local governments, for example, are required to  define their lowest level of poverty and minimum wage.    Yang also reiterated that the demands of human development  today should be linked with the exigencies of development  tomorrow. He said governments should consider how decisions  affecting the environment and natural resources will impact  future generations to ensure they have opportunities similar to  the ones previous generations have enjoyed.</p>

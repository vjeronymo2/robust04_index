			<p>BFN     [Text] N'dalatando, the capital of Cuanza Norte Province,  is not under the effective control of the Popular Movement for  the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] troops. Our  correspondent Firmino Lukamba says that N'dalatando is currently  the scene of the most violent clashes on the African continent,  despite the presence of the United Nations in Angola passively  observing the National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola's [UNITA] [words indistinct]. The clashes are taking  place exactly in the lower part of that city, where foreign  mercenaries have set innocent civilians alight, using the  hideous necklace method. Right now the city is covered with  smoke due to the explosion of the deadliest bombs which the  Soviet Union and some Western countries supplied to the Luanda  regime, a scenario which, according to our war reporter, is  reminiscent of the battle for Leningrad during the World War II.  Here is his report:    At present they are deployed in Ward No. 218's hospital and  volunteer's streets. [sentence as heard] The manhunt in areas  controlled by the MPLA has reached alarming proportions. People  linked to other political forces, except the Angolan Democratic  Party and [words indistinct], have been necklaced. The  mercenaries have raped children and old people [words  indistinct] it is horrifying what is happening in N'dalatando  today.    At (?0630) on 7 May a group of about [words indistinct]  (?mercenaries) backed by two T-57 tanks tried to break through  our lines east of the city. After an hour of fierce clashes,  the enemy left on the ground 18 confirmed killed and several  wounded, whose blood is still running on the paved streets. Our  forces captured 17 RPG-7 grenades, 22 ammunition belts for PKM  machine gun, 78 AGS- 17 grenades, 1,300 AK-47 rounds of  ammunitions, 18 knapsacks, 10 [word indistinct], and other  military equipment. Our soldiers are still collecting the  military equipment.</p>

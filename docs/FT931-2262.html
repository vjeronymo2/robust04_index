			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / How to Spend It: Designer gear by mail order - Quality catalogue clothes CONVENTIONAL wisdom in mail-order land has it that while it is relatively easy to sell shirts and cotton chinos, tracksuits and T-shirts through the post, selling high-priced designer ranges is another thing altogether. Patricia and Andrew Davidson thought otherwise. They had a hunch - they could not afford a catalogue and market research, so they had to rely on instinct - that there were many women who either hated shopping or did not have the time who longed for easy ways of buying quality clothes. Women living far from decent shops, women with busy careers and those who live abroad were all seen as potential mail-order customers. With nothing but Andrew's business expertise, Patricia's eye for stylish clothes and a modest amount of capital they have now launched a beautifully photographed catalogue. Its most distinctive quality perhaps is that it is small. The collection is centred round three main designers - Caroline Charles Paul Costello and Amanda Wakeley - but there is also a range of accessories from Anya Hindmarch (handbags, some classic, some witty) and Butler &amp; Wilson. These names are not new but they were not always easy to track down. Now their wares can reach homes all over the UK as well as abroad. The Davidsons' hunch that there was a mail-order market for quality designer clothing looks to be proved right. It will never be mass-market, but as niches go it seems to be doing well. Launched last week, some 3,500 catalogues have been sent out and orders are pouring in. At least three people have ordered more than Pounds 1,000 worth of clothing each. Do not expect to buy more cheaply than you would in the shops - 'the point is not price but accessibility,' says Andrew Davidson. Quality and ease of shopping are what it is all about. Paul Costello's pure silk 'toile du jouy' tea dress, for instance, is a more grown-up version of all the flower-sprigged numbers wafting into the shops. At Pounds 195 it seems good value, if not cheap. His dark navy fine wool double-breasted blazer is also well-priced at Pounds 230 but cannot begin to compete with Marks and Spencer on price terms. Amanda Wakeley's fine wool sweaters with satin cuffs may seem expensive at Pounds 220 but they do offer that magic combination of being classic and distinctive. For this catalogue most of the designers' clothes come from mainstream collections but in the pipeline for the autumn are more exclusive ranges, including some sassy cocktail dresses and evening suits from David Sassoon of Belville Sassoon. If you are interested in the spring/summer range you can order the catalogue by post or by phone: Kingshill, Little Kingshill Grange, Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire HP16 0DZ. Tel: 0494-890555. It costs Pounds 3.50 (refundable on the first purchase) plus Pounds 1 p&amp;p.</p>

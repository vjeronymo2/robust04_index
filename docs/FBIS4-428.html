			<p>BFN     [Text] Kigali, 12 Apr (AFP) -- Rwanda's interim government  this morning left the Hotel de Kigali, where it had taken up  residence, for an unknown destination, thereby causing panic in  the city. Shooting intensified in various districts by midday  leading to speculations that rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front  reinforcements from the north may have joined those already in  the capital. However, there is no reliable information about  the exact location of the front.</p>

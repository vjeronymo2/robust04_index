			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["New Analysis" by Wang Nan: "Why Is MFN a Misnomer?"] </F>   [Text] Washington, May 18 (XINHUA) -- The most favored  nation (MFN) trade status, widely interpreted as a privilege  offered by Washington to almost all of its trading partners, is  really a misnomer.    In a fundamental sense, observers here said, MFN has become  the minimum requirement of meaningful economic exchanges between  two countries and cannot be used by the U.S. to exercise  leverage in foreign policy.    "MFN status is not a concession or foreign aid, but merely  the normal basis for international trade," said Robert Manning,  senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute and researcher  at George Washington University.    As President Bill Clinton is nearing his decision on China's  MFN status, the relatively technical term has become a matter of  intense debate which, observers said, should be put in the  proper context.    The articles of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT)  contains a MFN clause that applies to all members' tariffs and  all other rules relating to imports and exports, which form the  keystone effort to liberalize trade.    Washington has two basic sets of tariff rates, with the  lower  tariff rate, referred to as MFN, applicable to most countries,  including those to which the U.S. has serious policy differences.    The non-MFN tariff rates, promulgated in the 1930  Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act at the peak of U.S. protectionism,  average over 40 percent and are believed to be instrumental in  causing the then world depression.    MFN became an instrument for Washington to express its moral  outrage in 1974, when President Richard Nixon, wanting to give  the Soviet Union MFN, tried to use it to force Moscow to permit  Jewish emigration.    With the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, MFN can be extended, and  thus renewed annually, to non-market economies only when a  special waiver is issued by the President saying that the  country does not impede emigration.    In the case of China, not a GATT member but enjoying MFN  status in the U.S. market since 1980, MFN expires on June 3  every year. Congress, if objecting to MFN renewal, must come up  with a joint resolution by September 1.    The President, then, has the option of vetoing the  resolution, in which case Congress has 15 legislative days to  override the veto only with two-thirds votes in both the Senate  and the House of Representatives.    "Ironically, the original intention of the Jackson-Vanik  Amendment has been forgotten," said Nicholas Lardy, professor at  the University of Washington and author of numerous studies on  China's economy.    On the basis of the original emigration criterion, Lardy  noted, China qualifies for MFN status since Chinese emigration  to the U.S. is restricted mainly by U.S. immigration policy  rather than by Chinese policy.    New conditions to renew China's MFN were included in  Clinton's presidential order in May 1993, although none of them  was envisaged in the Jackson-Vanik Amendment as a criterion for  extending MFN to non-market economies.    "In Christmas tree-like fashion," Robert Manning of the  Progressive Policy Institute said, "Congress added conditions to  MFN renewal as though it were stringing lights on a Christmas  tree."    These conditions include U.S. concerns on trade, human  rights  and weapons proliferation. "On its own terms, MFN  conditionality has not worked," Manning added.    In a recent statement, the National Manufacturers  Association  (NAM) described the America's unilateral imposition of  restraints on bilateral trade relations to convey concerns about  other policy as "historically ineffective".    MFN "is not an issue of us granting something to the  Chinese," NAM's president Jerry Jasinowski explained.  "Non-discriminatory or MFN treatment is the commercial  equivalent of diplomatic recognition."    Even with MFN status, observers here noted, China is still  disadvantaged in its trade with Washington as compared with most  of the other developing countries which receive other tariff  benefits.    These benefits include the Generalized System of Preferences  (GSP), the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) and the Andean Trade  Preference Act (ATPA), which offer lower tariffs to as many as  138 countries and regions in the world.</p>

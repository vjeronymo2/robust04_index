Mark Robinson, Tory MP for Somerton and Frome, and Tony  Worthington, Labour MP for Clydebank and Milngavie, were taken  hostage along with an Action Aid employee.    The Action Aid employee is believed to be Jeff Chinnock.  They were taken in North-West Somalia near a place called  Erigavo some time last night.    A spokeswoman at Worthington's office told REUTERS: "I can  confirm the reports. We have heard this morning that Tony is  well." She said the two were on a fact-finding tour of Somalia  with the charity Action Aid. "I believe they were kidnapped  yesterday. We do not know who is holding them," she said.    The Foreign Office spokesman said he believed an Action Aid  employee "was also involved" but could give no details. "We are  in close touch with our ambassador in Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) who  is speaking to local elders," said the spokesman. There had  been no ransom demand, he added. The British embassy in  neighbouring Ethiopia also has responsibility for Somalia.    The Foreign Office believe the three had been taken in a  dispute between rival clansmen. The British Embassy in Addis  Ababa has been assured the men are not in any danger. They were  on a trip to look at work by the charity Action Aid in the  region when they were taken.</p>

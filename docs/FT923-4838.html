			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Arts: Combing the Fringe - Edinburgh International Festival THE most popular bit of the Edinburgh Fringe has been the local based Communicado Company's version of Cyrano de Bergerac played in the spanking new den of the Traverse Theatre. Rostand's rhyming couplets have been faithfully translated by Edwin Morgan into the Glaswegian vernacular and somehow manage to give both an immediacy and a sense of history to the piece. 'You're so macho' is a phrase which fits the aspirations of 17th century France. There is plenty of cross-dressing, music, and sword-play, indeed an enveloping air of braggadocio which suits Cyrano well. The play is performed at such a lick that the ingredient which made it a success with Victorians its pathos, is lost. Cyrano's poetic wooing of his beloved Roxanne on behalf of the witness Christian should be one of the saddest moments in the theatre, but here it is played fast, furious, and for laughs. Tom Mannion has energy and charm enough for Cyrano, but the lack of feeling robs him of some nobility. Sandy Mcdade, too, seems untouched by the selfish vanity of Roxanne. However the nose, always a key factor in the success of Cyrano, is monstrous but credible. This is ensemble playing of great gusto. Much of the text may be lost on foreigners, but a Scottish audience hugely enjoyed the wit and vitality in Gerry Mulgrew's production. The Fringe, like the Festival, makes no critical sense - one person's pleasure is another's purgatory. My two favourite shows made it to award short-lists and then faltered. John Shuttleworth is both funny and bathetic. He is the creation of Graham Fellows, whose last taste of stardom was hiding behind Jilted John, in 1978's excruciating pop novelty hit. Shuttleworth is a redundant security guard from a Rotherham sweet factory who holds master-classes in light entertainment, passing on the skills he has honed appearing in local old folks homes. He teaches microphone technique (including vibrato); self-promotion; and song writing on the Yamaha organ. His first step on the showbiz ladder was through a memorial verse he sent to the deaths column of his local newspaper and he has not been bothered at all by the absence of a sense of humour, talent, or success. Fellows could find himself the novelty hit of 1993. Emily Woof is equally enigmatic. Her show is wilfully mis-entitled Sex III. It is a series of drama school exercises taken to perfection. The delicate, wistful Woof turns cartwheels, sings, plays the piano, and cavorts on a trapeze. She also recounts the misadventures of a young girl, obsessed with Anna Karenina, who hopes to meet her boyfriend in Spain. Rarely has style triumphed so gracefully over content. Woof's narrative leads nowhere - except to a succession of heart-tugging images. She starts as the spitting image of the cover of the Penguin Classic of Tolstoy's novel; she ends a disconnected, half-naked androgyne. The piece is transfigured by Woof's physical perfection as she crashes a balloon, performing the splits declaiming, 'don't stretch your legs for fear of becoming a boy', and, at the finale, like Anna leaping to her death, Woof flings herself off the trapeze. When inconsequence carries this much impact, it becomes its own art form. A mesmeric performance. Last year, the stand-up comics wrote themselves plays. This year they seem rather stranded, like flailing dinosaurs left behind by changing taste. The best on offer was the American Thea Vidale, who uses sex to please feminists; blackness to appease anti-racists; and good old-fashioned common sense to charm everyone. Somehow you accept her analysis of male inadequacies, her almost physical brow-beating of the audience, because Vidale has no illusions about herself or her race. The act flags in the middle as she picks out American obsessions, but it ends strongly. I even accepted the pay-off homily about her children's bleak future in a racist society. If there is a theme to the Fringe it is the exploitation of the possibilities in the current popularity of opera. In Kill Me I Love You, a quartet of professional opera singers known as Opera Circus, subjects famous arias to heavy mugging. Donizetti's Love Elixir becomes Foster's Lager, and Carmen emerges as a baritone in drag. Mime specialist David Glass directs. I preferred Recital, in which soprano Helen Noonan declaims the life of a diva. She begins by looking like the Countess in Der Rosenkavalier, all Madame de Pompadour finery, and ends in tatters. Deserted by lovers and toadies alike, her life falls apart, a decline conveyed through the arias she performs, down to a splendidly resonant 'Remember Me' from Purcell's Dido. The gap between the artificial life of the prima donna and the emotions in opera's greatest moments are powerfully conveyed.</p>

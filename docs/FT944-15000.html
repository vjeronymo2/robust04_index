			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Defence manoeuvres GEC may well want to retain the freedom to make a hostile bid for British Aerospace as a way of chivvying it into friendly talks on merging their defence interests. But actually moving ahead with a hostile bid can never have been more than a last-ditch option. BAe would have been able to use its immense strategic importance to create the most almighty political stink. The ensuing fight would have been more bitter even than GEC's two bids for Plessey in the 1980s. This does not mean Lord Weinstock will believe BAe's promise to resume friendly talks provided GEC gives it a free run in its bid for VSEL. If BAe bags the submarine maker, it will be under little pressure to accede to GEC's demands. VSEL's cash pile will strengthen BAe's balance sheet, while earnings should be enhanced as the submarine group's profits could be set against BAe's tax allowances. A bid by GEC for VSEL must therefore remain a high possibility. Lord Weinstock would probably have to pay more than VSEL was worth as a stand-alone entity. But he might be able to justify such a bid to himself on the grounds that it would keep BAe vulnerable and open to approaches. Lord Weinstock's hopes of restructuring the UK defence industry through a mega-merger may not be an ideal option. Far better to reorganise Europe's industry through a series of cross-border mergers. The snag is that concerns over national sovereignty make such deals politically impossible. But if BAe wants to escape GEC's affections once and for all, it will have to advance beyond its current mish-mash of continental alliances.</p>

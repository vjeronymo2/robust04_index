			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Lib Dem paper tackles low pay A regional minimum wage and the introduction of a low pay commission were yesterday proposed by the Liberal Democrats as options to bridge the gulf between the low paid and high wage earners. The package of proposals, outlined in a discussion paper, Working for Change, will be put to the party's conference in Brighton next month. The two options are: Establishing a regional minimum hourly rate of pay across the whole economy. A low pay commission to investigate any industrial sector or company in which it believed there was exploitation due to low pay. The commission would recommend solutions such as a minimum hourly rate in a particular sector or company. Baroness Williams, the former MP Shirley Williams, who chaired the policy working group, said: 'There are good reasons, if you are giving people exactly the same standard of living, for some variations (in pay) between one region and another.' Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, described Labour's support for a national minimum wage as 'ill-defined and inflexible'. The party is concerned that a minimum wage can destroy jobs if set too high. The party is also proposing converting social security benefits to the long-term unemployed into vouchers payable to employers taking them on. The party has estimated that the cost to the state would be 'negligible', and less than the cost of benefit and tax revenue forgone for the unemployed  -an average of Pounds 173 a week. Its document also suggests tax relief measures on the costs of child care.</p>

			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Central bank sales 'may weigh down gold market' GOLD PRODUCERS should not rely too heavily on the present fall in mine output to push the price up from current levels. Much will depend on the future action of the Central Banks who between them hold 35,619 tonnes, equivalent to 17 years' production of the indestructible metal. It is reasonable to expect the banks to become net sellers of about 700 tonnes a year from the mid-1990s, suggests Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland, in his latest quarterly Precious Metals Outlook. He points out that gold's monetary role is 'now history for private investors and central banks. Selling gold would be just part of a day's work for a central bank, not an admission that the financial world as investors know it was about to end'. Mr Smith says that if the eight countries which between them account for more than 85 per cent of central bank gold were to sell all their gold and reinvest the proceeds in interest-bearing paper, the combined annual return, in perpetuity, would be Dollars 21bn. 'On a per capita basis, the annual dividend would be impressive enough to catch the eye of even the most well-to-do taxpayer,' he adds. There is no suggestion that central banks would take this course but they are certainly under increasing pressure to include gold sales in their 'gold mobilisation' policies, says Mr Smith. For example, as part of a recent revised treatment of US net international indebtedness, the US Commerce Department revalued that country's gold reserves at market prices rather than the still official Dollars 42 a troy ounce. 'Clearly, an unrealised asset value of over Dollars 80bn has not completely escaped US official attention.' Mr Smith also points out that, if the course towards true European monetary union runs smooth, before the year 2000 a single European central bank will control 40 per cent of the world's official gold reserves - 11,600 tonnes now in EC members' vaults plus nearly 3,000 tonnes in the European Monetary Co-operation Fund. 'A single European currency reduces the principle need for reserves of any kind - intervention in currency markets. A Eurobank could economise on all reserves,' he adds. 'Seeing this, EC member states could even make pre-emptive strikes, liquidating gold and currency reserves to the benefit of taxpayers before the ink is dry on Eurobank statutes.'</p>

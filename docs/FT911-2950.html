			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Local Election Diary - Eden / Trouble in paradise THE POLITICAL issue dominating the Eden District Council elections this year is whether party politics are, in fact, desirable at all. Bounded by the Lake District to the west and the Pennines to the east, the 900 square mile Valley of Eden has long been an earthly paradise with sheep as plentiful as ideologues are rare. But are they any more? In the George Hotel amd the conspiratorial coffee houses of Penrith's Devonshire Street, citizens are agog over the Cumberland and Westmorland Herald's sensational headline: 'Eden Election Takes On a Political Outlook.' At issue is the revelation that of the council 37 seats an unprecedented 17 are being contested. Worse still, in Penrith itself - Eden's capital with some 13,000 of the Valley's 47,000 population - conventional parties have swept in to challenge a long tradition of dogma-free politics. The outgoing council had just two non-independent councillors. Now all three main parties have set up their stalls. Until recently, other issues - the proposed visitors' centre (rejected), the new pig farm (opposed) and the infamous 'Penrith Pong' emitted by an offal processing plant - have hogged local debate. Now, the politicians themselves are the talking point and, typically, they blame each other. Mr Stephen Parry, a public relations man, justifies his candidature for the Tories on the ground that Mr Peter Hodgson is standing for Labour. Mrs Joan Robinson, a Liberal Democrat, says that she has taken to a party platform as she already leads the Liberal Democrats on Cumbria Council. Despite its Clochemerle-like qualities, the issue is a serious one. While some claim the party struggle is meaningless at local level, others say it aids planning and spurs constructive action. In consequence, attention has now turned to the avowedly non-political Residents' Association that has long dominated the town. Several citizens alleged this week that several of its nine candidates were prominent masons. It was also claimed that council business is often completed well away from the chamber. An Italian P2 in Cumbria? No such allegation was made. None the less, most critics insisted on anonymity. 'There is a concern about the possibility that certain councillors are being dictated to by certain organisations,' was as far as one would go. Mr James Chambers, respected shopkeeper, mason and 25 years a councillor, denied as 'ridiculous' any suggestion of a conspiracy, promising to fight, fight and fight again to save the non-party politics he loves. That said, he conceded that Eden's era of innocence appeared to be coming to a close. As he left, his handshake was virtue itself. ****** The claims that something is rotten in the Valley of Eden owe not a little to an historic battle between Councillor John Moffat, a bluff Independent, and a council leader. In 1986, Mr Moffat was ejected by the police after trying to sit in as an observer on a working party examining council reorganisation. Protesting at what he claimed was repeated and unnecessary secrecy , Mr Moffat fought his rejection all the way to the Court of Appeal. He lost, at a cost to his own pocket of Pounds 80,000. The working party, meanwhile, came to no conclusion. ****** Ten miles away in Appleby, few dare hope that Mr Michael Heseltine's review of local government will free them from under Penrith's jackboot. The county town of Westmorland, officially killed off in the 1974 reorganisation, is now a reluctant part of Eden District though it jealously preserves its 16th century Moot Hall, its mayor and its memories - lodged in the mind of its 85-year-old historian, Mr Martin Holmes. The meddlings of Westminster and the annual gipsy horse fair aside, not a lot has happened in Appleby for the past few centuries, though there was a nasty clash last year over plans to build homes on the edge of the cricket pitch. According to Mr Holmes, the last real political excitement came during the Civil War when Lady Anne Clifford, a royalist benefactress, lived in the town under the suspicious eyes of the parliamentary garrison led by one 'Harrison the Regicide.' Lady Anne survived. But Harrison confirmed his lack of good manners by sitting up and boxing the ears of his executioner not before but after being disembowelled.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Allianz reports robust premium income growth Premium income at Allianz rose nearly 20 per cent to DM65.5bn (Dollars 39.2bn) last year, and is likely to continue growing at a double-digit rate in the current year, the Munich-based insurance group said yesterday. The rise was attributed mainly to strong growth in the group's activities outside Germany. However, it also reflected the consolidation of Deutsche Krankenversicherung, the healthcare insurance subsidiary, for the first time. The increase in premium income will be matched by a robust increase in net earnings for 1993, Allianz disclosed in documentation published yesterday in connection with its planned DM1.56bn rights issue. Earnings for 1994 were also likely to increase, Allianz revealed, although it was too early to make detailed predictions. This was on the assumption that there was no upsurge in the number of natural catastrophes for the rest of the year, Allianz explained. The Los Angeles earthquake, which struck the city in January, is likely to cost the group DM140m. Although full 1993 profits details will not be disclosed until later this year, analysts suggest net earnings will climb well above DM1bn - perhaps as high as DM1.1bn, according to some predictions - against net earnings of DM858m in the previous year. The 1994 results will reflect the impact of rationalisation measures implemented at Allianz subsidiaries in Germany and abroad during previous years. Losses from so-called 'technical insurance' are also expected to fall in 1993, Allianz said. These losses, which amounted to DM1.68bn in 1992, arise on core insurance business - premium income netted off against payments to settle insurance claims - before taking into account investment and other income. The figures, contained in advertisements placed yesterday in a number of German newspapers, are better than Allianz's earlier estimates of a 14 per cent increase in 1993 premium income for the group. Premium income outside Germany grew by 21.3 per cent to DM31.1bn, while domestic income climbed 18.2 per cent to DM34.4bn. Allianz said a number of factors influenced the improved income and earnings, including higher premium rates in the industrial sector and reduced losses at Deutsche Kreditversicherung, the former state-owned insurance monopoly in eastern Germany which Allianz acquired in 1990. Favourable currency movements also played a role, and Allianz also highlighted a surge of sales of annuity policies in the north American market.</p>

"This bitter incident is a clear proof of the tense  situation  in Karabakh which endangers the lives of innocent people and  those of foreign nationals," the Foreign Ministry said in its  statement.    The Iranian aircraft, a C-130 Hercules, was flying from  Moscow to Tehran with families of Iranian diplomats in Russia on  board on March 17, when it exploded in mid air over Karabakh  after being hit by a missile fired by Armenian troops based in  the region, shortly after the plane had contacted Yerevan  control tower at 19:10 GMT.    "The Islamic Republic of Iran reserves the right to take  legal action... and receive compensations for the victims of  the crash, and calls on the Armenian Government to identify and  punish those guilty of downing the aircraft," the Foreign  Ministry statement said.    It expressed regret that tension in Karabakh not only has  caused heavy casualties and losses but has also endangered  flight security in the region.    Those trying to fan the flame of war and heighten tension in  the region should bear the consequences of such painful  incidents, it warned.    The Foreign Ministry statement was based on a report filed  by  a team of Iranian experts dispatched to the site of crash to  probe the incident.</p>

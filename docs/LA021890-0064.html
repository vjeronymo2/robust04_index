			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANVAS BAGS BEAT PAPER AND PLASTIC  </P> <P> I wonder if you as journalists and the leaders of powerful environmental groups  are too busy concentrating on the problems we face in relationship to the  environment and are unwilling to look to some solutions.  </P> <P> There are two companies in San Diego that are now marketing reusable shopping  bags.  </P> <P> One company, Treesavers, makes theirs from canvas (that have) been picked up by  the Big Bear grocery chain, which is taking a very active and committed role  concerning the environment. These are people making a difference.  </P> <P> The question I have is why do the so-called leaders of these environmental  groups so easily and relentlessly go to war with corporate America with their  boycotts instead of focusing their attentions on the solutions that are so  blatantly in our faces. I also ask why you at The Times as our voice and ears  of what's going on report these wars and all their newsworthy ramifications and  ignore the people who are making a difference. Why isn't there a picture of a  reusable shopping bag on the cover of the article to show people how much we  can do so easily?  </P> <P> LARRY HAWES, Vista  </P></p>

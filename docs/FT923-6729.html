			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / US publishes 'hit list' of China imports THE US yesterday put pressure on China by publishing a list of Dollars 3.9bn (Pounds 2bn) in imports that could face sanctions if bilateral negotiations fail to reduce Beijing's import barriers. The 'hit list' - the largest ever published by the US - is headed by footwear and includes silk clothing, jewellery, ceramics, electronics, bicycles, watches, tea, spices, foods, and leather goods. Mr Michael Moskow, the deputy US trade representative, said an effort would be made to avoid putting tariffs of up to 100 per cent on items which would otherwise be scarce. There is also likely to be an effort to avoid damaging Hong Kong interests and to target state-run industries. The list was published for public comment after a fifth round of talks in Beijing this week failed to produce what the US sees as satisfactory progress. Chinese officials have hinted at retaliation. The two sides will meet again in mid-September and the first week in October, in the hope of achieving a settlement by October 10, the deadline set under US trade law. The US Commerce Department says its Dollars 12.7bn trade deficit with China is still growing. Imports rose almost 42 per cent in the first six months of this year, while exports increased only 18.4 per cent. The US attributes the surplus to unfair trade barriers, such as China's import substitution policy and high tariffs. Among other demands, it is pressing China to publish its laws, regulations, and judicial and administrative rulings pertaining to imports; to end import bans and restrictions; to discontinue restrictions imposed through import licensing; and to discontinue technical trade barriers, such as unreasonable standards and testing requirements. US officials present their demands as an attempt to prepare China for membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>

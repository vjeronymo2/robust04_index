The office is  located in Lomas de Chapultepec, very close to Radio ACIR.  Cuahtemoc Cardenas met with members of the PRD National Council,  chaired by Porfirio Munoz Ledo, to discuss the situation  following the murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio, PRI candidate. The  following is a report of what happened early this morning at the  PRD office.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] The PRD joined the  country's political organizations unanimous rejection of the  murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta. PRD presidential  candidate Cuahtemoc Cardenas has voiced his sorrow for the  violent action that took the life of the PRI candidate. He  strongly condemned Colosio's murder and demanded it be  immediately resolved.    [Cardenas] We deeply regret and strongly condemn this  action,  which should be resolved. All Mexicans, and particularly his  family, must learn the motives that caused the Colosio's  murderers to commit such a deplorable action.    [Reporter] Cardenas Solorzano, who met until very early this  morning with the members of his party's National Council, has  just suspended his campaign tour in Tlaxcala State. Cardenas  said it is necessary to reestablish normalcy in the country's  institutions, and added that the government has the obligation  of guaranteeing the security of all citizens and those  participating in the political events of the nation until the  August elections are held. The elections will become the fulcrum  to reestablishing the unity of all Mexicans.    [Cardenas] We must restore normalcy to the country's  institutions. We must have full guarantees for the development  of the country's normal everyday activities, including economic,  social, and political activities. The government has the  obligation of offering security to all citizens. The government  must also provide security to all of us as we exercise our  rights so political activities continue and culminate in the  elections, which we believe must be the point that will  reestablish the unity of all Mexicans.    [Reporter] The PRD candidate, who will personally present  his  condolences to the Colosio family and the PRI leadership, has  urged citizens to remain united so that normalcy of the  country's institutions can be restored as soon as possible.  Cardenas Solorzano said that although he will continue with his  electoral campaign as scheduled, he will modify his most recent  calendar activities.    [Cardenas] For the time being, the trip we had planned to  Oaxaca State will not take place, and we will closely follow  what happens these next few days. We will watch to see what  other organizations as well as the pro-government party will do.  According to its own statutes, it will have to replace the  candidate. We will see what it does. It will be a new event of  great importance for the country.    [Reporter] The PRD candidate, who talked to the press after  meeting with his party's National Council at his private office  in Las Lomas, said he thought it unadvisable and risky to  postpone the August elections.    [Cardenas] It would be more traumatic to think the elections  will not be held. That is why we feel the elections should be  held, regardless of the fact we know we are experiencing an  extremely delicate situation. We can save our institutions and  save the law by reaffirming the life of our institutions. [end  recording]</p>

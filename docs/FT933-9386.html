			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Movement in sectors as bourses consolidate SECTOR selection, consolidation and profit-taking after last week's gains were among yesterday's themes, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT saw some action in banks ahead of today's half-year results from Dresdner, but the DAX index closed only 2.92 higher at 1,872.30. Turnover fell from DM9.5bn to DM7.5bn from Friday's DM9.5bn. Dresdner rose DM5 to DM419.50 on expectations of a 10 to 12 per cent rise in first-half operating profits after risk provisions, and Deutsche Bank closed DM8.90 higher at DM781.90. There was a sceptical response to Friday's Volkswagen prediction of a profit in 1993; the shares fell DM2.80 to DM371.20. Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf noted that VW was the worst performing DAX constituent in July, with a fall of 4 per cent, but still the best performer for the first seven months of 1993 with a 43.7 per cent gain. DUBLIN put on an afternoon spurt as investors bought into Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Irish Life ahead of AIB's half year results today. The ISEQ overall index rose 27.40, or 1.6 per cent to 1,719.04. Financials were 1.8 per cent ahead with AIB 7p higher at 292p and BoI up 6p at 261p. AMSTERDAM continued to attract solid foreign demand and the CBS Tendency general index rose 0.50 to 123.90. Among cyclicals, Hoogovens rose Fl 2.00 to Fl 48.20 after touching a 1993 intraday high of Fl 49.30. The shares have doubled since January on hopes for a profit recovery from 1995, and added 27 per cent in the last month alone, aided by covering of short positions of more than 1.3m shares. BRUSSELS edged ahead with the Bel-20 index 0.45 higher at 1,343.14 in low turnover of BFr1.02bn. Steel stocks, increasingly viewed as a good recovery play, were again in demand. Cockerill Sambre reached BFr139 before profit-taking left it just BFr1 higher at BFr134 in heavy volume of 622,000 shares. Arbed, the Luxembourg steel group, rose BFr140 or 3.4 per cent to BFr4,275. MILAN put in a strong performance in heavy volume, with the market again led by the strength of the telecommunications sector. The Comit index rose 8.83 to 590.31. Sip gained L66 to L3,415.5 in volume of 24.3m shares while Stet slipped L23 to L4,131 in 8.31m shares. Italcable rose L731 or 8.7 per cent to L9,146 following the government plans to merge it with Sip. Olivetti rose on renewed speculative hopes it could gain from the end of Sip's monopoly in mobile phones. The stock ended L84 lire up at L1,960. PARIS consolidated in gentle profit-taking after Friday's record close, the CAC-40 index falling 11.31 to 2,138.52 in turnover down from FFr5.2bn to FFr3.15bn. Cyclicals inched up, Michelin rising FFr3.30 to FFr191.40 and Peugeot by FFr7 to FFr687. The building materials supplier, Lafarge-Coppee, also bucked the market trend with a gain of FFr11.50 to FFr456. and FFr2 to FFr. Alcatel fell FFr8 to FFr690 after a 3.7 per cent fall in first half sales at Alcatel Cable. ZURICH ran into profit-taking in banks, insurers and recently strong cyclical shares and the SMI index shed 3.0 to 2,420.5. The major banks, which have risen strongly in recent weeks, encountered selling from investors wanting to take profits ahead of half-year results which start with UBS on Thursday. UBS bearers fell SFr14 to SFr1,210. Nestle, the most active share, rose SFr13 to SFr1,031, reversing its decline of last week. Swissair picked up SFr13 to finish at SFr 728 on bargain hunting after Friday's larger than expected first half loss. OSLO climbed to a 1993 high with the all share index up 3.37 at 549.87 in hefty turnover of NKr618m, with the interest rate outlook continuing to fuel the market. HELSINKI was sharply higher on low money market rates and the HEX index added 37.4 or 2.8 per cent to 1,389.7. VIENNA broke up through 1,000 on the ATX index to set a new 14-month closing high of 1,005.3, up 15.83 or 1.6 per cent. But with ATX futures leading the market up, some dealers said that the tail was wagging the dog. TEL AVIV rose in moderate volume, the blue chip index ending 2.07 higher at 198.52 in turnover of Shk188m. ATHENS climbed on hopes that a bill for the partial privatisation of OTE, the Greek telecommunications company, would be passed in parliament this week. The general index closed 25.30, or 2.8 per cent higher at 916.25.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- August 9                                           THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open      10.30       11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1269.70    1270.75     1272.13    1272.33 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1350.89    1352.04     1352.83    1354.20  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00      14.00       15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1271.66    1270.93     1269.85    1269.95 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1352.72    1352.43     1353.39    1352.97  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Aug 6     Aug 5     Aug 4     Aug 3     Aug 2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1272.34   1268.56   1268.09   1261.49   1252.49 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1348.44   1340.80   1339.61   1341.55   1347.49  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1272.97; 200 - 1354.49 Low/day: 100 - 1269.32  200 - 1350.39.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

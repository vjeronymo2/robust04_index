			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARGAIN CORNER: RAIL PASS OFFERS FLEXIBILITY ON TRAVEL TO SWITZERLAND  </P> <P> SwissRail's Flexipass offers three days of unlimited rail travel within a  15-day period, and includes boat travel on some lakes and the use of buses. The  three days do not have to be consecutive. It costs $149 first-class and $99  second-class.  </P> <P> If you want to mix rail and car travel, look into the Swiss Rail/Drive Pass  that offers three days of unlimited rail travel and two days' use of a Hertz  rental car within a 15-day period. The five days, whether by rail or car, don't  have to be consecutive.  </P> <P> Rates depend on the car and whether it's for one or two persons. Lowest rate  for two people on first-class rail travel is $179 per person; second-class,  $129. On a solo basis, with first-class rail travel, the rate is $249;  second-class costs $199.  </P> <P> There is no mileage charge and the cars can be dropped off anywhere in  Switzerland. Reservations should be made at least seven days before departure  from the United States.  </P> <P> The regular Swisspass allows unlimited rail travel for eight or 15 consecutive  days within a month. The eight-day pass costs $180 first-class, $125  second-class. The 15-day pass is $220 first-class, $155 second-class. One-month  cards cost $300 and $210.  </P> <P> Rail passes cover such famous Swiss trains as the Glacier Express, Bernina  Express and Wilhelm Tell Express. Pass holders also get a 25% to 50% discount  on private Alpine railways and cable cars.  </P> <P> The one-month Swisscard, available for $80 first-class and $65 second-class,  includes round-trip rail transportation from arrival points in Switzerland  (either at the border or at Zurich or Geneva airports) to a destination within  the country. Travelers also can buy rail, bus and lake-boat tickets at 50% off  regular prices during this one-month period.  </P> <P> These passes and cards are good for six months from the date of purchase; the  time period begins when first used. They have to be bought in the United States  from travel agents or French Rail, which serves as Swissrail's agent in North  America. JACK ADLER  </P></p>

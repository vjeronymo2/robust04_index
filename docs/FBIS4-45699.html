			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPEAN REPORT: </F> "Strengthening of Cooperation To Clean up Eastern Europe"]    [Text] It is vital for cooperation in the area of the  environment to be "strengthened in order to avoid unfair  competition on the basis of dramatically low environmental  standards," claimed Ioannis Paleokrassas the EU Environment  Commissioner on April 26. Attending a conference organised by  Forum Europe on the theme of "the Greening of Eastern Europe,"  the Commissioner added "we cannot afford to let Central and  Eastern Europe's environment slip down the European agenda." He  said that EU standards and practices such as environmental  impact assessment, as well as the polluter-pays principle "would  have to be implemented step by step in the candidate countries."    The Romanian Environment Minister Aurel Constantin Ilie was  also attending the Forum Europe conference, and held talks with  the Commissioner. He felt that for there to be any chance of  Eastern Europe being "cleaned up" in the near future, the West  would have to finance projects and give access to the necessary  modern technologies.</p>

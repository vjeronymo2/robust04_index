			<p>BFN     [Text] A drastic restructuring of the republican television  and radio has started in Kazakhstan. In accordance with a  decree signed by President Nursultan Nazarbayev today, the state  Kazakhstan TV and Radio Broadcasting Company is to be closed  down and a republican corporation of Kazakhstan's television and  radio is to be set up instead.    The head of state says his decision has been caused by  objective necessity: It is obvious that the state broadcasting  company has lost the struggle for the radio audience to the  numerous commercial studios and stations in Kazakhstan, as well  as to programs broadcast from Moscow. It is no coincidence that  (Leyla Beketova), head of a commercial TV channel, has been  appointed president of the new corporation.    At the same time, one can clearly see that the Kazakhstan  head of state is striving to increase his own influence on the  Republic's television and radio broadcasting. For instance, the  top official of the corporation will be directly subordinate to  him. The president of the Republic has also appointed a senior  official from his press service as his permanent representative  in the new structure.</p>

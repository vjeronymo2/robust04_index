"The cabinet listened to the reports with satisfaction and  expressed... gratitude," Klaus told journalists, adding that the  issue had been also discussed at the session in a matter-of-fact  manner.    Asked about a meeting of the presidents of the Czech  Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Germany, Poland, and Austria  reported yesterday to be planned for on April 14-15 in the east  Bohemian city of Litomysl, Havel said "such a meeting was under  preparation and would be held as an unofficial one on the  occasion of some cultural event." However, Havel said that for  the time being nobody was capable of saying anything specific  about the planned meeting.    The meeting was preliminarily planned during a similar  meeting in July in Salzburg, where Czech, German, Austrian, and  Hungarian Presidents Vaclav Havel, Thomas Klestil, Richard von  Weizsaecker, and Arpad Goncz met on the occasion of the Salzburg  musical festival.</p>

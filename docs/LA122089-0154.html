PLANT  </P> <P> Upjohn Co. said today it will take an after-tax restructuring charge of about  $200 million in the fourth quarter to pay for closing down a chemical plant and  other costs.  </P> <P> The pharmaceuticals company said it will scale back production at its North  Haven, Conn., Fine Chemical plant, beginning in 1990, as a first stage in a  three-year phase-out of the operation. It also will record a number of other  non-recurring charges, including the estimated cost of a previously announced  early retirement plan for U.S. employees.  </P> <P> "These charges primarily reflect steps we are taking to become more competitive  in our core pharmaceutical business," Chairman Theodore Cooper said in a  statement. "They will make us a stronger company in 1990 and beyond."  </P> <P> Kalamazoo, Mich.-based Upjohn said it plans to sell its industrial chemical  product lines and technologies during 1990.  </P></p>

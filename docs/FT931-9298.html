			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Letter: Housing associations see threat to their future from government plans to make cuts in grant rates Sir, I was delighted to see your leader on housing policy and as usual it went straight to the point. It must be extremely tempting for the Treasury to attempt to reduce the procurement cost of new social housing, and reduction of the grant from 72 per cent for each new home to 55 per cent must to the purely mathematically minded seem a good solution. It is vitally important, however, that in all government spending calculations 'value for money' is used in a proper sense. If the result of such cuts is an immediate increase in revenue costs and, most importantly, very predictable extra expenses in the future, it will have been a false economy. Housing associations are no longer the Sunday afternoon charitable affairs that they may once have been, but are staffed by first-rate professionals answerable to management committees which contain many of us who are used to operating in the harsh private sector for our working lives. Significant strides have been made in efficiency and in methods of cost-effective procurement. All this, however, will be wasted if, as a result of over-doctrinaire policies, either they have to stop developing at all or reduce standards and thus incur future costs.

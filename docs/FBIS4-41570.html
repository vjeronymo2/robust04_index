			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan ("GOLOS ARMENII" Daily-Past), 06/25/94 --  It's hard to say for sure, what is the current situation  regarding the construction of an Iran-Armenia gas pipe-line,  though official discussions in this regard were being carried  for several years. The information from official sources is  quite contradictory.    According to RA [Republic of Armenia] Governmental press  service, the matter is getting no further than negotiations, and  representatives of both sides continue discussion of  construction details.    At the same time, RA Ministry of Fuel and Energy reported  that the negotiations have been finished, and projecting work is  currently being done.</p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Siting the Games FROM THE beginning of the modern Olympic movement a century ago, the right to host the quadrennial games has been hotly contested. At first the contestants were merely the sporting establishments in different countries - in 1896 the Greek government was apparently not consulted - but the issue inevitably became politicised as the prestige of the Games grew. National and civic pride were involved from the start. The economic and commercial stakes have also become considerable, although the costs have kept pace: few have forgotten the spectacular overrun at Montreal in 1976. Since that time financial guarantees, from national governments and private interests (especially television), have been a big consideration for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in deciding where to hold the Games. The support of American television and other corporate sponsors was almost certainly decisive in securing the 1996 Games for Atlanta, when many had expected that for their centenary they would return to Greece. Favoured city The IOC has also tended to make its decisions further and further in advance. The choice for 1996 was made in September 1990; that for 2000 is to be made this week. The object of this is, of course, to give the favoured city time for the more and more spectacular preparations that are deemed necessary. Hosting the Olympics has come to be seen as the key to unlock a veritable El Dorado of public and private investment. Even a bid which is not given a very strong chance of success - like that of Manchester this time - can be used as the centrepiece of a development strategy aimed at changing a city's image. But the Olympics cannot work miracles, as the authorities in Brasilia implicitly recognised when they withdrew their bid last month. It is no good having the backing of your national authorities if they themselves are generally perceived as insolvent. Perhaps unfairly, similar consid-erations will almost certainly rule out Istanbul, while Berlin has to contend with the memory of the 1936 Olympics, opened by Chancellor Adolf Hitler and ably exploited by his propaganda chief Josef Goebbels. The final choice seems likely to be between Sydney and Beijing. The former has many technical considerations in its favour, but the latter may have the edge for reasons largely unconnected with sport. The Chinese authorities desperately want it, and China is now widely seen as the most exciting area of the world economy. Troubled memories Yet it would surely be imprudent, as well as unjust, to let memories of 1936 count against Berlin while giving Beijing the benefit of the doubt. If 1936 looms large in Berlin's case, it is because a minority of the city's own inhabitants is deeply troubled by those memories, and is free to draw attention to them. The memory of what happened in Beijing in 1989 - the Tiananmen Square massacre - may not have been drawn so directly to the IOC's attention, but it should be much fresher. No doubt things have improved in China since then, and with luck by 2000 they will have improved even more. But who can possibly tell? The IOC should not risk inflicting on the world another drama like that of Mexico in 1968, when the Games were held in a city from which the blood of hundreds of student rioters had scarcely been cleaned; nor yet another dilemma like that of Moscow in 1980, when those who competed, in defiance of a US-led boycott, found themselves implicitly condoning the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Trade sanctions are not an appropriate way to advance the cause of human rights in China. But to commit the world to holding its top sporting event in Beijing in seven years would amount to a vote of confidence in China's rulers which they cannot be said to have earned. The Chinese authorities have in recent weeks sought to boost their chances by taking steps to improve their image on human rights. But they have also corralled their citizens into assisting their bid in typically repressive fashion and would almost certainly do likewise during the event itself. Beijing should be told that it can stage the Games only when its own people are at liberty to enjoy them.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Review fails to calm fears Few of the uncertainties hanging over the UK's armed forces were resolved by the white paper yesterday. The results of Front Line First, the review of defence costs ordered after the last Budget, will not be published until the end of July, said Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary. The review is aimed primarily at saving money in the armed forces support staff and should not affect fighting strength. But base closures, privatisation of some services and up to 20,000 job losses are expected. Rosyth naval base in Fife could face closure under the review, putting at risk 1,600 naval jobs and 400 civilian posts. Its operations have been scaled back in recent years and the small ships handled there may be transferred to Portsmouth. Rosyth dockyard would not be affected. The RAF's support services are also a target because maintainance of aircraft is particularly labour-intensive and costly. The Logistics Command employs 13,000 people and could be transferred to the private sector. Some defence analysts, however, expect a substantially slimmed-down operation to run in tandem with private-sector maintenance companies. Other large manpower cuts might include slimming the Procurement Executive, responsible for buying forces' equipment, and running down medical and veterinary services. Leasing vehicles is another possibility. The initiative is unlikely to extend as far as tanks and the armed forces' stock of 90,000 cars, Land Rovers and trucks may not be attractive to the private sector. But new batches of vehicles may be leased from private companies, which would also be responsible for maintenance. Old inter-service rivalries may be challenged. Analysts think consolidating all three staff colleges into a single base at Camberley would be logical. Staff from the RAF headquarters at High Wycombe and the Army HQ at Wilton may also be squeezed into a unified command at the Navy's base at Northwood. Smaller targets for the MoD knife may include chaplains and music, though both may arose strong sentiments. Regimental bands have been protected before and privatising spiritual support may also face opposition from Conservative backbenchers. The review team even has a working party studying the cost of armed forces regulations. Mr Rifkind yesterday acknowledged that it was a time of uncertainty for armed forces support personnel, though he emphasised that cuts would not compromise the effectiveness of front-line forces. If the review produced savings beyond the Pounds 750m a year by 1997 required by the Treasury, then the Ministry of Defence would be able to spend the money on improvements to fighting forces.</p>

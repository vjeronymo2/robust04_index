			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In summary, Entela, Inc. claims that it maintains the experience, expertise, personnel, organization, equipment, and facilities suitable for accreditation as an OSHA Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Entela's Grand Rapids facility consists of two adjacent structures that each contain two buildings covering a total of 40,000 square feet. Approximately 20,000 square feet of floor space is allocated to product testing. The main reception area is housed in the main building, along with the conference room, main records storage area, the wet chemistry labs, small scale flammability test room, tensile test area, with the metallurgical laboratories located on the upper floor. The weathering and environmental aging chambers, administrative offices, and nuclear records storage area are located in a leased building attached to this main building. The third building contains the appliance test area, vibration and electronics laboratory. The fourth building contains the Quality Assurance Department, certain records storage, California flammability test chamber, fabrication shop, and a metrology laboratory. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Natural gas and city water and electricity are supplied to all of the buildings. Special utilities include liquid nitrogen which is stored outside the second building, and a de-ionized water system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental conditions are controlled in specific laboratory areas. The temperature and humidity variations in these laboratories are continuously monitored and recorded, as required by specific test requirements. There are temperature and humidity chambers to control and monitor environmental conditions for specific product testing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The laboratory has a shipping and receiving department for receipt, retention, and disposal of samples for testing. Incoming samples are inspected and identified with numbered tags. All samples for one test have tags with the same number. Each unique tag number, the samples, and the purchase order, are reviewed, and the shipping/receiving clerk prepares a work order request, after which the samples are distributed to the test areas and copies of the work order distributed to the appropriate departments. A copy of each unique tag and work order is retained by the shipping and receiving department. Another copy of the work order is sent to the test department with the samples. The test department completes the work order when all product evaluations are accomplished, and returns it to the shipping and receiving department for sample disposition. The sample inventory and traceability information is kept in the shipping and receiving log, and work order information is maintained on a computer data-base. All storage locations for incoming samples are in the shipping and receiving areas, which are located indoors. The laboratory is automating the shipping and receiving numbering system so that the work order numbers are identical with the sample tags. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each staff member wears an Entela photo I.D. Visitors can only enter via the front lobby and are required to sign in on the visitor log. They are issued safety glasses and name tags by the receptionist and are escorted while on the premises. Other entrances are kept locked with limited access. Separate test and conference areas are available for those clients requiring confidentiality. The use of screens and partitions are also utilized in the laboratory. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

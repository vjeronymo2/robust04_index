"The three sides  could not reach an agreement," said Shigeru Goda, chairman of  the Shipbuilders Association of Japan, at a regular press  conference.    Japan and Europe have been asking South Korea to voluntarily  reduce its shipbuilding capacity which has strengthened  noticeably this year since the abolition in late 1993 of a South  Korean law restricting the growth of shipbuilding capacity. The  South Korean shipbuilding industry has become even more  conspicuous as the competitiveness of Japanese shipbuilders has  declined with the appreciation of the Japanese currency.    Goda said that during the Japan-South Korea, and Japan-South  Korea-Europe talks held from March 12 to 14, Japanese and  European officials said the global shipbuilding industry would  be able to meet future demand at the current level of  shipbuilding capacity. They pointed to the danger of excess  shipbuilding capacity leading to lower prices and an eventual  slump in the industry, Goda said.    South Korea responded that their government is pursuing a  policy of easing restrictions, and that they have no intention  of extending their share of the market by cheaper prices, Goda  said.    In 1993, South Korea surpassed Japan to become the world's  largest shipbuilder, with orders totaling 9.52 million tons.</p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Letter: Money not well spent Sir, I was surprised to read that, in spite of low profit, Pilkington decided to maintain its interim dividend, funded largely from reserves ('Pilkington raids reserves for dividend', December 11). It strikes me that the short-term interests of the shareholders are being met to their long-term disadvantage. As national officer of the GMB union representing many Pilkington employees, I cannot believe that Pilkington reserves could not have been better spent on research and development to maintain its technological lead, on new training initiatives to increase the skills of the workforce, on capital investment to replace some of the jobs the company has lost or plans to lose, or on a mixture of all three. From a leading company that had a reputation for planning ahead and looking after the interests of its employees this seems to me to be the worst kind of short-termism. Allan Black, GMB, 22-24 Worple Road, London SW19 4DD</p>

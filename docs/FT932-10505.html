			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Tory MPs call for cabinet reshuffle TORY MPs' alarm at the scale of Thursday's election losses ran deep yesterday as appeals for unity and resolve were drowned by calls for a cabinet reshuffle and firm leadership. Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor, faced the threat of a renewed campaign of vilification, presaging fresh uncertainty surrounding his position. One minister agreed there was 'strong pressure' within the party on the chancellor. 'He feels that he has been the lightning conductor for the government's unpopularity,' an aide to Mr Lamont admitted. Mr John Watts, Tory chairman of the Commons' Treasury committee, defended Mr Lamont, saying: 'I wouldn't wish to shoot the pianist now that he's playing the right tune. If we start to behave like the Labour party and squabble among ourselves, public confidence is sapped.' Some saw little alternative to pressing on with existing policies and personalities in the belief Conservatives' luck will turn - but even here there was a sense of stunned confusion. Sir Terence Higgins, Conservative MP for Worthing, said: 'People had underestimated the difficulty of governing when you don't have a Commons' majority on the issue which is the main headline of the day - Maastricht.' But privately Tory MPs listed a series of presentational blunders (coal, VAT on fuel, privatisation of rural post offices) and failures to consult properly (schools' testing). The most vociferous criticism came from known dissenters and Maastricht rebels. Sir George Gardiner, Tory MP for Reigate, said: 'We are in deep trouble and until we listen to our natural supporters we won't get out of it.' Lord Tebbit, former party chairman, said: 'Newbury was a warning to the government that it could lose the affection and the trust of the people of this country unless in some way it changes course'. But even Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, refused to back Mr Lamont without qualification: 'Nothing will be ruled out in terms of getting our policies through,' he said. 'It would not be very clever to just dismiss what has taken place as if somehow we can just soldier on.' A normally loyal home counties' MP was scathing: 'People are absolutely fed up to the back teeth with what they see as incompetence, indecision and drift in the government. 'Mr Lamont is regarded with something pretty close to contempt by rock solid Tories and there is a great deal of personal criticism of the prime minister himself.' Mr Lamont yesterday shrugged off the government's electoral reverses and responded with a robust commitment of his determination to ensure sustained economic recovery, Paul Cheeseright writes. Speaking to the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, he acknowledged that the Newbury by-election and county council election results were 'extremely disappointing and we must take them seriously'. But he sought to switch the political and economic debate on to a longer-term basis. 'How do we ensure that Britain's scientific excellence is translated into commercial achievement? How can we train enough young people in the technological and business skills we need to win markets abroad?' he asked. These are some of the questions for debate, he suggested. He inferred a degree of inevitability about the electoral losses. It had been a hard fight to reduce inflation. 'It's been a long struggle and it doesn't make us very popular,' he said.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COUNCILS WITH CHANGE OF CONTROL  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ENGLAND  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bedfordshire         NOC (Lab)         Lab overtakes Con Berkshire            NOC (LD)           LD overtakes Con Cornwall                  LD               gain from NOC Devon                NOC (LD)              gain from Con Dorset               NOC (LD)              gain from Con East Sussex          NOC (LD)              gain from Con Essex                NOC (Lab)             gain from NOC Hampshire            NOC (LD)              gain from Con Hertfordshire        NOC (Lab)             gain from Con Kent                 NOC (Con)             gain from Con Leicestershire       NOC (Lab)         Lab overtakes Con Lincolnshire         NOC (Con)             gain from Con Norfolk              NOC (Con)             gain from Con Northamptonshire          Lab              gain from NOC North Yorkshire      NOC (LD)           LD overtakes Con Somerset                  LD               gain from Con Suffolk              NOC (Lab)             gain from Con Surrey               NOC (Con)             gain from Con Warwickshire         NOC (Lab)             gain from Con West Sussex          NOC (LD)              gain from Con WALES No change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A record number of counties - 26 in England and two in Wales - has no overall control, after the Conservatives lost control of 13 councils.

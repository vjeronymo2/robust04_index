			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Traders digest factors behind latest pulled issue FIRST an upheaval in Scandinavian financial markets; then a change in Italian tax rules; now a possible change in a borrower's credit rating: the Eurobond market was yesterday digesting the latest reason for abandoning an underwritten bond issue. The news of the third issue to be withdrawn in recent days emerged late on Friday night when NatWest Capital Markets issued a joint statement with Spintab, a Scandinavian borrower, that Pounds 150m (Dollars 295.5m) of floating rate notes launched as recently as three weeks ago were to be pulled. The disarray in Scandinavian financial markets was partly blamed for the move, although a decision by Moody's Investors' Service, the US rating agency, to put the company under review for a possible downgrade seemed to have been a more important factor. The subscription agreement for the issue was due to be signed today. Ahead of a signing, said one bank in the syndicate, the underwriting arrangement had no legal force - although there was an obvious moral obligation on the underwriters, who were to be paid 20 basis points for taking on the risk. All trades that have taken place in the three weeks are now void. The decision to pull the issue left banks divided, with some claiming that NatWest should have gone ahead at so late a stage. Another bank in the syndicate, however, said that on balance it was better to have abandoned the issue when a fundamental question about the borrower's credit standing had arisen. The circumstances prompted some to make comparisons with a NatWest bond issue for Hammerson, the UK property company, earlier in the year, which had been made shortly before the company's credit rating had been cut. 'That caused a bit of a row and raised questions about how well NatWest had done their due diligence,' said one banker. NatWest said yesterday: 'We felt that in the interests of investors, it was the right thing to have done.' It added that a 'substantial' proportion of the bonds had been sold. The rash of underwritten issues to be pulled since the middle of last week - more than most bankers can remember in the past six years put together - has thrown into question the value of underwriting, and the circumstances in which bond issues should properly be abandoned. Most bankers agree, though, that it is not in a borrower's interests to proceed with an issue which will flop. Meanwhile, against the background of turbulence in the European government bond markets, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch ventured to launch a Dollars 2bn global offering for the province of Ontario - a move that puzzled many bankers. 'It was sprung on the market when something more important was occupying the minds of investors,' said one bank involved in the deal. 'It has taken the wind out of Ontario's sails.' At an indicated 46-48 basis points over US Treasuries, the bonds, to be priced today, were generally thought to be fairly priced. While most banks reported little interest, however, the joint lead managers said that they had managed between them to place more than Dollars 1bn of the bonds by the end of the day in Europe. With another day to sell in the Far East (although the Tokyo market will be shut today for a holiday) and the morning in Europe, the managers said they were confident the issue would be a success.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (14): Operators buck the trend - Italy GOING against a trend which saw a slight downturn in overall Italian demand, about 2.5 per cent more vehicles were delivered to the country's fleet operators last year than in 1990. Though precise statistics are not available, industry experts estimate that fleet operators took more than 400,000 new vehicles on to their books in 1991, equal to about 20 per cent of Italy's total market. The number of saloon cars bought by operators is estimated at 320,000. In addition, Italian fleet operators purchased about 80,000 light vans, below the half-ton threshold and mainly saloon derivatives. Though fleet operators bought a large number of vans, figures from Turin automobile-maker Fiat reveal significant bias towards the higher market segments. Whereas segments E and D represent 16.9 and 22.4 per cent respectively of total fleet purchases, these segments account for only 6 and 16 per cent of the total Italian market. At the other end of the scale, segments A and B represent 9.8 and 44.5 per cent of the total automobile market respectively, but only 6.3 and 24.8 per cent of fleet purchases. The biggest fleet operator, with its flotilla of official cars, is the public sector. In addition to the standard macchine blu (dark blue cars), there are vehicles of sundry colours, some bearing rotating blue lights, others carrying gun-toting law officers riding shotgun and others merely displaying discreet official discs. From ministries to state and quasi-state bodies, state-controlled corporations and banks, and the local communal authorities, this part of Italy's fleet market bought 120,000 vehicles last year. This was four times greater than sales to car rental operators. The largest single fleet operator in Italy, outside the military, is the SIP state telephone corporation. Of its 40,000 vehicles, dispersed the length and breadth of the Italian boot and on the islands, about 34,000 are Fiat Pandas and derivatives. The remainder also carry 'made-in-Italy' badges, an aspect that characterises virtually all the country's public sector fleets. Indeed Fiat Group, comprising Fiat, Lancia, Autobianchi and Alfa Romeo, won 52 per cent of the total fleet segment last year. This was around five points higher than the group's standing in the market overall. But changes in purchasing preference appear to be under way. General Motors has set the pace in this process. Two years ago it achieved the first sales of imports to the public sector by selling Kadett and Astra station wagons to the ENI state hydrocarbons holding corporation. Last year it sold Rascal small vans to the electricity corporation ENEL and to two ministries. Rover, with its Land Rover four-wheeled drive cross-country vehicle, also ranks ENEL among its customers. Importers also see opportunities at SIP. Indeed, while admitting that nationally-built vehicles have precedence, fleet managers at the telephone corporation say they have started to examine the ranges offered by importers. 'The public sector is starting to open, with state bodies and corporations being more willing to consider change than ministries. But importers have only been able to erode Fiat's position with specialist vehicles for which the Turin company cannot offer an alternative. It will be real progress when importers sell their saloon models to the public sector,' says Elio Tiberi, General Motors' fleet sales manager. Since Fiat's acquisition of Alfa Romeo, there is concern about the monopoly position that the Turin Group has won in domestic production. However, adds Mr Tiberi, public sector purchasers are nevertheless subject to considerable pressure to buy Italian. Some industry experts believe that the group has been able to use its position as sole national manufacturer when setting prices. Mr Tiberi notes that importers generally offer between 10 and 12 per cent basic discount on list prices, together with volume-related discounts of 6 per cent and more. It is thought that, where it gives discounts to the public sector, Fiat offers rather less. But, as in other countries, Italy's fleet operators' choices are not determined only by initial purchase price. Trade-in value is an important factor. And this is giving a significant advantage to importers whose increasing market share in Italy owes much to the attractiveness of model ranges, as well as to competitive prices. 'Private sector businesses in Italy are lengthening their lists of staff eligible for company cars and offering a choice of models. Usually staff opt for the most attractive, which are often those with the highest re-sale value. We emphasise the importance of re-sale when negotiating with clients,' says Mr Tiberi. That this aspect is increasingly an area of competition is confirmed by Fiat. A spokesman notes that the group fixes buy-back prices on large fleet contracts at the time of sale. The maintenance factor is also attracting greater attention. 'In the past imported cars had a reputation for poor and expensive spares supplies and service networks. This is no longer true and all major imported makes offer after-sales back-up that matches Italian makes,' says Mr Tiberi. Maintenance is a top priority for fleet managers at SIP, whose vehicles, which cover an annual total of about 370m kilometres, have a ceiling of 90,000km or nine years in service with the corporation. They are subject to checks at intervals of six months or 2,500km and to full maintenance servicing annually or after 10,000km. In addition to employing several hundred of its own mechanics, SIP has agreements with garages throughout Italy. 'Fiat's consolidated presence through an enormous network provides the assurance of nationwide maintenance service that SIP's widely-spread fleet requires,' says a senior executive at the telephone corporation. Though it contracts out a substantial part of its maintenance workload, SIP owns the vehicles in its fleet. But more operators are deciding they do not want responsibility for maintenance or for the many other aspects of fleet management. Leasing and hiring are becoming more popular. 'Companies are able to axe whole departments and reduce their overheads. By buying full service, they eliminate all the administrative details of maintenance, repairs, insurance, vehicle licences, fines and many other worries,' says a Fiat spokesman. General Motors's Mr Tiberi agrees. 'Italy's high labour costs encourage firms to look carefully for opportunities to cut payrolls. Hiring and operational leasing offer practical solutions to the problem. The leasing businesses established by the main car rental firms provide high efficiency and cost containment.' Leasing and hiring are expected to expand significantly as vehicle fleets in Italy continue their growth trend.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / International Company News: Bloomberg to tune radio listeners into stock prices / Examining the rapid expansion of a US financial news and information group The day after Mr Michael Bloomberg paid Dollars 13.5m for WNEW AM, one of New York's most famous music radio stations, there was no shortage of people  -from the security guard at his Park Avenue office to the Korean newsagent near his home - asking him for a job. 'Everybody, it seems, wants to be a disc jockey,' Mr Bloomberg said resignedly after the acquisition was announced. Disc jockeys, however, do not figure in the station's future. Sinatra will be replaced by stock prices. WNEW will become WBBR (Bloomberg Business Radio), and a fast-growing financial news and data company, Bloomberg Financial Markets, will have taken another step forward. Mr Bloomberg's journey began in 1981 when he was fired by Wall Street securities house Salomon Brothers over differences with the management - he kept telling them how to do their job. The day after he left Salomon, he began his search on Wall Street for someone to back his company, which would supply dealers and investors with electronic data on financial markets. The only firm interested was Merrill Lynch, which took a 30 per cent stake in the tiny venture. Today, Merrill's investment has paid off handsomely. More than 20,000 customers around the world have Bloomberg's terminals on their desks. They cost Dollars 1,100 a month to rent, which brings in annual revenues of Dollars 264m. The growth rate of new rentals has never been higher, with customers attracted by the system's easy-to-use analytical capabilities and its reputation for service. A year ago Bloomberg was renting 325 new terminals a month, today it rents 625 a month. Apart from its terminals, which carry a huge range of market prices, statistical data and analytics, Bloomberg runs a financial newswire service and it publishes specialist newsletters and a glossy magazine for its customers. Despite an impressive growth record, Bloomberg remains one of the smaller players in the Dollars 4.5bn electronic information business. Reuters dominates the market with more than 200,000 terminals. Second is Telerate, which is owned by the Dow Jones company and has about 90,000 terminals, and third biggest is Citicorp-owned Quotron, with about 65,000 terminals. In the newswire business, Bloomberg not only has to contend with Reuters and Dow Jones, but also Knight-Ridder. Seeking to stretch the technological boundaries, Bloomberg plans later this year to provide its customers with an audio and video capacity on their terminals. Users will be able to hear the news, interviews and speeches of the day direct from their screens, accompanied by static pictures of relevant material. Sitting in his Park Avenue office surrounded by framed profiles from the pages of US newspapers and magazines, Mr Bloomberg displayed obvious pride in his company's achievements. Yet despite his forays into news journalism, publishing and now broadcasting, he insists the terminals remain the most important part of the Bloomberg machine. 'The radio station is a natural extension of our business,' says Mr Bloomberg. 'It is designed to enhance the reputation of our news product, which is only available over our terminals. It all fits together. 'In the end, what drives this company is renting terminals. That's the way we make a living. The magazine helps that, the radio station will help that.' Never one to shy from loudly criticising his competitors, Mr Bloomberg argues that many of the problems they have encountered - Quotron has been a huge drain on the resources of its parent, Citicorp, while Telerate has struggled to keep its customers in the face of heightened competition - can be traced to the fact that the parent companies have lost sight of what they are selling. He says: 'We are a one product company. Take a look at Dow Jones, they are a one product company, and the product is the Wall Street Journal. 'They just either didn't realise it, or maybe realised it and made a mistake, but Telerate never helped the sales of the Journal - that's the cash cow. In our case the radio station and magazine are designed to help sell our product.' Bloomberg's rivals have not stood idly by watching the new upstart steal their business. Reuters launched its Decision 2000 analytics package last year, Telerate has won some plaudits with its new Matrix system, and EJV, a joint venture between six big Wall Street securities houses, will soon be selling its own product, UniVu. With its open architecture, UniVu can take data and analytics from any number of sources, striking at the heart of Bloomberg's biggest weakness - the fact that because it is a closed system, cust-omers can only use the calc-ulations and formulas for analytics provided by Bloomberg. To use anything else, they have to turn to a different terminal. This is a source of frustration to many users, who increasingly want everything housed in one terminal. Ms Patricia Zlotin, an investment manager with Massachusetts Financial Services in Boston says: 'We're looking for something that can interact and be combined with other systems. The stand-alone systems will lose market share as space on desks becomes more of a premium.' Mr Bloomberg, however, confidently dismisses criticisms that his machines are inflexible. 'We are close to completing a system that will allow anyone to run their analytics on our system using our data, our calculation libraries, our communication system . . . that is the openness that the users really want.'</p>

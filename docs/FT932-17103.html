			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Official fears on bus deregulation THE Department of Transport has acknowledged that the deregulation of bus services outside London in the late 1980s may have had harmful as well as beneficial effects. It has circulated a consultation paper in the bus industry which lists widespread concerns about the way deregulation has worked and seeks suggestions for improvements. The consultation paper comes at a sensitive time because the government is bound by a manifesto promise to deregulate bus services in London within the lifetime of the current parliament. Bus operators in the rest of the country have been competing with one another since the passing of the 1985 Transport Act. The paper says deregulation outside London has caused a cut in bus operating costs, a reduction in local authority subsidies and an increase in innovation. It concedes, however, that a number of concerns have arisen. For example: Timetables change so frequently that passengers find it difficult to obtain up-to-date information. The short period of notice required for changes in services causes instability and discourages potential users. The bunching of services by competing operators on busy routes is causing congestion in city centres. There is no right of appeal for companies excluded from travelcard schemes run by other operators. The Department of Transport says that any changes to the present arrangements will need to be judged by the benefits and costs to passengers, operators and local authorities. It wants comments by June 30. The Operation of Local Bus Services Outside London. Department of Transport, Room S15/08, 2 Marsham Street, London SW1P 3EB. Free.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> DECISION ON LANDFILL DELAYED  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Regional Planning Commission today delayed a decision on the  proposed expansion of the Sunshine Canyon landfill near Granada Hills because  of incomplete environmental studies.  </P> <P> Browning-Ferris Industries, which operates the 230-acre dump north of Granada  Hills, has proposed an expansion to include 542 acres of land in unincorporated  county territory.  </P> <P> The commission voted 4 to 0 to delay making a decision after Deputy County  Counsel Charles J. Moore advised members that BFI needed to conduct more  thorough studies of alternative landfill sites in the county and on property  the firm owns in the city of Los Angeles adjacent to the existing landfill.  </P> <P> County planners, who urged commissioners to decide the issue today, said it  would take up to two months to complete additional studies.  </P></p>

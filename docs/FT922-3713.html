			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Arts: Worrying straws in the wind - Television There are many straws in the wind. Programmes are now turning up regularly on screen looking as though they have been created specifically to compete in the new market-obsessed contest which is being thrust upon British broadcasters by the 1990 Broadcasting Act. British television is starting to look more and more like American television, not only because there are so many American imports (likely to increase even further as we move towards January 1993 and the new franchises) but because British programme makers are increasingly producing the sort of programmes favoured by American programme makers, and for the same reasons. Commercial broadcasters are not the only ones. In approaching the renewal of its charter in 1996, while preparing in the shorter term for the examination promised by the new broadcasting minister, David Mellor, the BBC clearly feels under tremendous pressure to scrimp, save and maximise audiences in order to prove itself more market-obsessed than its competitors. Thus we learn that in two weeks time BBC1 will begin an ambulance-chasing series called 999 which we are warned will 'focus on the real life drama behind every emergency call' and will tell 'dramatic stories of real life rescue'. Of course the bravery and selflessness of ambulancemen and lifeboatmen are reasons for celebration, and no doubt there are heartening stories to tell. But this series is pretty clearly inspired by the American series Rescue 911 (the British dial 999 but Americans dial 911) which all too often turns out to be current affairs for ghouls. Last time I watched Rescue 911 the cameras followed one poor soul all the way into casualty where, we were told, he died on the operating table. Perhaps the British version will be less sickeningly intrusive, and, who knows, it may not be especially cheap. But it is hard to avoid the feeling that 999 is another move towards the sort of ratings-led tabloid telly which BBC1 is already seeking to exploit in such series as Crime Limited. ITV is doing the same with Michael Winner's True Crimes which appear to be modelled closely upon the old Edgar Lustgarten programmes. There has been much comment about the morality of this series, and the Rachel McLean case which was supposed to open the new batch on Saturday was postponed at the behest of the Oxford college attended by the late Miss McLean, the suggestion being that an account of her murder might put the undergraduates off their exams. The notion, much pursued in other newspapers, that Winner ought not to be allowed to 'exploit' crime in this way is, presumably, inspired by dislike of his Death Wish vengeance movies. But Winner's television reconstructions are less exploitive than Shakespeare's in Richard III. Our real objection should be to the amateurish nature of the drama which consists almost entirely of cliches. 'At last]' says one character as a document arrives. 'It's hot off the press]' says the other, and you can hear the exclamation marks. 'His technique was given a baptism of fire in his own back yard' says Winner, mixing his metaphors while stacking his cliches. This stuff is being brought to us by London Weekend, the company previously responsible for Weekend World, Poirot and The South Bank Show. Similarly worrying signs are coming from Granada. This column has complained in the past that British television drama seems transfixed by period naturalism - all that documentary realism in steam trains, Players packets, and Oxford bags - and weak on contemporary fantasy. The Americans, somewhat surprisingly, given their traditional strength in modern action drama, have proved themselves greatly superior here, from the 1950s to the present, with series from The Twilight Zone to Quantum Leap. Now we find Granada, the company which gave us such triumphs of period naturalism as Brideshead Revisited and Jewel In The Crown, attempting to ape the Americans but getting it wrong. Having offered us the very ordinary hospital series Medics they have tried us on Angels, a 90-minute drama involving not one but three guardian angels, played by Tom Bell, Cathy Tyson and Eric Mallett, with Alfred Molina and Warren Clarke as two of those on earth who become involved. Unless they were blinded by the starriness of the cast the mystery is how those in charge at Granada ever allowed this to get onto the network in peak hours. Though billed as a 'comedy drama' it was consistently unfunny. Worse, it was long winded, the three strands did not fit well together, and the plot broke all the rules of time travel and celestial visitors. By all accounts this was intended as a pilot for a regular series, but we would be better served if Granada brought us another American series, provided it was as good as the better episodes of, say, Beauty And The Beast. There is, perhaps, less reason for suspecting that A Stab In The Dark on Channel 4 is inspired by the desire to be ready for more cut throat competition come 1993, though since the channel is going to cease being supported by ITV and instead compete with its old supporter for advertising, we certainly should not be too starry eyed. The depressing thing about this late night Friday series, described as 'a topical programme which takes an oblique look at the week's news, serving up anarchic and subversive topical comment in front of a studio audience' is its pathetic safeness. Had the producers wanted to achieve the sort of delighted shock which greeted That Was The Week 30 years ago they could have done so by attacking today's sacred cows: tunnel vision feminists, loopy greenies, the politically correct apparatchiks of the Aids industry. What did they choose instead? The House of Lords, Mark Thatcher and a book on etiquette which had already received a much fiercer roasting from Private Eye. Picking through celebs' dustbins and castigating the owners for not taking bottles to the bottle bank requires less moral courage than explaining to an audience bombarded by green hype that most bottle banking is a total waste of time since the recycling industry can only use a tiny proportion of what is collected, and the business is largely a feel-good charade. The common factor in all these straws is the expectation of fiercer competition for audiences and, in all cases outside the BBC, profits. One more item this week may give an even more vivid hint of things to come. We are told that Sky is planning from early 1993 to encrypt its 24-hour news channel Sky News and its general entertainment channel Sky One and sell them in a package with five other channels (the rock video channel MTV, the American classic movie channel Bravo, the nature and science channel Discovery, the Children's Channel, and the planned UK Network which is being launched by Thames and BBC Enterprises) for Pounds 5 a month. Add that to the Pounds 17 a month already charged for the movie channels and the Pounds 22 a month predicted for soccer and you reach an interesting total of Pounds 528 a year for the satellite services, or just over six times the BBC licence fee. For 'straws' read 'haystacks'.</p>

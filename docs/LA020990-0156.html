			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PATH CLEARED FOR FEDERATED TO OBTAIN $400-MILLION LOAN  </P> <P> Opposition to Federated Department Store Inc.'s financing proposal collapsed  Thursday night, clearing the way for a federal bankruptcy judge to allow the  retailer to obtain a $400-million loan.  </P> <P> Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. said he would review a proposed compromise between  Federated and a committee representing unsecured creditors, who are mainly  merchandise suppliers.  </P> <P> "I would see no impediment to my signing the order tomorrow morning," Aug said,  which would allow Federated to draw on the loan.  </P> <P> The loan from a 90-bank syndicate headed by Citibank of New York would be in  addition to a $1-billion financing package allowing Federated to sell credit  card receipts to a subsidiary, Federated Credit Corp. The credit division  wasn't among those that filed Jan. 15 for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  </P></p>

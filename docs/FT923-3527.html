			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Public expenditure committee shapes up for spending battle THE government's public expenditure committee will meet for the first time next week, although the occasion is expected to be largely procedural. The Treasury has yet to decide whether spending ministers should be invited to attend to make their cases - as they were under the 'star chamber' arrangements - or whether they should simply submit papers. Bilateral discussions between spending ministers and Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, will still be continuing when the committee meets, so the results of those discussions will wait until the second meeting, which is scheduled for the beginning of October. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will chair the committee, whose membership the Treasury had originally hoped could be confined to 'trusties' - Treasury ministers or ministers with very small departmental budgets. However, Mr John Major insisted the spending ministers should be represented by Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. The committee will submit options to the cabinet, which will decide on fund allocation between departments. Increases in the public-sector borrowing requirement are to be limited by linking spending to the expected low economic growth in the next few years. The cabinet has agreed that for 1993-94 the government should keep to the planning total of Pounds 244.5bn announced last November.</p>

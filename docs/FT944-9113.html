			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / . . .short term business confidence bubbles Business confidence in the European Union has gained ground substantially, led by optimism in Spain, the Netherlands, Italy and the UK, according to the UPS survey. However, only one-fifth of companies plan to increase their workforces during the next 12 months, underlining how employment prospects across Europe remain bleak. A total of 72 per cent of companies believe their economic position will be better in 12 months, with only 2 per cent saying it will be worse - the highest optimism rating since the survey was started two years ago. The net balance of companies reporting optimism rather than pessimism about prospects has widened to 70 per cent from 48 per cent in the autumn 1993 UPS survey, and only 19 per cent in 1992. In Spain, 84 per cent of respondents believe their economic position will improve, compared with 80 per cent in the Netherlands, 74 per cent in the UK, 73 per cent in Italy and 72 per cent in Belgium. However, 32 per cent of companies plan to reduce staff during the next 12 months, with only 21 per cent planning employment increases and 46 per cent saying their workforces will remain the same. Propensity to reduce staff is particularly large in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, where respectively 53 per cent, 37 per cent and 35 per cent forecast falling employment. In spite of relatively poor German job prospects, the survey shows a marked increase in confidence in Germany's position as a manufacturing base. Some 28 per cent of respondents say Germany offers the best potential for manufacturing in western Europe, with Spain favoured by 18 per cent of companies and Britain by 13 per cent. Among eastern European countries, the Czech republic is seen by 32 per cent of companies as offering the best potential for manufacturing investment, followed by Poland (22 per cent) and Hungary (20 per cent).</p>

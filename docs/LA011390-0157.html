			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COSTA MESA MAYOR SUGGESTS COMMERCIAL SITE FOR SOS  </P> <P> Mayor Peter F. Buffa on Friday proposed that the Share Our Selves charity, soon  to be ousted from a city-leased facility, move into a commercial building on  West MacArthur Boulevard, an alternative that would cost the city more than  $177,000 over five years.  </P> <P> The building at 1695 W. MacArthur Blvd. is home to the Community Development  Council, a private poverty agency that does not offer direct services to  clients.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, the CDC would sublease 4,200 square feet of space on the  ground floor of the two-story building to SOS for $1 a year.  </P> <P> The city would pay the balance of the $3,800-a-month rent for three years with  SOS gradually assuming financial responsibility.  </P> <P> The City Council earlier this month rejected a similar proposal to help SOS  move into a building on Superior Avenue, arguing that the plan was too costly.  </P> <P> This plan is different, Buffa said, because the CDC building would require  fewer renovations than the Superior Avenue location.  </P> <P> Buffa said the CDC proposal would also offer the charity more time to purchase  and renovate a building of its own.  </P> <P> Officials of SOS, being evicted from its home at the Rea Community Center,  announced Thursday that they had received more than $300,000 in contributions  and were negotiating to purchase permanent quarters.  </P> <P> Directors said it makes more sense for the City Council to extend the agency's  lease at the Rea center for two to three months rather than have it make two  moves.  </P> <P> "I don't feel the (CDC) move is in the best interests of us or the city," said  SOS founder and executive director Jean Forbath. "We are very pleased that the  city is concerned . . . and we will not discount the proposal, but it is still  a last alternative."  </P> <P> SOS leaders will rally today from 2 to 4 p.m. at a park near the Rea center,  then proceed to the steps of City Hall and begin a 50-hour fast to protest the  agency's ejection.  </P> <P> The council is scheduled to take up the SOS issue at its Monday meeting. SOS  officials say they will ask for an extention at the Rea center, while Buffa  will recommend that the council approve the CDC move.  </P> <P> ***  </P> <P>  Editor's note: SOS is the topic of the Joseph N. Bell column on Page N-1 in  the Orange County Life section. Bell's column was written before Friday's  developments.  </P> <P> </P></p>

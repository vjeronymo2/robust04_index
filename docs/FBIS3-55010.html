Speaking at a  press briefing at the Ministry of Defense, Danish Defense  Minister Hans Haekkerup acknowledged that Russia undoubtedly has  military-strategic interests in Latvia. However, no country has  the right to maintain its troops in another state against its  will.    At Skrunda the Danish delegation met the leading personnel  of  the radar station and listened to a lecture on the activities  and functions of this station. The guests were not denied a  chance to examine the station's technical equipment. After that  the delegation of the Danish Ministry of Defense visited the  Kuldiga Home Guard battalion.    President Guntis Ulmanis also met the Danish minister of  defense today. Ulmanis noted that this is the first foreign  delegation to make close acquaintance with the Skrunda radar  station. The president also appreciatively assessed the  cooperation agreement signed between the defense forces of  Latvia and Denmark, and noted that the three main issues in  talks with Russia directly concern the Skrunda radar station.    The Danish defense minister offered the assistance of his  specialists in ascertaining the harmful effects of the station.  He was also appreciative of the creation of a unified peace  battalion for the Baltic countries. Haekkerup and Ulmanis also  discussed the idea of the common security system for Europe, and  exchanged views on the NATO summit to be held in January, which  will also decide on the inclusion of east European countries in  these structures.</p>

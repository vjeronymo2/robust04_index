Karolos Papoulias said he did not want a confrontation, but  this was the only way to let Skopje and the world know how  strongly Greece felt about the matter. Athens would lift the  embargo, imposed this month, only if the Skopje government  changed its flag and dropped articles in its constitution that  implied territorial claims on Greece.    Speaking on the eve of talks here with Douglas Hurd, the  Foreign Secretary, who will warn the Greek government today that  its European Union partners condemn the closure of Salonika, Mr.  Papoulias also called for a new pan-Balkan conference after a  cease-fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina to resolve lingering tensions  in the region.    Mr. Papoulias said there had been an explosion of popular  anger in Greece over the former Yugoslav republic's "insult."  The government had to do something to force a confrontation as  one by one other countries were establishing diplomatic  relations with Skopje. The Salonika decision had been hastened  by the recent American decision to establish relations.    Asked whether the move was illegal under European Union law,  Mr Papoulias said there was a long history of illegal moves in  the EU, citing the actions of fishermen and farmers who had  forced a change of policy. Greece had given its legal  justification to Brussels, but the move was essentially  political. "The government was forced to act by the threats in  the constitution of that state. Greeks feel threatened by the  propaganda from Skopje," he said.    Hans van den Broek, the EU External Affairs Commissioner,  spent two days last week in fruitless shuttles between Athens  and Skopje to mediate. The Commission is threatening to take  the Greek government to the European Court of Justice, a move  officials here acknowledge is now likely.</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Bundesbank softens line on rate cuts THE German Bundesbank yesterday clearly softened its intractable stance on lowering interest rates with the acknowledgement that international economic conditions were an important factor in its policy decisions. A speech by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the central bank, which coincided with fresh Bundesbank manoeuvres to reduce short-term money market rates, was widely read as a signal that key rates, including the internationally important Lombard rate, could start falling soon. Money supply growth was only one element in policy-making, Mr Tietmeyer told banking students. 'But we know there are other factors, such as currency inflows and the changed international competitive situation, which must be considered at the same time.' The Frankfurt Stock Exchange responded with sharp gains, and the DAX index closed 32.48 points higher at 1,511.55, just below the day's high. Domestic bond markets also improved on the news. The relaxation of the bank's rigid attitude towards rates follows many months of fruitless appeals from abroad for interest rate reductions to help boost the international economy. But any cuts will be more closely related to easing the economic difficulties now crowding in on Germany. According to Mr Martin Hufner, chief economist at Bayerische Vereinsbank, Germany is heading for a recession, with real falls in gross domestic product in the second half of this year and the first half of 1993. According to Mr Tietmeyer, recent moves by the Bundesbank demonstrated that its attention was not fixed 'dogmatically and exclusively' on the M3 money supply measure. In recent weeks, influenced by changed competitive conditions - brought about by the effective revaluation of the D-Mark against most European monetary system currencies - it had steered overnight rates downwards. They were now 1.5 percentage points lower than at the start of September. Capital market rates of below 7.5 per cent were the lowest since late 1989, he added. But the revaluation is also damaging an export-based economy which was already showing marked signs of strain. New orders for German industry have fallen for six months in succession, and hopes of recovery abroad or at least an improvement in domestic consumer demand have failed to materialise.</p>

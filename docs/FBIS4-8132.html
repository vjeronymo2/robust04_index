			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bulgarian Socialist Party leader Zhan </F> Videnov by Rozalina Evdokimova; place and date not given:  "Urgent Changes in Government Are Needed"]    [Excerpts] [Evdokimova] Mr. Videnov, do you see a  coincidence between the interview President Zhelev gave to the  BBC British radio station and the arrival of observers of the  Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Bulgaria, who  will analyze the political situation and "recommunization" in  Bulgaria?    [Videnov] I do not think that there is such a connection,  however, it is obvious that ideological statements and  scholastic disputes, as well as deliberately fanning  confrontation rather than discussing the real socioeconomic  problems of the Bulgarians today, are a basic issue for  President Zhelev, and for people who do not know our country's  reality. It is not strange that foreigners assume such a  position. They are far away from the country's reality and not  especially concerned with its real problems. However, the  position of the president is absolutely inadmissible for any  head of state.    [Evdokimova] Mr. Zhelev devoted a lot of space in his  interview to the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] and the  situation in our country. Speaking about the BSP's support for  the cabinet, Mr. Zhelev said that this is nothing else but a  road leading to new elections, already in the fall. What could  you say about this?    [Videnov] The fact that the cabinet relies on the BSP  despite the fact that Berov's cabinet contains many BSP  opponents from the near and remote past, implies that the BSP is  a highly responsible, state-responsible, and competent party,  capable of participating in the government (unlike the other  parties, which regardless of the people's vote results, are  unable of translating this vote to governing). I include among  these parties the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] that  President Zhelev likes so much, and even the president himself,  as former SDS leader. Within the framework of the confidence  received by the people in 1991 the BSP helps the country to  resolve its most urgent problems. It is the success or failure  of these efforts that will determine when Bulgaria will head  toward new elections. It must be pointed out that these are the  efforts of the entire country, rather than the efforts of a  single party or the government. [passage omitted]    [Evdokimova] The BSP is being ever more frequently accused  of being responsible for the economic and social situation that  emerged in the country, and for supporting a cabinet that cannot  do its job. What could you say about this?    [Videnov] The situation could be corrected through early  parliamentary elections. If someone thinks that he is ready for  such a step toward decisively improving the situation in the  country, let him convince the people that they should  participate in such a step. However, the people are not  convinced of this. It is not clear what early elections could  contribute to the country. As long as the cabinet remains  within the framework of its program and tries to move things  forward, it could rely on a certain parliamentary consensus.  This support will be denied when the cabinet fails. [passage  omitted]    [Evdokimova] Will you demand personnel changes in the  cabinet?    [Videnov] Of course. They are absolutely necessary and  should have been effected immediately after the budget was  adopted. The changes have been postponed because of the prime  minister's illness, however, they will become topical again, as  soon as next week.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thus, if unlawful practices are occurring, the current Guides cannot perform their intended purpose of informing industry of the Commission's views of the practices and providing the basis for their ``voluntary and simultaneous abandonment'' by industry members. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  In order to provide adequate notice of the scope and applicability of the Guides to certain forms of factory-built residential housing, the Guides would have to be revised to inform the relevant members of the industry that the Guides apply to some of their marketing practices. However, under the circumstances this would be tantamount to issuing new guides. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 CFR &sect;1.5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In these circumstances, the Commission has determined that revising or reissuing the Guides is necessary only if there is reason to believe that unfair or deceptive practices are occurring in the relevant industry to some significant extent or are likely to occur in the absence of Commission guides. Based on the response to the request for comment and on the staff interviews with the responsible heads of the housing code authorities of California, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Texas and Virginia, the Vice President of the National Foundation of Manufactured Home Owners and a Senior Analyst from the American Association of Retired Persons, the Commission has determined that the practices addressed by the Guides are not common and, to the extent they exist, are adequately handled by state or local housing code authorities. Accordingly, the Commission has determined to repeal the Guides. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On April 12, 1962, the Commission adopted the Guides under the authority of sections 5(a) (1) and 6(g) of the FTC Act, 5 U.S.C. 45(a)(1) and 46(g). <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  The Guides address advertising claims relating to housing features that are material to consumers such as inhabitability upon delivery, dimensions, included items, savings, availability of financing, guarantees, time of delivery or installation, and whether the cost of delivery or installation is included in the advertised price. The Guides generally reflected the law previously developed by the Commission in cases involving advertising for shell homes, <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  factory-built homes, <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  and home improvements. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 27 FR 3917 (April 25, 1962); P924219, B&hyph;10. The Guides took effect immediately upon publication in the FR. Originally appearing as section 14.6 of the Commission's Administrative Interpretations, the guides were later recodified as 16 CFR Part 230, 32 FR 15531 (Nov. 8, 1967). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Monumental Engineering, Inc.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 58 FTC 1093 (1961); and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Lifetime, Inc.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 59 FTC 1231 (1961). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Main Line Lumber and Millwork Co.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 56 FTC 17 (1959);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> R.H.

(Emphasis added.) This and the cases brought before or around the time the Guides were formulated <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  indicate that the Commission intended the term ``shell'' to be interpreted in a generic sense_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> structures assembled or installed in whole or in part by the seller that lack all the necessary components to make the building inhabitable when delivered to the buyer. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Five pre-guide cases involved most of the acts or practices addressed by the Guides.

According to Philip Schneider of the National Institute of Building Sciences, a ``shell'' home concept was part of HUD's so-called ``Operation Breakthrough'' program to provide affordable housing to Americans on a large scale. Housing without any plumbing, heating or wiring, was to be produced in the factory, transported to the site in one piece or in sections, and assembled or mounted on the foundation and fitted with utilities on-site. Schneider says Operation Breakthrough was formulated while George Romney was Secretary of HUD (1969 to 1972). The program accordingly postdated the Guides by nearly a decade and could not have been their inspiration. The vestiges of Operation Breakthrough that exist today are limited to housing produced and finished with ``sweat equity'' as part of a publicly subsidized housing program.

Dugan, P 924219, B&hyph;7, p. 4 (June 1, 1992); re-interviewed by Joel Brewer, P 924219, B&hyph;11 (May 10, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Presently, it appears that other terms are now used in the industry to describe housing that the Commission characterized as ``shell'' housing. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  For example, according to one source, a ``shell'' home is a ``pre-cut'' home under classifications established by the National Association of Home Manufacturers (``NAHM''). <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  There are also other industry terms for factory-built housing, such as ``panelized'' <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  and ``modular,'' <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  where the degree of completeness varies, and that may not be inhabitable as sold. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> P924219, B&hyph;7, p. 3. According to one industry spokesperson, in the final analysis, it is easier to define what is ``inhabitable'' than what is a ``shell'' home.

Pre-cut housing contains all or most of the lumber and millwork for the main structure of the house, from floor to roof, plus exterior doors and windows, insulation, and roofing materials. The package may contain additional materials and supplies for the interior as well. Pre-cut housing requires the most on-site labor to finish the house and make it inhabitable after delivery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Panelized housing consists of complete walls that are factory-made in large sections and then shipped to the site. After set-down, the inhabitability of the dwelling depends on the extent to which the structure needs work such as installing a roof or panelized roof, installing a wet core (central plumbing, heating and wiring equipment), installing a floor or panelized floor, hanging doors and windows, installing utilities and insulation, closing the panel interiors, and hooking up the utilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Modular or sectional housing is 95% complete when it comes off the assembly line. It is shipped in two or more sections for set-down at the site. After set-down, inhabitability depends on the extent to which the house needs work finishing the interior and hooking up the utilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

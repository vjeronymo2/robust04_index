			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Salvesen Christian Salvesen's 27 per cent fall against the market since January's profits warning looks overdone in the context of a fall of just 2 per cent in annual profits. It might thus be seen as an example of how the market over-reacts to the kind of prompt trading statement now being urged by the stock exchange in situations where traders' expectations lose touch with reality. But the January statement highlighted difficulties with the Aggreko plant hire business, which was supposed to be an important engine of longer-term growth. Since Salvesen is now determined to focus on Aggreko's margins rather than volume growth, the market's response is more understandable. As a specialised business, Aggreko might generate high quality earnings, but that would not warrant a premium rating. Salvesen's present multiple of 13 times earnings does not make the shares particularly cheap. Salvesen may feel bruised by the market's reaction to its statement, but a re-rating was inevitable given investors' changing perception of long-term growth prospects. Certainly yesterday's statement held out little promise of a rapid rebound in earnings despite the improving economic climate. The Swift industrial distribution business has made a promising start, but its profit base is relatively small. Having chosen to renegotiate its complex arrangement with Marks &amp; Spencer at a time when interest rates are low, Salvesen can no longer look forward to the benefit of rising rates. Management would describe the renegotiation of this archaic arrangement as good housekeeping. Quite so, but it will need more than that to out-perform.</p>

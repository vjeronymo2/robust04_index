			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / CBI pulls out of talks on works councils The Confederation of British Industry yesterday withdrew from discussions on the ground rules for establishing works councils in European multi-nationals as Unice, the European employers' body, went further than the British employers' group was prepared to accept. The CBI's decision to withdraw, after pressure from members and other UK employers' groups, will not prevent talks continuing - at least until tomorrow - between Unice and the European Trades Union Congress. But it raises questions about the viability of the social dialogue between Unice and the ETUC, which the European Commission is keen to promote as an alternative to producing detailed directives. CBI officials say the social dialogue as now structured does not allow national employers' organisations to consult their members properly. On works councils, the CBI objected to the accepted Unice principle that there should be minimum requirements if voluntary agreement at company level is not possible, and also that information and consultation should be a legally enforceable right. The government's opt-out from some aspects of the social chapter means UK employers will only be affected by works council legislation through their continental European businesses. The commission has agreed to pass a directive on works councils if Unice and the ETUC fail to reach agreement. That means the ETUC has little incentive to agree to anything less than what is laid out in the directive. Ninety-one per cent of foreign-owned companies would not change their attitude to the UK if the government reduced its commitment to the European Union, a survey has found. The size of the UK market is the main attraction for foreign investors, according to a survey of 800 executives of foreign-owned companies, conducted for the accountants and management consultants KPMG Peat Marwick. Only 3 per cent of foreign companies cited cheap labour as an investment reason. Foreign-owned Companies in the UK. KPMG, 8 Salisbury Square, London EC4Y 8BB.</p>

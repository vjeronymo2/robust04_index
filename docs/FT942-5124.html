			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / China plans ways to bridge 57km sea channel China plans to build what would be the world's longest sea-crossing project  -a chain of bridges and a tunnel, linking the Shandong and Liandong peninsulas in the north-east of the country. Feasibility studies, expected to take several years, have already started on the Yn60bn (Dollars 6.9bn) project to bridge the 57km Bohai channel, said an official in the Liaoning government. Work is unlikely to begin before early in the next century and the project would take about 10 years. Meanwhile, Liaoning and Shandong are planning a Yn1.3bn train ferry linking the two provinces. This would run between Dalian, the main port in Liaoning, and Yantai in Shandong. Both are important ports and railheads connected with China's interior. The ferry is expected to be operational by 1998, and would be capable of handling 10m tonnes of freight a year. Capacity would double by 2005. The plans to bridge the Bohai channel and improve transport between Liaoning and Shandong, two of China's most important provinces, reflect a new drive to boost economic development in the north-east. The official China Business Weekly reported last month that efforts were under way to improve the economic integration of the Bohai rim which encompasses 680,000 sq km and includes the provinces of Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei and Liaoning, and the municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin. This followed a government decision in 1992 to declare the Bohai rim an independent economic zone under China's strategic economic development plan. An important aim is to match explosive economic growth in southern China. Development in the north-east, home to much of China's heavy industry, has been lagging behind programmes around the Pearl River and Yangtze River deltas in the south. Some of China's largest cities are located around Bohai Bay, including 11 cities with populations of more than 1m.</p>

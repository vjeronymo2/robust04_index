			<p>BFN     [Text] Knesset Member [MK] Ari'el Sharon says he does not  understand Likud members' attacks on Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres for his letter to the Norwegian foreign minister regarding  the Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem. Mr. Sharon told the  Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that these  institutions were established during the tenure of Yitzhaq  Shamir's government. According to Sharon he used to raise  this issue in almost every government session and demanded a  halt to Orient House activity, but most of the ministers used to  react by bursting out in laughter.</p>

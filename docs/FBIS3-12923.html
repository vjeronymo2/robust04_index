			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad 'Abbas, secretary general of the </F> Palestine Liberation Front, by Ahmad 'Abd-al-Majid, in Baghdad;  date not given]    [Excerpts] ['Abd-al-Majid] You were deeply saddened by  pictures of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre you saw on  television, and you stayed at home for two days, refusing to  receive anyone. Is sorrow sufficient? Can a revolutionary  stand idle, doing nothing, while his people are being killed  before his eyes?    ['Abbas] Revolutionaries are full of emotions. I believe  that it is normal to experience emotions first, before other  values and reactions, including retaliation. Consequently, it  is natural for any human being to become angry over such a  massacre when he sees his people being brutally killed while  they are performing their prayers. This affects us as human  beings. [passage omitted]    The normal state of affairs during the stage of conflict is  that we should expect losses, and the fall of martyrs. However,  what saddens us in the face of such a massacre is the current  political formulas, the stands that conflict with our real  principles, and the current miserable Arab situation. Great  sadness is a major tool for a consequent action. The men who  were martyred, the children who were killed, and the widows who  cried deserve balanced measures that will alleviate their  suffering and prove that our determination is still strong to  pursue struggle to terminate occupation and to achieve  independence.    ['Abd-al-Majid] You said consequent action. What is the  nature of this action? Will you resort to another option other  than the option of a political solution?    ['Abbas] Struggle is an integral and indivisible whole.  However, any action necessitates a reaction, especially when you  see your people being slaughtered. You must then look for an  appropriate action. We have not relinquished armed struggle.  As an organization, we still believe that armed struggle is a  major tool to attain our people's rights in Palestine.  Developments are escalating, and they are all related to what  has taken place. We have great hope that God will grant us  success and help us wipe away the tears of the widows and  console the children who have lost their fathers and brothers.    ['Abd-al-Majid] Can our sadness console the victims?    ['Abbas] Sadness is not condolence, it is a human  expression.  The holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre makes us sad. The condolence  in such a national cause is to make our people confident that  armed struggle is still continuing, that the objectives for  which martyrs fell and for which our people were exposed to such  a massacre will not be forgotten, and that our people's blood  will not melt away uselessly. The martyrs' blood must be a  torch, granting the revolution further strength and lighting the  road toward our goals.    ['Abd-al-Majid] The way you deal with the national  Palestinian rights is to some extent similar to that of Hamas.  Do you have contacts with this movement?    ['Abbas] As an organization, we have carried out armed  struggle for more than a quarter of a century in a continuous  manner that has left its imprint in the national, Arab, and  international arenas. We have never been negligent in this  field. Our vision has always been clear and it will remain so.  Hamas and other organizations have similar ideas. In one way  or another, we have contacts with the Palestinian forces that  work within the national framework, regardless of their  political stands. The closer their stands become to ours, the  closer we become to these Palestinian organizations.    We view Hamas with special appreciation, and we have  contacts  with it. I say contacts and not an alliance. These contacts  might be developed. This depends on how close our political  stands become in the future regarding struggle in our homeland.    ['Abd-al-Majid] But do not you see that there is a  contradiction between armed struggle and political action within  the PLO framework?    ['Abbas] This is an integration, not a contradiction. We are  represented in the PLO and the PLO Executive Committee. We have  developed relations with factions and forces that are outside  the PLO framework. We also have relations with factions that  left the PLO or that have adopted a certain stand toward the PLO  leadership such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of  Palestine. Our concept of integration is based on our reading  of the PLO's current situation. In our opinion, the PLO still  constitutes the moral entity of the people. In other words, it  is the state of the Palestinians. [passage omitted]    ['Abd-al-Majid] Following the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre,  U.S. President Bill Clinton called on the parties to the  settlement to resume negotiations in Washington. In your  opinion, why this hasty invitation?    ['Abbas] We should speak about the U.S. role, taking into  consideration that America is the legitimate father of the  current political settlement. In brief, we can say that the  settlement is a U.S. settlement. We are aware of the changes  and circumstances that have contributed to drawing the features  of the stage that produced the so-called peace plan. Based on  this, the United States must be very concerned about the success  of its Middle Eastern plan, which is represented by the  establishment of a regional Middle East complex in which Israel  will be the center of gravity, because it has fateful ties with  the United States. In light of the repercussions of the  massacre, the U.S. President's invitation came as a quick  reaction aimed at protecting whatever he can still protect of  his programs in the region.    ['Abd-al-Majid] Do you have any advice for the PLO  leadership?    ['Abbas] Everyday carries new evidence of the blind and  erroneous political course -- its uselessness, the extent of the  harm it has inflicted on our people and cause, and the losses  which could have been averted if the PLO had redressed its  course, especially since there are no signs or indications  regarding substantive Israeli concessions. There were huge  national losses, and the Israeli and American demands are  pushing the PLO toward making still further concessions. In  addition to this, repressive and oppressive measures are still  continuing, and they were crowned by the Hebron massacre. The  only advice I have to the PLO leadership is to leave,  unhesitatingly, this quagmire that it has led our people into,  before the catastrophe becomes complete. [passage omitted]    ['Abd-al-Majid] The reason behind your relinquishment of  your  seat in the PLO Executive Committee is still unknown, why?    ['Abbas] My departure of the PLO Executive Committee was  linked to my reading of the situation; the Gulf war and the  PLO's political program paved the way for what has followed. It  was my choice not to stay with the leadership dominating the  PLO. As an expression of our commitment to the PLO, we  nominated another comrade to replace me. [passage omitted]    Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] is a different man than the one I  used to know. He expresses aspirations and concerns differently  from how he used to express then in the past. He speaks in a  language that is not the traditional language of his  revolutionary conversation with us. He uses the politicians'  language. Despite all these differences, we are still concerned  about our relationship with brother Abu-'Ammar, which is based  on frankness and sincerity.    ['Abd-al-Majid] How do you view your other half; namely,  Jordan -- people and government?    ['Abbas] Regardless of the details, we believe that Jordan  and Palestine are an integral whole, and that relations between  the Palestinian and Jordanian peoples go far beyond relations  between any two peoples in the region. Our relations are very  interrelated and affect each other greatly.</p>

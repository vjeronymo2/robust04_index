			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Fashion: Simple and so chic - Lucia van der Post finds hats to turn the classiest heads I first became aware of Patricia Underwood's hats in the summer of 1985. I remember it because I wanted one of her soft, floppy, 'wilting-rose' straw hats so badly I almost took out a bank loan. That tells you a lot about Patricia Underwood's hats. Firstly, that they are dangerously desirable and secondly that they cost wicked amounts of money. She has, more than any other hat designer, developed a personal style that is instantly recognisable. The style revolves around the finest, softest of straw or crinbraid which is crafted into shapes and lines of the utmost simplicity. She is to hats what Armani is to the unstructured jacket. But all that artless-looking simplicity requires dedication to the craft of hat-making. There is no hint of excess or decoration on Underwood's hats. Understated, simple, effortlessly classy, they never shout louder than their wearer. Nobody . . . (well perhaps that's a bit sweeping, I've just remembered Dolly Parton) . . . almost nobody, could look vulgar in a Patricia Underwood hat. If that makes them sound puritanically austere let me assure you that they are among the most flattering of hats. Flattery is, in my view, a hat's most important function. The magic lies in the most subtle, most refined sense of line and proportion. Patricia Underwood's unadorned, hand-made, hand-finished hats rely on shape, colour and proportion, not fancy trims and artificial flowers, for their effect. Great skill goes into finding the line and the shape that give the face its most beguiling frame. Her personal style is founded on simplicity - on the day I interviewed her she was wearing a navy-blue Jil Sander suit, navy-blue silk shirt, almost no make-up and one of her own fine black straw hats. She evolved an approach to headwear as part of a woman's look and personal style rather than a distracting ornament. Her hats have a modern cerebral quality about them. These are hats to please the most up-to-date and liberated of women. She believes that: 'Hats create amazing possibilities. One cannot be neutral in the presence of a hat. It sends a message. When I think about the design of a hat, I consider what that message might be.' Just listen to Michael Malone, an American author, writing about the hats of his youth: 'In the 1980s, to my delight, America rediscovered the romance and power and sexiness of hats. The brown hat of Indiana Jones said danger and adventure just the way Bogie's hat said danger and mystery years ago. I've long since lost (my) long-loved Yankees cap, and the cowboy hat with the red trim. But I remember how they made me feel. Like the movies, they had that magic to tell us who we are.' Patricia Underwood is full of wise advice on how to choose one. 'Our grandmothers never needed advice on how to wear a hat. It was part of their daily lives which they understood instinctively. 'Today there is a new young generation which does not associate hats with churchgoing or eccentric aunts or grandmothers and they are discovering, and, in some cases, re-discovering, themselves in hats. The trick is to find the pleasing relationship between the width of the cheekbone and the top of the hat - this is a matter of visual judgment. 'A hat is part of a woman's style and therefore it must match the mood of her clothing - for this a full-length mirror is necessary. 'When choosing a hat to go with a printed fabric always choose it in the least prominent colour. If you look deep into a tweed or even a single-colour fabric there are nearly always other muted colours and shades. Choose one of those and the fabric will be enhanced.' Underwood adds: 'Few faces are perfectly symmetrical. When putting on a hat, never wear it absolutely straight - a subtle, but I really mean subtle, little tilt will integrate it with the face.' Although her hats are simple, they do change and evolve. Some of her newest designs are photographed here. For this summer there are baby bonnet shapes in finest crinbraid. There is a subtle but simple almost 1920s-style cloche. There are finely-stitched suede berets and some of the newest combine knit and straw or crinbraid - some have knitted crowns, others knitted brims. Prices range from Pounds 120 to Pounds 350. Browns of west London stock Underwood's hats and are offering 50 readers a chance to share high tea and hat-talk with Patricia on Tuesday May 17, from 6.30pm to 8.30pm. She will be discussing hats for the high summer season with Ascot particularly in mind. Tickets will go to the first 50 readers who send a cheque for Pounds 20 made out to The Teenage Trust (a charity that helps teenagers with cancer, registration number 1009984) to Janet Fischgrund of Browns Press Office, Browns, 23-27 South Molton Street, London W1. Anyone wanting to know even more about hats might like to obtain The Hat Book, designed by Rodney Smith and Leslie Smolan (Dollars 25, published only in the US) by Nan A.

			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A military tribunal in Myanmar, formerly Burma, sentenced seven youths to  five-year prison terms for staging anti-government demonstrations, a government  newspaper said. Police arrested the youths for shouting slogans July 17 at a  Buddhist temple in Yangon, formerly Rangoon, during a religious holiday, the  Working People's Daily said. In a related development, a spokesman for the main  opposition party said as many as 1,500 people have been arrested since early  July. Early last week, another military tribunal ordered the death sentence for  three young members of the League for Democracy who were convicted of planting  a package bomb that killed two people at a government oil refinery July 7.  </P></p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Blockbuster set to win Cityvision BLOCKBUSTER Entertainment, the US-based video rental chain, yesterday narrowly defeated a move by a group of dissident shareholders which would have blocked its agreed bid to acquire Cityvision, the UK video chain. Blockbuster said that by 3pm yesterday, 50.21 per cent of shares in Cityvision had been tendered to it, and that it had declared its offer unconditional in respect of acceptances. The offer has been extended until February 12. Merrill Lynch, advisers to Blockbuster, said Blockbuster was prepared to complete the acquisition even if a large minority of shares remained in the hands of other shareholders. Minority shareholders are not required to tender their shares unless the bidder receives at least 90 per cent acceptances. Meanwhile, Blockbuster said it was delighted with the outcome. The company hadn't expected to get more than 45 per cent acceptances, Merrill Lynch said. Blockbuster had made a cash and shares bid for Cityvision last November in a deal valued at Pounds 75m. As part of that deal, Philips, the Dutch electronics company, agreed to pay Pounds 37.3m for a 50 per cent stake in a new company to be known as Blockbuster UK, consisting of Cityvision and other stores. Following the offer, a group of dissident shareholders, Fidelity Investment, Alliance Capital and Postel, who controlled more than 17 per cent of the company, called for an extraordinary general meeting to replace Cityvision's management with a team of former Cityvision executives. The team was headed by Mr David Quayle, founder of the B&amp;Q DIY chain and chairman of Cityvision during its greatest period of expansion. The shareholders said the price on offer for Cityvision shares, while nearly double the price at the time of the bid, did not reflect the value of the company's franchise. Poor management and poor marketing, they charged, had allowed the company's sales and share price to fall sharply. They said yesterday that they were considering their position and had not decided whether to tender their shares. Merrill Lynch said arbitrageurs - who by Wednesday controlled more than 40 per cent of shares - had apparently played a significant role in Blockbuster's success. If Blockbuster fails to acquire 100 per cent of Cityvision, Philips has an option to use its Pounds 37.2m investment to purchase up to 6m shares of Blockbuster Entertainment, rather than buy into a UK subsidiary which is not wholly owned by the company.</p>

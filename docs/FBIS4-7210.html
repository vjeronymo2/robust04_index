			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry plans  to make a major revision in the stopgap budget for fiscal 1994  because of a delay expected in Diet proceedings on the full  budget for the year, ministry officials said Thursday [28  April]. They said the revision is required since substantive  debates on the full budget by the House of Representatives  Budget Committee are unlikely to start until mid-May.    The stopgap budget for the year that started April 1,  compiled to deal with the nation's political confusion, is valid  only until May 20. The officials said the full budget is  unlikely to be approved by the Diet before that date.    The new stopgap budget will be valid until sometime in the  40-day period through June 29, when the current Diet session  ends, and will involve additional appropriations of 3 trillion  yen to 4 trillion yen, the officials said.    The fiscal 1994 budget was submitted to the Diet on March 4,  but there have been no Diet debates on it because of the  political confusion.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> LOVITZ TO TRY HIS HAND AT MOVIES  </P> <P> "Saturday Night Live" cast member Jon Lovitz has decided to find out whether  acting in movies is the ticket.  </P> <P> Lovitz, known for his character the pathological liar who says "That's the  ticket," said Thursday he's leaving the show.  </P> <P> "I've done the show for five years. That's enough," he said. "I've had a great  time on the show and it's time to move on.  </P> <P> "I've got several offers to do movies and that's the direction I'm headed," he  said.  </P> <P> Lovitz, 32, has finished "Mr. Destiny," a movie for Disney, and is working on  "Mom and Dad Save the World" for Warner Bros.  </P> <P> On "Saturday Night Live," his recurring comedic bits included an impression of  playwright Harvey Fierstein as an affection-starved talk show host, and as  himself, jovially urging viewers, "Get to know me!"  </P></p>

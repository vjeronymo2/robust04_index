			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Germans urge rethink of European union GERMANY'S employers and trade unions yesterday joined forces to urge the European Community leaders meeting in Lisbon this week to answer growing public doubts about the progress towards European union. In a rare joint initiative, the two sides of German industry called for the member states to push through the ratification of the Maastricht treaty, but at the same time to face up to the 'visible fears and reservations in the population at large'. They warned that the Danish rejection of the treaty reflected a wider backlash against 'a centralised, bureaucratic Europe, remote from its inhabitants and lacking democratic legitimation'. They called for 'further development' of the treaty to spell out the principle of subsidiarity - maximum devolution of power away from the centre. They also proposed a new inter-governmental conference to strengthen democratic control and make EC decision-making more open to public scrutiny. The declaration coincided with a highly critical analysis of the EC agreement on economic and monetary union (Emu) delivered in London by Mr Heinrich Weiss, president of the BDI, Germany's industrial federation, and one of the signatories of the declaration. The others were the BDA, the employers' federation, and the DGB, the trade union federation. Mr Weiss suggested that many German employers had lost faith in Emu, and would now prefer to postpone it until well into the next century. Speaking at the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, he said that Europe was not economically 'mature' enough for monetary union. When it was finally introduced, it should be 'the last stone, and not the first, in the edifice of integration'. The BDI has traditionally been one of the most enthusiastic supporters of economic and monetary integration among Europe's employers' organisations, and Mr Weiss' open hostility to speedy economic union will be taken as a further sign of a general cooling in public enthusiasm towards Emu in Germany. 'The speed of integration has been too fast,' Mr Weiss said, adding in an apparent side-swipe at Chancellor Helmut Kohl: 'There are too many politicians who want to go into the history books as architects of the new Europe.' In the latest German opinion poll on the subject, carried out by the Allensbach Institute, some 62 per cent of ordinary citizens said they did not believe the European currency would be as stable as the D-Mark. Among civic and business leaders, that proportion was higher, at 69 per cent. Chancellor Kohl will be arguing strongly in Lisbon for some sort of clarification or declaration on the principle of subsidiarity, which should also help him satisfy the doubts of the 16 federal states in Germany, anxious at what they see is an erosion of their local authority through European union. Popular support for the Maastricht Treaty has weakened in France, according to an opinion survey which gives 54 per cent in favour and 44 per cent against, Ian Davidson reports. The previous survey conducted by the CSA polling organisation for Le Parisien newspaper in early June, gave 69 per cent in favour and only 31 per cent against. However, there has been a wide variation in the findings of different polling organisations on the Maastricht issue, although, in every case, supporters outnumber opponents. The abstention rate may account for the difference and could easily determine the result when the French vote in a referendum on the treaty, probably in September. Yesterday's poll points to an increase in the numbers who expect to stay at home, from 42 per cent in early June, to 50 per cent.</p>

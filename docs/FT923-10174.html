			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Arts: Sawallisch bows out in Munich - Summer Festivals AFTER nearly quarter of a century at the centre of Munich's operatic life, Wolfgang Sawallisch is leaving - and the city has suddenly begun to suffer withdrawal symptoms. In an otherwise unexceptional July Opera Festival, Sawallisch's performances alone captured the festival spirit - not just his mature, fresh-minted Wagner, Strauss and Mozart, but his surprising decision to bow out with a modern work: Henze's Der Prinz von Homburg. Sawallisch became music director of the Bavarian State Opera in 1971 and quickly established a close working relationship with Gunther Rennert. Had he been able to find a suitable partner after Rennert's death, he might not be leaving now. It was his rivalry and incompatibility with Rennert's eventual successor, August Everding, which led him to seek the post of overall director in the early 1980s - a role to which he was temperamentally unsuited. Sawallisch could not handle the political side of the job, he had little success as an artistic planner and was dogged by bad luck. The past ten years have effectively soured his relationship with his home city, and apart from a handful of performances in September it is doubtful whether he will ever again conduct opera in Munich. Anyone who has experienced a Sawallisch evening in the National or Cuvillies-Theater must realise this is a tragedy. Despite his imminent move to the Philadelphia Orchestra (and EMI's attempt to sell him as a recording star), he remains a theatre conductor at heart. He is one of a select group of conductors who can transform a performance, no matter how moribund the staging. His relationship with the Bavarian State Orchestra is one of implicit trust and mutual inspiration, built up over years of intensive work. Sawallisch's Munich performances always carried an air of musical substance from start to finish - a special cogency, an unmistakable stamp of on-going, unshowy German tradition, whether in Meistersinger or Arabella, Cardillac or Palestrina. Such qualities - increasingly scarce as conductors take the fast route to fame on the international circuit - have been taken for granted in Munich in recent years, but they proved crucial to the success of the new Henze production. Der Prinz von Homburg, premiered in Hamburg in 1960, remains one of Henze's least known stage works (a British company has yet to tackle it, though the BBC broadcast a studio performance in 1989). Judging by this well-cast production in the Cuvillies-Theater, staged by Nikolaus Lehnhoff and designed by Gottfried Pilz, it is also one of his most eloquent and aesthetically pleasing. Henze and his librettist Ingeborg Bachmann turn Kleist's early 19th century tale of Prussian militarism into a dream play: the Prince inhabits the stage like a universal somnambulist, treading the dangerous tight-rope between dream and reality, state power and individual freedom, duty and feeling. Despite its unfashionably utopian ending, the opera has lost none of its contemporary relevance. Nor has the music dated. The score is notable for its richly poignant lyricism, its emotional power, its plasticity and swift durchkomponiert quality, transcending the episodic nature of the stage drama. All the effects are precise, piquant and refreshingly un-Expressionist - particularly the dappled instrumental tapestries at the opening and close, and the brilliant crescendo to the Act one finale. No meandering, no overladen textures, no dogmatic serialism - though the transparent clarity of the Munich production owed something to Henze's re-editing of the score, resulting in a pruning of wind, percussion and chorus parts. The performance itself was mesmerising. Sawallisch's command of Henze's idiom, his elucidation of the work's structural complexity and animation of its rhythmic undertow, suggested thorough preparation and commitment. Lehnhoff's staging was equally perceptive. It focused exclusively on the poetic symbolism of the drama, unfolding in a semi-circular stage-tower behind a misty blue gauze - an isolated, abstract world, monumental and simple. The only props were three tables, positioned in line or strewn about the stage to evoke council of war, battle and prison. The costumes were austere period suits and gowns; the lighting exquisite. Francois Le Roux's idealistic young Prince made a strong, handsomely-declaimed centrepiece. William Cochran brought gravity and mature poise to the Elector of Brandenburg. Claes Ahnsjo was the highly sympathetic Count Hohenzollern. Helga Dernesch lent the shadowy Electress a welcome size of personality, while the blossoming Mari Anne Haggander really tugged the heart in Natalie's plea for the Prince's pardon. The Bavarian State Opera now faces ten months of upheaval, camping out in Munich's underused older halls and theatres while its main home, the National Theater, undergoes repairs to the stage hydraulics. Peter Schneider arrives as music director in January, and Peter Jonas takes up the post of intendant at the beginning of the 1993-4 season. Sawallisch's final duty will be to take the company on tour in November to Japan. The fact that he has chosen to leave the company with a new production of Die Frau ohne Schatten in Tokyo and not in Munich shows where his sympathies now lie.</p>

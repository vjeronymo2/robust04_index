			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 25 -- The Solidarity power industry  section decided Monday evening [25 April] in Belchatow, Piotrkow  province, to expand the strike action on power plants operating  on hard coal.    The National Power Distribution Centre limited power  supplies  to industrial enterpises. Power is being imported from the  Czech and Slovak republics and Hungary as of Monday.    The chairman of the Solidarity national commission of hard  coal mining said in Katowice on Monday that "a rotation protest  action will start in hard coal mines on Monday night and will be  staged until further notice."    Andrzej Dobroczek of the National Power Distribution Centre  said Monday that the strike by hard coal miners would not  disturb the production of electric power, at least for some  time, as power plants had stocked enough coal.    In a letter sent Monday to Waldemar Pawlak, the national  protest committee of lignite mines charged the prime minister  with responsibility for Poland's security in the field of power  reserves. The committee expects the prime minister to  immediately revoke a decision of Industry Minister Marek Pol on  transformations in lignite mines.    The unionists also recognized that further correspondence  with Industry Minister Marek Pol is useless.    "Even if the government withdraws or annuls the decision  concerning transformations in lignite mining, the Solidarity  protest committee of lignite mines will not end the strike but  only suspend it," Jozef Polkowski, a member of the strike  committee, told a press conference at the Belchatow mine on  Monday.    This would mean an increase of coal supplies to power plants  which now receive only strategic amounts of fuel necessary to  keep them going, he said and added that after the decision has  been either suspended or annuled, the strike committee might  start negotiations concerning nation-wide demands of the union.    At a press conference on Monday afternoon, Minister Marek  Pol  said that he has been inviting the protesting unionists for  talks with representatives of the government and employers for  three days and that he has been waiting for a signal from them.  He added that the ministry defined no pre-conditions and  repeated that the validity of his decision concerning  transformations in lignite industry expired at the moment he  said it was suspended.    The Solidarity Mazowsze region announced on Monday it would  stage a strike in all enterprises of the region except for  public sector and, perhaps, municipal enterprises on Thursday,  Deputy Chairman of the Mazowsze Region Ewa Lewicka said Monday.  Also "Sendzimir" steel works in Krakow announced a strike alert.    Apart from the demand to halt transformations in the lignite  industry the miners request that the government stop work on the  new wage control law and immediately implement the "pact on  state enterprise" and related laws.</p>

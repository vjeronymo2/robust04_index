			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / As They Say In Europe: Bill Clinton's lucky number IT IS hard to say anything new about this week's events in the US. IF Time magazine can run a cover story weeks before the election which could have been titled 'Clinton's road to the White House,' poor old Europeans have little to add. In Germany there is no reluctance to hammer home self-evident truths. Welt an Sonntag produced a fine example of what German leader writers manage when they know they have to write something, no matter what: 'Most auguries say President Bush will not be confirmed in office on Tuesday. Most Americans want a change and therefore will send Arkansas governor Bill Clinton to the White House for at least four years . . . There are many reasons for the loss of confidence in a President who had more international and government experience for the highest US job than any of his predecessors. But the main cause of Bush's loss of popularity is the desolate economic situation.' Elsewhere the lacklustre apercu demands more skilful decoration. Tuesday's headline in Corriere della Sera ran: 'Dollar jumps with Clinton.' On Thursday La Repubblica had Bill Clinton saying, improbably, 'Ecco la mia America.' Generally each nation worried about its fate. France-Soir warned, 'It would be a great mistake to lower our guard in the belief that a Democratic president would scarcely defend the farmers of the Middle West under the pretext that these people vote Republican.' Fortunately there is always Komsomolskaya Pravda. The Moscow paper proclaimed, 'In recent weeks a hole appeared in the Republican vessel that had seemed unsinkable some six months ago . . . At that time the good-for-nothing governor of a small state could not compete with the President of a great country. But victories in the Gulf and changes in Eastern Europe raised Bush so high that he forgot a simple truth: not even success of historic proportions abroad can replace concern about one's own country.' Last week Bernard Heimrich of the Frankfurter Allgemeine took a London taxi to a royal investiture: ''To the Palace, please,' said the passenger. 'Buckingham?' asked the driver. 'Buckingham Palace,' confirmed the passenger simply. The driver nodded, turned the meter and made his way towards his Queen. The passenger behind waited. The driver was silent. Surely that cannot have been all?' 'Many have been racking their brains as to why London taxi drivers have stopped talking. A week ago a cabbie spent a quarter of an hour attacking the Bundesbank without drawing breath. But for two years now that sort of thing has been the exception. . . . One school of thought puts it down to these new-fangled chat radio stations which remove the pressure for conversation.' Heimrich wrote that he had wished to contact the Palace so he looked in the phone book. 'There stands 'Buckingham Palace' in small print, somehow thrown between 'Buckingham Butchers,' 'Buckingham Dry Cleaners and 'Buckingham, R', and even the phone number is not anything special.' This raises a problem: how do you start looking up the phone number of a head of state? And what sort of number should that person have? Clinton's will be 202-456-1414 which is pretty dreary.

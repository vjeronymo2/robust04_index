			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOME DESIGN;  </P> <P> EX-POLITICAL CARTOONIST BENT ON ADVENTURE  </P> <P> Jean-Pol d. Franqueuil, who was a political cartoonist in France in a previous  life, asked 6-year-old Rebecca Nguyen of Fountain Valley what she would like  him to paint on her bedroom walls.  </P> <P> Her mother, June, had commissioned a mural that would cover all four walls, and  Rebecca was calling the shots.  </P> <P> The artist, a Huntington Beach resident whose caricatures of world leaders have  appeared in the International Herald Tribune, the New York Times, the  Washington Post and U.S. News and World Report, listened intently as Rebecca  said: "I want a jungle scene -- and I don't want it to be boring!"  </P> <P> It's not.  </P> <P> Rebecca and her year-old brother, Matthew, now awaken each morning in a room  covered with images of a tiger feeding ice cream to a hippopotamus, monkeys  swinging from trees and an elephant carrying a balloon. There's also a farm  scene with a cow sipping a glass of milk, a singing goat and a pig in a pumpkin  patch.  </P> <P> Franqueuil smiles when asked about his leap from drawing politicians for an  international audience to painting animals on bedroom walls.  </P> <P> As a cartoonist who worked briefly in Canada and Japan but made his name in  Paris, he saw the world political scene as "a big theater, a show. And I found  the same funny things everywhere -- the same kind of politicians trying to get  to power," he says. What he's doing now, he adds, "is just another kind of  show" -- one that's bringing him a growing audience in Orange County.  </P> <P> Murals he's painted in public places -- including the Olga for Kids clothing  store in Newport Beach and Puccini Ristorante in Santa Ana -- have stimulated  the demand for his art in private places.  </P> <P> His beach scene at Olga for Kids caught June Nguyen's eye, and she liked the  one he did for her store, Kidding Time in Westminster, so much that she offered  him $3,500 to paint her children's room.  </P> <P> Sami Kanawati, owner of Cliche Boutique in Huntington Harbour, commissioned  Franqueuil to paint abstract floral designs on his shop's walls and ceiling,  then asked for a piece for his Huntington Beach home.  </P> <P> Returning to a favorite theme, Franqueuil painted a beach scene dominated by a  bold blue sky. But he wasn't satisfied when he placed the painting on  Kanawati's stark white living room wall. As he studied it, he saw the canvas  not as a boundary setting limits but as a base on which to build. And he  impulsively began expanding the scene on the wall itself.  </P> <P> Kanawati is delighted with the results.  </P> <P> "It's both abstract and realistic. When the painting goes onto the wall, it's  like it's entering the twilight zone," he says.  </P> <P> Franqueuil is as spontaneous in life as he is in his art. He came to Southern  California from Paris three years ago for a two-week vacation -- and never went  back.  </P> <P> The 34-year-old, self-taught artist -- who was born in Paris but raised in  Africa where his father's government post exposed him to politics early -- left  behind a career in which he had begun to feel stifled by his own success.  </P> <P> "Working for newspapers, you always have deadlines," he explains in a  pronounced French accent. "It takes so much time and energy that you aren't  open for anything else.  </P> <P> "I made a good living; I had a very comfortable life. But I had to leave that  world. I had a lot of ideas, but I never did anything with them. Sometimes to  start something, you have to put yourself in danger."  </P> <P> His new freedom in this country took him in unexpected directions.  </P> <P> He designed his own line of contemporary clothing (which never reached the  market), started a series of celebrity caricatures (Sylvester Stallone, Eddie  Murphy, Woody Allen) that he hopes to someday publish in a book, and drew  caricatures of George Bush, Dan Quayle and Mikhail S. Gorbachev for a line of  watches that will soon be sold through a mail-order business.  </P> <P> He also began painting on large canvases -- works that have a photographic  realism in spite of his love for Impressionism. He sold two of his oil  paintings at an exhibit last year at the Beverly Hills Hotel -- one for $5,600,  the other for $3,500 -- and he plans to make his work more widely available by  producing lithographs and serigraphs.  </P> <P> While his paintings are pure Jean-Pol, his murals are a reflection of the  people who commission his work as well as his own style.  </P> <P> In his choice of colors and subjects, he aims for harmony with the tastes and  personalities of homeowners as well as the furniture and design of a room, he  says. He recently spent a day getting acquainted with the Newport Beach  residents for whom he is doing a family portrait and a large mural -- a $10,000  project. The mural, which will be painted on canvas and stapled to the wall, is  being custom-made for a child who asked him to include a carousel, her dog and  her favorite toys.  </P> <P> Franqueuil tries to look at such work through a child's eyes, which is easy for  a man who admits that one of his main ambitions in life is having fun.  </P> <P> "Everybody has one life and one must try to spend it in the least painful way  possible," he muses. "We have to enjoy all the moments, and that's what I try  to do."  </P> <P> He enjoys his work so much that he sometimes paints through the night, not  realizing he has forgotten to sleep until he notices his roommate is leaving  for work.  </P> <P> Fun also means sky diving, wind surfing, sailing, skiing and traveling -- to  far-off destinations chosen primarily because he likes the sound of their  names.  </P> <P> His adventurous spirit was not easily put down when he tried to please his  mother by enrolling in engineering school in Paris before he decided to pursue  a career as an artist. He lasted only six months. "I was good," he says. "But I  didn't think it would be a very exciting life."  </P> <P> Franqueuil has found opportunities for excitement -- particularly in his work  -- so rich in Orange County that he's decided to stay and become a U.S.  citizen.  </P> <P> It did take some adjusting to reach that decision, however.  </P> <P> An open, laid-back man who makes friends easily wherever he is, Franqueuil  struggled at first with the impression that people here weren't interested in  having a good time.  </P> <P> "People are very involved with their work, more so than in France. There's not  much time left for doing things spontaneously."  </P> <P> But as his art attracted attention, he attracted new friends, and he learned  that "people here do have fun, but they plan for it -- three weeks ahead."  </P> <P> Now, he says: "I like the American way of life. I especially like the way your  talent is recognized here. In France, I'd have to wait until I was dead to be  recognized. In Europe, you have old habits, old culture and old ways of  thinking, and you have to struggle against that all the time. It stops your  mind.  </P> <P> "This is a new country and everything has to be tried. Whatever your age, the  attitude is if you can do something, go for it. There's hope that everybody can  succeed."  </P> <P> He doesn't find the open display of material success in this county  off-putting, though he's most comfortable in tattered jeans and work shirts,  with paint on his fingers and his sleeves rolled up.  </P> <P> "People have money, but they've worked for it," he says. "I like the way  they're proud of what they get and show it. In Europe, if you get very rich,  you try to hide it from the poor. Here, you don't have to be ashamed of what  you have."  </P> <P> He hopes his art will bring him enough success so he can someday buy a boat and  sail around the world. Flying an airplane, his own, is another dream.  </P></p>

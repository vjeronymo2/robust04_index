			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Aldwych Tube station to close THE LAST train to Aldwych Tube station in central London will run on April 2 after a decision by London Underground to close the station on economic grounds, Richard Evans writes. The station, on a spur of the Piccadilly Line from Holborn, is open only at peak times and carries 450 passengers a day to offices in the Strand, Covent Garden and Fleet Street areas. Costs of upgrading the 86-year-old station - in phases to 2021 - would be Pounds 10.7m, including Pounds 3m for lifts that need replacing immediately. Mr Denis Tunnicliffe, managing director of London Underground, said yesterday: 'At a time when the government has just reduced the amount it promised for capital investment on the existing network, the cost of replacing the lifts cannot be justi-fied.' Annual station costs at Aldwych, including maintenance, energy and staff salaries, are about Pounds 104,000 - the cost of running trains is just under Pounds 100,000. Total revenue generated by the station in the current financial year is an estimated Pounds 53,000. Closure notices will be published this week before objections are invited in February. They will be considered by the London Regional Passengers Committee and Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, before a final decision is reached on the proposed closing date.</p>

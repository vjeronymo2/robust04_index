			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL REGIONALS;  </P> <P> BOYS' DIVISION II;  </P> <P> BOUNCES ARE TORREY PINES' IN VICTORY OVER ARTESIA  </P> <P> A handful of seconds remained in the third quarter, and guard Kyle Armstrong  took his stance to try to increase host Torrey Pines' lead over Artesia in the  first round of the Division II Southern California boys' basketball playoffs  Tuesday night.  </P> <P> He shot. Klank.  </P> <P> Artesia's Deandre Austin grabbed the rebound. Armstrong raced at Austin,  knocked the ball away and into the hands of Torrey Pines' center Kevin  Flanagan. Flanagan shot.  </P> <P> Bounce. Bounce. Boom. Two points. And the buzzer.  </P> <P> The ball, everything and everybody did Torrey Pines a good turn in its 62-51  victory. The Falcons (32-1) -- who will play host to Dominguez, a 78-37 winner  over Porterville Monache Tuesday, in Thursday's semifinals -- had few worries  from the start. Artesia (21-7) had many.  </P> <P> "I think that was just an example of team unity," said Flanagan of his  last-second basket in the third quarter. "I think it's kind of unfortunate they  rely on two really good athletes. Our whole team was fighting. Our whole team  was scrapping."  </P> <P> While Torrey Pines scrapped, Artesia's Ed O'Bannon hacked. Or so said the  referees. Artesia Coach Wayne Merino wasn't sure O'Bannon, a junior who was a  preseason Parade All-American, should have had to skip gingerly around the  court through most of the second half. O'Bannon picked up his fourth foul with  4:42 remaining in the third quarter.  </P> <P> "It threw our whole rhythm off," Merino said. "It really wasn't fair, but  that's the way it goes. Anytime you're going out of your area, you've got to  deal with that."  </P> <P> That and Darren Cox. Cox, Torrey Pines' transfer point guard from Las Vegas,  refused to miss in the first half. He took the pressure off Flanagan and  forward Courtie Miller, who were packed in early by a sagging Artesia defense.  </P> <P> Cox popped in 10 points in the first quarter and had 16 by halftime, four on  three-pointers.  </P> <P> "Darren was just unconscious," Miller said.  </P> <P> "Every night it's somebody different," Torrey Pines Coach John Farrell said.  "This is a great group."  </P> <P> Cox couldn't pinpoint why he was so hot. He had his usual pregame meal of stew.  He didn't do anything different in warmups. He just felt good. No pressure.  </P> <P> "I thought we were all relaxed from the start," said Cox, who finished with a  team-high 22 points. "The first half they were falling off so (the outside  shot) was open."  </P> <P> Torrey Pines was down by as much as six early. Cox tied the score with a  three-pointer with 2:49 remaining in the first quarter and seconds later gave  the Falcons the lead with a perfect jump shot.  </P> <P> O'Bannon, who finished with a game-high 23 points, stirred the sellout crowd  with a reverse dunk in the second quarter to tie the game at 26. Then Torrey  Pines regained the lead and was never again headed.  </P> <P> The Falcons led 39-28 at halftime and 53-40 at the conclusion of the third  quarter. Artesia crawled back slightly in the fourth quarter but was unable to  come closer than eight.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOP-PAID CITY OFFICIAL IN STATE;  </P> <P> VERNON ADMINISTRATOR -- A STUDY IN POWER, CONTROL  </P> <P> Bruce V. Malkenhorst ends his daily drive to work in Vernon, an industrial  hamlet at the southeast edge of Los Angeles. The surroundings are bleak --  manufacturing plants and slaughterhouses, harsh odors, trucks, rumbling trains.  It is a city of just five square miles and 90 full-time residents.  </P> <P> Vernon may be an ugly town, a gritty town, but it is Malkenhorst's town, and he  loves it -- for good reason. In 14 years as city administrator, he has become  the highest-paid city official in California. His $162,804 yearly salary has  vaulted him past the city of Los Angeles' general manager of airports, who  earns $153,000, and has lofted Malkenhorst far beyond such lesser government  wage-earners as Mayor Tom Bradley, $97,654, and Gov. George Deukmejian,  $85,000.  </P> <P> "I always thought if I made this much money I'd be rich," Malkenhorst said,  punctuating his quip with a hearty laugh.  </P> <P> There are perks as well: The dapper, 54-year-old Malkenhorst tools past the  dusty lots and chain-link fences of Vernon in a city-leased 1989 Cadillac, gold  rings flashing on each hand, a gold band dangling from his wrist. He travels to  conferences on city government in Palm Springs, San Diego, San Francisco, and  his expense accounts and travel budgets alone total $48,000. Like all Vernon  employees, Malkenhorst puts in a four-day week; he devotes his Fridays to golf.  </P> <P> To hear Malkenhorst tell it, he is hardly overpaid. Rather, he considers  himself a bureaucratic bargain. He is not only the city administrator; he is  also the city clerk, finance director, personnel director and treasurer. He  runs the city-owned Vernon Light and Power Co. and is secretary of the newly  formed Vernon Redevelopment Agency.  </P> <P> "I think I make a lot of money here, but if I go back into private industry  (I'd make) $300,000? $400,000?" Malkenhorst said with the gruff, breezy  self-assurance that his critics call arrogance.  </P> <P> The salary, benefits and job titles form only a skeletal outline of  Malkenhorst's dominance over Vernon. A shrewd and aggressive administrator, he  has come to control this blue-collar town as though it were a Monopoly board --  and he was the only player. His power is unquestioned; even the City Council, a  part-time panel that shows little evidence of dynamic leadership, seems to  follow his directives out of both respect and trepidation.  </P> <P> For instance, a city councilman -- ostensibly one of Malkenhorst's employers --  said when asked about the city administrator's salary: "For what he's handling  . . . I agree with what he's making." Then the same councilman, pausing  uncertainly, asked not to be quoted by name.  </P> <P> </P> <P> One-Man Town  </P> <P> Malkenhorst encourages the impression that he alone runs the town,  overshadowing the actions of the council.  </P> <P> "He doesn't try to win popularity contests," said acting Police Chief Louis  Rosenkrantz. "He looks an organization over and, when he recognizes there's too  much fat on the top end, he chops it out, chops it out real clean -- almost to  the bone. He's very strong, very much in control.  </P> <P> "He's also very capable. He just doesn't give money away."  </P> <P> Malkenhorst's hard-nosed cost-cutting and business moves have streamlined the  260-member city payroll, increased revenues and tripled Vernon's huge budget  reserves, now $95 million.  </P> <P> At the same time, he has stirred enmity and alienation with almost reckless  indifference. While authorizing his own hefty raises, he has slashed the size  of Vernon's Police and Fire departments in half. He takes pride in his  reputation as a tight-fisted fiscal manager and almost intractable negotiator.  </P> <P> Malkenhorst's reign has not been without challenge. He survived a 1978 strike  in which more than 90 firefighters were fired, a grand jury indictment stemming  from alleged election improprieties and an FBI investigation of his  administration -- all challenges that have left him unscathed.  </P> <P> More recently, he has drawn the wrath of environmentalists for supporting a  planned $29-million toxic waste incinerator in Vernon -- a project that would  substantially boost city revenues. He also angered much of Vernon's business  community by proposing tough new restrictions on trucking and warehousing.  </P> <P> "He is ruthless . . . a dictator," said one longtime businessman, who asked not  to be identified. "He is a powerful man . . . and he revels in that power. He  has hurt a lot of people over the years."  </P> <P> Malkenhorst denies that firings or threats are a regular part of his management  repertoire, saying he does not know why people seem to fear him. "We've  negotiated good (labor) agreements with our people," he said. "We put them on a  four-day work week because we had trouble keeping people. Most of the people  who work for the city enjoy it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Demonstration of Power  </P> <P> But in another breath, he delights in recalling an incident from years ago,  when he was new to the job and firefighters were preparing for their walkout.  One firefighter in particular was showing up at public meetings and lashing out  at members of the City Council.  </P> <P> "I asked the council why they allowed him to do that," Malkenhorst remembered  in an interview, "and they said, 'Well, what can we do?' " Malkenhorst smiled  as he related the anecdote. "I said, 'There's a lot of things you can do. He  works for the city. We're not a Civil Service city. . . .'  </P> <P> "We just took his job out of the budget. He was gone before the strike."  </P> <P> With that, Malkenhorst let loose with his distinctive laugh, a laugh that  erupts like an electrical storm, brightens his face and bombards the ears of  his listeners with a crackling burst of sound.  </P> <P> He has a wide, even grin and a sporty mustache that contribute to an air of  competence. He is robust and athletic, an aficionado of softball, golf and  ocean swimming. At his best he can be witty, charming and gracious, and yet  those attributes never seem to interfere with his judgments at City Hall; they  never obscure his view of the bottom line.  </P> <P> At biweekly council meetings he seems bored, leaning back in his chair or  mumbling into the microphone on the dais.  </P> <P> Insiders in Vernon consider Malkenhorst's power to be unassailable, even  though, in theory, he answers to the City Council and could be replaced at any  time. In practice, he consults council members only when he deems it necessary.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Exclusively Industrial'  </P> <P> To understand Malkenhorst's power it is necessary to understand Vernon, a city  unlike any other in Los Angeles County. Founded in 1905 solely to foster  industry, it still bears the motto, "Exclusively Industrial." The town -- one  of the richest in California in sales tax revenues -- stands in sharp contrast  to such neighboring cities as Huntington Park, Maywood and Bell, tiny, densely  populated enclaves that struggle to pay their bills.  </P> <P> The Vernon landscape is a treeless, jarring sprawl of square buildings. There  are no parks, no greenbelts. The streets are creased and bisected by 114 miles  of railroad track, and at times the odors from slaughterhouses and other plants  produce a stench that is almost suffocating.  </P> <P> Vernon's sole claim to architectural fame is the mural-covered Farmer John  slaughterhouse, a rambling structure that each year produces, among other food  items, enough hot dogs to satisfy 3 million Dodger fans.  </P> <P> It most recently was in the news this spring when a consumer group ranked  Vernon as far and away the county's worst polluter among cities releasing  airborne hazardous chemicals.  </P> <P> Although 45,000 people go to work every day in Vernon, all but a handful depart  before nightfall. The town contains just 32 housing units, 26 of them owned by  the city. Those homes and apartments are occupied by a group of city employees  who receive subsidized rents, paying as little as $50 to $75 a month for two-  and three-bedroom houses. Each occupant must be approved by the City Council.  And at least four of those occupants are members of Malkenhorst's high-scoring,  park-league softball team, the Vernon Tigers. (Malkenhorst, the catcher, bats  eighth.)  </P> <P> Efforts to create more housing in Vernon have failed, largely because of zoning  and policy decisions made by city government. For one thing, chemical wastes  have contaminated much of the ground, Malkenhorst said. And, by the city's  reckoning, each acre of new housing would cost 40 to 50 jobs to Vernon's first  priority -- industry.  </P> <P> "Kids, you can't raise them here. There's no parks," Malkenhorst said. "And if  you want to go shopping, there's no grocery stores."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Real Check on Government  </P> <P> Detractors said the housing arrangement leaves Vernon without the system of  checks and balances that is vital to government. After all, the Malkenhorst  critics asked -- anonymously, of course -- what city employee living almost  rent-free in a city-owned house would dare to initiate changes at City Hall?  Who would step out of line by running for office or by publicly supporting a  challenger?  </P> <P> The point seems valid. One resident, city employee Jack Looper, even declined  to discuss life in Vernon without written permission from Malkenhorst. Council  members, meanwhile, take their elected posts for granted; none bothers to  collect campaign contributions, city officials said. The newest member of the  council was appointed to fill a vacancy in 1981, and the city's last contested  race, in which two incumbents were reelected, was in 1980.  </P> <P> "You couldn't get any kind of political toehold in the city of Vernon if your  life depended on it," said Carlton E. Claunch, a former firefighter who  campaigned in vain for a council seat in 1978. "It's absolutely impossible."  </P> <P> Mayor Leonis C. Malburg, 60, a major landowner whose grandfather John Leonis  helped create Vernon, is the most prominent member of the council, a veteran of  33 years. It was the conservative, soft-spoken Malburg who helped to bring  Malkenhorst aboard in the mid-1970s, after the retirement of the former top  administrator, who apparently lacked his successor's talent for consolidating  power.  </P> <P> Since then, Malburg has liked what he has seen. "I think the feeling is, he's  doing a fine job for the city, or he wouldn't be there," the mayor said. "It's  that simple."  </P> <P> Malkenhorst, a father of five, is a longtime Downey resident who graduated from  Compton High School and Woodbury College before working for a number of private  companies as a controller. He was with the finance department at the city of  Manhattan Beach when Vernon hired him, instructing him to shore up the city's  finances and come to grips with newly forming labor unions.  </P> <P> The directive to Malkenhorst was simple -- "Don't give away the store" -- and  he followed it with a vengeance.  </P> <P> His role in the firing of city firefighters touched off years of upheaval, even  bomb scares.  </P> <P> "Those were really fun times," Malkenhorst recalled, wistfully.  </P> <P> Although a judge upheld the dismissals, firefighters attempted to challenge the  political Establishment. They brought in Claunch, a retiree, who took a room  above a cafe and announced his candidacy for office. Almost immediately, he  recalled, he was besieged by city inspectors trying to force him to move.  </P> <P> "They said (the room) wasn't designed for residential use," Claunch remembered.  "They started putting pressure on the landlord, on the people who leased the  cafe. One day seven inspectors showed up."  </P> <P> Claunch and the landlord circumvented the city codes by drafting an agreement  that made him a night watchman. When election night came, according to Claunch,  the city election officer -- Malkenhorst -- disqualified a number of ballots;  Claunch lost the race to Malburg, the incumbent mayor, by a vote of 33 to 24.  </P> <P> "I had the votes," he said bitterly. "I still think I won that election."  </P> <P> Malkenhorst said he did not recall disqualifying ballots that year. The race,  however, became the subject of a district attorney's investigation at Claunch's  request. Claunch charged, among other things, that the mayor lived outside the  city. Malburg owned -- and still owns -- a six-bedroom, six-bath home with a  pool in Hancock Park, but claims as his legal residence a suite in a Vernon  office tower.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Louis K. Ito, who handled the investigation, recalled  obtaining testimony from a maid who said the mayor lived outside of Vernon.  Meanwhile, Malkenhorst also faced accusations stemming from negotiations to  rehire the fired firefighters.  </P> <P> "The president of the association calls me . . . says he wants to talk to me to  see if there's any chance they can get their jobs back," Malkenhorst recalled.  "I said, 'You can't have that (union) attorney involved any more.' He said, 'No  problem, he's gone.' And they got me for soliciting a bribe because of that."  </P> <P> Ultimately a grand jury indicted both the mayor and Malkenhorst, but each was  cleared in court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Slashed Police Jobs  </P> <P> Malkenhorst next turned his attention to the Police Department. He eliminated  many positions and turned others into civilian jobs. Morale plummeted. At the  next city election, in 1980, retiring Police Chief Spencer E. Hogan -- the  resident of a city-owned home -- surprised City Hall by proclaiming himself a  candidate. The city immediately evicted him, saying city-owned homes are for  active employees.  </P> <P> Another resident, Philip Reavis, then president of the Vernon Chamber of  Commerce, also decided to run for office. Reavis, the owner of one of the few  private homes in Vernon, allowed Hogan to move in, and together they ran to  challenge a pair of incumbents.  </P> <P> This time, Malkenhorst disqualified six ballots, subtracting those votes from  each of the two challengers. The lost votes made a difference as incumbents  Hilario Gonzales, with 35 votes, and Keith K. Kaeser, with 32, won reelection.  Hogan ended up with 30 votes, Reavis with 27.  </P> <P> "If you were going to write a Mel Brooks movie, this is the kind of thing you'd  make up," said Reavis, who filed suit over the race but later abandoned it.  </P> <P> Malkenhorst recalled throwing out the ballots because the names on six  voter-registration forms were found to be outsiders not residing in Vernon. He  pinned the blame on the challengers for bringing them into town.  </P> <P> Under Malkenhorst, the city soon began exploring new ways to make money. One  was to take advantage of its own electric-power grid, built by founder John  Leonis in the 1930s. Rather than buy all of its power from the Southern  California Edison Co., Malkenhorst began purchasing electricity more cheaply on  the open market, importing it from Arizona, the Pacific Northwest and  elsewhere.  </P> <P> The practice is evidence of his business acumen, supporters said. It has  enabled Vernon to boost budget reserves while providing power to industry at  discount rates. However, Edison officials now blame Malkenhorst for destroying  the once-friendly cooperation between the city and the company, and the two  groups are now locked in a legal battle over Vernon's access to Edison's  interstate transmission lines.  </P> <P> Recently, Vernon has been at odds with environmentalists and officials from  surrounding cities, including Los Angeles, over the proposed toxic waste  incinerator, a facility that would handle 22,500 tons of hazardous chemicals  each year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Backs Waste Incinerator  </P> <P> Malkenhorst has supported the proposed toxic waste incinerator by saying it  would keep chemical wastes off the highways while addressing the problem of  overburdened landfills.  </P> <P> Vernon residents are too fearful of the city government to voice any concerns,  according to Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-East Los Angeles), whose  staff members attempted to circulate anti-incinerator petitions in town.  </P> <P> "A lot of them were very, very upset about the fact there was an incinerator  being proposed," she said in an interview. "But they were afraid to speak out  because they were in housing owned by the city or they had jobs (with the  city). The people in Vernon are being held hostage by their own government."  </P> <P> Similarly, when a group of 28 companies in and around Vernon filed suit against  the city to challenge the incinerator and several zoning actions being planned  to reduce trucking and warehousing, they arranged to keep their identities  secret. The suit -- settled after the city made some concessions -- was handled  entirely by an attorney who shielded the names of his clients.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fear of Malkenhorst  </P> <P> So extensive is the fear of Malkenhorst that several former city employees and  current members of the Vernon Chamber of Commerce declined to discuss him, even  privately. Critics said the former employees fear losing their retirement or  disability payments; business people fear City Hall retribution.  </P> <P> "You'll hear that again and again and again," said Sandra R. Southworth, a  Chamber of Commerce board member. "You'd think that this can't exist in the  United States today."  </P> <P> In Malkenhorst's view, Vernon has quieted down since his rollicking early days.  It seems almost boring sometimes, running the town where hardly anybody lives,  making more money than the governor, assured of his position behind the plate  for the Vernon Tigers. Still, he plans to stay on.  </P> <P> "Getting old, getting lazy," he explained, flashing the grin.  </P> <P> "I like it here."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Claudio Rinaldi: "The Poisoned Plebiscite: The </F> Right Attacks: An Unfair Fight?"]    [Text] Overwhelming mass media. Shovelfulls of money.  Nonpolitical agreements. The trio Bossi-Fini-Berlusconi is not  competing with its adversaries on equal terms. And if the latter  do not react, the campaign could become a walkover.    You are a party of the center or of the left. Do you want to  use television advertising? You have to go to Fininvest. And  there you have two choices. You can pay full price for the ads,  and you are ruined. Or, you can accept Fininvest's super  discount, which is even worse: in effect, you accept financing  from the Milanese tycoon, and you even have to declare it in  accordance with the law. Do you see the absurdity? Those who  want to combat the politician Berlusconi on television must  accept money from the businessman Berlusconi. And probably have  to tell him: thank you, and what a pluralist you are.    It is just an example, not even the most important, of the  distortions introduced into the political contest by the entry  of the owner of Fininvest. These distortions are making a fixed  match out of this electoral campaign because of the enormous  disproportion between the political forces in the contest. They  further give an artificial and vaguely repugnant appearance to  the rise of the Right, an outcome which the polls predict.    The Right was strong to begin with, very strong. Never in  power, the Lega and the MSI [Italian Social Movement] had stolen  much less than the others: while the winds of Clean Hands were  blowing, they could demonstrate a kind of virginity. In  addition, they had two first rate leaders. Bossi is coarse and  Fini pedantic, but both are capable of appealing to many sectors  in Italy. But neither of the two would have created a triumphant  Right without Silvio Berlusconi, the man who was described on  the cover of L'ESPRESSO last November as "the vote gatherer"  while many were still pondering the misleading question of  whether or not he would run.?    Berlusconi has made headway with a deployment of forces  never  before seen, beyond the reach of any other rival. By now,  everything is known about the limitless television and newspaper  empire that the state and the banks have allowed him to own. But  little attention is paid to how that empire is used, in which  moments of impartiality are rare. The chief's adversaries are  attacked mercilessly; on the other hand, television coverage of  him abounds and favorable interviews appear even in nonpolitical  newspapers. Television stations beat the drum for Forza Italia,  mobilizing stars and starlets; the magazines even distribute  postcards to register. But above all, Berlusconi's mass media  are used to condition the mass media that he does not own. The  uproar against RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation] is an  extreme case, with grotesque results, such as the gag imposed on  the satire "Tunnel," but it is not the only one. Every day  Fininvest's powerful resources warn the state-owned television  news programs and independent daily newspapers against rubbing  Berlusconi the wrong way; or else the rumor will be spread that  the other news media owners have taken sides with the left. It  is impressive firepower. Umberto Bossi himself recognized it  when he admitted that without an agreement with Berlusconi, his  League party would have risked being "literally cancelled."    But this is only the best known aspect of Berlusconi's  power.  There are others. For starters, money: Berlusconi has  incomparably more of it than his adversaries. His companies  (Standa [department store chain]) do not pay their suppliers,  they delay paying eminent collaborators like Maurizio Costanzo  (Channel 5) for months, they even leave the winners of  television quiz shows ("Yes or No") high and dry; but the money  reaches Forza Italia through a hundred mechanisms already  described by CORRIERE DELLA SERA. This behavior may well be  described as immoral, but it has the advantage of nourishing the  network of clubs without risking criminal penalties. This is  because, according to the law of 1974, a private company can  subsidize a party without limits, on the one condition that the  contributions be approved by the board of directors and  described in the balance sheet. Well, Fininvest is not at all  embarrassed to openly finance the Forza Italia clubs since they  both have the same owner. For the PDS [Democratic Party of the  left] and the PPI [Italian Popular Party], however, it would be  impossible to find a financier who would agree to appear as such.    That is not all. Only Berlusconi can count on thousands of  yes-men trained for years to the cult of the chief. This is why  his party, created from above by managerial decision and  entrusted to masses of paid employees, can establish in two  months the 9,000 offices that would cost other groups the work  of generations; and it is the only party that does not have and  structurally cannot have internal conflicts. Forza Italia is  also the only organization that gathers support effortlessly for  non-political reasons: from the major bankers who risk seeing  their credits go up in smoke to the small suppliers left waiting  for payment, the country is full of people who have a material  interest that Berlusconi's political adventure not end in a  catastrophe. This does not account for the fact that  Berlusconi the businessman, moving between commercial  television, supermarkets and soccer teams, also has  non-political know-how in manipulating the emotions of the crowd.    It is the sum of these elements of strength that confers on  Berlusconi's campaign the unpleasant appearance of a walkover,  and leads one to blame the right for conducting an unfair  contest. It is not competing with the Center and the Left on  equal terms. And the evidence is to be found not only in the  rapidity with which the Right seems to grow, but especially in  the speed with which Berlusconi has become the undisputed head  of the entire alliance, supplanting within a few weeks Bossi and  Fini, who are superior to him in charisma and in real political  following.    It is obvious that Berlusconi, besides being powerful, is  able. He knows well how to use the immense arsenal he possesses.  He has represented his entrance into the contest as a  long-awaited and long-feared event, by means of a show of  pretended hesitations and reconsiderations which few recognized  from the beginning as designed to mislead. Moreover,the great  event has been transformed quickly into many minor events: the  cassette with the recorded appeal on television news, the  convention in Rome transmitted in its entirety on Channel 4, the  refusal to take part in direct debate, the call-ins on RAI talk  shows. By contrast, the Left has created a campaign totally  devoid of events, except for such negative ones as agreements  with Communist Renewal, tiresome negotiations over candidacies  conducted by small, petulant groups, and now involvement in  judicial investigations. Even the name chosen, "progressives,"  is abstruse, it is a word no one ever uses; and the symbol is  ugly.    In 1978, Enrico Berlinguer, who did not have television,  knew  how to create one grand event. It was enough for him to say, in  an interview with Giampaolo Pansa, that he accepted NATO's  protective umbrella. There is a need for equally striking and  serious gestures today. Otherwise, only a miracle will be able  to stop the Right.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Are you in favor of the electoral agreement between the League and Forza Ita-|  |lia for the northern voting districts?

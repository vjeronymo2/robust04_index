			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOSPITAL CITES NURSE ERROR IN PATIENT DEATH  </P> <P> A Garden Grove woman suffering from advanced breast cancer died last November  after a nurse at FHP Hospital in Fountain Valley grabbed the wrong medication  from a shelf and mistakenly administered a lethal dose of potassium chloride,  FHP officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> "This was an egregious error on the part of the nurse and an inexcusable lapse  in judgment," FHP said in a written statement, adding that the nurse was  suspended immediately and fired a week later "as a result of her mistake."  </P> <P> On that same date, Nov. 21, 1989, FHP said that it notified the California  Board of Registered Nurses of "the termination and the medication error."  </P> <P> The nurse, Maureen Daubert, could not be located Thursday for comment.  </P> <P> Francis J. Johnson, 74, died on Nov. 14, 1989, one day after paramedics brought  her to FHP in what a hospital official described as a "semi-comatose"  condition. Johnson, according to FHP, "was an end-stage victim of cancer who .  . . was expected to die within a short period of time."  </P> <P> Dr. Gary E. Goldstein, a regional vice president for the health maintenance  organization, said that Johnson had "perked up" the morning of Nov. 14. But by  that afternoon, Goldstein said in an interview, Johnson's condition was listed  as "extremely poor" and her doctor prescribed the diuretic Lasix to maintain  her blood pressure.  </P> <P> Nurse Daubert, Goldstein said, walked to the shelf where medication is kept  and, instead of removing Lasix, mistakenly grabbed "KCl" -- the chemical  abbreviation for potassium chloride.  </P> <P> "The (doctor's) order was written for Lasix," Goldstein said. "The error is  such that we viewed it as totally accidental -- an extreme medication error. A  one-time event."  </P> <P> Goldstein said that as soon as Daubert realized her error, she and others tried  immediately but unsuccessfully to revive Johnson.  </P> <P> In addition to firing Daubert, Goldstein said the hospital also has relocated  the potassium chloride to prevent the mistake from happening again because of  the alphabetical proximity. Goldstein said FHP will continue to investigate the  incident.  </P> <P> The statements by FHP officials came on the same day that the Orange County  coroner's office formally amended Johnson's death certificate to "acute  potassium intoxication." The original certificate, signed by Dr. Sabry Fahmy  Ghaly, attributed the death to Johnson's "metastatic breast cancer."  </P> <P> Investigators began looking into the woman's death last month after state  officials were contacted by an FHP employee, Fountain Valley Police  Investigator Steve Williams said. When deaths occur because of unnatural  causes, California law requires hospitals to notify local coroners so that  autopsies may be performed.  </P> <P> In its statement on Thursday, FHP said its ongoing "internal review" has found  it "difficult to determine Mrs. Johnson's exact cause of death because any one  of several acute problems could have been at fault, including septic shock,  massive heart failure, and terminal cancer beyond treatment."  </P> <P> As to the issue of FHP not reporting Johnson's death to the coroner for  possible autopsy, Goldstein said there was no effort to hide the mistaken dose  of potassium chloride. Based on his and an FHP lawyer's questioning of four  doctors and four nurses involved, Goldstein said that Johnson's grave condition  because of cancer weighed heavily.  </P> <P> "The universal feeling was, the death seemed so obvious to us (because of  Johnson's cancer and its complications) it never crossed their minds to make it  a coroner's case. Half said, 'Gee, maybe we should have.' And half said, 'Gee,  I don't know. . . .' It didn't cross their mind, unfortunately."  </P> <P> Bruce Lyle, a supervising deputy coroner, said that Johnson's death certificate  was amended Thursday to reflect what his office believes to be the woman's true  cause of death. Asked if FHP officials should have reported Johnson's death for  a possible autopsy by the coroner's office last November, Lyle said:  </P> <P> "Absolutely. It would have been autopsied at that time. . . . We can't do  anything until the case has been reported to us."  </P> <P> Dr. Ghaly, who signed the original death certificate attributing Johnson's  death to her metastatic, or spreading, breast cancer, declined to be  interviewed and referred a reporter to FHP's public information office.  Goldstein said that contacting the coroner's office is usually the  responsibility of FHP's nursing staff.  </P> <P> Johnson, who is survived by her husband and three children, died on Nov. 14 at  5:50 p.m. -- 40 minutes after nurse Daubert administered the potassium,  according to Lyle, the deputy coroner.  </P> <P> Based on a review of hospital records and interviews conducted by state medical  investigators, Lyle said, the coroner's office determined that Johnson's death  was "accidental."  </P> <P> Garry Garcia, a son of Johnson, said Thursday that he was puzzled about how his  mother died and the handling of the original death certificate. Garcia said his  family did not learn of the mistaken potassium dosage until a coroner's  official called June 4.  </P> <P> Asked about that, the FHP's Goldstein said, "I don't know for sure what was  said or what wasn't said."  </P> <P> Fountain Valley Police Sgt. Williams said the circumstances surrounding  Johnson's death, including the hospital's failure to notify the coroner of the  potassium overdose, remain under investigation. Williams said he plans to  present his findings to the district attorney's office later this month.  </P> <P> Moreover, Daubert remains under scrutiny from the California Board of  Registered Nursing, according to Susan Brank, the board's assistant executive  officer. Brank said that the board, which controls the licensing of nurses, has  been examining Daubert since January.  </P> <P> But Brank said that, contrary to earlier, erroneous statements by police,  Daubert's license has not been revoked and has been in good standing since she  began working in California in September, 1981. Brank declined to say what the  board has learned during its five months of investigation or what prompted the  inquiry.  </P> <P> FHP said its notification to the board last November started the investigation  and that FHP doctors and nurses "have cooperated fully."  </P> <P> According to officials with Fountain Valley police and the coroner's office,  Daubert had been questioned as of Thursday by only the state nursing board.  Investigators say they believe she has moved out of state.  </P> <P> Dr. Thomas A. Raffin, chief of respiratory medicine at the Stanford University  School of Medicine, said that an infusion of potassium would typically follow a  treatment with Lasix because the diruetic flushes the body of a number of  nutrients and minerals.  </P> <P> "If the level of potassium in the blood falls, it can cause the heart to have a  bad rhythm, which can result in death," said Raffin. On the other hand, Raffin  said, a hyper-elevated level of potassium can stop the heart, also causing  death.  </P> <P> In Johnson's case, the administering of potassium before, instead of after, the  Lasix, proved deadly. Deputy Coroner Lyle said that Johnson's amended  certificate of death lists the cause as "cardiac arrhythmia due to hyper  kalemia." In lay terms, Lyle said, "it means too much potassium in the blood  system."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Marla Cone contributed to this report.  </P></p>

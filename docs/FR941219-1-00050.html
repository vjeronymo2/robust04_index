The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State of California Fish and Game Commission has listed  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Parvisedum leiocarpum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Navarretia plieantha  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (now known as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Navarretia leucocephala  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ssp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> plieantha <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) as endangered species under the California Endangered Species Act (Chapter 1.5 Section 2050  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> of the California Fish and Game Code and Title 14 California Code of Regulations 670.2 ). The California Fish and Game Commission also has listed  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Navarretia pauciflora  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (now known as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Navarretia leucocephala  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ssp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pauciflora <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) as threatened. Listing by the State of California requires individuals to obtain a memorandum of understanding with the CDFG to possess or ``take'' a listed species. Although the ``take'' of State-listed plants is prohibited (California Native Plant Protection Act, Chapter 10 Section 1908 and California Endangered Species Act, Chapter 1.5 Section 2080), State law exempts the taking of such plants via habitat modification or land use changes by the owner. After CDFG notifies a landowner that a State-listed plant grows on his or her property, State law requires that the land owner notify the agency ``at least 10 days in advance of changing the land use to allow salvage of such a plant'' (Native Plant Protection Act, Chapter 10 Section 1913).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The California Environmental Quality Act ((CEQA) Public Resources Code Sections 21000&hyph;21177) requires a full disclosure of the potential environmental impacts of proposed projects. The public agency with primary authority or jurisdiction over the project is designated as the lead agency, and is responsible for conducting a review of the project and consulting with the other agencies concerned with the resources affected by the project. Section 15065 of the CEQA Guidelines, as amended, requires a finding of significance if a project has the potential to ``reduce the number or restrict the range of a rare or endangered plant or animal.'' Species that are eligible for listing as rare, threatened, or endangered, but are not so listed, are given the same protection as those species that are officially listed with the State or Federal governments. Once significant effects are identified, the lead agency has the option to require mitigation for effects through changes in the project or to decide that overriding considerations make mitigation infeasible (CEQA Section 21002). In the latter case, projects may be approved that cause significant environmental damage, such as destruction of endangered species. Protection of listed species through CEQA is, therefore, dependant upon the discretion of the agency involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because vernal pools are generally small and scattered, they are treated as isolated wetlands or waters of the United States for regulatory purposes by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers under section 404 of the Clean Water Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Clean Water Act regulates discharge of fill material into wetlands but does not itself protect the plants. Nationwide Permit No. 26 (33 CFR part 330.5 (a)(26)) was established by the Corps to facilitate issuance of permits for discharge of fill into wetlands up to 4 ha (10 ac). For project proposals falling under Nationwide Permit No. 26, the Corps has been reluctant to withhold authorization unless a federally listed threatened or endangered species is known to be present, regardless of the significance of other wetland resources. The section 404 regulations require an applicant to obtain an individual permit to fill isolated wetlands or waters greater than 4 ha (10 ac). A project proponent affecting wetland fill of less than one acre is only required to notify the Corps of their intent to fill wetlands. Compensatory mitigation generally is not required for projects affecting less than one acre. In either case, candidate species receive no special consideration. Additionally and equally important, upland watersheds are not provided any protection. Disturbance to or loss of pool hydrological conditions has damaged populations and habitat as discussed previously in Factor A. Reductions in water volume and inundation adversely affect all four plants. Thus, as a consequence of the small scale of vernal pools and lack of protection of associated uplands, these vernal pools receive insufficient protection.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

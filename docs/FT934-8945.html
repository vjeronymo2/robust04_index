			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Inco to take output charge INCO plans to take a USDollars 70m pre-tax charge against first-quarter 1994 earnings to cover the costs of recently-announced cutbacks by the Toronto-based nickel producer, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. Inco has painted a mildly encouraging picture of the international nickel market, predicting a drop in Russian supplies to the west and a significant decline in inventories early next year. The group plans to cut output by 16 per cent next year.</p>

			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JURY DEADLOCKS IN MURDER TRIAL OF SPORTS AGENT  </P> <P> A mistrial was declared today during the 14th day of jury deliberations in the  trial of a sports agent accused of hiring two men to kill an ex-business  partner.  </P> <P> The Alameda County Superior Court panel reported it was deadlocked 9-3 to  convict Michael Blatt of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.  </P> <P> That left Judge Frank Kim no choice but to declare a mistrial, because jurors  must reach unanimous verdicts for convictions in criminal cases under  California law.  </P> <P> Blatt, a developer in Stockton and briefly acting general manager of the  Seattle Seahawks, was accused of hiring two former football players from the  University of the Pacific to kill Laurence J. Carnegie.  </P> <P> He was shot with an arrow from a crossbow near Stockton on Feb. 28, 1989, then  strangled. Carnegie's body was dumped in rural Sonoma County.  </P> <P> The two men Blatt was accused of hiring, James Mackey and Carl C. Hancock,  admitted killing Carnegie. They were guaranteed reduced sentences for  cooperating with Blatt's prosecution.  </P> <P> "We went through a very conscientious decision process, and we were unable to  reach agreement," said jury foreman Bob Peppler.  </P></p>

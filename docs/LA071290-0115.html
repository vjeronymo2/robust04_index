			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A'S SEEK ESCAPE IF RAIDERS RETURN  </P> <P> The World Series champion Athletics are considering a plan to leave Oakland if  the city succeeds in wooing the Raiders back to the San Francisco Bay area.  </P> <P> The A's want the right to leave after the 1995 season if the city gets the  Raiders back, according to city officials.  </P> <P> The A's also requested a package of rent concessions and loan deferrals that  would cost the city and Alameda County about $1.5 million per year if Oakland's  latest return-the-Raiders plan works.  </P> <P> The proposed changes in the lease would be in addition to a series of lease  improvements, valued at about another $1 million per year, that the A's  obtained from the city in May.  </P> <P> A's President Wally Haas said Tuesday that the team wanted the new package  because the club could suffer considerable financial losses competing for fans  with the Raiders.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul District Civil  Court's ruling on Monday in favor of the plaintiff in a sexual  harassment case has set an important precedent for women facing  similar troubles.    The case was brought by a Seoul National University (SNU)  teaching assistant, identified only as Miss U, against her  professor known as Mr. Sin, seeking 50 million won (about 62,000  U.S. dollars) in compensation for mental anguish due to sexual  harassment. Presiding Judge Pak Chang-u of the court's panel  No. 18 ruled, after nearly six months of hearings, that the  defendant must pay 30 million won to the plaintiff.    The judge decided that although the defendant claimed the  plaintiff took action to gain revenge for her dismissal as a  teaching assistant last August, her anguish caused by the  defendant's sexual harassment, such as unnecessary physical  contact, "is recognized in view of the witnesses of the  plaintiff and her colleagues and other evidence."    The historic ruling is expected to spur many women suffering  sexual harassment to take action at the risk of disclosing their  secret problems.    In the court struggle, the defendant was supported by  women's  organizations and the SNU student government, which put up  posters on campus last August charging Professor Sin with  frequent sexual harassment -- trying to embrace Miss U from  behind and rubbing her shoulders, for example. The women's  organizations and the student government also formed a joint  committee to draft measures against sexual harassment.    Professor Sin filed a countersuit charging Miss U with  libel,  claiming she brought the case merely to take revenge for her  dismissal.    After four court hearings over nearly half a year, the  verdict at last went in favor of the plaintiff.    The joint committee welcomed the ruling, calling it historic  in that it has set a favorable precedent for women subjected to  sexual harassment. But it noted that the ruling overlooked  sexual discrimination and disadvantages in employment, thus  failing to recognize sexual harassment as a social problem.    A poll of 458 working women conducted by the joint committee  last November showed 87 percent of the respondents had  experienced sexual harassment. Only 17.5 percent said they had  taken action against their tormentors, including demanding an  apology. Miss U's lawyer, Yi Chong-kol, said the ruling greatly  increases the possibility that women will win sexual harassment  cases in the future.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 20, 9-15 May 94] </F>   [Text] On 13 May 1994 President Leonid Kravchuk signed a  decree on establishment of the Ukrneftegaz (Ukraine's Oil and  Gas) National Joint-Stock Company (NJSC) of a holding type.    On 14 May, the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers discussed a  draft plan for NJSC stock placing.    Enterprises, which belong to the Ukrainian oil and gas  industry, are supposed to be amalgamated in NJSC as the latter's  affiliates through contributing their stocks to its authorized  fund. These enterprises constitute a special group, for which  the President's decree specified certain conditions involving  their transformation into joint-stock societies ("On holding  companies, which are set up in the process of corporatization  and privatization", of 11 May 1994).    The Cabinet approved a decision to set up NJSC as early as  12  April 1994. However, its materialization will be possible only  after the aggregate property, which belongs to the enterprises  to be NJSC's stock-holders, has been evaluated. (For more  details see UBN no. 14/1994).    Tentative estimates appraise it at over $22 billion (in  1992's prices). However, it is subject to great variation  depending on evaluation approaches and methods and the number of  affiliate enterprises to undergo the merger.    In the meantime, the decision on Ukrneftegaz's establishment  has triggered ambivalent responses from the interested circles.    Prior to making the decision, top-placed officers of the  State Committee for Oil and Gas repeatedly urged NJSC  establishment as a national agent, capable of speedily resolving  the crucial problem of Ukraine's indebtedness to Russia for its  fuels supplied to Ukraine, as well as of accumulating enough  means, foreign investments included, to develop the oil and gas  industry. They did not conceal the fact that the National  Joint-Stock Company would be a monopolist structure. Since there  were no other options, the holding company idea had to be  accepted. Nonetheless, in view of Ukraine's very peculiar mode  of denationalization, which, among other things, provides for  the State's invariably controlling parcels of stocks in all the  supposedly denationalized enterprises, the little trivial  peccadillo of monopolism on the part of the State per se, may be  overlooked.    Since, as the State Committee for Oil and Gas maintains, the  affiliate enterprises are supposed to retain relative  independence on NJSC, they may well develop into the latter's  competitors, in due time.    Contrary to this upper echelon mood, the grass-roots  sentiment tends to doubt NJSC's expediency as a unified and  integrated structure. As managers of enterprises under the  Ukrneft (Ukraine's Oil) and Ukrgaz (Ukraine's Gas) associations  (substructures of the State Committee for Oil and Gas) maintain,  NJSC will likely channel the thus pooled means to targets, other  than the enterprises' development, which will reduce to naught  the generally laudable concept of the industry's  denationalization and individual enterprises' privatization, as  well as badly compromise their stabilization chances.    NJSC's inexpedience is further predicted on grounds, it will  form yet another unnecessary administrative suprastructure among  the none too few Ukraine's bureaucratic institutions.    Such misgivings and apprehensions are not altogether  groundless, since the Cabinet's thinkers are rumored to be very  busily engaged in masterminding yet another ministry  specifically to exercise control over NJSC (along the lines of  Russia's Ministry for Power and Fuels).    Presently, Ukraine's oil and gas industry has basically four  levels of hierarchy: immediate producers, seven major pipe-line  agencies, the Ukrgaz, Ukrneft, Ukrgazprom associations, and the  State Committee for Oil and Gas on top of them. NJSC and  probably the new ministry will likely make up as many as six  levels.    Such a restructuring mode will likely result in renaming the  old structures and setting up new administrative bodies.    As attentive observers maintain, it is hard to predict,  which  trend will prevail, since the two options are dictated by the  involved parties' ambivalent and often clashing opinions, which  make the resultant vector too dim and obscure.</p>

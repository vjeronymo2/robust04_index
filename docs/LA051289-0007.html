			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> UC Riverside administrators have discriminated, harassed and retaliated against  staff members on the basis of sex, race, age, national origin and disability  for more than 20 years, 24 employees contended in a class-action discrimination  complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Labor. The case falls under federal  jurisdiction because the campus holds contracts with the U.S. government. Labor  Department investigators have been on campus to interview staff members who  signed the complaint, officials said, and Labor Department investigators met  last week with Chancellor Rosemary S.J. Schraer, said university spokesman Jack  R. Chappell. But he said the campus has not been formally notified of any  investigation. Wanda Clark, a staff member speaking for the employees who  signed the complaint, said events supporting the claim go back as far as 1968.  </P></p>

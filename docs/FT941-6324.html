			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Yielding to pressure The US Treasury bond market, which has been scaring itself with inflationary phantoms ever since the Federal Reserve tugged on the monetary reins last month, has spooked itself some more. Revised figures suggesting the US economy grew at an annualised rate of 7.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1993 were eye-catching but somewhat academic. The hand of God, which has administered earthquakes and snowfalls, will have slowed that breakneck expansion this quarter. Bond traders were more alarmed by the latest purchasing managers' price index, which showed a second consecutive monthly rise. Such figures emphasise how quickly disinflationary pressures are abating but they do not yet confirm that an inflationary trend has asserted itself in the real economy. The purchasing managers' index can be an unreliable predictor of consumer price inflation. The rise in some commodity prices will be partly offset by the continued weakness of oil. Consumer confidence and employment levels remain weak. The bond market may therefore be over-reacting to inflation fears but may still be right to anticipate a further monetary tightening. European bond markets are being buffeted by the US turbulence even though yesterday's developments strengthen the argument for a decoupling. The output gap in many European economies will widen this year, creating scope for further interest rates falls. But it would help if the Bundesbank had been bolder in cutting its money market repurchase rate by more than 3 basis points.</p>

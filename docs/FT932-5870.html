			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Spanish Elections: Gonzalez floors his conservative tormentor - Aznar seemed to grow visibly younger, until he looked like a schoolboy LIKE A man slipping down a slope, Spain's prime minister Felipe Gonzalez put a hand out on Monday night and at last found something to hold on to. Running second in the opinion polls and with just four days left to campaign before the snap election on June 6, Spain's prime minister for the past 11 years desperately needed his conservative tormentor, People's Party leader Mr Jose Mara Aznar, to make a mistake in public. On Monday night he did. During a crucial televised debate, Mr Aznar did not get a figure wrong or contradict himself; he simply refused, repeatedly and in front of more than 12m people, to say what he would do if he won the election. Where were the policies? Mr Gonzalez asked over and over again. The repeated and grave reply was that Spain needed a restoration of confidence to generate savings that would create jobs. 'Obviously that is what Spain needs,' retorted Mr Gonzalez at one point. 'But how? All you ever seem to do is solemnise the obvious.' This was a different Felipe Gonzalez to the tired figure Mr Aznar was able to walk over in their first debate a week earlier. He was slippery and much more nimble than the conservative leader, and even the fiercely anti-Gonzalez newspaper El Mundo said yesterday morning he had beaten Mr Aznar. 'A whip-like Socialist leader insisted that Aznar say how he was going to solve the economic crisis, what he was going to do about unemployment . . . . Jose Mara Aznar did not survive the attack,' wrote a Mundo columnist, Raul Heras. 'He should have set aside his script and improvised, but he still does not know how to.' It was not a pretty sight. Mr Aznar, who left the building in a hurry after the three-hour debate, seemed to become visibly younger as the night wore on. Had he been 51, like Mr Gonzalez, that may have been no bad thing. But he is only 40. Whoever trained him to laugh and snigger while an opponent is talking to him was on to a loser. Mr Aznar even laughed while he was - perhaps because he was - losing arguments, and it made him look like a schoolboy. The debate was a revelation because, while Mr Gonzalez was equally vague about what he would do to get Spain out of its recession, it also demonstrated his ability to think on his feet. It seemed to expose a hitherto hidden weakness in Mr Aznar - the fact, as El Mundo pointed out, that he struggles to improvise under pressure. Spain will have taken note, and there is no doubt Mr Gonzalez will have succeeded in persuading many hundreds of thousands of undecided former Socialist voters to stay away from the PP and, perhaps, return to the fold. At a national level, the debate may even have been enough to enable the Socialists to draw level again with the PP. According to a poll in El Pas at the weekend, the PP was leading by enough to take a parliamentary majority of about four seats. But the rot in the Socialist tree at a provincial level, where the votes are counted, may be too far gone. Under Spain's rigid system of proportional representation, one vote can decide the fate of a series of seats in parliament and voters have to vote for one party, not individuals. While Mr Gonzalez leads in personal polls, the divided Socialist party is nowhere near as attractive to voters. The prime minister never mentioned his party during the debate and, oddly, Mr Aznar never tried to force him to. The playing field is level again (though that, in itself, is a big setback for Mr Gonzalez, who has a parliamentary majority for the time being). Instead, the prime minister has been allowed, at the last minute, to make the election a personal affair and to dare the country to sack him. It has worked before and Mr Aznar's performance on Monday will not have made the alternative very attractive.</p>

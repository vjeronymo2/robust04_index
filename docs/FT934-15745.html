			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Transferring shares I WISH TO transfer some shares to relatives. Am I able to do this simply by completing a stock transfer form and sending it to the registrar (the shares are in plcs quoted on the London Stock Exchange). Is stamp duty to be paid and, if so, how? Do I have to go to a stamp office? How is the transfer altered if the transaction is not at market value? If the shares are being transferred by way of gift, you merely have to complete the stamp-duty exemption certificate on the back of each transfer form (as well as completing the front of the form, of course) and then hand it and the share certificate over to your relative so that he/she can send them to the registrar. If the transfer is not by way of a gift, stamp duty is payable at one-half per cent, in units of 50p. Stamping can be arranged through the Post Office, if need be. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Books: Schoolgirl feminist MOVING BEYOND WORDS Glory Steinem Bloomsbury, Pounds 9.99, 296 pages The cover of this book says it all. Here, at 60, is Gloria Steinem: long blonde hair, drainpipe pants, high black boots, exquisitely manicured fingernails. She is the acceptable face of American feminism: radical but feminine, prosperous - the picture of a healthy, pampered confident young girl. And that is the problem. For between the covers, Steinem writes like an adolescent. Moving Beyond Words is a collection of essays: some revamped versions of the smart journalism with which she made her name, such as 'Sex, Lies and Advertising'; others new, long pieces on Freud, on a feminist economics, on being 60. It is these, published to celebrate 30 years of feminist wisdom, which reveal Steinem's limitations as writer and thinker. They are embarrassing, tedious, shallow and, in their pretence to scholarship, deeply fraudulent. The essay 'What if Freud were Phyllis?' is the core of the book. At 90 pages it introduces the volume and Steinem, subtitling it 'The Watergate of the Western World', compares it both to Swift's A Modest Proposal and Nabokov's Pale Fire. In fact, it is a trite pastiche of Freud's life, constructed as a mock biography of Phyllis, a matriarchal psychoanalyst who discovered male womb envy and female breast castration anxiety. Steinem tells this deadpan but, every few sentences, she tries, like a precocious student, to catch out teacher Freud. He was beastly to his wife, 'too bad Martha didn't write a book'. He had an affair with his sister-in-law - or even worse, he did not: 'If he'd had a satisfying sex life with anybody, he wouldn't have been so bananas.' And his theories were a male conspiracy which 'keeps society and the psyche in its proper order'. Years ago, Steinem got laughs out of role reversals. Her fantasy of men menstruating when women could not, for example, - 'men would brag about how long and how much . . .street guys would invent slang (he's a three-pad man)' - was funny, warm, provocative. By contrast, this pastiche is crass. We know Freud was a chauvinist who made serious errors about female sexuality; Steinem merely trivialises feminism's long quarrel with psychoanalysis. And in her schoolgirl cockiness, she ignores the key point - that Freud was an intellectual revolutionary whose effect on modern consciousness can never be reversed, in spite of grave individual flaws in his argument. Like many feminists, Steinem's vision of truth is ideologically determined. She interprets basic human experiences through the prism of a gender war. In 'Doing 60' she complains that the (male) state is removing older women's right to bear children: 'France has just passed a law against medically assisted procreation for post-menopausal women . . . It makes you understand why women lie 'about their age'.' The undertone of the Freud piece is that women would have better sex if Freud had not got us wrong. Through them all run the cliches - 'testosterone-fuelled corporations', 'women are primordial underdogs' - which reflect the strong hold of political correctness on our responses to Steinem's world view. To demur, says Steinem's tone, is to rule yourself out as a moral player. For so many of the issues Steinem discusses - ageing, sexual neuroses, having and rearing children or not having them - are problems which are not entirely or even largely caused by politics. A return to flower power - 'I hope to live to the year 2030, and see what this country will be like when one in four women is over 65 . . . perhaps we will be perennial flowers who repot ourselves and bloom many times' - is not the answer. The psyche was never an easy or simple thing. Steinem's utopianism denies the tragedy and awe, the chaos and venality, that are a rich part of life and whose absence leaves her book soulless and banal.</p>

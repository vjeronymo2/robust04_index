			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Revlon postpones plans for flotation REVLON, the cosmetics and consumer products company taken over by Mr Ronald Perelman, the corporate raider, after a bruising bid battle in 1985, yesterday postponed plans to float shares on the stock market. Revlon first announced flotation plans in May. It said it intended to transfer the bulk of its cosmetics, skin care, fragrance and personal care operations to a new subsidiary, New Revlon. It would then sell 20m shares in New Revlon to investors, leaving the rest of the equity - an 82.2 per cent stake - to be held by a company controlled by Mr Perelman. According to the original flotation filing, the maximum price at which the shares were to be sold was Dollars 19 - raising up to Dollars 380m. Revlon later amended this, reducing the size and price of the potential offering to 11m at a price of Dollars 14 to Dollars 15. But yesterday, it postponed the flotation altogether. The company said the 'prevailing market conditions for initial public offerings have weakened domestic institutional demand' and the offering could not 'be done at a price we think is consistent with Revlon's overall value and operating prospects.'</p>

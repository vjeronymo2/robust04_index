			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mert Kubu: "Private Army in Estonia Causes </F> Concern"]    [Text] "Halt! This is as far as you can go." With his  combat-ready Kalashnikov, 21-year-old Joel Kitt stands in front  of the gates to the former KGB wiretapping station in Pullapaa.  He is one of the soldiers in the feared paramilitary company, a  private army, a state within the Estonian state -- which no one  seems to have the nerve to tackle.    The paramilitary force's camp is located at the far end of a  promontory just a mile outside the Estonian town of Haapsalu.  Inside the gates are 38 career soldiers, armed to the teeth. Two  paramilitary men who are wanted by the police, suspected of  complicity in a murder, are probably hidden there too.    However, their commander, "Lieutenant Colonel" Asso Kommer,  has been detained by the police in Tallinn. He is suspected of  having shot and wounded a police captain and his assistant. The  two plainclothes policemen tried to stop Kommer on a street in  downtown Tallinn. A firefight broke out. Rounds were fired from  automatic weapons. Kommer fled, but was apprehended later.    Another of the company's officers has been detained and  charged with hooliganism.  <H5>  Fled to Sweden </H5>   A third paramilitary leader, "Major" Jaak Mosin, fled to  Sweden where he has applied for political asylum. Mosin is  accused of attempting a "state coup."    Now the Estonian police want to interrogate the two private  soldiers who are suspected of murder, but the company refuses to  hand them over.    It is easy to understand why the criminal police are not  eager to drive out to Pullapaa. The paramilitary camp looks like  an army garrison. Behind the high fence they have set up  machine-gun nests out of old tractor tires filled with sand. The  young men have been trained by veterans of the war in  Afghanistan.    Now both the police and the private soldiers are accusing  each other of being in league with the mafia. Opinions differ on  who fired the first shot on Parnuvagen. A government commission  is looking into the matter.  <H5>  Russian "Businessman" </H5>   The police allege that "Lt. Col." Kommer was involved in the  murder of a Russian "businessman." Kommer's defenders claim that  the criminal police have mistreated him under interrogation and  have also drugged the "lieutenant colonel."    One version of the rumors that are flying in Tallinn now  maintains that the Russian "businessman" was really the key  figure the police turned to in order to commission a  professional killer from Russia for assignments in Estonia.  According to this theory, the paramilitary force simply killed  the Russian in order to get rid of him.    Whatever is true, the whole thing is an incredible story  that  could only happen in a country that has just won its freedom and  is moving toward a fragile democracy. Those involved in the  affair include cabinet ministers, many members of parliament,  the defense staff, the Home Guard, and high-ranking police  officers -- and it is very likely that the frequently mentioned  mafia is peripherally involved as well.    The paramilitary soldiers themselves? Most are young men in  their twenties, their leaders are somewhat older. For a large  part of the Estonian nation they are heroes who have struck  terror into the hearts of the mafia, of organized criminals.  Others call them bandits, murderers, extortionists.    The paramilitary company was born during the "singing  revolution." The company was organized from the newly formed  Estonian Home Guard (Kaitseliit). The officers were appointed by  the Estonian Government in exile. This exile government had been  in existence in Sweden, Norway and the United States during all  the years of the occupation. It quickly appointed some 80  reliable "officers" in Estonia.  <H5>  Long Popular </H5>   The paramilitary soldiers in Pullapaa were very popular for  a  long time. When the police were powerless against the extortion  rings, people called on the paramilitary force. They are famous  for the time they cleaned up the Kibuvitsa (Wild Rose) Bar. They  lay in ambush, seized eight Russian extortionists, shot them in  the legs, pulled sacks over their heads, and delivered the  bloody group to the local sheriff. That is how things used to be  done in the wild West, but hardly in a nation governed by law.  The Estonian Government appointed a commission. But nothing  happened.    Last summer, then Defense Minister Hain Rebas, a  Swedish-Estonian history professor and reserve captain in the  Swedish Armed Forces, tried to straighten things out. The  paramilitary company was to be disbanded. The soldiers refused  to surrender their weapons. Members of the Home Guard from all  over the country came to the aid of the paramilitary force. A  regular military unit, the Kalev battalion, was order to move  toward Pullapaa.    Fortunately they desisted from attacking at the last minute.  For three critical days Estonia was very close to a small civil  war.    Defense Minister Rebas resigned in protest against the  passivity of the other members of the government.    And today? The 38 paramilitary men work in shifts.    "We go to Tallinn and guard a metal warehouse and a casino,  among other things. The food is good here. There will be more of  us in the spring," said the young guard, Joel, before the guard  commander, Eero, came out with his pistol dangling in the  holster under his arm and shouted at Joel.    They are not allowed to get too friendly with strangers  here.  <H5>  A Leader Who Shuns the Light </H5>   Behind the Estonian paramilitary force stands "Colonel"  Kalle  Eller, a short man in his fifties. He is a former language  teacher.    We met at dusk in a house in central Tallinn. Eller prefers  to move around when it is dark outside.    "I have been forced to go underground. The criminal police  have conducted three raids in an effort to catch me," Eller said.    Eller assured us that he has no quarrel with the Estonian  Government. Until quite recently he was a public adviser to the  parliamentary Defense Committee. Eller was also a frequent  visitor to Justice Minister Kaido Kama's office. He is a private  adviser to Kama. Both are supernationalists.    "We simply do not trust the red `polkovniks', the colonels  from the former Red Army who are still found in the leadership  of the Estonian Armed Forces," Eller said.    Isn't it enough that Estonia's commander in chief is a  former  high-ranking NATO officer who worked in the Pentagon for a long  time?    No, Eller did not think so. The commander is surrounded by  far too many former "reds." Nor does Eller believe in the police  charges against Kommer, while the accusations against "Major"  Mosin, who is in exile in Sweden, are absurd fabrications, in  his opinion.    Who pays the paramilitary force in Pullapaa?    "Sponsors. The men are paid 1,000 kronor a month, the  officers and the female company doctor gets 1,500. The money  comes from private security jobs in Tallinn, among other things."    And Eller turned up his collar and disappeared into the dark  city.</p>

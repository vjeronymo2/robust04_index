			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the </F> Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, DFLP, by  Tal'at Rumayh and Mahmud Bakri in Khartoum in early December]    [Excerpts] [AL-SHA'B] What will the region's future be like  after the Gaza-Jericho agreement?    [Hawatimah] I believe that the Gaza-Jericho agreement will  not work out. It is completely and essentially different from  the Camp David accords, which gave Egypt all of Sinai, including  Taba, in return for its recognition of Israel within borders  that are thus far unclear.    As known, we have been and still are against Camp David,  because it did not achieve what it promised. The accord opened  all the roads to the Israeli aggression and expansion in the  Palestinian and other Arab territories. The settlement activity  prospered all over the occupied Palestinian territories until  the settlements now cover 22 percent of the lands occupied in  1967. Settlements now spread all over the West Bank and Gaza  Strip. They threaten to cover 60 percent of these areas.    That is our stand on Camp David. The Gaza-Jericho agreement  does not even rise to the level of Camp David, which caused all  these crimes. The agreement gives only limited self-rule to the  inhabitants of Gaza and the town of Jericho, with no sovereignty  over a single inch of Gaza and Jericho. It also legitimizes the  redeployment of the Israeli occupation troops all over Gaza and  Jericho after the evacuation of the densely-populated areas. I  can say clearly that Taba talks that were held in Cairo involved  an agreement on the redeployment of the Israeli troops in Gaza  and Jericho, while keeping the settlements and dividing the Gaza  Strip into four sectors, three of which are Israeli: The  northern settlements, the central settlements, and the southern  settlements. All these settlements are linked to Israel and the  bridges and crossing gates remain in the hands of the occupation  troops. [passage omitted]    [AL-SHA'B] You said that the agreement will not work out.  What if its provisions are applied for some time and  self-government elections are held? Will you boycott the  elections?    [Hawatimah] We distinguish between legislative elections  that  elect a legislative council (a parliament) through which our  people can determine their own destiny and the election of an  executive council in accordance with the Gaza-Jericho agreement  to implement the agreement and legitimize it. That is why we  will not take part in the elections of the executive council,  because its task is to implement the agreement and the exchanged  letters of recognition. Such a council would legitimize the  occupation of our country for a further five-year period.    [AL-SHA'B] How do you see the Palestinian situation after  the  self-government elections?    [Hawatimah] I can say now that Israel will withdraw its  recognition of 'Arafat as a representative of the Palestinian  people, because Israel, the United States, and the EC will deal  with the executive council as the elected representative of the  Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank. Hence, 'Arafat  will be there to represent Fatah only or abroad to resume  negotiations concerning the five-year period.    [AL-SHA'B] In your current position you rely on Syrian  opposition of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. What if Syria  supports the agreement or signs a peace agreement with Israel?    [Hawatimah] That possibility exists. This is one of the  interests of Syrian policy. So far, Syria has announced that it  favors a comprehensive peace and solutions and opposes  independent bilateral agreements.    Syria declares that it favors full withdrawal from the Arab  and Palestinian territories in return for full peace. This has  been the declared Syrian stand so far. The Madrid negotiations  and the Gaza-Jericho agreement have shown that the Syrians are  sincere in their statements.    [AL-SHA'B] How can inter-Palestinian fighting be avoided?  How can the campaign against the agreement be prevented from  becoming a struggle over the figure of 'Arafat himself? What is  your view of the fact that international balances of power  impose certain conditions on the Palestinians?    [Hawatimah] The DFLP, the unified central leadership of the  DFLP and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine,  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], the 10 Palestinian factions  [who reject to Gaza-Jericho agreement], and the Arab Liberation  Front -- which has not yet joined the 10 factions -- all have a  unified position on the issues. The masses of our people might  very well join this broad-based stance. Some other forces might  also join the struggle against the Gaza-Jericho agreement. We  in the DFLP have declared that the major conflict is between our  nation -- represented by all its forces, factions,  personalities, and streams -- on the one side and the occupation  and the settlement policy on the other. Although  inter-Palestinian differences are no longer minor, we must  always put our conflict with the occupation before any  differences among ourselves. All rifles, all stones must be  directed against the occupation and the settlement activity.    We must solve inter-Palestinian differences through recourse  to the people themselves via sound democratic methods. That is  why we are proposing a referendum on the Gaza-Jericho Agreement.  If the majority of the people accept it, we will comply and  respect their wishes. If the majority reject it, then those who  signed the agreement must retract and comply with the will of  the majority. [passage omitted]    We oppose all forms of killing and political assassination.  We submit to the people's wishes. If you are democratic, you  must submit to the popular will. We have always opposed  operations outside the occupied territories that were merely  individual acts of showmanship because we believe that the  people can liberate themselves through organized collective  action. No matter how important an individual's role is, it  remains limited if it does not have a social and political base.  If it has such a base, it becomes much more important.  [passage omitted]    [AL-SHA'B] Judging by your current disagreement with the  leadership of Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, are you  thinking of establishing an alternative PLO or a parallel  National Council?    [Hawatimah] We are against having two PLO's. At the same  time, we do not wish to hand over the PLO as a gift to Yasir  'Arafat. The PLO is not any person's private fief. We have  blazed a path of political and armed struggle for 25 years now.  The PLO's program since 1968 has asserted that the organization  is actually a broad-based coalition. 'Arafat's wing, however,  ruined the coalition and tore apart the unified national front  that existed within the PLO. We call for rebuilding Palestinian  national unity and the PLO's broad-based national coalition on  democratic, electoral grounds that will restore the  organization's legal and popular character. Its historical  legality is no longer sufficient.    In this connection, we demand the election of a united  national conference that will include representatives of our  people inside and outside the occupied territories. We have  begun preparatory steps with the hope of doing this by 13  January. The work of this conference must focus on the  following three basic issues:    1. We must formulate a collective political program for the  Palestinian people inside and outside the occupied territories.  To ensure a return to legitimacy, representatives of all the  factions opposing the Rabin-'Arafat agreement must take part, in  addition to representatives of opposition groups within Fatah  itself.    2. Local leaders and subsequently a unified leadership of  the people inside and outside the occupied territories must be  elected. This leadership will head the unified national front  that will be formed by the united national conference.    3. The united conference inside and outside the occupied  territories must elect a unified committee to lay the groundwork  for rebuilding the PLO's institutions, notably the Palestine  National Council.</p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Construction Contracts: French tourist attraction A major clean up programme is to be undertaken at the bay surrounding Mont-Saint Michel because it has been severely polluted by untreated waste. Roughly 1.5m visitors a year come to Mont-Saint Michel, a rocky isle topped by a Benedictine abbey and connected to the mainland by a causeway. Despite the multitude of visitors, hotels and restaurants on the isle have dumped untreated waste water into the bay. Mr Pierre-Frederic Teniere-Buchot, a regional water official, said the cleanup plan would cost FFr20m (Pounds 2.03m) and would establish a waste treatment system within two years. He also forecast that the cost of water was likely to increase by 180 per cent. The project will entail the temporary removal of the cobblestones paving the isle's narrow main street. The bay, already a subject of environmental concern, has been shrinking in size because of the encroachment of silt.</p>

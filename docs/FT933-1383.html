			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Milk price auctions attacked DAIRY industry executives yesterday attacked proposals put forward by Milk Marque - successor to the Milk Marketing Board - for an auction to set prices and allocate supplies when the industry enters a free market next April. They also questioned the legitimacy of the proposals because the government has not yet approved the arrangements under which Milk Marque will operate. 'I'm not sure it's really an auction: it's not even-handed and it's not transparent,' said Mr Jim McMichael Phillips, president of the Dairy Trade Federation. Industry executives object to the complexity of the scheme, which has five stages for determining prices with plans to consult widely before final prices are set. 'The fact that all these consultations are built into it leaves it open for wheeling and dealing behind closed doors, and that is not the way a free market should work,' said Mr Neil Davidson, group executive at Northern Foods. Northern Foods plans to buy all its milk directly from farmers when the government's compulsory purchasing system is abolished next year. MD Foods, a British offshoot of a large Danish farm group, has approached farmers about buying supplies directly, but also plans to purchase some milk through Milk Marque. 'I'm unhappy with the way milk will be allocated,' said Mr Roger Clarke, MD Foods' commercial director. 'If there is too much demand for supply and companies need to be scaled back, what basis will they use for that?' Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive of Milk Marque, said his proposals had received tacit approval from the Office of Fair Trading. But Mr McMichael Phillips said this was premature because the government had not yet approved arrangements for Milk Marque to set itself up to replace the Milk Marketing Board.</p>

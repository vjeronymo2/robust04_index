			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Malbak registers 14% increase MALBAK, the industrial conglomerate in the Gencor group, overcame difficult trading conditions to record a 14 per cent increase in earnings to R374m (Dollars 89.5m) in the year to August, compared with R329m a year ago. Turnover rose by 10 per cent to R11bn, and although gross margins were under considerable pressure, cost reductions and productivity improvements helped offset these conditions and operating income rose by 7 per cent to R820m. Mr Grant Thomas, chairman, said the results were 'very pleasing' seen against the difficult operating environment. He said the group was forecasting a modest increase in earnings for 1994, but said predictions were extremely difficult given the huge changes which lay ahead, including South Africa's first multiracial elections. Reflecting his cautious outlook - Mr Thomas said it was unlikely that there would be any return to 'sustained economic growth' in the coming year - the dividend was increased by 4 per cent to 35 cents per share. Earnings rose by 8 per cent to 122 cents per share from 112 cents.</p>

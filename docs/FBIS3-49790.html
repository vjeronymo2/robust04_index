			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Regular" Friday interview with Prime Minister Vladimir </F> Meciar by editor Peter Toman; place not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Toman] Some political  observers hold very skeptical views of Visegrad Group prospects.  How do you see the Visegrad Four future?    [Meciar] As far as the cooperation within the Visegrad Four  is concerned, the year 1993 can be assessed as the year of  wasted opportunities. The creation of a common market area was  supposed to have begun in 1992. We have made no headway in this  respect. Multilateral cooperation has begun to stagnate. The  building of an infrastructure in the border areas which would  make it possible to establish communications between and within  the states is stagnating. There are no programs which would  outline a specific course of action in developing cooperation in  the very near future. [passage omitted]    The Slovak Republic is exceptionally interested in the  continual development of Visegrad Group. It is interested in  the continual development of very effective forms of cooperation  between Visegrad Four in the spheres where it is, from the  pragmatic view point, appropriate and essential. In other  words, this is the development of the economy, trade, transport  and communications, the coordination of the course of action  vis-a-vis European Communities. All of this is promising.    Naturally, the active development in 1994 will be to a  certain extent modified by the situation surrounding the  elections in the Republic of Hungary. Once again we shall be  awaiting the outcome of these elections. There are concerns on  our side that (?more time could be wasted) again.    Thus it is important for the Slovak Republic. We shall be  striving for and seeking ways of cooperation. But whether this  cooperation will actually materialize depends equally on all the  four partners.    [Toman] The Brussels and Prague deliberations have somewhat  overshadowed the fact that over here, on our political stage,  developments in the Slovak National Party [SNS] have  intensified. How do you interpret those conflicts, and above  all, what consequences for the functioning of the coalition  government and the stability of our internal political situation  could they have?    [Meciar] What is going on inside the SNS is a matter for  that  party alone. But if such developments have an influence on the  government coalition, then it is not a matter for that party  alone because, naturally, it concerns the coalition, both in  parliament and in the government. The nature of these  developments was determined some time ago. Frequently, rhetoric  obscured the truth, but we recognized the truth and discussed  it. There has always been, however, a contradiction between  what was being said at the negotiating table and what was the  SNS representative telling the public. Sometimes this even  included untruths of which he was aware. But it is impossible  to be in a coalition and at the same time against the coalition.  The current dispute is not between those who are in favor of  partnership and cooperation, because we are partners and we do  not wish to deny their identity anyone. It is between those who  do not want the coalition and this shared government on the one  hand, and those who want the coalition and want to preserve the  shared government on the other.    Several facts do surprise me, though. First of all,  immediately following the signing of the coalition agreement,  those SNS officials who had contributed to the creation of the  coalition were attacked, while those who had criticized the  coalition agreement gained the upper hand. Second, the  government was joined by officials who did so on the basis of  the coalition agreement and as a result of having the SNS  mandate. These very same people are now being accused of career  ambitions, although they have accepted posts of a lower status  than they used to enjoy in parliament.    Likewise, I am astonished to see that in a process  resembling  a kind of purge, party officials or deputies representing the  party [SNS], are being despatched to the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. Since this is taking place at a  time when the national-democratic club is being set up, we have  to ask the question: What about the SNS, has it not been a  national-democratic party all along?    We know a lot about backstage deals and therefore are  anxious  to see the results of the SNS deliberations. From our point of  view, the ideal situation would be if our partner acted in a  united fashion. As this seems to be impossible, could we at  least know who is who, please?    The situation when one thing is being said in the public and  something different is being done behind the stage can hardly  last much longer.    [Toman] Critical responses are coming in from HZDS district  and local assemblies to that part of the New Year address by the  president of the republic which speaks about the need to set up  a more broad coalition government. What do you think about this  proposal?    [Meciar] First, the New Year message is usually delivered in  a festive atmosphere and rounds up the whole nature of the  festive season. I do not know whether his speech had a  disturbing effect. However, there was a special section of the  community where its disturbing effect was felt.    It is not commonplace that the president should question the  government of his own country before the talks of such  importance, as were the talks with NATO on joining the alliance.  This sends a very serious signal abroad and it backfires. At  the same time, in practical politics there cannot be two policy  lines -- one from the Castle [president's seat] and one  government policy, because there is only one government and it  is the government that makes policies.    The only reason why the HZDS is far more sensitive to these  matters is that the president has been holding talks on various  levels for several months. During these talks he has been  trying to win the support of the people from the movement and to  turn them against their own movement's chairman and against  their own government.    As for the broad coalition idea, this is nothing new. After  all, right from the very beginning our existence in the  government was based on a close cooperation with the SNS and the  Party of the Democratic Left [SDL]. As soon as certain possible  changes started to take shape, we proposed a coalition to the  Party of the Democratic Left. For me personally the biggest  disappointment of 1993 was [SDL Chairman] Peter Weiss' statement  that they [PDL] never took these talks seriously, because we  [HZDS] have always very seriously and very honestly taken our  place at the negotiating table.    There is, of course, yet another dimension to the forming of  a coalition. We do not even oppose a coalition with the  Christian Democratic Party [KDH], or in their own terminology,  with the part of the Christian Democrats that would like to  cooperate with us. But [KDH Chairman] Jan Carnogursky sets down  as a condition for the coalition that the HZDS give up its  chairman. We do not set this condition to the KDH. But what if  we did? Does this mean that the HZDS should relinquish its  leadership only to accommodate Carnogursky. Milan Knazko  [chairman of the Alliance of the Democrats of the Slovak  Republic--ADSR] has set down a similar condition. And what club  does he represent?    Discussing our coalition with Egyuetteles is not on, I  think.  Our cooperation with the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement  could have some proper foundations and both of us are trying to  establish that they exist. And thus, voicing an idea and a  slogan at the same time not being able to impart a content to  them and specify in what ways they should be implemented is very  difficult. Attaching personal dimensions to parties' attitudes  and differences in policies and pointing out that the one who is  to blame is Meciar amounts to great simplifications and I cannot  accept this viewpoint.    The HZDS, which supported Mr president in the election by  giving 74 votes to him, perceives his moves in a far more  sensitive way, mainly because his moves are directed at breaking  up the movement. But the movement has been built to provide  defenses against any external attack and, as such, it is  defending itself. I think it is a legitimate defense.    Given this situation, just consider the action taken against  [Ivan] Lexa [whose ministerial appointment was blocked by  President Kovac]. He is threatened with the possibility that  criminal prosecution could be relaunched against him for an  offense which was not used even under Husak -- nothing happened  to Bilak [former member of CPCZ Central Committee], Colotka  [former Slovak prime minister] -- who were in this situation.  But here, when a person says publicly what he [Lexa] said at a  HZDS meeting, criminal proceedings are launched against this  person and a punishment of deprivation of freedom is looming  over him and he is being threatened with the confiscation of his  passport. This does not create a good atmosphere, because Lexa  enjoyed the trust of the same (?representation) whose trust the  president sought. [passage omitted]    [Toman] The latest opinion polls once again signal the  deepening political apathy of the population. The fact which is  not too flattering is that in the assessment of trustworthiness  of eight frontranking institutions in the state, the government  found itself in last place. What, in your opinion, is the  reason for this and how would you like achieve a reversal of  things in the year that has just began?    [Meciar] We were aware of this threat before and that is why  our last three cabinet sessions in 1993 considered this  development, and the fact that the government could actually  drop to the last place. After all, a citizen is continually  being fed with the information that the government can be blamed  for everything. The government can be blamed for any silly  action of any official in Slovakia, it is blamed for each  businessman who is out of work, is responsible for a hole in the  road roadworkers failed to mend and so on. What this amounts to  is that the government is identified with all the bad things in  Slovakia. This has been achieved by influencing people's  reasoning and thinking.    We are facing a task of exposing what (?the practical)  responsibility of each official is and, on the other hand, to  demonstrate the work of the government. I am confident that  this relationship will be reversed.</p>

The plan was to meet Boris Yeltin in  Moscow en route for New York, but now Nursultan Nazarbayev has  canceled that, we were told today by the Kazakhstani president's  press service. Andrey Kondrashov reports.    [Kondrashov] This latest rejection by the president of  Kazakhstan is not, as it seemed, linked to the upcoming visit to  Almaty by Andrey Kozyrev. The Kazakh leader canceled his talks  with the Russian president much earlier. In addition, the  arrival of Russia's Foreign Ministry chief in the republic will  not by any means resolve all the problems between the two states.    Observers put this down to Kazakhstan's unwillingness to  hold  talks on military cooperation in particular.    The stumbling block, as before, is Baykonur. Kazakhstan does  not want to lease it to Russia on the previous terms. Having  declared the space site to be its own property, the republic  wants, I quote, to hive off only the military part of it for the  Russian military, leaving the civilian part for itself to put to  commercial use.    Since Russia continues to maintain all of Baykonur, it quite  naturally sees this option as unacceptable. Moreover, the  duration of the lease on Baykonur and the cosmodrome's status  have yet to be decided. In addition to this, the very presence  of Russian military units on Kazakhstan territory is a breach of  the constitution. And, Kazakhstan has still not elected a  parliament settle the issue.    It looks as if Andrey Kozyrev's visit to Almaty has simpler  aims. Even before his arrival, Nursultan Nazarbayev announced  that Kozyrev will not get him to introduce dual citizenship.  However, the president of Kazakhstan has in advance drawn up a  compromise for Russia. Instead of dual citizenship, he intends  to propose to Andrey Kozyrev a simplified procedure for  Kazakhstan's ethnic Russians to obtain Russian citizenship.</p>

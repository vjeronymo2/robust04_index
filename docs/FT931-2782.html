			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Unionists protest at slip by Major MR JOHN MAJOR sparked protests from Northern Ireland's Unionist MPs yesterday after accidently suggesting that he would block the setting up of an assembly in the province. Downing Street moved to correct what it said were 'inaccurate interpretations' of the prime minister's remarks in the Commons on Tuesday, when he said he opposed 'extra assemblies . . . in any part of the UK'. Britain remained committed to finding new arrangements for government in Northern Ireland as part of a wider political settlement, it said. But Mr Major's comments led to Unionist accusations that he was creating confusion. They also betrayed tension between the Northern Ireland Office and the Scottish Office, which last week published its paper opposing devolution in Scotland. The Northern Ireland Office has been worried about the impact of its 'taking stock' on its attempts to balance Unionist and nationalist aspirations. The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, yesterday wrote to Mr Major asking for clarification of his remarks which, Mr Paisley said, had undermined the purpose of political talks on the province last year.</p>

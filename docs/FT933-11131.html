			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Wales (7): High tech has replaced the smoke stacks  -Industry FEW things epitomise the new face of industrial Wales better than the arrival of Robert Bosch outside Cardiff two years ago to produce a new generation of alternators for the motor industry. The Pounds 100m investment was new; the product was new; the end markets were new. For the German company, motor equipment is the most important part of its Pounds 5.4bn business and it had decided to locate its most advanced factory in a country that was once best known for its heavy industries - coal, steel, engineering, chemicals and metals. 'We chose Wales,' says Dr Kurt Liedtke, managing director of the company's British arm, 'because the site was close to the M4 motorway, the ports of Cardiff and Southampton and because we wanted to be close to the new motor manufacturers such as Nissan, Toyota and Honda which have set up in the UK. 'South Wales has a history of industrial excellence and so Bosch knew its employees would have the necessary technical skills which could then be further developed through re-training programmes.' If Bosch is a leading example of the new industrial Wales it is far from being the only one. Almost across the road from its plant, British Airways has built the largest hangar in Europe to service its Boeing 747 Jumbo fleet. Electronics, motor parts, food processing, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology abound. High technology has replaced the smoke stack industries of the past. In case it be thought that the new Wales is only based in the south, the little town of Newtown, in mid Wales, is home to Control Techniques, one of the fastest-growing producers of variable-drive motors. Hamilton Brothers is building a gas and oil plant at Point of Ayr in Clwyd. Euro/DPC is making medical diagnostic products at Llanberis in the shadow of Snowdon. And Toyota has an engine plant at Shotton. 'The process of attracting new industry has resulted in a transformation in Welsh business and industry over the last 15 years,' says Mr Ian Kelsall, Welsh director of the Confederation of British Industry. 'An enormous number of new jobs has been created and there has been a very large expansion in manufacturing industry in the country.' One newcomer is Ascom, subsidiary of a Swiss concern whose Pounds 1.5bn annual turnover puts it among the larger producers of telecoms equipment in Europe. 'We started in Cardiff in 1985,' says Mr Payl Moirano, marketing director, 'with a workforce of 100. It's now up to 300 and we are still recruiting. The plus factors are a flexible labour force, good labour rates and a workforce with an ability to learn new skills. Employment costs in Wales are very competitive against those anywhere else in Europe.' Mr Keith James, chairman of Eversheds Phillips and Buck in Cardiff, and a director of the Bank of Wales, says that the 'Welsh economy has been transformed to one with an above national average proportion of manufacturing. Manufacturing now accounts for 27.3 per cent of Welsh gross domestic production whereas the UK figure is only 22.4 per cent. 'Success in attracting big export-oriented names such as Sony and Panasonic means Wales is increasingly integrated into the European and world economy.' Today, more than 25,000 people work in electronics, a figure overshadowed by the 70,000 in the financial-services sector. Financial services, with the arrival of concerns such as National Provident Institution, N M Rothschild, Axa and D C Gardner have been one of the cornerstones of the new growth. Even those older industries which remain have played their part in the regeneration of Wales. Coal may no longer be more than a bit player in the economy, with just four pits employing about 1,000 people where once a quarter of a million worked underground. But steel, even if its numbers are drastically reduced, still has a leading role. The industry now employs some 14,600 where once there were more than 85,000. But its production lines at Newport and Port Talbot are among the most efficient and most profitable in Europe, while the coated-steel plant at Shotton is a market leader. The tinplate works at Troestre and Ebbw Vale are producing a new can opener, the Ecotop, a twin-button opener to replace the ring-top, described by Mr Brian Sims, an executive at Newport, as 'a significant new development in beverage packaging. Instead of having to pull the ring, you just push two small buttons. 'The product has been developed by us in conjunction with Hollands's Hoogovens and Germany's Rasselstein and has been accepted by Sainsbury's. It illustrates the international nature of our business.' Two academics at the Cardiff Business School, Mr Stephen Hill and Ms Julie Keegan, have pointed to a 'Welsh manufacturing renaissance,' showing how the long-term decline in industry has been reversed in Wales. In a paper, Made in Wales, written for the CBI, they state that 'Wales started the 1980s with relatively low levels of manufacturing output and with manufacturing making a lower-than-average UK contribution to regional GDP. 'By the end of the decade the Welsh manufacturing position had been transformed. Manufacturing had grown faster than the UK average so that it now makes a higher-than-UK-average contribution to regional GDP.' That renaissance has been stimulated to a great extent by the arrival of inward investment, much of it from overseas but a large amount from elsewhere in the UK. 'Attracting new investment in Wales, environmental improvements and helping small and medium-sized companies to grow will continue to be our key priorities,' says Mr Phil Head, chief executive of the Welsh Development Agency. Dr Gwyn Jones, until June chairman of the WDA, adds that in the five years of his chairmanship 'The agency has more than doubled the rate of inward investment projects and tripled the associated capital investment. Wales is now seen as the leading UK region for winning inward investment and we are much feared by our European competitors.' The last word on the transformation comes from Mr Kelsall. 'The new industry and the new arrivals have resulted in a general improvement in standards. When the Japanese first came to Wales just over 20 years ago they could not get the the sort of quality supplies they wanted from local manufacturers. 'Their presence has helped to bring about a very considerable rise in standards among existing producers. That is of immense benefit to the economy as a whole.'</p>

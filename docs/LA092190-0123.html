			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> KILLER ART: Portraits of notorious murderers, to be exhibited in Fullerton next  week, have already received an Orange County-style welcome: complaints that the  pictures will erode community morals. . . . The portraits were drawn for a  series of 40 tongue-in-cheek trading cards and include such Southland killers  as Richard (Night Stalker) Ramirez, above. Some parents have called the Get  Lost gallery and threatened to picket if the portraits are displayed. There are  no plans to cancel, the gallery says. Cathy Curtis and Bob Schwartz  </P></p>

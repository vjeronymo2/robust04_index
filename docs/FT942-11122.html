			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (8): It had to be 'oui' - Interview / Pierre Mauroy on the wooing of Mrs T Mr Pierre Mauroy, the mayor of Lille, is a man whose large unflappable features remain undented by his trouble-torn spell in 1981-83 as the first Socialist prime minister of France's Fifth Republic, writes DAVID MARSH. In his splendid office in Lille's belfryed town hall, Mr Mauroy recalls with considerable pleasure his part in ensuring the tunnel's construction. 'With coal, textiles and steel, we were a traditional industrial region, a subcontractor for the Paris region. I said you need something to strike the imagination - above all to spur the service sector and create additional employment.' He says he brought up the subject of the tunnel with Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then British prime minister, at an Anglo-French meeting in 1982. 'It was me who spoke to her about it for the first time. We were at a Scottish castle, near the loch where the monster is found. She arrived early. She didn't want to be too disagreeable. But she said, 'I'm not giving you a penny.' I wanted to talk to her about the tunnel, and she kept insisting on Britain's rebate (from the European Community budget). But I pushed her: tunnel, tunnel, tunnel, tunnel.' At the EC summit in Fontainebleau in 1985, Mr Mauroy says proudly, 'We came to agreement.' Mr Mauroy sees Lille's new links to northern Europe as a vital means of giving the region new life. Unemployment, around 12 per cent in Lille, is however a black spot. He points out that the region's electorate voted by a majority of 56 per cent against the Maastricht treaty in the referendum in September 1992. 'The region is European. But the people are starting to lose hope.' 'There is a link between development of the region and the idea of Europe. If Europe is able to offer them a perspective for improving their situation, they are European. If unemployment rises, and they see no way out, they become anti-European.' A great supporter of European economic and monetary union, Mr Mauroy says, 'If developments in Europe continue as they have done during the past few years, it will lose the support of its citizens.' The tunnel is Mr Mauroy's strongest hope for keeping the people of Lille on the main line to Europe.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pepe Suarez] </F>   [Text] Good evening, Cuba. The neutralization of a  simulated enemy invasion of the town of Santa Fe on the western  coast of Havana was the result achieved by the joint forces of  the Unified Vigilance and Protection System [SUVP] of the Cuban  capital, where the Giron-94 exercises began today. These  exercises will be extended until 17 April in an effort to  actively thwart criminal and antisocial actions.    In each locality of the capital, troops from the FAR  [Revolutionary Armed Forces] and of the Minim [Interior  Ministry], together with the fast-response brigades, are  operating jointly with the troops of the political and social  organizations under the command of the Joint General Staff of  the SUVP to test the effectiveness of the command's guidelines  and the revolutionary response capability against criminal and  enemy actions.    Speaking with the inhabitants of Santa Fe in Havana City,  Jorge Lezcano Perez, Politburo member and first secretary of the  provincial committee in the capital, said the results of this  operation, called Operation Dignity, were excellent. He also  spoke with the people about Cubans who try to illegally leave  the country and the risks these actions represent, both for the  physical safety of the illegal runaways and for the Coast Guard  troops who patrol our shores. Lezcano stressed the political  manipulation conducted by the enemies of the Revolution,  referring to the issue of illegal departures for the United  States, and urged all revolutionaries who were there to offset  any action that might tarnish the image and feelings of our  people.    Giron-94 is already yielding its first political results,  and  on the field of operations, it will provide great surprises to  those who might underestimate the defense and response  capabilities of the Revolution.</p>

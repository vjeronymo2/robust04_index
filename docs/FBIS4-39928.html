			<p>BFN     [Text] The Paris Club, uniting 18 countries who are Russian  creditors, is ready to negotiate with Moscow next autumn on ways  of resscheduling foreign debt repayment on a long-term basis.  Before, such loan-restructuring agreements were concluded  annually.    "An upcoming agreement is to significantly change the  structure of Russia's foreign debt, bringing it in line with  what the country can really afford to pay," says a statement,  released by Russia's Foreign Ministry on Friday.    In early June, Moscow and the Paris Club signed an  agreement,  deferring payments on a 7-billion-dollar Russian debt. Payments  will be evenly distributed over 8-17 years with a 3-year easy  term.    A senior Finance Ministry official reported to the Financial  Information Agency that in subsequent negotiations with the  Paris Club Moscow hopes to get a deferment for 1994 on the  payment of yet another 20 billion dollars.    Earlier, the Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin declared that  to  secure a long-term debt deferment accord Russia must agree with  the IMF on an economic program, which, if negotiations succeed,  could be backed up by an IMF Stand-by credit worth 4 billion  dollars. Appropriate talks are expected in autumn this year.    According to federal budget expenditures for 1994, Moscow is  ready to repay a 4.1 billion dollars toward debts.    The former USSR debts total 80 billion dollars, about 10  percent of which is Russia's part.</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool If trading conditions in wool consuming countries are taken as a guide to what happens to wool prices when sales are resumed next week, buoyancy would be very surprising. Information from the UK and Continental Europe indicates negligible new buying interest, and quite often no great keenness to take up deliveries where orders have previously been placed. Holidays have been a major factor. Currency volatility has also injected uncertainties which cannot always be evaded, and which tend to inhibit buyers who are often for trade reasons already cautious.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Ciba While Ciba is further down the road towards restructuring than most of its continental European rivals, yesterday's half-year results underline that it cannot afford to relax. The 10 per cent fall in operating profits would have been worse but for cost-cutting measures already taken. The expiry of the US patent of Voltarin, its largest selling drug, at the end of this year will be a further test of resolve. The target set in 1991 was to reduce costs in relation to sales by three percentage points over three years. The question is whether management will stick to its guns should sales growth prove elusive. By cutting 700 jobs from its US pharmaceuticals business, Ciba has taken pre-emptive action ahead of the patent expiry. The hope must be that its interests outside pharmaceuticals will be showing decent sales growth by the time Voltarin starts to decline. Yesterday's statement was surprisingly positive in respect of both industrial chemicals and agrochemicals, despite the dual impact of recession and Common Agricultural Policy reforms. But that may not be enough to stir enthusiasm among investors. The immediate prospects for Ciba's pharmaceuticals look uninspiring in comparison with Roche or Astra. Yet the scope for cyclical recovery in agrochemicals is - for those prepared to take an optimistic view - no match for bulk chemicals companies such as BASF.</p>

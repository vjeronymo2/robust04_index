			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- The lower house of the  Russian parliament held on Monday hearings on the state of and  prospects for Russian-Chinese relations. The hearings were  initiated by the International Committees of the Russian  parliament's two chambers.    According to the deputy foreign minister, Aleksandr Panov,  Russian-Chinese relations are a priority area of the Russian  foreign policy.    The diplomat also noted in his speech that the Russian  Foreign Ministry conducts a course for strengthening bilateral  ties with China and sees its main task "in bringing  Russian-Chinese relations to a level of constructive  partnership". Panov noted that this line pursued by the Russian  Foreign Office finds support from the Chinese side.    The deputy minister dwelt at length on problems in Russian-  Chinese relations. He stressed that the situation in connection  with the massive immigration of Chinese into Russia needs close  attention.    It is aggravated by the fact that there is no law on the  status of foreign citizens in Russia for the time being. In  this connection the sides concluded an agreement which  drastically cut the number of people having the right to a  visa-free entry to Russia.    Apart from this, Panov continued, the problem of the border  between the two countries remains acute. The diplomat  underlined that the problem was "the main irritant in our  relations until recently".    However, a joint Russian-Chinese demarcation commission is  now actively working. It successfully resolves questions on  ownership of disputed islands on border rivers. The diplomat  also said that talks are in progress on cutting the strength of  Russian and Chinese troops in border areas.    In the opinion of the deputy minister, it is necessary to  develop infrastructure of the Russian-Chinese border in future,  which will help promote trade and economic cooperation between  the two countries.    Panov added that the turnover of border trade between Russia  and China totalled 2.5 billion U.S. dollars last year.    He expressed opinion that it would be very profitable for  Russia to lend a helping hand in modernisation of Chinese  industrial enterprises built with Soviet assistance in the 1950s.</p>

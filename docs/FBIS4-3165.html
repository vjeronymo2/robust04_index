			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Beijing, April 17 (AFP) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng said Monday the murder of 32 people, including 24 Taiwan  tourists, on a pleasure boat in eastern China last month was a  "heinous" crime that would be severely punished. "This is a  heinous criminal offence and we will seriously punish those  criminals in accordance with criminal procedures," Li told  reporters.    The Chinese authorities admitted for the first time Sunday  that the March 31 fire on the boat on Qiandao Lake in the  eastern province of Zhejiang was a case of "murder, robbery and  arson." Three suspects have been arrested in the case, which  provoked an outcry in Taiwan amid repeated accusations of foul  play and seriously damaged relations between the mainland and  the Nationalist island. The outcome of the fire has caused  considerable embarrassment to Beijing after Chinese officials  and the media had previously insisted it was purely accidental.    "What really happened with regards the Qiandao Lake incident  has already been found out and the criminals in that case have  already been detained," Li said prior to his departure for a  tour of Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries and  Mongolia. "I would like to take this opportunity to express my  condolences over the death of the compatriots from both Taiwan  and the mainland, and would also like to express my sympathy to  the families of the victims," he said.    Relatives of the victims had accused Beijing of trying to  hide the true cause of the the fire, and Taiwan launched a  series of boycotts in protest, including the suspension of  cultural and educational exchanges, sightseeing tours to China  and the reappraisal of investment policies on the mainland. On  Saturday, a source in Taipei had said the killings and robberies  were carried out by a group of Chinese soldiers disguised as  civilians. [passage omitted: history of PRC-Taiwan relations]</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> NEW RAMPS TO OPEN AHEAD OF SCHEDULE  </P> <P> A new on-ramp and off-ramp to the Santa Ana Freeway at Beach Boulevard will  open this week, eight months ahead of schedule, Caltrans officials have  announced.  </P> <P> "It is a win-win situation," Caltrans resident engineer Junior Reichert told  city officials.  </P> <P> "It is eight months ahead of schedule and within budget too."  </P> <P> The northbound ramps are expected to open today and the southbound ramps are  scheduled to open Dec. 14.  </P> <P> The $4.1-million interchange, which links Beach Boulevard to the Santa Ana  Freeway, is seen as a crucial link for the Buena Park central business  district, which depends on Beach Boulevard for access and visibility.  </P> <P> "This is an event we have waited for for a long time," said Fred Sica, director  of the Buena Park Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> Although construction was completed ahead of schedule, getting the project  started wasn't an easy task. It was mired on the California Department of  Transportation's eligibility list for more than 20 years and consistently fell  victim to budget cuts.LYNDA NATALI  </P></p>

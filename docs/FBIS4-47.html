			<p>Summary:       Reaction by the state-controlled Syrian media to two  recent Palestinian terrorist attacks within Israel was largely  confined to brief but laudatory characterizations of the operations,  although the government radio's "Palestine Broadcast" program loudly  applauded the attacks.  Such approval is in keeping with the  program's frequent celebrations of attacks against Israelis in the  West Bank and Gaza, as well as its occasional expressions of support  for such attacks within Israel's 1948 boundaries.      Monitored Syrian media have carried no direct comments by Syrian  officials on the 6 and 13 April suicide attacks on passenger buses  in 'Afula and Hadera, although 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, assistant  secretary general of the ruling al-Ba'th party, made a passing  reference to "the escalating brave Palestinian intifadah against the  Zionists and their continuous terrorism" in a speech on 17 April  (Damascus TV, 17 April).  Syrian media, however, characterized the  attacks alternately as "martyrdom" and "resistance" operations, with  one headline in the daily Tishrin calling the 'Afula attack "a brave  offensive" (7 April).  A Damascus radio report the same day  described the victims of the attack in 'Afula--which is within the  1948 boundaries of Israel--as "settlers," while a headline in the  daily Al-Ba'th reported the death of "eight Zionists."   Another  radio account, referring to Israeli and U.S. appeals to PLO Chairman  Yasir 'Arafat to condemn the 'Afula attack, reported that a U.S.  State Department spokesman expressed support for Israel "in its  fight against so-called terrorism."      Stressing that the attacks came in response to the 25 February  Hebron mosque massacre of Palestinians by an Israeli settler and  subsequent acts of Israeli government "terrorism," commentaries  described the suicide operations as evidence of the futility of  current Israeli policies, including "separate deals"--a clear  reference to the 13 September 1993 Israeli-PLO Declaration of  Principles (for example, Tishrin editorial reported by Damascus  radio, 9 April).  Several commentaries warned that Israel can expect  more such attacks if it persists in its policies toward the  Palestinians and the peace process:  A radio commentary on the 8th  asserted that if the Israelis think they can "achieve peace through  the continuation of occupation . . . they will undoubtedly reap  further bitter fruit."  Making the same point more boldly, a  commentator in Tishrin earlier declared that "he who sows death must  reap death" (7 April).      "Palestine Broadcast"      Damascus radio's "Palestine Broadcast"--which purports to speak  in the name of Palestinians but is fully under Syrian government  control and makes little attempt to obscure its Syrian character-  -unreservedly praised the operations.  While repeatedly stressing  that these attacks occurred in "parts of Palestinian territory  occupied in 1948" (8 April), commentaries on the program nonetheless  referred to those killed as "settlers" and stressed that the attacks  underscored Palestinian determination to rid all of Palestine of  Israeli occupation:   --A commentary on the 8th cited approvingly both the 'Afula attack  and another the same day "on Zionist settlers near Ashdod, also in  1948 Palestine," declaring that "these are some of the bold and  heroic operations the intifadah youth carried out against the  Zionist soldiers and settlers in the Arab territories occupied  before and after 1967."  The commentary declared that "our  Palestinian Arab people . . . will chase the Zionists in every spot  in occupied Palestine."   --A commentary that followed the attack on the Hadera passenger bus  was similarly laudatory, celebrating "the spectacular and wondrous  'Afula and Hadera operations" and claiming that although the Hadera  attack "was only powerful enough to destroy just one Israeli  military vehicle" it nonetheless "shook the earth under the decaying  Zionist ideology" and constituted the punishment "called for by  divine and temporal laws as well as moral ethics" for the Hebron  massacre (14 April).      In a notable exception to the overall militant tone of the  Palestine Broadcast commentaries, however, the 14 April commentary  asserted that "if Israel learns the lesson and ends occupation and  dismantles settlements and disarms settlers, the road to peace will  be wide open."      The Palestine Broadcast's vocal support for the 'Afula and Hadera  attacks is consistent with its generally more extreme rhetoric than  that carried elsewhere in Syrian media.  The Broadcast almost always  expresses support following attacks against Israelis--whether  military or civilian, or whether the victims are from the  settlements or from Israel proper.  While it has generally limited  its expressions of support in recent years to operations in the West  Bank and Gaza, the Broadcast has occasionally voiced approval  following attacks within Israel (for example, 25 November 1992).

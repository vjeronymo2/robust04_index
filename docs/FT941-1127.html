			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Halstead rises 14% to Pounds 4.54m A strong performance from the core flooring business was behind a 14 per cent rise in interim profits at James Halstead, the Manchester-based floor-coverings, weather-proof clothing and trailers group. Pre-tax figures for the six months to end December were up from Pounds 3.97m to Pounds 4.54m on turnover of Pounds 31m (Pounds 27.5m). The interim dividend has been raised from 2.5p to 2.75p. Mr Stephen Knight, finance director, said flooring sales were slightly up in the UK, where the company has about 60 per cent of the sheet vinyl market. European sales rose, including German business, while those in Australia and south east Asia also improved. The directors said that the group has opened a Hong Kong office as a bridge for sales into China. Group capital expenditure of Pounds 4.9m for the half-year was concentrated on the flooring division, which accounts for about two-thirds of turnover. In July a Pounds 7m production line will be opened in Manchester, giving the group some extra capacity and a great deal more flexibility, said Mr Knight. Both sales and profits were ahead at Driza-Bone, the Australian stockman's coat company. However, margins at Phoenix, the motorcycle accessories distributor, were under pressure from the absorption of another business and currency factors. Conway Products, the trailer tents, trailers and security cabins business, reduced the usual first-half loss. The group, which is hoping to develop further sales away from the seasonal camping market, lifted sales of the steel security cabins used on civil engineering projects. Net cash at the end of the half stood at Pounds 4m. Earnings per share were 10.16p (8.94p).</p>

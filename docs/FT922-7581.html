			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Boards faulted on voter rights MORE THAN half Britain's largest corporations included in a recent survey on corporate governance allow shareholders no say in the appointment of top executives. Pensions Investment Research Consultants, which advises pension funds on investment issues, included the findings of the survey in its Mid-Season Corporate Governance Report, released today. The survey found that 27 of the UK's 52 largest companies have adopted provisions by which all or some of their executive directors need never seek re-election by shareholders. Coats Viyella, Commercial Union, Guardian Royal Exchange, Inchcape, P&amp;O and TSB insulate all their executive directors from regular shareholder votes. PIRC, which advises UK local-authority pension funds and some US-based pension funds, is urging clients to discuss the matter with managements. The Bank of England-backed Institutional Shareholders Committee guidelines say it is best practice for directors to be subject to re-election every three years, although company law allows exemptions. PIRC also found that 18 of the 52 companies studied have nominated non-executive directors who fall short of the ISC's criteria for independence, which bar anyone who has been employed by the company in an executive capacity within the past few years or who has been retained as an adviser or who is a director of a significant supplier or customer. Among appointments questioned are those of Sir Graham Day to the board of British Aerospace; Sir Brian Corby and Mr Colin Southgate at Prudential; and Sir Timothy Bevan at Barclays.

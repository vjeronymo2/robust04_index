			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Few top company jobs go to women FEWER than one in 200 board members in Britain's top 1,300 quoted companies are women, according to figures in the forthcoming issue of Crawford's Directory of City Connections. Ms Anita Roddick of Body Shop, the toiletries retailer, is the only female managing director, according to the directories subsidiary of The Economist which publishes Crawford's. The Economist is part-owned by Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. The analysis says there is also only one woman chief executive - Ms Ruth Henderson at the fashion retailer Alexon Group - and five women who chair top companies. Women comprise 2 per cent of the total in Crawford's broader category of 'top executives'. Of 7,103 people in senior positions in listed and Unlisted Securities Market companies, 152 are women. Among USM companies, the proportion of women at the top is slightly higher than in larger, listed companies. Four of the 330 USM companies have female managing directors. They are Ms Linda Serr at Honeysuckle Group, the clothing wholesaler; Ms Karen Jones at Pelican Group, the restaurant group; Ms Margarita Hamilton at Swanyard Studios, the music publisher and owner of recording studios; and Ms Anne Bruh at Frank Usher, the clothes maker. Two women shared the position of managing director of a USM company with their husbands. Almost all the companies where women are in the most senior positions are in fashion, toiletries, restaurants or children's goods. The directory shows that 71, or 5.5 per cent, of 1302 company secretaries of quoted companies are women.

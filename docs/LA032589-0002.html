			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG-TEST DECISIONS  </P> <P> Two rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court last week began the process of  delineating how far the federal government can go in using blood and urine  tests to help curb drug abuse on the job.  </P> <P> These cases have propelled the court into a new and perplexing area of  constitutional law. In one decision, the majority made a convincing argument  that the need to ensure the safety of railway passengers supersedes traditional  search-and-seizure strictures. In the other ruling, the minority made what  seems to us a persuasive argument that, by approving testing as a condition of  employment, the court had done damage to Americans' freedom from unreasonable  searches.  </P> <P> In the first case, Skinner vs. Railway Labor Executives, the court upheld a  federal regulation directing that all crew members of trains involved in  serious accidents be tested for drug use. In its ruling, the court acknowledged  that, in most instances, the probable cause which makes a search legal must  derive from a suspicion of individual wrongdoing.  </P> <P> However, Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion, argued that  train crews have a diminished right to privacy because they "discharge duties  fraught with such risks of injury to others that even a momentary lapse of  attention can have disastrous consequences."  </P> <P> In the second case, National Treasury vs. Von Raab, the court decided that the  U.S. Customs Service could make drug tests a condition of employment in some  jobs. Here, the reasoning of the minority was more compelling.  </P> <P> Writing in dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia called the Customs Services program  "a kind of immolation of privacy and human dignity in symbolic opposition to  drug use . . . Symbolism, even symbolism for so worthy a cause as the abolition  of unlawful drugs, cannot validate an otherwise unreasonable search."  </P></p>

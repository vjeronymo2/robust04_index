			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Poll holds key to Belarus independence Belarus, the least independent-minded of former Soviet republics, tomorrow elects its first president in a contest which could determine whether it finally gives up its main attributes of independence. The contest appears to be led by Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, a neo-communist whose unrivalled access to state-owned TV has won him the sobriquet of Uncle Kebich - after equally frequent advertising for Uncle Ben's rice. Having failed to reform what has become a stagnant economy, Mr Kebich is campaigning on a promise to merge the Belarus economy with that of Russia. He claims that a provisional agreement he concluded last winter with Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin for a monetary union between the two states is the only way to save the Belarus economy from its catastrophic state. If endorsed, despite growing doubts within Russia, the treaty would require Belarus to place its central bank under the tutelage of Russia, and to adjust all its economic legislation to Russia's. Since Belarus has already given up nuclear weapons inherited from the Soviet era and has no pretensions towards an assertive foreign policy - it would have very little else to give up in the way of real independence once it hands over its central bank and the power to print money. Mr Kebich pledges economic support for Byelorussians which Russia is unlikely to endorse. By 1995, he has promised 100 per cent indexation of pensions and savings, and says he will prevent bankruptcies among ailing industrial enterprises - a pledge which effectively ends hopes of economic reform. Vying for the educated vote of those Byelorussians who feel something of a national identity are Mr Zenon Pozdniak, the leader of the nationalist Popular Front and Mr Stanislav Shushkevich, the reformist former chairman of the parliament. Both men are promising fast market reform. While Mr Shushkevich is seen as amiable but somewhat ineffectual, Mr Pozdniak inspires some nervousness as to what his more nationalistic message would entail in foreign policy. Competing with Mr Kebich for the less sophisticated voters who want order and security above all else is Mr Alexander Lukashenko, an anti-corruption campaigner, who says his first decree as president would cleanse the administration of corrupt officials. The Latvian parliament yesterday approved a controversial nationality law, severely limiting the rights of the large Russian minority to citizenship, Reuter reports from Riga. The new law, passed at its third and final reading by 66 votes to 11, sets a limit of some 230,000 Latvian-born people who can become citizens by the end of the century.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 22 Jun (AFP) -- Former Sandinist soldiers,  apparently disarmed, today occupied the cathedral in Esteli, 150  km north of Managua to demand attention from the government, a  local radio station has reported.    "There are 10 people, who do not seem to be carrying any  weapons. They are wearing civilian clothes, and their faces are  not covered," Javier Borges, a member of the parish, told AFP by  telephone.    Worshipers who were inside the cathedral praying "ran out"  when the former soldiers entered the church, Borges said. He  added that together with Julio Cesar Videa, the archbishop of  Esteli, he tried to persuade the intruders to leave the  cathedral.    The occupiers identified themselves as members of the  National Self-Defense Movement (MADNA), which consists of former  members of the Army and the Government Ministry who were  dismissed by the government without being given indemnification.    Meanwhile, police arrested at least 11 men who blocked an  access road to Esteli for several minutes at the time the  occupation was taking place, according to radio reports not  officially confirmed.    According to unconfirmed reports, MADNA is demanding from  the  government an indemnification of $2,000 for each demobilized  soldier. Authorities, however, have refused to give them that  amount.</p>

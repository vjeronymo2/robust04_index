[see page 5 of 29 October  Terrorism Report for arrest reporting] It is amazing that a man  who had committed no crime in Belgium and who in no way  threatened the interests of the country could be kept under lock  and key for so long. The authorities will of course argue that  the name of the President of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation  Front (JKLF) is listed with Interpol, and that is reason enough.    We will not therefore continue to labor this point. On the  other hand, it would be wrong of us to close the matter just  because Mr. Amanullah Khan has been released. Too much doubt  remains at various levels not to give us cause for concern.  Thus, firstly from a diplomatic point of view, we should repeat  once more the conclusions of certain analysts who are convinced  that the arrest of the JLKF leader in Brussels on 18 October was  organized at the request of the cabinet of Mr. Willy Claes, keen  to serve a foreign power -- not to put too fine a point on it,  the United States -- irritated at seeing the European Parliament  participate in the Kashmir crisis. In the light of this, it is  interesting to note that a magazine published in Hong Kong and  specializing in Asian questions recently carried an in-depth  article on Washington's particular and recent interest in  Kashmir. As the saying goes, there is no smoke without fire...    On a domestic level, certain points at the Foreign Ministry  also attract attention. Reliable sources say that Mr. Claes's  cabinet may have been informed beforehand of the invitation  issued to Mr. Amanullah Khan by the British socialist group at  the European Parliament. There is no reason to doubt it, since  the Belgian foreign minister is president of the European  socialists: between comrades, it is a fairly logical thing to  respect the customs required by simple politeness, a point that  the German and French diplomatic heads for their part found it  convenient to ignore when, during a recent visit to Warsaw, they  offered to implement a process of rapprochement between Central  Europe and the Western European Union.    Indeed, Mr. Claes, who had other things on his plate these  last six months, was perhaps not personally informed of Mr.  Amanullah Khan's visit before he arrived in Brussels. This is  what he claims. If he is telling the truth, however, why then  does he not censure the leader of his cabinet, Mr. Willems, who  is said to have played a major role in this affair. Moreover,  if Mr. Claes is as innocent as the proverbial lamb, why is the  minister so keen to drag his ambassador in Islamabad in the mud  when his successor, Wilfried Geens, has already been secretly  appointed? Could not Mr. Staes too have been unaware of the  plot that was being hatched in the office of one of his  colleagues -- the consul, in fact. That being said, it is  nonetheless significant that Mr. Staes, this non-commissioned  officer, this balding and scruffy individual, accused by the  minister of having committed "a serious error" will not, it  appears, pass before a disciplinary committee. He will "only"  be subject to an administrative inquiry. Informed sources say  that he will be reprimanded or given a black mark in his file  before being invited to wander like a suffering soul through the  corridors of the ministry for the good reason that the minister  cannot lose face! It all depends on whether you are a prince or  a pauper...</p>

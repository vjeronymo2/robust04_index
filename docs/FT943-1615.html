			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Management: Matter of years, not weeks - Employers have welcomed annualised hours because of the flexibility they allow One issue which might have been on the table at this week's intensive bargaining between Railtrack and the RMT transport union - but isn't - is the introduction of annualised hours for signal workers. After considerable debate, Railtrack management decided that such a proposal  -which would define the amount of working time on the basis of work over 12 months, not each working week - is a step too far for the moment. 'There is a lack of understanding, many staff have difficulty grasping the concept,' admits Paul Radley, Railtrack's employee relations manager. The long-term aim of the state-owned company which runs the UK's rail infrastructure is nevertheless clear: 'It would give us enormous flexibility in matching employees' hours to service needs, eliminate excessive premium payments for overtime working and give us greater freedom in changing daily working time patterns,' explains Radley. His wish reflects a growing conviction among managers across British manufacturing and services that annualised hours are a more effective and profitable way of organising an employee's scheduled working time than the traditional weekly approach. As Gregor Gall from Stirling University's management school explains: 'In its simplest form annualised hours is based on the number of working weeks in the year multiplied by the number of working hours per week minus holidays.' In most schemes, he points out, there are a number of rostered hours and unrostered hours that are banked to allow maximum flexibility. The Department of Employment recently estimated that around 2m employees, 9 per cent of the UK workforce, are now covered by annualised hours. The largest proportion (15.8 per cent) are to be found in professional occupations with a high number in teaching. They are followed by plant and machine operatives (10.3 per cent) and craft and related occupations (9.0 per cent). The lowest incidence of annualised hours is among managers and administrators (6.6 per cent). Companies which have introduced annualised hours to cover at least some of their employees in recent years include BP Chemicals (at its Grangemouth plant in 1993); British Airways; Findus Foods in Newcastle; Fisons Pharmaceuticals; Tesco Distribution; Valor Heating; Matsushita Electric, Hotpoint, Whitbread Beer, Scottish Power, Thames Water, Blue Circle Industries; Manchester Airport; and a number of national health trusts. Companies operating annualised hours seem well satisfied by its results. Half the companies surveyed by the independent group Incomes Data Services last year, for example, welcomed the 'flexibility' such schemes provide. Matching work to seasonal patterns of demand, reduced labour costs through elimination of overtime and lower absenteeism are among the advantages cited. Earlier this year British Coal introduced annualised hours to cover just over 9,000 of its employees as part of a package designed to increase flexible working in the pits. Under its plan there is no actual change in the number of hours worked every year. Colliery managers decide the length and starting time of shifts 'in accordance with the business needs' of each pit while attendance patterns are settled after consultation with the unions. Kevan Hunt, British Coal's employee relations director, argues the new system allows managers and workers 'the opportunity of working fewer shifts and to make more use of leisure time'. Imperial Chemical Industries brought in annualised hours as part of its 1991 staff agreement with the trade unions and an estimated 80 per cent of its 9,000 manual workers now have their working time structured in that way. 'We have found it an efficient and cost-effective way of organising our workers,' says Malcolm James, ICI's industrial relations manager. 'Absenteeism has been halved since the arrival of annualised hours, while the savings made from abolishing overtime have been used to finance other changes in the company.' The trend, meanwhile, is not confined to manufacturing. Annualised hours contracts have been introduced at television companies such as ITN, Yorkshire and HTV. The Bristol and West Building Society has had a scheme for the past three years for its staff. A growing number of companies are using annualised hours as part of a wider restructuring exercise. Its introduction is often combined with team-working, performance-related pay and the harmonising of terms and conditions of employment between manual workers and white-collar staff. So far the arrival of annualised hours has not aroused much resistance from employees, many of whom can see advantages. As Railtrack's Radley points out it ensures 'much greater predictability of earnings' as it removes the uncertain fluctuations suffered by those paid on a weekly hours basis. The use of annualised hours is more common in mainland Europe, particularly in Germany and France where it began to grow in the late 1970s. The concept developed in the UK in the mid-1980s. Gall argues that schemes aimed at smoothing peaks and troughs in demand carry drawbacks for employees. 'Annualised hours can lead to loss in earnings, restrictions on the choice of when to take holidays, reduced manning levels and inflexible shift rotas,' he claims. Annualised hours, however, are here to stay. The development, which reflects the wider social revolution at work, is arguably the most significant in working time since the arrival of the five-day working week after the second world war.</p>

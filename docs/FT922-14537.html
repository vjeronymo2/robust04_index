			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Reaction to Beregovoy team tepid THE ministerial team chosen by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, France's new prime minister, met a tepid public reception over the weekend. Some 46 per cent of the electorate were disappointed with Mr Beregovoy's line-up, according to an opinion poll in Le Journal du Dimanche, while 40 per cent were satisfied and the remaining 14 per cent had no opinion. The result contrasts with the majority approval accorded to Mr Beregovoy personally in polls just after his selection last week. It also underlines the difficulties the government faces in winning popularity. Mr Beregovoy's new cabinet is younger than that of his predecessor, has a strong showing of supporters of Mr Laurent Fabius, the Socialist party secretary, and contains several surprise appointments like that of Mr Bernard Tapie, the football club owner selected as minister for cities.

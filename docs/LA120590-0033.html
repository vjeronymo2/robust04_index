			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE RELENTS, WILL LET HOMELESS IN FROM COLD;  </P> <P> SHELTER: MIDLAM LIFTS HIS BAN ON USING VISTA COURTHOUSE AS A SHELTER BUT CALLS  USE 'INAPPROPRIATE.'  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge has rescinded his order banning the use of the Vista  courthouse as an emergency homeless shelter Tuesday after receiving assurances  from county officials about the building's security.  </P> <P> Kevin Midlam reversed the decision he made last week after Norman Hickey, the  county's chief administrative officer, assured the judge Tuesday morning that  the building will be secure.  </P> <P> "I still maintain, however, that the utilization of this facility (as a  cold-weather shelter) is inappropriate, and I would hope they would take action  to reconsider the policy," Midlam said in an interview.  </P> <P> "It's inconsistent with the whole use of the courthouse," Midlam said.  </P> <P> About 45 homeless people were allowed to spend the night of Nov. 27 at the  courthouse annex -- a small building with two courtrooms, a coffee shop and  administrative offices -- as part of the county's cold-weather shelter program.  </P> <P> The next day, Midlam learned that people were sleeping in the hallways outside  his courtroom and issued an order banning people who are not county employees  from the building after 6 p.m.  </P> <P> Midlam said the use of the courthouse as a homeless shelter poses security  risks, including the exposure of confidential documents and the removal or  destruction of evidence.  </P> <P> Midlam also was angered because no one had told him or the marshal that the  annex would be used as a shelter.  </P> <P> "It isn't 'the judge versus the homeless,' my concern is in having unauthorized  and unsupervised personnel in this facility," Midlam said.  </P> <P> "The things that could happen are so legion and so outweigh the benefits that  are so minor in relation to the concerns of the homeless," Midlam said.  </P> <P> County counsel, however, advised Hickey on Monday that the Board of Supervisors  has the right to control access to all county facilities, including the Vista  courthouse.  </P> <P> In an interview, Supervisor Brian Bilbray called Midlam's initial order "kind  of funny," and labeled it "John Duffy-like confrontational politics."  </P> <P> "If there was a lack of communication, that's fine, and you say very sternly  you don't appreciate not being told about it and make sure it doesn't happen  again," Bilbray said. "But you give the system a chance to work, to correct the  problem, before you start trying to burn the house down."  </P> <P> Leon Williams, Board of Supervisors chairman, said in an interview that he was  unsympathetic to Midlam's position.  </P> <P> "It seems to me to be totally incomprehensible that such an issue would be  raised, and there would be an attempt to limit the use of that building,"  Williams said, "especially (by) a judge who's getting a nice fat salary at the  public's expense."  </P> <P> Midlam said that he has recommended to county staff that the policy on use of  the courthouse be amended.  </P> <P> Hickey, who could not be reached for comment, stated in a press release that a  security guard has been on duty when the Vista facility has been used as a  shelter over the past three years and that "we will continue to ensure that the  security of the courtrooms in that building is not compromised."  </P></p>

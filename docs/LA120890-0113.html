			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THREE HOUSES DESTROYED IN ARSON FIRE  </P> <P> A fire visible for several miles destroyed a small apartment house and two  vacant homes Friday in Southeast San Diego. Two firefighters were slightly  injured battling the blaze, which authorities said was probably started by a  transient.  </P> <P> Total damage to the structures, in the 2500 block of Imperial Avenue, was  estimated at $412,000. Smoke and water damage to an adjacent church and  restaurant were minimal.  </P> <P> The fire began in one of two vacant single-family homes and spread to the  adjacent four-unit apartment house, which faces Imperial Avenue. Only one unit  in the apartment building was occupied, by 80-year-old Geryl Walton, owner of  the property, who escaped unharmed. Walton, who is coordinator for a city aids  research program, was distraught, however, and was treated by paramedics at the  scene.  </P> <P> "It's an arson fire," San Diego Fire Department investigator Jeff Carle said.  "There's been a recurring problem (with) transients and drug users on this  lady's property, and we believe that they're responsible for the fire today,"  he said.  </P> <P> The roof of the apartment building collapsed when firefighters first entered,  causing them to approach the blaze much more carefully for fear of more  structural weaknesses. In addition, firefighters found piles of highly  flammable debris and stored materials inside the homes.  </P> <P> "I don't know what type of material was in there, but some (firefighters) said  it was piled about knee-high," firefighter Mike May said.  </P> <P> From the homes, the fire jumped to several nearby trees and then to the  apartments.  </P> <P> An estimated 75 firefighters and 20 fire engines battled the blaze for about  two hours.  </P> <P> Several blocks of Imperial Avenue and connecting streets were cordoned off, but  only after several youths were arrested after they threw rocks at police and  firefighters attempting to cordon off the area, police said.  </P> <P> Battalion Chief Vic Smyth said two firefighters suffered minor leg injuries. A  few firefighters were expected to stay at the scene throughout the night as a  precaution against the fire reigniting.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY AGREES TO RENEW AMBULANCE CONTRACT  </P> <P> The Glendale City Council on Tuesday ordered Fire Chief John Montenero to  negotiate a new contract with Professional Ambulance Service, which has  provided paramedic and ambulance services to the city since 1975.  </P> <P> Council members decided to continue working with the Glendale firm because no  other companies submitted bids to provide the service.  </P> <P> Montenero recommended that the Fire Department not take over the paramedic  services. He said an internal study determined that such a move would be too  expensive or would detract from the department's ability to carry out its  firefighting duties.  </P> <P> Professional Ambulance's contract with the city expires Feb. 24. Last May, the  city invited 10 companies to submit bids for a new contract for paramedic  services. Montenero said five companies sent representatives to a pre-bid  conference in June, but only Professional Ambulance submitted a bid.  </P> <P> Mayor Larry Zarian and councilmen Carl Raggio and Jerold Milner supported a  motion to suspend the bidding process and renegotiate with Professional  Ambulance. Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg, who has criticized the company's  service, voted no. Councilman Richard Jutras was absent.  </P></p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Lenzing loss worsens to Sch66m in first half LENZING, the world's largest viscose fibre producer, said its loss worsened in the first half, reaching Sch66m (Dollars 5.58m), compared with a loss of Sch54m in the whole of last year, due to fierce price competition in world fibre markets and heavy interest charges. The Austrian group forecast that its full-year 1993 loss would be higher than last year's. Sales rose 9.2 per cent to Sch4.24bn but operating profits tumbled from Sch130m to Sch48m. Lenzing said fibre sales prices were 15 per cent lower on average than in the same period of last year. Following interest charges inflated by the group's heavy investments in pollution control systems, the pre-tax loss was Sch50m compared with a profit of Sch88m in the first half of last year. Lenzing said it had agreed a Dollars 100m joint venture with Industrias Klabin de Papel e Celulose of Brazil to build a 120,000 tonnes a year chemical pulp mill. The output would supply Lenzing viscose plants in the US and Indonesia.</p>

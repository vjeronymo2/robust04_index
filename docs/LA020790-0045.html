			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CARLSBAD  </P> <P> Escondido Police Chief Vince Jimno was dropped Tuesday from a lawsuit in which  a former Carlsbad police officer claims she was sexually harassed by fellow  officers and that Jimno -- Carlsbad's police chief at the time -- failed to  take appropriate action.  </P> <P> Vista Superior Court Judge David B. Moon ruled that Jimno could not be charged  in the civil suit by Elizabeth Rodriguez because she failed to exhaust her  administrative remedies and because, while she made charges against "managers"  in her legal complaints, she failed to specifically name Jimno.  </P> <P> Rodriguez, 42, alleged she was sexually harassed by several Carlsbad officers  from 1980 to 1982. Jimno, as police chief, ordered an investigation into the  allegations, and some disciplinary action was taken against several officers.  </P> <P> In his ruling, Moon also dropped four other defendants -- current or former  Carlsbad police officers -- from the suit: William Ready, William Huntington,  Michael Kelly and Robert Eyer. Still to face trial later this month are Robert  Vales, the city's current police chief; Michael Van Hoosser, a former officer,  and the city of Carlsbad.  </P> <P> Jimno, who is on leave as Escondido's police chief to campaign for election as  San Diego County sheriff, could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / UK Gilts: Inflation outlook builds confidence GLOOM about the UK economy held up gilt prices, in spite of the shadow over the market caused by a large tranche of bond issues which attracted only modest investor interest. While prices at the short end of the gilt market rose slightly, with a consequent fall in yields, longer-dated gilts showed little movement. The market gained cheer from a rash of economic data which indicated a continued fall in inflationary pressures, due to a recession which has dragged on for 18 months and is now expected to last until well into this year. With inflation in virtually all areas of the UK economy likely to be be constrained over the next year or so, demand among investors for fixed-interest securities such as gilts remains strong. Hence few sellers of the bonds emerged last week, even though the availability from Monday of the Pounds 1.25bn tranche of 9 per cent Treasury stock due in 2012 damped any downward movement in yields. By Friday night, buyers had emerged for only about half of the total tranche, according to gilt specialists. The Pounds 1.25bn worth of gilts is part of a large volume of funding which the Bank of England plans over the next 18 months. Because of the need to borrow from the financial market to pay for Britain's rising public-sector deficit, total gilt issues over this 18-month period could total around Pounds 40bn. On Friday, the benchmark 10 per cent Treasury stock maturing in 1994 closed at 101 1/16 , up just  1/32 on the week and yielding 9.46 per cent. The longer-dated 9 per cent bond due in 2008 saw its yield fall slightly to 9.15 per cent. At the short end of the market, the tendency for yields to fall was restrained by the perception that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is unlikely to sanction a cut in base rates, now 10.5 per cent, before the March 10 Budget. The Bank is advising caution on this score, arguing that the vulnerability of sterling within the European exchange rate mechanism would make a rate cut risky. Mr Lamont, however, also has to weigh up political soundings which suggest that a rate cut well before the Budget could bolster confidence ahead of the election. Last week's economic data painted a picture of extremely weak demand, increasing the pressure on Mr Lamont to stimulate the economy. There was a large fall in factory-price and retail-price inflation, while the Confederation of British Industry reported that pay settlements in manufacturing industry fell to their lowest level since it began collecting such data in 1980. Pay awards for the factory sector averaged only 4.1 per cent in the final quarter of last year, down on the 5.1 per cent recorded in the third quarter. Meanwhile a 53,000 jump in seasonally-adjusted unemployment last month - well above the expected figure - cast a question mark over last week's statement in the Bank's bulletin that the rise in unemployment in this recession 'seems to have moderated much more quickly than in the early 1980s'. The jobless total of 130,000 in the three months to January is almost exactly the same as the jobless total at the equivalent period of the 1980-1981 recession, and the trend appears to be increasing.</p>

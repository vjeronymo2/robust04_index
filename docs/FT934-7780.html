			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Brambles warns of 10% downturn BRAMBLES, the Australian transportation, waste management and equipment services group, warned yesterday that profits in the current year could be up to 10 per cent lower than in 1992-93. This would be a second successive year of falling profits; in the 12 months to end-June, after-tax earnings dipped from ADollars 180m (USDollars 118m) to ADollars 166m. The warning was provided by the company's chairman, Mr Gary Pemberton, who told Brambles' annual meeting that current trading projections 'indicate that there is virtually no upside on last year, but a downside containable within ten per cent'. 'We must accept that the maintenance of full-year profitability at the 1992/93 level is at some risk,' he added. Mr Pemberton said the sudden change in the US hazardous waste market and the downturn in European economies were the two major factors dominating Brambles' short-term outlook. 'Given the realities of the current situation in Europe and the US, profit forecasting is difficult, particularly this year when we are anticipating an uneven half to half result with a number of factors pointing towards a stronger second half,' he commented. He noted there had been some UK improvement, Germany was 'showing signs of levelling out', but France remained 'under pressure'.</p>

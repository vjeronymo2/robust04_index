			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Clinton aide in apparent suicide PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has lost a friend and political ally with the death of Mr Vincent Foster Jr, who apparently took his own life six months after coming to Washington from Arkansas to work as deputy counsel in the White House. Administration officials were stunned by the death of Mr Foster, who was found shot dead in a McLean, Virginia, park. The only immediate explanation offered was depression over the barrage of negative publicity surrounding the firing of seven employees from the White House travel office on charges of mismanagement. In the fall-out, the White House stood accused of a wide range of political misdemeanours including cronyism, abuse of power and an attempt to misuse the FBI. The counsel's office was criticised for failing to contain the incident. Mr Foster kept Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton informed about the alleged mismanagement of the travel office. Ms Clinton and Mr Foster had been partners at the Rose law firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, before Mr Clinton's election. His death is a reminder that in many administrations, people come to Washington with high hopes and leave frustrated after the exposure to the national media and the close scrutiny that come with serving the president.</p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Hong Kong Many commentators hoped the weight of global money that flooded Hong Kong last year would calm its notorious volatility. They have been disappointed. The colony's Hang Seng index rose 30 per cent last December. This year concern over interest rates, combined with gloomy political and economic news from China, has sent the market plummeting 31 per cent. The problem is not so much political uncertainty: the colony has had 150 years to come to terms with this. In fact, Chinese intransigence is now rather more predictable than US interest rate movements, which have hit Hong Kong directly through its currency peg to the US dollar. The two-year bull market was fed on interest rates far below the rate of inflation, which encouraged capital flows into stocks and property. This year, interest rates exceeded inflation for the first time since 1991 - and as a result the liquidity bubble has burst. With 60 per cent of the Hong Kong stock-market earnings deriving from property and finance, the outlook is dispiriting: property developers will see profits growth more than halved from the 58 per cent achieved in 1993. The banks have suffered because of slower growth in their mortgage books. Much of the rest of corporate Hong Kong has also been hit due to its tendency to dabble in the property market. If the interest rate cycle has stifled one source of liquidity, China's economic mandarins have removed another. The problem is not so much China's austerity measures, which will have limited direct impact on Hong Kong corporate earnings. The issue is rather the cash which last year flowed out of China and pushed up shares and property prices in the colony. More rigid financial controls have put a stop to that. They have also soured Hong Kong's attractions to fund managers as a China play. Hong Kong is a highly geared option on the US interest rate cycle. So it is hard to imagine that the worst is over for the market until that cycle turns, despite last week's 5 per cent rally. Increased capital flows from China would spur a revival, but Beijing can hardly relax fiscal restrictions now. Volatility will remain, but the market trend is likely to be downwards.</p>

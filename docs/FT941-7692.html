			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities advance as bonds improve Wall Street US stocks finished with solid gains yesterday after bonds responded favourably to congressional testimony by the Federal Reserve chairman, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 24.20 higher at 3,911.66 and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 3.77 ahead at 471.46. The American SE composite gained 1.43 at 472.38, while the Nasdaq composite ended 2.30 up at 791.15 after recovering from early weakness. New York SE volume was 270m shares and advances outscored declines by 1,139 to 996. During Mr Alan Greenspan's remarks on monetary policy to the House banking sub-committee, the market displayed none of the volatility which has frequently surfaced since the Fed's decision to lift interest rates two weeks ago. Stocks opened firmer, held their early gains and began to accelerate near midday. The key was a steady bond market. Speculation about the Fed's intentions triggered a sharp sell-off in US Treasuries last week, but Mr Greenspan's comments yesterday morning held no nasty surprises for the fixed-income markets. The Fed chairman, in his twice-yearly Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, told lawmakers that real short-term rates were likely to increase from present levels, but he gave no hint on the timing of the central bank's next tightening. Mr Greenspan bolstered sentiment by restating his view that inflation was under control and that he was committed to price stability. His comments were enough to send longer-dated government bonds moderately higher on the day. Amid the fanfare surrounding Mr Greenspan's appearance on Capitol Hill, news of a larger than expected decline in consumer confidence passed with little notice. The Conference Board said its February index fell to 80.8, from a revised 82.6 the previous month. A reading of 83 was expected by analysts. By contrast, the announcement of a bullish first quarter by Deere captured plenty of attention, with the stock jumping Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 82 1/2 . The farm equipment manufacturer posted earnings of Dollars 1.02 a share, against an operating loss of 48 cents a year earlier. Investors saw Deere's performance as a positive indication for other stocks sensitive to economic trends. Among the Dow industrials, Caterpillar climbed Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 110 5/8 , 3M Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 107 3/4 and Procter &amp; Gamble Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 58 7/8 , but Alcoa shed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 77. In health care, newly merged Columbia HCA added Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 42 3/4 after Merrill Lynch lifted its rating on the issue to 'long-term buy'. Beverly Enterprises gained Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 14 5/8 on reports that it was holding talks that could lead to a buy-out by Columbia. Quaker Oats was Dollars 1 3/8 higher at Dollars 64 3/8 , thanks to an upgrading by Ms Nomi Ghez, the Goldman Sachs analyst. On the Nasdaq, Dell Computer rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 22 7/8 . The company announced that it was re-entering the notebook computer market. Castle Energy dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 8 7/8 after Metallgesellschaft said it might sell its 40 per cent stake in the oil refining concern. Brazil Equities in Sao Paulo surged 13.5 per cent in active trade, spurred by strong buying in major blue chips such as telecom, mining, oil, power utility and steel companies. The Bovespa index of the 54 most active stocks ended 1,251 up at 10,537, marking the highest daily rise since January 1992. Turnover totalled Cr226.1bn (Dollars 380.2m). Analysts said renewed optimism over the stabilisation programme put forward by Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the economy minister, boosted the market. Traders were confident that congress would approve the government's social welfare fund proposal during a second vote scheduled for today in Brasilia. Analysts said fears over the implementation of a new single price index were also prompting players to pump fresh money into the stock market. Mr Cardoso has said that he will adopt the new index on March 1. Telebras, the telecommunications group, soared 16.3 per cent to Cr29.30, while Vale do Rio Doce, the mining company, was up 18 per cent to Cr72. Petrobras, the oil group, was 15 per cent higher at Cr115. Canada Toronto ended mixed after moderate trading as market participants awaited the release of the federal budget later that day. The TSE 300 index gained 22.1 at 4,371.1 but declining issues led advances by 399 to 368 after volume of 69.8m shares.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ulises Canales: "Cuba-Emigration: Charges of </F> Manipulation in the Granting of U.S. Visas"]    [Text] Havana, 22 Jun (PL) -- Dozens of Cubans are trying  to leave the country by occupying foreign embassies while the  United States manipulates the granting of visas to thousands of  citizens who have all their documents in order.    Those who want to travel to the neighbor country who have  been interviewed by PRENSA LATINA have denounced how the U.S.  Interests Section in Havana denies visas. This situation in  recent months has become more prevalent because of political  reasons.    Some of those interviewed, after insisting that they remain  anonymous for fear of reprisal from U.S. diplomats (an eventual  definite denial of visa), said they believe that the forced  entries by 150 people into the diplomatic missions of Belgium,  Germany, and Chile in this capital are a result of U.S.  immigration restrictions.    Sitting around the U.S. Interests Section building as they  wait for an answer to their requests to meet with their  relatives, the applicants noted that the majority of the people  who entered the missions by force have stated their desire for  visas to travel to the United States, which is the main  destination of those who want to leave the island.    Foreign media, and the U.S. media, in particular, report on  the forceful entry into the embassies and on the country's  difficult situation. A worker criticized this reporting by  pointing out the notorious silence such media maintains  regarding the other side of the coin: the closing or blocking  of legal departure methods.    In 1984, Havana and Washington signed an immigration  agreement in which the United States would renew its  preferential visa granting to Cuban immigrants with residence in  Cuba, to allow up to 20,000 visas annually. This renewed  preferential visa granting applied especially to close relatives  of U.S. citizens and Cuban residents in that country.    U.S. compliance with this agreement has been poor, said a  lady who has already traveled once but who is, as she said,  aware of the fact that sometimes political interests prevail  over the interests of people who have nothing to do with  politics.    According to official Cuban statistics, in 1993 the U.S.  Interests Section approved only 1,000 of the 20,000 visas it  could have approved for Cubans who had requested them in order  to spend time with their relatives in the United States.    In 1993, Cuba authorized the departure of approximately  100,000 people who wanted to visit the U.S., but only 30,000  made it. Of those who made it, most were people over 40. The  rest had their visa requests denied by the Interests Section,  which from July 1991 to May 1992 suspended visa processing  because they claimed that visa requests had stockpiled  considerably.    People who in recent days visited the Interests Section have  told PRENSA LATINA that on one day six visas were granted, out  of 300 applications, and that on the next day another six out of  260 applications were granted. An elderly lady said: "Judging  from what I heard from those who visited the Interests Section  this morning and from several dozen people who have already come  out of there, only one visa has been granted.    No one is certain about being chosen for travel, but the  young find it more uncertain, according to comments heard by  this reporter in the "park of the wailing," a plaza near the  U.S. Interests Section where impatient applicants meet and where  rejected applicants reflect on their pain.    Another person interviewed did not dispute that constant  visa  refusals encourage illegal departures, but that person refused  to accept that hypothesis as conclusive, because this would lead  to the belief that all who want to visit their relatives have  the objective of remaining there and this, he emphasized, is not  so.    After spending hours, days, and even weeks coming and going  and forming lines to enter the Interests Section building (many  from the countryside rent rooms nearby or sleep in the open),  the applicants may have to face a rejection of their  application, in which case they must wait one year before being  able to present a new application.</p>

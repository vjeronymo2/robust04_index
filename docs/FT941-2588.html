			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: CGT - what to do about / In this, the third of four articles on capital gains tax, Richard Chant and Alan Sugden deal with the rules for securities acquired before April 6 1982, and how capital changes in a company affect shareholders As well as the 'new holding pool' for a company's shares acquired on or after April 6 1982, there is also a second pool, known as the '1982 holding pool,' for those acquired between April 7 1965 and April 5 1982. Shares acquired on or before April 6 1965 are kept separately unless the investor makes an election to include any quoted shares acquired on or before that date in a 1982 holding. This election, called the '1965 election,' must be made to your local inspector of taxes within two years of the end of the tax year in which the first disposal was made after April 5 1985. Once made, it cannot be withdrawn. If you dispose of shares which you acquired before April 1 1982, their cost is taken at their market value at March 31 1982 and is indexed for the increase in the retail price index (RPI) between March 1982 and the date of disposal. Special rules There are special rules to ensure: 1. That the RPI adjustment is calculated on the actual cost, if this is to your advantage. 2. That the gain or loss since 1982 is not greater than the gain or loss over the whole period you have owned the asset. (See Table 1 for examples of calculations under the special rules). You can elect for these special rules not to apply; but, if you do make this election, called the '1982 election,' there is no need to calculate the gain or loss over the whole period of ownership. The 1982 election should be made within two years of the end of the tax year in which the first relevant disposal of an asset acquired before April 1 1982 is made on, or after, April 6 1988. (1988/89 was the first tax year for which this election could be made). Once made, the election cannot be withdrawn. Normally, too, it will apply to all assets which you owned on March 31 1982. Where to find March 31 1982 market values Helpful companies like Boots, BP, ICI and RTZ give the March 31 1982 market value of each class of share issued in their annual report and accounts. Usually, this can be found towards the back of the report under the heading 'Information for Shareholders.' Where this information is not included, you can write to the company secretary - which might encourage it to include the data in future years - or ask your stockbroker or tax inspector. Make sure you get an up-to-date market value as it can change (eg, the March 31 1982 market value per share will be halved by a one-for-one scrip issue. Matching disposals with the acquisition of securities Matching applies where you are considering securities of the same class in the same company. Disposals are matched to the investor's holding in a company in the following sequence: 1. With shares acquired on the same day as the disposal. 2. With shares acquired within the previous nine days. 3. With shares in the new holding (the pool acquired from April 6 1982 onwards). 4. With shares in the 1982 holding (those acquired between April 7 1965 and April 51982; and quoted shares acquired on or before April 6 1965 if the 1965 election has been made). 5. With shares acquired on or before April 6 1965, if the 1965 election has not been made. The matching is done on a last in, first out basis. Indexation In the sequence above: 1 and 2. No indexation. 3. For shares in the new holding, indexation runs from the month in which they were acquired. 4 and 5. Indexation will be based on the market value of the shares at March 31 1982. Or, if you have not made the 1982 election, the special rules described above (and illustrated in Table 1) will apply to shares acquired on or before March 31 1982. See Table 2 (on page VII) for an example of matching from the portfolio of an elderly widow who obviously believed in the slogan 'You can be sure of Shell.' But then, with a weak oil price early in the 1990s, she decided to dispose of her holding. She spread the disposal over three tax years so that, together with her other transactions, her gain in each of those years did not exceed the annual CGT exemption. Capital changes In last week's article, Table 4 showed an example involving Stakis, the Scottish-based hotel group. This included the treatment of a scrip issue, and a rights issue where the shareholder took up his entitlement. To recap: Stakis's two-for-one scrip issue simply trebled the number of shares held and, of course, did not alter the overall cost of the holding. In the rights issue, the shares taken up were simply treated as a purchase of additional shares because all the shares had been acquired on or after April 6 1982. Where some of the holding was acquired before that date, the treatment is slightly more complicated. Rights issue on shares acquired before April 6 1982 Where a rights issue made after April 5 1982 concerns a holding, part or all of which was acquired before April 61,982, any shares received in respect of the 1982 holding are treated as an increase in that holding. Similarly, if the 1965 election (to include shares acquired on or before 6 April 1965 in the 1982 holding) was not made, any shares received in respect of shares acquired on or before April 6 1965 are treated as an increase in those earlier holdings. Rights issue - shares not taken up Shareholders who do not want to take up their entitlement in a rights issue can do one of two things. These are: 1. Sell the new shares 'nil paid,' renouncing their entitlement to them by completing the relevant section on the back of the provisional allotment letter (PAL, in back office jargon). 2. Let their entitlement lapse. In this case, the issuing house will sell all the shares of the entitlements that have lapsed 'for the benefit of entitled shareholders' - providing they can be sold at a premium. The shares are sold fully paid and the net proceeds (the premium obtained over the subscription price, net of selling costs) are distributed to the entitled shareholders pro rata. Whichever the shareholder does, the treatment for CGT purposes is the same; it depends on whether the proceeds of the sale of the shareholder's rights are 5 per cent or less of the value of the underlying shareholding (the shares originally held), or more than 5 per cent If the former, the proceeds of the sale are deducted from the cost of the underlying holding, indexed to the month of sale. If the latter, the sale is deemed to be a disposal and a taxable gain arises from it. Table 3 shows how the gain and the value of the underlying shareholding is calculated when the proceeds of the sale of rights exceeds 5 per cent of the value of the underlying holding ex-rights. Takeovers and mergers The shareholder of the acquired company can either accept new shares in the acquiring company in exchange for his holding in the acquired company (accepting 'paper,' in City jargon), or can accept the cash alternative if one is offered. If new shares are accepted, the cost of them is taken as the cost of the investor's holding in the acquired company. If the cash alternative is accepted, it is deemed to be a disposal, and normal rules apply. Demergers Where a company hives off a subsidiary (eg. BAT hiving off Argos and then Wiggins Teape, or the demerger of Zeneca from ICI), the cost of a holding in the original company is apportioned between the resulting holdings. Table 4 illustrates the case of a shareholder in ICI when it demerged Zeneca. Scrip dividends If you elect to receive a scrip rather than a cash dividend, the deemed cost of the shares received is the cash dividend you have foregone (ie, the dividend before the addition of the tax credit). Indexation on the deemed cost of the shares received will run from the month in which the dividend is paid. Enhanced scrip dividends These are a recent innovation, designed for companies with a surplus of advance corporation tax (ACT) - that is, those paying more ACT than they can offset against their UK corporation tax liability. These are, typically, companies with a high proportion of their profits earned and taxed overseas, such as RTZ. But they may also include companies paying uncovered dividends in difficult times, such as Ladbroke. ACT is paid on all cash dividends but does not have to be paid on scrip dividends. Thus, some companies with an ACT problem have been offering shareholders the choice between a normal cash dividend and an enhanced scrip dividend (usually around 50 per cent higher). For CGT purposes, the cost of an enhanced scrip dividend is taken as the market value on the first day of dealing, and is indexed from the month in which the cash dividend is paid.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      TABLE 1. SPECIAL RULES FOR SHARES ACQUIRED BEFORE APRIL 1 1982  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Where the investor has not made the 1982 election (for the special rules not to apply), the calculation of a chargeable gain or loss on the disposal of shares acquired before April 1 1982 has to be done twice, once with March 31 1982 market value and once with original cost:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Example A - Chargeable gain                                              March 1982       Original                                                value            cost  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Net proceeds of sale - Nov 93              Pounds 29,000  Pounds 29,000 Less: Cost Apr 1972                                             (10,000) Market value Mar 31 1982                          (8,000)                                                  ---------      --------                                                   21,000         19,000 Less indexation on higher of cost or Mar 31 82 value: Pounds 10,000 x 0.782         (7,820)        (7,820)                                                  ---------      --------                                                   13,180         11,180                                                  ---------      -------- The lower gain of Pounds 11,180 is chargeable. Example B - Allowable loss                                              March 1982       Original                                                value            cost  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Net proceeds of sale - Nov 93                      5,000          5,000 Less: Cost Apr 1972                                             (10,000) Market value Mar 31 1982                          (8,000)                                                  ---------      --------                                                   (3,000)        (5,000) Less indexation on higher of cost or Mar 31 82 value: Pounds 10,000 x 0.782         (7,820)        (7,820)                                                  ---------      --------                                                  (10,820)       (12,820)                                                  ---------      -------- The lower loss of Pounds 10,820 would be allowable.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Note: In his November 1993 Budget, the chancellor proposed to restrict indexation to prevent it creating or increasing a loss on disposals made on or after Nov 30 1993. Legislation on this is included in the Finance Bill now going through parliament.  The effect on Example B, if disposal had taken place on or after November 30 1993, would be to restrict the loss to Pounds 3,000.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   TABLE 2. MATCHING SALES TO PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Since her husband died 30 years ago, an elderly widow has made the following purchases and sales in SHELL:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Month &amp; Year      Shares Transaction     Cost Pounds   Proceeds Pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sep 1964             200 Bought               402            - Apr 1970             300 Bought             1,429            - Aug 1973             250 Bought               789            -                   -------                  -------                      750                    2,620 Jun 1979             750 1 for 1 scrip       -               - Dec 1982             600 Bought             2,552            -                   -------                  -------                    2,100                    5,172 Dec 1988           4,200 2 for 1 scrip          -            -                   -------                  -------                    6,300                    5,172                   -------                  ------- Feb 1991           1,000 Sold                   -        4,470 Jan 1992           2,000 Sold                   -        9,314 Mar 1993           1,600 Sold                   -       11,342 Dec 1993           1,700 Sold                   -        9,529                   -------                    6,300                   -------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Let us see how the purchases and sales are matched. The elderly lady did not make a 1965 election, so shares acquired on or before 6 April 1965 are kept separately.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Matching - No 1965 Election                      Sales                                    ---------------------------------                                      Feb 91  Jan 92  Mar 93  Dec 93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Purchases Dec 82 600 = 1,800 xc*                1,000     800       -        - Aug 73 250 = 1,500 xc )                       )     3,300         -   1,200   1,600      500 Apr 70 300 = 1,800 xc ) Sep 64 200 = 1,200 xc                     -       -       -    1,200 * xc = ex-capitalisation, ie after the scrip issue(s)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                TABLE 3. RIGHTS ISSUE, SHARES NOT TAKEN UP  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A company makes a 1 for 3 rights issue at 80p. Before the rights issue an investor held 3,000 shares, which were standing at 102p each on the last day of dealings cum rights. He is, therefore, entitled to subscribe for 1,000 shares. He decides to sell his rights 'nil paid' - ie. before the date on which payment for new shares falls due. (In practice he has to sell two or three working days before the subscription date, to give the purchaser of his nil paid shares time to make the subscription payment: the 'last day of dealings nil paid' is given in the rights issue circular to shareholders).  The investor sells his rights on the first day of dealing nil paid for 20p each, realising Pounds 196 net of selling expenses. The price of the old shares has eased to 99p ex-rights.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Is the sale deemed to be a disposal ? Let the proceeds of the sale of his rights = A and the value of his holding of old shares, ex-rights = B                                 A           Pounds 196 The proportion sold =     -------------  = -------------  =    6.60%                                 B           Pounds 2,970 So, as this is greater than 5%, the sale is deemed to be a disposal. Calculating the capital gain The cost of the original holding, indexed to the month in which the nil paid shares were sold, was Pounds 2,200.                                 A           Pounds 196 The proportion sold =     -------------  = -------------  =    6.19%                                 B           Pounds 2,970 A = 6.19% of Pounds 2,200 = Pounds 136 Capital gain = Pounds 196 - Pounds 136 = Pounds 60 The indexed cost of the residual holding, 3,000 shares xr, is B = 93.81% of Pounds 2,200 = Pounds 2,064.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    TABLE 4. DEMERGER OF ZENECA FROM ICI  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- For CGT indexation purposes, the new shareholding (Zeneca) is treated as having been acquired at the same time as the original holding (ICI).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- For cost apportionment, the A/(A + B) formula is used to determine the proportion of the cost of the original holding of ICI which is attributed to the new holding in Zeneca.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    A = First Market Value of new shareholding    B = First Market Value of old shareholding  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- where First Market Value on the first day on which ICI and Zeneca were dealt in separately is the lower of:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.the bid price of the security plus one quarter of the spread (the difference between the bid price and the offer price). Known colloquially as 'quarter up'.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 2.the figure half way between the highest and the lowest prices of bargains recorded that day in the Stock Exchange's Daily Official List.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- These prices were ICI 631.75p; Zeneca 625.75p  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                          625.75p So cost apportioned to Zeneca =       ------------       = 49.76%                                      625.75p +                                          631.75p  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Yet Another Unlawful Edict Issued by </F> Yu. Meshkov"]    [Text] President of the Crimean Republic Yuriy Meshkov has  issued an edict to have all the conscripts of the spring call-up  do their military service in the Crimea only. The acting prime  minister of the Crimea, Anatoliy Franchuk, and Military  Commissioner Oleksandr Volkov were authorized to implement the  edict. In this connection, Volkov told our correspondent that  he had received the edict in the evening of 23 March. Just like  Ukraine's Defense Minister Radetskyy, with whom O. Volkov  discussed the subject, he considers the edict absolutely  unlawful. "We will act in conformity with Ukraine's  legislation," stressed Volkov. "As before, 80 percent of the  conscripts will serve outside the Crimea and 20 percent (those  found unfit for health reasons and the Crimean Tatars) will  serve in the Crimea."</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / French socialists in turmoil as Rocard resigns: Interim leader named but speculation surrounds Delors Mr Michel Rocard resigned as head of the French Socialist party yesterday after his defeat in a vote of confidence among the party's leadership, throwing the party's plans for next year's presidential elections into confusion. Mr Rocard was replaced last night with Mr Henri Emmanuelli, a former parliamentary whip. But his election as provisional party chief will fuel speculation that Mr Jacques Delors, the French president of the European Commission, may be tempted to enter the presidential contest. Mr Delors had made clear that he would not stand against Mr Rocard. The resignation thus meets one of Mr Delors' preconditions for entering the race, although his appetite for politics was diminished by the bruising experience of winning approval for the Maastricht Treaty. Mr Rocard is the latest casualty of the traditional continental European left's dismal showing in the recent elections for the European parliament. The French Socialists won just 14.5 per cent of the vote, their worst result in a national poll for more than 20 years. Mr Achille Occhetto resigned last week as leader of Italy's Democratic party of the Left. Ominously deep divisions have re-emerged in Germany's opposition Social Democratic party, only three days before a critical party conference called to endorse its leader, Mr Rudolf Scharping, as the candidate to fight Chancellor Helmut Kohl in next October's general election. Mr Rocard called for the vote of confidence after criticism of his leadership and the party's showing in the European elections. He won 88 votes for his proposals to revitalise the party. There were 129 votes against and 48 abstentions in the party's national leadership council. Mr Emmanuelli, 49, was chosen as leader by 140 votes to 64. He is expected to head the party until a scheduled party congress this autumn or until a special convention is called to decide on the Socialist candidate for the presidential elections due in April 1995. On Saturday Mr Laurent Fabius, the former Socialist prime minister and a rival of Mr Rocard, said Mr Delors was the person 'best placed' to lead the Socialists in next year's presidential election. Mr Fabius said the choice of a candidate for the presidential elections should be left until the beginning of next year, coinciding neatly with Mr Delors' scheduled date of departure from the Commission's presidency. Mr Jack Lang, former culture minister, has also been suggested as a possible Socialist leader. Mr Rocard told the national council: 'Uncertain political and strategic positions, confirmed isolation, and absurd means of operation are our three main failures that require radical change.' Mr Rocard took over as general secretary of the party last year. He rose to the party leadership after the Socialists' general election defeat last March at the hands of the centre-right RPR-UDF ruling coalition. After the setback in the European elections he had proposed a new party platform and a renovation of the party machinery.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Paris, March 31 (AFP) -- Interior Minister  Charles Pasqua on Thursday [31 March] warned students against  allowing hooligans into their ranks ahead of a nationwide mass  demonstration celebrating a government climbdown.    Students decided to maintain their protest Thursday even  though Prime Minister Edouard Balladur on Wednesday scrapped a  controversial plan to pay young people less than the minimum  wage.    Pasqua, interviewed on the RTL radio, said the 3,000  security  forces who will be on duty had been given strict instructions to  prevent trouble.    He called on students to ensure they are distinguishable  from  trouble-makers and to eject anyone caught stealing, looting or  attacking the police.    Demonstrators "must be aware of the risks they are taking,"  he said.    In the past month of demonstrations against the job plan,  more than 400 policemen have been injured when violence has  erupted.    Pasqua admitted that there had been no point in persisting  with the plan, which had been rejected by "students, employers  and the trade unions." [passage omitted]</p>

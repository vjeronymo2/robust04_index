			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Loans for Poland approved THE World Bank has approved Dollars 750m of new loans to Poland in another move which strengthens the country's attractiveness to foreign investors. The latest loan agreements follow approval last week by parliament of the privatisation of more than 600 enterprises. Six weeks ago, the International Monetary Fund agreed a Dollars 660m standby loan after the parliament approved a tight budget. The bank is lending Dollars 300m to help modernise Polish farming and Dollars 450m to support the Polish government's enterprise and bank restructuring and privatisation (EBRP) programme. The new loans bring the bank's commitment to Poland to Dollars 3.5bn since 1990. The EBRP programme has been designed to speed privatisation of the banking system, improve banking supervision and refinance the bad debts of enterprises which clog bank balance sheets. Last month, Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy became the first big Polish bank to be privatised. The 20 per cent of shares allocated to small investors was heavily oversubscribed. Christopher Bobinski adds from Warsaw: Thousands of Polish teachers yesterday underlined the problems caused by tight IMF-imposed budget deficit limits by striking for higher pay which the government cannot finance without breaching the 5 per cent budget ceiling limit.</p>

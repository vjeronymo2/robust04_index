			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 29 TASS -- The Indian Prime Minister  Narasimha Rao begins an official visit to Russia today. Talks  between the Indian prime minister and Russian officials will  focus on problems of military and military-technical cooperation  between Russia and India.    In technical respect, the Indian armed forces are  predominantly oriented to Soviet-made and Russian weapons.  According to the data available, 85 per cent of the military  hardware in the Indian Navy are Russian-made, the Indian Air  Force is equipped with Russian-made hardware up to 80 per cent,  the Army -- to 65 per cent and the Air- Defence Troops - to 100  per cent.    Russia, which had faced the threat of the loss of the Indian  market which would have resulted in tens of billion dollars  losses, after a certain stalemate in this sphere, finally  determined the Indian direction as one of those of priority  importance.    At present, Russia is not only supplying spare parts to the  Russian-made hardware, but sells licenses for the production of  weapons in India. Russian and Indian firms signed an agreement  on the creation of a joint venture for servicing aircraft of the  "MiG" series and producing spare parts for them. During the  Indian prime minister's visit to Russia this document is  expected to be approved at a government level. The  modernisation of jet-fighters of the "MiG-21" series used by the  Indian Navy will begin in the near future under a contract worth  350 million dollars. These jet- fighters will be equipped with  controllable missiles, new systems of controlling weapons and  modern equipment on board.    The program of the production of jet-bombers of the MiG-27  series according to the Russian license is expected to be  carried through in a year's time. A total of 120 such bombers  had already been built, which makes up two-thirds of the planned  amount. India intends to use its industrial potential for the  production of a new type of jet-fighters of the Su-30 series.  According to the data available, Moscow is prepared to offer  about 30 "Su-30" jet-fighters on credit to India and sell a  license for their production.    In June, 1994, a high-ranking delegation of the Indian  Defence Ministry led by the Air-Force Marshal Krishnaswami  discussed these problems in Russia and visited the Irkutsk  aircraft building plant, where the trials of the new jet-fighter  were held. Indian experts qualified the "Su-30" jet-fighter as  a plane, which in its technical characteristics equals the  American "F-18" and the European "Tornado" jet-fighters and  surpasses the F-16 and the French "Mirage-2000" aircraft. The  "Su-30" is equipped with a 30 millimeter-caliber gun, 10  missiles of various types and equipment which enables to refuel  the aircraft in the air, which maximally improves the aircraft's  capacity to spot and destroy targets both in the air and on the  ground.    India might possibly buy 30 jet-bombers of the "MiG-29" type  and six jet-fighters of the "MiG 29YB" type worth around 780  million dollars. In mid-May, a series of contracts for the  construction of missile boats, frigates and border guard ships  in India under Russian licenses were signed in New Delhi by the  director general of the Russia "Rosvooruzheniye" company, Viktor  Samoylov. All main units, completing parts and weapons for  theses ships will be supplied by Russia.    Both Moscow and New Delhi officials believe that the Indian  prime minister's visit to Moscow is expected to give a new  impetus to the development of military-technical cooperation  between the two countries.</p>

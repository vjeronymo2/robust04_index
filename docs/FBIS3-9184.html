			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Appeal by the Slovak National Party to the </F> Citizens of Slovakia"]    [Text] Bratislava--In an appeal addressed to the citizens  of the Slovak Republic through TA SR yesterday, the Slovak  National Party [SNS] called on the citizens to keep calm and not  to permit Slovakia to be defamed any further.    In its appeal, the SNS draws attention to the "difficult  situation in which power has been seized by people who brought  about destabilization and are trying to preserve this situation  under the slogan of democracy and by inciting provocations." It  expects a further escalation of the attacks on the Movement for  a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and the SNS, and, therefore, it  appeals to citizens not to let themselves be provoked into  ill-considered actions, the consequence of which might be the  introduction of a police regime and a ban on national parties.    "Let us hold out together. Today's situation in parliament  does not reflect the will of the population. The SNS, in  cooperation with the HZDS, avails itself of all political means,  with your help and by making use of the referendum as the most  democratic means to get rid of power people who were opposed to  the independence of the Slovak Republic or who, after losing  their lucrative posts, have left the political entities that  deserve the credit for the founding of the Slovak Republic and  for returning decisionmaking on Slovak causes into Slovak hands."</p>

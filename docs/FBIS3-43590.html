The meeting lasted several hours,  and attempted to find ways and means of alleviating some  difficulties obstructing the establishment of transitional,  broadbased institutions.    The two parties agreed to pursue consultations in order to  bring the crisis out of deadlock, particularly with the Liberal  Party [PL] and Republican Democratic Movement [MDR], and they  reiterated their support for the Arusha Peace Accord. According  to Mr. Patrick Mazimpaka some parties were demanding the  revision of the Arusha agreements.    The groups did not fix a date for the establishment of the  remaining transitional institutions, but the head of state  promised to pursue a dialogue with the concerned parties so that  a date for their establishment can be fixed.    It is worth noting that the RPF maintains as valid the list  of the PL deputies elected before the 37 days (?in accordance)  with the Arusha Accord signature. [sentence as heard] The prime  minister of the current transitional government, Madame Agathe  Uwilingiyimana, also participated in the meeting, together with  the special representatives of the secretaries general of the  United Nations and OAU, Dr. Jacques-Roger Booh Booh and (Joe  Felly) respectively, while the Tanzanian ambassador to Rwanda  represented the facilitator. The RPF delegation also included  Jacques Bihozagara, Pasteur Bizimungu, Seth Sendashonga and Tite  Rutaremara.</p>

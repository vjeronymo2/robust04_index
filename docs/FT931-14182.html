			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Angolan fighting closes oil terminal THE West Africa division of Texaco said yesterday that about 79,500 barrels a day (b/d) of Angola crude production has been shut down because of fighting between Angolan troops and rebels has forced the closure of an oil loading terminal at Soyo, AP-DJ reports from New York. Soyo terminal operator Fina Angola shut down the field early on Monday and asked Texaco to halt the 55,000 b/d output from its offshore field and a 24,500 b/d onshore field, a spokesman said by telephone from Florida. Unita rebels began fighting on Monday to capture oil-rich areas in the north and retake their headquarters in central Angola. Soyo is the base area for five foreign-owned petroleum companies, staffed by Angolan nationals and some 500 foreign workers from Portugal and other European countries, according to the Portuguese news agency LUSA.</p>

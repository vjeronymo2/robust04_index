			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Kodak may split L&amp;F subsidiary before sale Eastman Kodak, the US photographic products group, has given up the attempt to find a single buyer for its L&amp;F Products subsidiary and is instead proposing to break up the operation before selling it. The decision emerged from a letter to L&amp;F's employees in which L&amp;F said it would be sold as two separate units: one comprising its world-wide household products, and the other its world-wide do-it-yourself products. Kodak yesterday declined to comment on the reasons for the split, but there was speculation that it believed it could get a better price for the operations. Some companies thought to be interested in bidding for L&amp;F may only be interested in one side of the business. For example, Colgate-Palmolive, the US consumer products group which earlier this year expressed an interest in buying L&amp;F for its household products, may have had little interest in acquiring L&amp;F's do-it-yourself business. Other companies said to have examined L&amp;F include Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, Reckitt &amp; Colman of the UK, and Procter &amp; Gamble of the US. L&amp;F's household products include Lysol disinfectants and cleaners and Resolve carpet cleaners. On the do-it-yourself side they include Minwax wood finishes and Thompson's waterproofing and staining products. Kodak put L&amp;F on the market in May as part of a plan to divest peripheral businesses and concentrate on its film and digital imaging operations. Other businesses included in the divestment plans were its Sterling Winthrop drug subsidiary which was sold to Sanofi, the French pharmaceuticals group, for Dollars 1.68bn in June. No price has been put on L&amp;F's operations, but there has been speculation that they could fetch up to Dollars 2bn. Interco, the US footwear company, is evaluating business alternatives for its footwear operations in an effort to enhance shareholder value, Reuter reports. The company said these include an initial public offering and/or a spin-off to shareholders involving all or a part of the common stock of one or both of Interco's footwear operating companies.</p>

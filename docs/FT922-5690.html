			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: North West achieves Pounds 230m - Two privatised water companies report increased annual profits NORTH WEST Water Group, second largest of the privatised water companies, increased pre-tax profit by 7 per cent to Pounds 230m in the year to March 31. Turnover rose from Pounds 599m to Pounds 789m, including Pounds 153m from the process engineering division, built up through nearly Pounds 150m of acquisitions over the past 18 months. At the pre-tax level, the new division contributed Pounds 3.7m. The final dividend is raised to 13.13p, making a total of 19.67p (18p), a 9 per cent increase. On yesterday's closing price of 436 1/2 p, the yield is 6 per cent. Prices to the consumer were increased by nearly 15 per cent, according to a formula that added 5 per cent to the inflation rate. This year's rise has been set at 9 per cent. The inflation-plus increases take account of a huge capital spending programme to renovate North West's 70,000 km of pipes and to improve the system in line with more stringent regulations on water quality and sewage treatment. Mr Bob Thian, chief executive, said the estimate for the amount the group must spend this decade was now about Pounds 5bn, but that did not take account of work needed to meet higher standards. 'The people who voted through these standards have not considered the costs,' he said. Last year, capital spending rose from Pounds 408m to Pounds 512m. This year it would be well over Pounds 550m and it would peak in 1993-94. The company went from net cash of Pounds 4.8m to net debt of Pounds 296.4m, gearing of about 17 per cent which would double this year. Mr Thian said the group could live with gearing of 60 to 70 per cent. Net interest costs of Pounds 15.6m compared with income of Pounds 27.9m. A restructuring charge of Pounds 30.2m (Pounds 32m) was taken above the line and the charge was expected to fall this year. Mr Steve McAdam, finance director, said the main element was reducing the head count. The number employed fell from 6,614 to 5,450 and the average severance payment in the voluntary redundancy scheme was Pounds 30,000. Manpower costs fell by 3 per cent to Pounds 81m. Mr McAdam said this was a 12 per cent reduction in real terms because the average pay rise was 9.2 per cent. Earnings per share rose by nearly 7 per cent to 57.9p (54.3p). The group pays no mainstream corporation tax. Irrevocable ACT on dividend payments amounted to Pounds 23.3m. Mr Thian said a memorandum of understanding with the industry's regulator would enable an extra Pounds 360m to be spent on quality and service over a much shorter period than had been envisaged. When pricing was reviewed in 1995 this would be taken into account and a return of 7 per cent would be allowed on the investment. This would limit the reduction in prices that would otherwise have been imposed to reflect gains in efficiency.</p>

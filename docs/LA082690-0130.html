			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TIMES' WRAPPING  </P> <P> We commend The Times for its environmental efforts and enjoy the "recycling  spots" in the paper. However, we have a difficult time believing The Times'  commitment to the environment when every morning (rain or shine), we receive  our Times double wrapped in non-recyclable, non-biodegradable plastic bags.  </P> <P> This seems illogical in a part of the country where we have had drought  conditions for four years and average only 12 inches of rain per year. Not only  does it not make sense ecologically, but the costs (passed on to readers) must  be substantial.  </P> <P> We'd like to see The Times show the type of leadership in the environmental  arena that we have come to expect from the West's finest newspaper.  </P> <P> DAVID A. MOORE  </P> <P> MONICA S. MOORE  </P> <P> San Diego  </P> <P>  Editor's note: On days when rain is not predicted, some copies of The Times  are wrapped in plastic to protect them from water sprayed by lawn sprinklers.  The Times' management is involved in research to develop a more biodegradable  plastic to use for this purpose.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- Chongwadae [presidential  offices] is closely watching Jimmy Carter's visit to North  Korea, concerned that Pyongyang may utilize the former U.S.  President's meeting with strongman Kim Il-song for propaganda  purposes both at home and abroad as well as for a political  compromise.    A knowledgeable source said Wednesday that if Carter is  greeted by North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Song Ho-kyong at  Panmunjom, it might be a North Korean tactic to turn his visit  into a political negotiation between Washington and Pyongyang.  The source pointed out that "We have to watch with concern how  the high-ranking official greets him at Panmunjom."    He said, "North Korea has made it a rule to greet former  heads of state through the chairman or staff of the Committee  for Cultural Relations With Foreign Countries." He speculated  that having a Foreign Ministry official meet Carter at Panmunjom  would signal political negotiation rather than a cordial  reception.    As to reports that Chinese President Jiang Zemin refused to  discuss the North Korean nuclear problem with President Clinton  over the phone, he explained, "China seems discontent that  Pyongyang has not consulted beforehand with it on the  announcement to quit the International Atomic Energy Agency."</p>

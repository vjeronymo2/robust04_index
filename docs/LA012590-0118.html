			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL SOCCER ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> KENNEDY PULLS CLOSER TO 1ST PLACE WITH WIN OVER GRANADA HILLS  </P> <P> Kennedy High kept its Mid-Valley League title hopes alive Wednesday, turning  back first-place Granada Hills, 2-1, at Granada Hills.  </P> <P> With the victory, Kennedy (10-2-1 overall, 6-2 in league play) avenged a loss  to Granada Hills (9-4-1, 6-1-1) and moved into second place, a half-game behind  the Highlanders.  </P> <P> Midfielder Brian Singer broke a scoreless tie early in the second half with a  head shot off a pass from Ruben Rios.  </P> <P> Rios had his hand in the Golden Cougars' other goal as well, passing to Luis  Sandoval, who scored from 20 yards with 10 minutes to play.  </P> <P> Kennedy outshot the Highlanders, 14-7, and shut down Granada Hills scoring  threats with superb defense. "This time we played our game," Singer said. "This  time we were calm and cool."  </P> <P> No one was more coolheaded than goalkeeper Chris Hines, who recorded four  saves.  </P> <P> With the Golden Cougars holding a 1-0 lead, Hines found himself standing  between the goal and Raphael Acosta, who had broken away for what appeared to  be a clear opportunity to tie the score with 15 minutes to play. But Hines, a  senior, sprinted to the front of the box and blocked the shot.  </P> <P> Kelly Brockway spoiled Hines' bid for a shutout with a 25-yard goal with eight  minutes left.

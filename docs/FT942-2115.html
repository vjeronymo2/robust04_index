			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Business and the Law: Transatlantic alliance - Robert Rice considers the implications of a US-UK legal merger Transatlantic mergers between law firms are back on the agenda. After a lull of three years - the result of recession on both sides of the Atlantic - commercial lawyers in the UK and the US will today wake up to the news that two firms are joining forces: Titmuss Sainer &amp; Webb, a medium-sized City of London firm will throw in its lot with Dechert Price &amp; Rhoads, a large Philadelphia-based US firm. The new partnership will be known as Titmuss Sainer Dechert. Dechert's London office will close and its London partners will become partners of the new alliance while remaining partners of Dechert in the US and in Brussels. What most City lawyers will want to know is whether the alliance represents the start of the long-expected rush to form transatlantic partnerships, or whether it is merely the extension of the type of exclusive mutual referral of work which has been the basis of several transatlantic relationships, such as that of Los Angeles-based O'Melveny &amp; Myers and City solicitors Macfarlanes. Mr Michael Smith, senior partner of Titmuss, and Mr Eddy Kling, the partner in charge of Dechert's London office, say the arrangement is a merger in all but name. Together the two firms will have more than 450 lawyers in eight locations enabling them to advise domestic and international clients on a broader range of UK, European and US issues. Certainly, Mr Smith and Mr Kling believe, the arrangement goes beyond any of the current referral arrangements between US and UK firms. In the heady period of the late 1980s there had been much talk of mergers between large US and UK practices to form multinational law firms capable of meeting the challenge of providing legal services on a global scale. But the economic slowdown in the US and the UK put such plans on hold. As the two economies move out of recession and firms look to expand once more, transatlantic mergers are being actively considered again. Firms which struggled during the recession are busy pondering what they should do to regain market share. With significant over-capacity in the domestic legal markets in Europe and the US, expansion overseas is one obvious option. But funding international offices is expensive for all but the most profitable law firms. A merger with a strong US law firm could provide the answer for medium-sized European firms. Does the Titmuss/Dechert alliance fall into that category? Mr James Wyness senior partner of City-based international law firm Linklaters &amp; Paines says the market would interpret the Titmuss/Dechert alliance as, in effect, a takeover of Titmuss by Dechert. Dechert is by far the bigger of the two. Dechert, ranked 47th by size in the US, had 136 partners and 336 lawyers according to the American Lawyer magazine's 1993 league table of America's top 100 law firms. Titmuss, in contrast, is ranked 39th by size in the UK with 48 partners and 147 lawyers, according to Legal Business magazine's 1993 top 100. There is also a big difference in the financial performance of the two firms. According to American Lawyer Dechert was ranked 56th by gross revenues in 1993 with a turnover of Dollars 108m for the 1992-93 financial year. It was ranked 67th in profitability with profits per partner of Dollars 315,000. According to Legal Business Titmuss had a turnover of Pounds 19.8m in 1992-93, placing it 39th in the UK top 100 law firms with profits per partner of Pounds 158,000 (36th). In spite of these differences, Mr Wyness says that the link-up still falls short of a full merger. 'For a start it doesn't involve full profit sharing,' he says. 'Yet it is more than an arrangement to refer business to one another.' In effect, Titmuss is taking on Dechert's London and Brussels partners. The arrangement will give Dechert a stronger English law capability and Titmuss a strong US referral stream, a Brussels office and a transatlantic dimension. Both firms have assessed the impact of the loss of referral work from other law firms and the impact on their existing client base and concluded that their link-up would lead to an increase in turnover, an improved image and better services to clients, Mr Wyness says. The firms say they are keen to secure a bigger slice of the global legal services market and believe they would be better placed to achieve this as a single unit. Most legal observers say the alliance is unlikely to have a big impact on the legal services market, largely because the two firms are both medium-sized in their respective markets. 'It's not a blockbuster', Mr Wyness says. The big shake-up will come when two top firms - such as Freshfields and Davis Polk Wardwell - decide to form an alliance. Medium-sized London firms which compete head on with Titmuss may be more shaken by the alliance, he says. 'A number of them may well say 'why don't we do the same'. But they will have to ask themselves whether they are better able to serve their clients independently or in an arrangement such as this. A lot may be tempted by the idea that such an arrangement might enhance their image,' says Mr Wyness. What do the clients of Titmuss think about the arrangement? Mr Darren Clayton, company secretary of Travelex, the international bureaux de change operator which has been using Titmuss for some 16 years, said his initial reaction was 'very positive.' The law firm's approach squares with Travelex's entrepreneurial style, he says. Last year Travelex opened up bureaux at airports throughout the US and has a considerable demand for US legal services. In the US, Travelex has traditionally used New York-based law firm Milbank Tweed Hadley &amp; McCloy. But Mr Clayton recalls that on several occasions when he has needed advice on a US matter, he was unable to get it immediately because of the time difference between London and New York. With the new Titmuss-Dechert arrangement, Mr Clayton should be able to get first-hand advice on US issues in London without having to wait until New York wakes up. 'That's a superb benefit,' he says. Milbank is also a large firm, he adds, and although Derchert is big by US standards its style appears closer to that of Titmuss, a factor that appeals to Mr Clayton. So will Travelex use Dechert in the US? Mr Clayton says he will decide after meeting the partners in Dechert's New York office next month. Ideally, he would like to use Dechert in the US. 'I've had very good feed-back from the US about them so I can see no reason not to. We are an international company, so for our chosen law firm to become more international can only be good.' But will Dechert's long-standing US-based multinational clients feel the same way about using Titmuss in London? Mr Wyness suggests that Dechert's US-based clients, accustomed to being referred to leading City firms on big transactions, may raise eyebrows if they are suddenly steered towards a (medium-sized) London firm they have never used before. 'I wonder whether the arrangement will bring Titmuss deals it would not have otherwise got,' Mr Wyness says. That will be the litmus test. If the link-up does bring Titmuss more global work, then other City firms could also start to dust off their own transatlantic merger plans.</p>

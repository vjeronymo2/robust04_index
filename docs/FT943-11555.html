			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: National Express to run service in Poland National Express Group, the UK's largest inter-city coach company, is to start an inter-city passenger service in Poland next month, becoming the first foreign carrier to do so. The initial investment, of Pounds 2.3m, is comprised of 21 second-hand coaches brought from the Netherlands. Six routes are to be served in the initial phase with Warsaw acting as a hub. National Express already runs an international service to Poland through its Eurolines subsidiary and recently the UK company purchased Fregata, a Polish emigre-owned, London-based tourist operator with more than 30 years of experience in the Polish market. Polski Express, National's wholly owned local subsidiary, will be working with PKS, the Polish state-owned bus company which will be providing drivers and maintenance facilities as well as selling tickets. PKS remains Poland's largest inter-city coach carrier with small private companies operating urban and short-range routes. The market is shrinking, though, as car ownership grows and ticket prices rise. Last year, 1.4bn passengers travelled on inter-city coaches compared with 2.1bn in 1990.</p>

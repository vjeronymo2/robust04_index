			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> 7 ACCUSED IN WHALE MEAT CASE  </P> <P> Japan's coast guard arrested seven seamen on suspicion of smuggling 30 tons of  frozen whale meat near the southern island of Okinawa, a spokesman for the  Maritime Safety Agency said today.  </P> <P> The meat was worth $310,000 at retail prices, officials said, and the seven  could face jail sentences of up to five years. Japan, which caught nearly 3,000  whales a year up until 1987, banned commercial whaling in 1988 under an  agreement with the International Whaling Commission. Because many Japanese  still have a taste for whale, smuggling banned whale meat into the country has  become a lucrative business.  </P></p>

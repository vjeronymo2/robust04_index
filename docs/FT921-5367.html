			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Credit-card issuers act to stem Pounds 165m-a-year fraud BANKS AND building societies yesterday started a campaign to combat credit-card fraud following a 35 per cent surge in the crime last year. Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, said that credit-card fraudsters stole Pounds 165m last year. 'By reducing the attraction of cards as a soft target we can do much to reduce these crimes,' he said at the launch of the Card Watch campaign. According to the Association for Payment Clearing Services, which has organised the campaign, leading banks and building societies have issued more than 80m plastic cards. At least 2m are stolen each year, an average of 5,500 a day. Most thefts take place at work, but other target areas are cars and the home. The initiative, part of a three-year programme, involves increasing public awareness and the introduction of more sophisticated technology such as digital signatures, fingerprint recognition and personal identification numbers for shop transactions. Mr Baker said that the initiative would make it harder for thieves to get hold of cheque and credit cards by improving the delivery of new cards and by making it easier for cashiers and shopkeepers to check the identities of users. Mr Jim Parsons, the association's head of fraud prevention, said that lost or stolen cards accounted for 75 per cent of fraud losses and cards that did not reach the genuine customers 20 per cent. The remainder was accounted for by fraudulent applications and counterfeit cards. 'There is no single solution to beating this serious crime,' said Mr Parsons. 'The battle against card fraud must be waged on many fronts and we are investing heavily on a wide range of initiatives.' The anti-fraud campaign includes increasing the number of transactions in retail stores which require authorisation, developing a comprehensive file of more than 3m 'wanted' cards, and using computer systems that would detect unusual spending patterns on accounts before a card is reported missing.</p>

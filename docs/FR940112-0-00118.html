			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Section 500.10&blank;Units of Fluid Measure, How Expressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section continues to describe how the inch/pound fluid measure statement must be expressed. Under the amended FPLA, there is no requirement that the disclosure in fluid ounces be made when the amount is greater than a pint. Accordingly, subsection (b)(2) deletes the prior requirement that both the total number of fluid ounces and the largest whole unit (quarts, quarts and pints, or pints) plus remainder be used for items of at least 1 pint but less than 1 gallon. For quantities of at least 1 pint but less than 1 gallon, manufacturers will have the option to include an additional statement of net quantity in fluid ounces ``immediately adjacent'' to the required expression of largest whole unit, as proposed subsection (b)(2) allows this discretionary second expression of fluid measure. Subsection (b)(1) retains the requirement that disclosure be given exclusively in fluid ounces for quantities less than one pint.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed subsection (b)(3) as it appeared in the NPR retained the requirement for quantities of one gallon or more that disclosure be given exclusively in largest whole unit, with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or fractions of the pint or quart. The Commission received two comments on this subsection arguing in favor of permitting the optional use of fluid ounces for products above one gallon. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 32 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For the reasons discussed in part III.E. above, the Commission has determined that it is in the public interest to permit the voluntary additional disclosure of fluid ounces for products above one gallon. Subsection (b)(3) has been amended to reflect the Commission's determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 32 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> NCWM, 19, 4; and PG, 10, 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Section 500.11&blank;Measurement of Commodity Length, How Expressed <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section describes how to express linear measure in terms of yards, feet, and inches. The amendments reflect the determination by Congress not to continue to require the disclosure of the total number of inches for items one foot or more in length. For those items one foot or more in length, disclosure should be made in the largest whole unit with the remainder in inches or common or decimal fractions of the foot or yard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Section 500.12&blank;Measurement of Commodities by Length and Width, How Expressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section describes how to express the net quantity for bidimensional commodities which are measured by length and width, such as roll type goods like foils and tapes. The amendments add metric parentheticals to the inch/pound statements and examples.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission amends subsection (a)(1) by deleting the requirement that length and width be expressed in ``linear inches and fractions thereof.'' This requirement is inconsistent with amendments to subsection 500.8(c), which provide that ``statements of linear measure shall be in terms of both yards, feet, and inches and SI metric meters, centimeters, or millimeters.'' Consequently, the Commission amends subsection (a)(1) to read that length and width are to be expressed ``in linear measure'' and that the ``customary inch/pound statement is to be expressed in inches and fractions thereof.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection (a)(2) has been made consistent with amended subsection 500.8(d), which provides that ``statements of measure of area shall be in terms of both square yards, square feet, and square inches and SI metric square meters, square centimeters, and square millimeters.'' The Commission amends the subsection (a)(2) requirement that disclosure ``be expressed in terms of square inches, followed in parentheses by the length and width in the largest whole unit (yard or foot),'' to read that net quantity is to ``be expressed in terms of area, followed by length and width'' and that the ``customary inch/pound statement of area is to be expressed in square inches with length and width expressed in the largest whole unit (yard or foot).''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the same reasons described above, the Commission modifies two other existing subsections in &sect;500.12. Subsection (a)(3) is rewritten to reconcile it with amendments to the disclosure provisions of subsection 500.8(d), and subsection (b) is amended to reconcile it with the linear measure disclosure provisions of subsection 500.8(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Section 500.13&blank;Measurement of Commodities by Area Measure Only, How Expressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section describes how to express the net quantity in the inch/pound system for commodities that are measured in area only. The amendments add metric parentheticals to the inch/pound statements. The amendments reflect the determination by Congress not to continue to require the disclosure of square inches for areas one square foot or greater.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Section 500.14&blank;Statements of Cubic Measure and Dry Measure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amendment to this section deletes a superfluous reference to dual declarations of net quantity of contents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> K. Section 500.15&blank;Units of Count, More Than One Ply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amendment to this section includes metric in the example.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

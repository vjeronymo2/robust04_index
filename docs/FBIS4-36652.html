			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 11 Jun (MENA)--Yemeni Planning Minister Dr.  'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani has said that what he described as "the  forces of apostasy and secession" have rejected the new  initiative by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to stabilize the  cease-fire in Yemen; the proposal would have gone into effect at  1800 yesterday. In a statement to a MENA correspondent in Sanaa  he said that the "rebels" are continuing to fight with all types  of weapons. He stressed that the "the forces of unity and  legitimacy have completely abided by the cease-fire." He said  that the "rebels" had refused to attend the Yemeni Military  Committee meeting in the (Ja'walah) area, between the villages  of Sabir and Darb al-'Amr near Aden, which had been scheduled  for 1100 Saturday morning.</p>

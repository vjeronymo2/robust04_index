			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ghazi al-'Ayash] </F>   [Text] The main reason for the pressures that are being  applied by America, international Zionism, and Britain, as well  as for the demand for concessions from Arab parties, are the  absence of a united Arab position and the absence of an Arab  force similar to Iraq's effective force. The reasons for their  30-nation agression against Iraq are no longer concealed from  anyone. Indeed, they themselves have taken to bragging about it  after having enslaved some Arab rulers and exploited Arab  resources against Arab interests. No honest Arab can have the  slightest doubts that America, Britain, and Ziionism are  implementing a plan to humiliate the Arabs and deprive them of  their rights and resources, transforming them into a conduit for  American, British, and Zionist interests. As a start, America  has succeeded in silencing some Arab rulers and in exploiting  others to destroy the bulwark and hope of the Arabs: Iraq. They  have left Iraq and the people of Iraq to pay the price alone, to  the accompaniment of traitorous Arab instigation, an indifferent  Arab stance, and a hateful international one. This, while Iraq  was placing and continues to place Arab interests above all its  own interests. The leader, Saddam Husayn, had previously warned  the Arabs against dangerous blunders toward which they were  being pushed by the American and British leaderships. America is  injecting them with a fatal cancer in order to kill their  national ambitions and expectations in the interests of  "Israel," its ambitions and greed for Arab wealth and lands.  Iraq pointed this out a long time ago, before the 30-nation  aggression against it. The British station (BBC) broadcast a  discussion between two political personalities, American and  French. The first, Graham Fuller is one of the chief political  analysts at the RAND Corporation in Washington. He had  previously worked in the same capacity in the Middle East  section of the Central Intelligence Agency. The second, Paul  Balta [name as transliterated], is the director of the Center  for the Study of the Contemporary Middle East at the New  University of the Sorbonne. They admit in their discussion that  the main purpose for the continuation of the embargo is to serve  American, British, and Zionist strategic interests in the  region. This, in spite of their admission that Iraq has  implemented the resolutions of the United Nations. Fuller, the  American expert, says: "From an official point of view, we want  the implementation of the resolutions of the United Nations.  From an unofficial point of view, we want to overturn the  government in Iraq." Balta, the French expert, interjects to  introduce additional American aims: "America also wants to keep  up the pressure on Iraq as long as there is no fundamental  progress in the "Arab-Israeli peace talks," as Iraq represents  the greatest threat to "Israel" in the region. There are also  the current economic and financial difficulties of the Kingdom  of Saudi Arabia, America's most important ally in the region. If  Iraq were to enter the oil market, the Saudi economy would  collapse." The French expert adds: "When they speak of human  rights in Iraq, they do so for local consumption. I am in  complete agreement that the international community itself is  violating the rights of Iraqi human beings." Explaining the  reasons for France's participation in the aggression against  Iraq, the French expert said: "Frankly, President Mitterrand was  expecting political and economic benefits like the possibility  of our participation in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations for  peace and the increase in the share of French companies in the  petroleum and arms industries. However, it now seems to me that  France has met with frustration. My country has been determined  for some weeks to serve its own interests first." The American  and French experts admit that double standards and positions are  being applied to Iraq in the West, especially in America. This  is what Iraq had exposed before their 30-fold aggression.</p>

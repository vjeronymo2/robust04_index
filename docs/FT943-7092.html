			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Arts: Humour versus Hammer - Cinema WOLF (15) Mike Nichols LE PARFUM D'YVONNE (18) Patrice Leconte A SHADOW OF DOUBT (15) Aline Isserman Deep in a Hollywood laboratory, men in white coats seek to create the perfect rejuvenation potion. The idea is to rejuvenate not people but pictures. They mix and match movie genres, searching for the ultimate box-office 'Eureka]' Will it be the action epic cum marital infidelity comedy (True Lies)? Will it be the Western cum gambling movie cum TV rip-off (Maverick)? Or how about - touch of desperation now creeping into the ingenuity - the publishing comedy cum May-December love story cum werewolf movie? As genre experiments go, Wolf seems to have escaped its laboratory before its time and dashed off down the emergency stairs. Screenwriter Jim Harrison or director Mike Nichols probably left it untended, thinking it was almost ready. But it wasn't. And being a Jack Nicholson project, it is soon out on the street, surprising passers-by with idiot grins, flyaway eyebrows and twanging slow-burn epigrams. The opening scene - no, the opening half hour - is promising. Jack's car collides with a wolf on a skiddy, midnight New England road and he is bitten when he tries to shift the supposed dead body. Back in that other primal forest called New York, he is being retired as editor-in-chief of a top publishing firm. His boss Christopher Plummer says: 'I want you to think about eastern Europe.' (Gothic joke combined with josh at Gotham job-politics.) But all that sacked Jack is thinking about is how to appease his vicariously ambitious wife (Kate Nelligan); how to put a good face on his resentment of the super-yuppie replacing him (James Spader, in oleaginous overdrive); and why his senses of smell, sight and hearing are suddenly, strangely sharper. He is of course lycanthropising. Soon it is but a hop and jump to peeing on his rival's suede shoes in the office loo ('Just marking my territory'), to growling impressively at Plummer, and to sharpening figurative claws for his job reclamation. 'Is the worm turning?' trills his spinsterish secretary Eileen Atkins. 'The worm is turning and packing an Uzi,' replies Jack. 'About f - ing time,' says Eileen. And it is. Forty minutes gone and still no authentic werewolfery. Soon after that, though - but no, we feel a hand suddenly clamped round our mouths by the Columbia press handout: 'would be grateful . . . refrain from telling . . . third act . . . thank you . . . understanding and cooperation.' Happy to oblige. For the third act, sad to tell, is a silly old mess, with director Mike Nichols evidently bitten by the dead body of Hammer Films and choosing to finish things off with fur, fangs and flying bullets. (Not giving too much away, am I?) This would be fine if the images matched the apocalyptic gear-change. But Wolf, having lingered so long in the land of back-chat and Martinis, lacks the courage to go feral. If you want bone-stretching, mind-boggling, proper metamorphoses such as in The Howling or An American Werewolf In London, rent the aforementioned movies on video. Instead we have a snuffling Nicholson in orange contacts and miracle-grow sideburns, inflamed to self-assertion by beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer as the Plummer's daughter. Their romance - let us call it Act Two - is where the film begins to go wrong. Pfeiffer is a knock-em-dead actress struggling with a never-come-to-life role. And director Nichols, who as Silkwood and Heartburn taught us is ever the vapid stylist when he chooses, films the couple's formative tete-a-tete from behind their heads, silhouetted against a sparkling twilight river. Throughout this scene the camera does one of those simultaneous push-pull motions with the zoom and track to give us a sense of perspective-sorcery. But it is pretentious beyond measure: like an icky picture postcard animated by Tarkovsky. So we are left with the early territorial comedy between Nicholson and Spader, manoeuvring for acting honours as turning worm and wormy twerp respectively. Spader is a joy. No one in modern cinema acts better sincerity-fakers. The face is a blob of radiant choirboy disingenuousness, with invisible wires hitching the mouth into unctuous grins or pulling the eyebrows down into 'concerned' frowns. In Wolf he stays right in there and up there with Nicholson: no mean feat since our Jack is in his voice-tweezing, elastic-eyed element here, at least so long as the film's sense of humour keeps at bay its sense of Hammer. French cinema today wanders in a half-world all its own. The New Wave has receded, leaving a chain of low-tide rock pools that seem, depending on the prevailing light, either gloomily inert or delusively reflective. Can you have life without movement? Can still waters really run deep? Patrice Leconte's Le Parfum D'Yvonne, from the director of Monsieur Hire and The Hairdresser's Husband, is rock pool cinema par excellence. Chic resort setting (luxury hotel). Teasing iridescent light. And a whole lot of exotic, biologically predestined life forms: including the young man opting out from the Algerian war during the 1950s (Hippolyte Girardot), the beautiful girl he falls for (Sandra Majani) and her ageing gay friend (Jean-Pierre Marielle), who insists on being called Queen Astrid. Don't ask why, just enjoy Marielle's high-style acidic performance, the movie's one flicker of vitality. Indeed Leconte's film could have been, but wasn't, inspired by Cyril Connolly's novel The Rock Pool. (The actual source was Patrick Modiano's Villa Triste.) Connolly's story was all about a bunch of vain artistic types sur le continent, taking elegant swabs from each other's souls. But Connolly was a satirist. Leconte, via Modiano, seems to be - what? An impressionist? (All that blurry, light-kissed photography.) A bricoleur? (Narrative tricks within tricks within flashbacks.) Or just a cinematic dandy doodling endlessly with his movie palette? The period set pieces are pretty and sometimes funny: notably the concours d'elegance for vintage cars and their drivers, a scene resembling Genevieve out of Last Year In Marienbad. Elsewhere, ever-so-precious dialogue is exchanged amid ever-such-opalescent settings and the temperature barely rises even when the chatter stops for the love scenes. Anyone for Dubonnet? A Shadow Of Doubt is better. The light on this rock pool is dimmer, but the perspective is wider (Cinemascope) and deeper. When a 12-year-old girl (Sandrine Blancke) accuses her father (Alain Bashung) of child abuse, interested parties try to keep the two apart, un-aware that shadows have an elastic life almost independent of their owners. No vintage cars. No Dubonnet. Just the distant susurration of mistrust and the darkened, panicked depths of a relationship into which one fatal stone has been dropped. Director Aline Isserman boldly uses a wide screen for an intimate story: which means that faces are wreathed in boas of shadow and ambiguity becomes a form of brain-teasing poetry. Movie-making like this is still 'rock pool' rather than high tide. But at least it makes a virtue of its own marooned and intimist vision.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Arts: Today's Television ITV's drama series Gone To Seed (8.00) is like a cross between a Dick Whittington pantomime and a Carry On film, with quieter gags than you would expect in either. The triplets, played by an impressive cast (Jim Broadbent, Warren Clarke and Alison Steadman), are now back in their beloved garden centre, the villainous Wesley has recovered health and nastiness, and Lucy Lastic (try it out loud) breaks Monty's heart again. This is another drama set in London's docklands. The incidence of arson in British schools last year was an astonishing one in eight, the bill being Pounds 75m. Public Eye finds the motives of the arsonists are little understood. There is only one offenders' centre trying to deal with the problem (8.00 BBC2). There were encouragingly few fingers wagged at us in the opening episode of Lynda La Plante's crime series, Framed (9.00 ITV). Jackson, a young policeman, has spotted an absconding supergrass in Spain. Now Jackson has been drafted in to ensure the sybaritic crook is comfortable in his cell. BBC1 shows the last episode of the excellent drama series about internal police investigations, Between The Lines (9.30).</p>

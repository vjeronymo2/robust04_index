			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Safeland 'pleased' with fall to Pounds 36,000 In bleak conditions Mr Raymond Lipman, chairman of Safeland, the property company, said he was pleased with a profit of Pounds 36,000 for the six months to September 30. The figure compared with Pounds 81,000 last time. Turnover increased from Pounds 3.26m to Pounds 5.99m. This signified an increase in the size of transactions rather than in number. Mr Lipman said the company was still being very selective in the projects it undertook. Earnings per share were 0.13p (0.28p) and the dividend is reduced to 0.06p (0.14p).</p>

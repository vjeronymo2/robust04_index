			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Management: Battle for star talent They were putting on a brave face this week. But Monday's announcement in London that Insead's professor of business policy, Sumantra Ghoshal, has been appointed to the new Robert P Bauman chair in strategic leadership at the London Business School is undeniably a blow for top brass at the French school. Ghoshal's poaching is a sign of growing competition between European institutions for the best academic talent, and raises the prospect of the sort of red-toothed rivalry seen between US campuses crossing the Atlantic. For eight years Ghoshal has been one of Insead's 'stars', raising its profile with books and award-winning case studies on cross-border management and international business. The traffic, it has to be said, is not just one way. This year, Insead pipped London to the post for two marketing professors from the Wharton business school in the US (Hubert Gatignon and Erin Anderson), and has also wooed Richard Rumelt, president of the strategic management society, away from the University of California at Los Angeles. Managing faculty members who can earn more from outside activities such as consultancy and writing than they do from teaching and research is a headache plaguing all deans at the moment. 'When someone says they want a change of scene, giving them a 10 or 20 per cent pay rise is not the answer,' says Ludo Van der Heyden, Insead's co-dean. Van der Heyden has mixed feelings. He does not deny disappointment at Ghoshal's departure and believes London may be targeting Insead (among others) as part of a policy to recruit more faculty members from outside the UK. On the other hand, he believes that European schools collectively still lack credibility by comparison with the US and that a stronger LBS is to the benefit of all. As one of the top schools in Europe, Insead is particularly vulnerable - 'but it will make us sharper,' Van der Heyden adds philosophically.</p>

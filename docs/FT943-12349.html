			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / High-tech groups plan 49% staff growth A survey of more than 200 high-technology companies in England has found that they expect staff numbers to grow by an average of 49 per cent in the next five years. The survey, by Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, covered organisations in four regions - the north-west, Cambridge, the south coast and the west of England - and sought to find reasons for their selection of location. In spite of the predicted growth in their size, most companies expected to remain in their existing region. Companies listed the availability of a well-trained workforce and good communications as the most important factors in influencing prosperity. Quality of life, low staff costs and the proximity of an international airport were regarded as the next most important points. The research was carried out for the Western Development Partnership, a regeneration agency, as part of a report published yesterday on high-technology industry in Avon and its neighbouring counties of Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and Somerset. Survey respondents in these counties regarded the west as a poorer location than the other areas. Companies elsewhere gave the region an even lower rating. The report says: 'This may be due to ignorance of the west of England, a lack of a regional identity and uncertainty as to the precise area being delineated - especially perhaps confusion with the more remote counties of Devon and Cornwall.' The report said the west had failed to build a strong position in high technology 'although it had three strong universities, other centres of excellence and a nucleus of high-tech businesses'.

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Arts: In search of the spirit of German romance - William Packer bemoans an opportunity missed If the importance of an exhibition is to be judged by the weight of its catalogue, then The Romantic Spirit in German Art is a very important exhibition indeed. And so, up to a point, it proves. Nothing can gainsay either the quality and interest of the work on show, or the scholarship that informs the exercise. The idea behind it is obvious enough, and in the celebration of particular artists, from Caspar David Friedrich to Joseph Beuys, there are groups of work as fine as one could wish. Why then, in the end, a sense of disappointment, of an opportunity missed? The answer lies with the orthodoxy of the scholarship and the banality of the curatorship. No one who knows anything of German art could fail to be intrigued by the central premise of the show. What is this dark and tormented sensibility, that yearns for perfection even as it chases false gods and hopes, that sees only Death and Despair stalking the forest of its imagination, that finds Love only to lose it? What is this Romantic Spirit by which we would say of Friedrich and Kiefer alike, as of Goethe and Wagner, that they are, well, so very German? In short, the show cries out for a radical comparative look at the work in defiance of chronology. With Beuys, for example, whose fine group of drawings touches the very quick of his originality, how good it would have been to see him alongside Paul Klee, Marc and Wols, and earlier, Rethel and von Rayski in the 1840s, Olivier in the 1820s, and the young Friedrich in the 1800s, all of whom are well shown. But no. Time after time we are brought up short by particular and remarkable images. As striking as any is a self-portrait by Victor Janssen of 1828, who looks out at us across his bare shoulder, his shirt folded down to the waist. It prefigures the paintings of the Neue Sachlichkeit, the New Reality, by a clear century. And where is the portrait by Christian Schad from the 1920s to set against it, or by Dick Ket, or George Grosz, or Otto Dix? Nowhere. Dix, in this aspect, is represented by only a minor piece, while Schad, Ket and Grosz are not even in the show. Such omissions are serious enough - that of Grosz is inexplicable - but none is more serious than that of Max Beckmann, one of the truly great painters this century. To leave him out and yet to include Georg Baselitz, a lesser artist whose early work, quite reasonably, is shown in depth, is to make a nonsense of any possible rationale. Indeed the contemporary ghetto at the Fruitmarket end of the exercise, where Beuys, Baselitz, Kiefer and Richter sit with trivia from Sigmar Polke and Blinky Palermo, shows curatorship at its most orthodox and flatulent - these six are shown on a scale out of all proportion to their importance in the given context of the show. But I protest too much. The show comes to the Hayward in London next month, and we shall see what differences a rehanging makes. As it is, section by section, from Romanticism as such through Symbolism to Modernism and the present day, each discrete display has its interest and qualities. The group of paintings and drawings by Friedrich in particular is as strong as any we have lately seen, and offers a more intimate and lively view of one who may often seem remote and unsympathetic. The show sags a bit in the mid-19th century - it could have done with painters such as Calame and von Menzel who figure in the National Gallery's current show of Romantic works from Winterthur - but it picks up with the Symbolists, Bocklin, Klinger and Hodler especially, and moves on strongly to the Expressionists and the Surrealists. It is intriguing thus to find Ernst and Kandinsky cast as German Romantics. Always more comparisons propose themselves. Bocklin's maiden rides her donkey-unicorn through the forest. Hans von Marees has a naked horseman pluck oranges from the tree while a girl, no less naked, morosely looks the other way. How dark and soulful it all is, how very northern and Teutonic. And we think back to Monet to Matisse next door at the Scottish National Gallery, and to Roussel's lovers beneath the summer trees, and Picasso's nakedly indolent hedonists - how very French, that all was, how very southern. The Romantic Spirit in German Art 1790-1990: The Royal Scottish Academy and The Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh, until September 7, then to the Hayward Gallery, London; sponsored by Beck's.</p>

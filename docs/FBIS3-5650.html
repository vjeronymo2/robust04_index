			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo -- Ichiro Yoneyama, Defense Facilities  Administration Agency [DFAA] director general, held a news  conference on 7 March after returning to Japan from his trip to  the United States. Referring to the issue of returning Yomitan  Auxiliary Airfield, he said: "When I proposed to the U.S. side  that both Japan and the United States study ways to have the  auxiliary airfield returned, the U.S. side said if the jamming  problem at Sobe Communications Center is cleared, the United  States would consider returning the auxiliary airfield." The  U.S. side's response indicated a change in the U.S. position  that "until the auxiliary airfield's function of parachute drop  training is transferred to another place, it is impossible to  return it." The relocation of the auxiliary airfield and  measures to clear up the jamming problem are a condition for the  return of the airfield. At the news conference, Mr. Yoneyama  said: "Both Japan and the United States are studying where to  relocate the auxiliary airfield. We intend to discuss this with  U.S. Forces in Japan at the earliest date."    On the issue of returning Naha Military Port, the U.S. side  said, "It is not easy to return the military port, but we intend  to tenaciously work for its return." Regarding the issue of  abolishing live-firing exercise across Prefectural Highway No.  104, the U.S. side said, "The United States is now studying the  possibility of ending the live-firing exercises and will make as  many efforts as possible to end them." In this way, the U.S.  side repeated its past view.    During his stay in the United States, Director General  Yoneyama met with Ross [name as published], deputy assistance  defense secretary, Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state,  and Stockpole, commander of the Pacific Marine Corps, for an  exchange of views.    During a series of meetings with them, Director General  Yoneyama proposed that both Japan and the United States study  ways not only to relocate Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield, but to  return it. In response, the U.S. side said, "If the jamming  problem at Sobe Communications Center is cleared, the United  States will study the possibility of returning the airfield."    Explaining the results of his visit to the United States,  Director General Yoneyama said: "The U.S. side was far more  interested in resolving those issues than we have thought. The  impression I got is that the United States wants to avoid new  tensions because of difficult economic issues between Japan and  the United States. American officials whom I met had a common  perception of the issues. It was significant for me to convey  the views of local residents directly to concerned American  officials."</p>

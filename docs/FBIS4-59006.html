			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "China's Protest to the United States"] </F>   [Text] The People's Republic of China has strongly  protested to the United States against the adoption of a  legislation concerning Taiwan and Tibet. The Chinese vice  foreign minister summoned the U.S. ambassador in Beijing and  made it clear to him that the United States has interfered in  China's internal affairs by approving that law. Meanwhile,  speaking at the U.S. Foreign Relations Committee's session, the  architect of the Pressler Amendment, Senator Larry Pressler,  accused China of developing nuclear missiles capable of striking  the United States, which can create security concerns among  neighboring countries.    The question is: Has Senator Larry Pressler taken onto his  shoulder the onus of creating causes of friction in Pakistan's  and China's relations with the developed nations? One can ask  this because his every statement seems to be directed toward  protecting the interests of India or Israel. Under these  circumstances, if one were to say that Larry Pressler and  Stephen Solarz are political cognates, then it would not be  inappropriate. In his aforementioned statement, without naming  India, Larry Pressler tried to bring home the point that Chinese  missiles with the capacity to strike the United States could  pose a threat to India's security. It seems India is fast  increasing its lobbying in the U.S. political and legislative  institutions to purchase Patriot missiles and technology from  that country.    As for Taiwan and Tibet, Pakistan recognizes these two  regions as parts of China. However, India and the United States  are gradually carrying forward their policies under a well  thought-out plan to create an uprising against Beijing in Tibet  and make Taiwan refuse to come under the sway of Beijing's  administration. The United States, after having deferred the  Tibet issue to India, is now playing the role of a silent  spectator and is keeping the Taiwan issue directly in its own  hands. If all these things are analyzed, then it will become  crystal clear in the very first stage that the conspiracies to  blockade China from all sides are being executed very cunningly.  The recent U.S. approval of a legislation about Tibet and  Taiwan also points to the Indo-U.S. conspiracy against China.    The seminars currently being organized in Pakistan to pave  the way for the implementation of the U.S. plan to divide the  state of Jammu and Kashmir also seem to be a link in the chain  of this conspiracy. The people of Pakistan openly support the  protestations made by the Chinese vice foreign minister against  the U.S. law and demand that Washington stop its increasing acts  of interference in the Asian region, because it is essential for  the preservation of global peace.</p>

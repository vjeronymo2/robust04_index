			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Budgets for Capital Spending Rise: U.S. companies' appropriations for spending  on new plant and equipment rose 33% in the last quarter of 1988 from the third  quarter, the Conference Board said in a report for release today. The budget  authorizations rose to $53.7 billion in the fourth quarter from $40.3 billion  in the preceding quarter and $30.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 1987, the  New York-based, business-supported research organization said. Appropriations  are considered a good indicator of how high capital spending will be. They are  the first step, preceding the ordering of equipment, the letting of  construction contracts and actual spending. The petroleum industry led all  sectors with a 157% increase in appropriations from the preceding quarter.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Should the treadwear test procedure be changed? What  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific changes should be made? Why? What data are available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to support such changes? How should such changes be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Should the test course calibration procedure be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changed? What changes should be made?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. How should traction grades be determined or improved?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Does traction change significantly with wear for any tire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lines?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Should the traction grades be upgraded? By raising  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the minimum values for each category (A, B, C)? By creating a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new category, such as ``AA''? By other means?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Should the UTQGS include peak tire traction ratings?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Does peak tire traction correlate with stopping distance on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ABS-equipped vehicles? Can the peak tire traction coefficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be measured reliably? How could/should it be expressed?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. What would be the cost of measuring peak traction? In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to sliding traction? Instead of sliding traction?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Are the characteristics related to a tire's ability to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dissipate heat and to withstand higher operating temperatures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that affect a tire's temperature resistance rating directly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related to a tire's rolling resistance?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Should the temperature resistance grade be deleted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the UTQGS? Is it adequately represented by the voluntary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tire industry speed ratings?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Should a rolling resistance grade replace temperature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance? How would such a grade be expressed? How would it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be labeled on the tire?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Should a rolling resistance grade be added to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UTQGS as a fourth category?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. How would the agency explain to consumers the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correlation between rolling resistance and fuel economy?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. Can rolling resistance be improved without detracting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the other graded characteristics? What is the additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost per tire? Do you agree with the costs projected in The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Climate Change Action Plan?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. Can tires of the same size, construction, and load  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carrying capacity which have the same rolling resistance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhibit significantly different temperature resistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. Would any safety values be affected if rolling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance replaced temperature resistance?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. How should data based on the test procedures of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SAE&hyph;J1269 and SAE&hyph;J1270 be utilized to compare the rolling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance performance of different tires?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18. What data regarding rolling resistance of different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tire designs currently exist?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19. What is the range of rolling resistance performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available both to OEM and aftermarket passenger car tires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today? What is the potential for further reductions in rolling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance for tires of various types, such as all-season,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mud/snow, rain, and conventional?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20. Are there improvements that should be made in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current procedures for measuring rolling resistance? If so,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> please describe how those measures could be improved, and at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what additional cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21. What should be done about tires already graded?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22. What would be the most effective campaign to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publicize the low rolling resistance/fuel efficiency program?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 23. What procedures would be most effective in monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the low rolling resistance/fuel efficiency program to assure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum results?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24. What is the estimated incremental consumer cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase for low rolling resistance tires of various types?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 25. What is the estimated cost effectiveness for low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rolling resistance tires of various types? How cost effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would low rolling resistance tires have to be to motivate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers to buy them?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 26. What is the current cost of tire labeling for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treadwear, traction, and temperature resistance combined on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per tire basis, assuming a high volume production line? How  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would this cost change if rolling resistance replaced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature resistance? If it were added, without replacing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any of the existing UTQGS requirements?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Brewer's recipe for success - Andrew Bishop's Cathedral ale is now serving, thanks to a bank loan and the help of some thirsty friends. Graham Deller sampled the new beer A brewer and an intensive care nurse in a hospital's liver unit make an incongruous mix. Nevertheless, Andrew Bishop, 28, founder of London's newest brewery, is grateful for the vocation followed by his wife, Alison, a sister at King's College Hospital. 'She paid the bills while I set the business up,' he said. Bishop's Brewery is a fledgling concern in the shadow of Southwark Cathedral and the Borough fruit and vegetable market just across the River Thames from the City. A former grain warehouse has been transformed, thanks to a loan from Midland Bank and the largely unpaid efforts of thirsty friends, from a spider-ridden shell into a plant capable of producing 850 gallons of beer a week. Start-up costs, including some second-hand equipment, worked out at about Pounds 20,000, plus another Pounds 10,000 for brewery transport, essential for deliveries to outlying pubs willing to take a new beer. Said Bishop: 'I'll deliver to almost anyone who wants some.' Bishop had managed the adjacent Market Porter pub, a free house, for five years before staleness set in: 'I wasn't going to progress in the business and didn't fancy any of the other houses in the group. It was time to go it alone.' It was not all plain sailing, however. Locating the premises was easy: he agreed a six-year lease from the trustees of Borough Market in January 1993. Local residents raised no objections. Bishop gave himself three months before brewing began; steelwork was erected, plumbing and electrics installed. He reckoned, however, without the attentions of Southwark Council. The local environmental health officer expressed anxiety over the ventilation, and council permission to change the use of the building proved more of a problem than expected. But Bishop eventually occupied the building in November, producing his first brew on December 18. Cathedral, as the initial beer was predictably named, proved a great success in a limited market. Test tasting by electricians, plumbers and, I have to admit, journalists, indentified a light hoppy beer with a definite bite. 'That was my fault, I put twice as many hops in as I meant to,' Bishop admitted. The recipe has since settled down, although it still features more hops than the average brew: 'It's not a run-of-the-mill product, it's still got a pronounced hop character that sets it apart from grim mass-produced muck.' Bishop, working on his own at present, supplies five pubs in the area as well as a few further afield. Potential expansion from these modest levels is limited by design: 'I don't want to get too big too soon; I've seen too many people come unstuck.' Indeed, the path from the Tom Caxton home brew kit to the handpump in the hostelry is littered with well-intentioned failures. Many a homebrewer thinks a marketable beer is just around the corner. Few succeed. Bishop's past is free from such experiments: 'I don't like drinking beer at home, it somehow doesn't fit with armchairs and sofas.' His experience is mostly in the trade: 'I fell into the licensed trade straight from school, working, illegally (he was under-age), behind a bar in Streatham.' Bishop honed his brewing knowledge with a three-month stint with David Bruce's famed Firkin chain. 'I never met him but I learnt a lot about costings.' In spite of the sizeable capacity, Bishop only needs to sell eight 36-gallon barrels a week to break even. He hopes to turn over Pounds 60,000 this year. Advertising is another step to be faced. 'I haven't been out in a suit and tie pushing people . . . yet.' Beer festivals and a growing number of pubs willing to take beer from small breweries do his cause no harm. 'Beer-spotters come from miles to taste a new beer, and if they like it, they spread it.' Which is not necessarily good news for Kings' liver unit . . .

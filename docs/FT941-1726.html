			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Dividend warning for MCC creditors Creditors of Maxwell Communication Corporation who expected their first dividend payout this month may have to wait until the end of the year. Mr Mark Homan, partner at Price Waterhouse and joint administrator for MCC, has written to creditors saying that difficulties in resolving claims on pension schemes formally controlled by Robert Maxwell are causing the delay. In a report to creditors on January 27 Price Waterhouse had said that it hoped to make a first distribution to creditors in March - provided certain issues could be resolved. The pension scheme managers are seeking a proprietary claim over MCC assets which, they say, were partly acquired with assets stolen from the funds. But in December Mr Justice Vinelott ruled that Price Waterhouse could not make a distribution to creditors until the pension fund claims were resolved, while rejecting a claim from some pension schemes for a proprietary charge on all MCC assets. In his letter - dated March 18 - Mr Homan notes that a series of legal decisions and possible appeals will have to be heard before the matter can be straightened out. He said: 'On the basis of court rulings to date the administrators have no reason at this stage to change the estimated dividend percentage calculated in Appendix 1 to the report. 'However, the estimated dividend and the timing of distributions could be affected by future decisions of the courts. 'It is possible that if the legal process becomes further protracted no dividend will be payable until the end of 1994.' Traders in distressed corporate debt estimate that about half the creditors to MCC purchased loans at deep discounts to face value in the secondary markets. Traders said that in recent days they had seen several blocks of MCC debt offered at between 33p and 35p in the pound, down sharply from the peak of 45p a year ago.</p>

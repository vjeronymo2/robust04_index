			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SURPLUS FOOD CUTS STARVE LUNCH PROGRAMS IN SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Dwindling stockpiles of surplus food are creating severe shortages in school  food programs throughout the country, causing school districts to raise prices  and students to drop out of lunch programs in large numbers, educators and  government officials say.  </P> <P> While schools are being pressured to improve student nutrition, many are losing  large chunks of their cafeteria budgets because federal surpluses of cheese,  powdered milk, beef and other commodities have dried up.  </P> <P> After relying on government surpluses for nearly a decade, districts throughout  the country are having to buy food that had formerly been free -- at the same  time that food prices are skyrocketing because of shortages caused by the  Christmas freeze in Florida and Texas, the San Francisco Bay Area earthquake  and the lingering effects of the 1988 drought.  </P> <P> As a result, the loss of so-called "bonus commodities" from the U.S. Department  of Agriculture is bringing many school food programs close to disaster. The  problem is a dramatic example of competing needs -- the budget deficit versus  the nation's schoolchildren -- and shows in tangible terms how agricultural  policy directly affects the food on cafeteria trays.  </P> <P> "Schools around the country are having to cope with these massive shortfalls,"  said Kevin Dando, spokesman for the American School Food Service Assn. "This is  the school year when it's really been a major trauma. The term I keep hearing  about this is 'the silent erosion of the school lunch program.' "  </P> <P> The loss of bonus commodities could be even more serious for schools if budget  cuts proposed by President Bush on Monday are enacted. Under the proposed  budget, the school lunch program will be cut by $180 million in 1991 by making  it more difficult for families to qualify for free school lunches for their  children.  </P> <P> "We're worried about low-income kids not having access to any lunch at all,"  said Edward Cooney, deputy director of the Food and Research Action Center.  "We're concerned that the health and nutritional status of low-income children  will be at risk because of the absence of commodities, coupled with the cuts in  budgets."  </P> <P> School districts in San Diego County have either raised prices of their lunch  programs or engaged in deficit spending to cope with increased costs in the  food service.  </P> <P> The San Diego Unified School District experienced a 17% decrease in the number  of full-paid lunches at elementary schools after lunch prices went from 80  cents to $1 at the beginning of the 1989-90 school year, Jane Boehrer, director  of the student nutrition program, said.  </P> <P> Prices at the junior and high school levels also increased, from $1.25 to  $1.50, Boehrer said, although she could not say how many students dropped from  the program.  </P> <P> "Generally, there is a 1% loss of students taking the meal for every per cent  increase in the price," Boehrer said.  </P> <P> The Poway Unified School District has drawn on reserves to make up for  increased food prices, but those will only last a short time, said Joan  Kleinhans, director of the district's nutrition program. "It's a definite  possibility" that next school year Poway will increase its prices, which stand  at $1 at elementary schools and $1.25 at junior and high schools, Kleinhans  said.  </P> <P> The total cost of the nutrition program at Grossmont Unified High School  District rose as much as 20% this year, according to Jo Ruth Wright, director  of student nutrition. The price of lunch at Grossmont, which serves 720 lunches  a day, jumped from $1.50 to $1.75 in September.  </P> <P> The Sweetwater Unified High School District responded to a 7% increase cost of  foods, combined with salary raises, by raising lunch prices from $1.25 to $1.40  in September.  </P> <P> After losing more than $7 million in federal food subsidies, the Los Angeles  Unified School District raised its lunch prices from 50 cents to 75 cents for  elementary school children and from $1.25 to $1.50 for secondary students. As a  result, the district says, 1.4 million fewer lunches will be sold at school  this year, a drop of 13% over the 1988-89 school year.  </P> <P> For some students, that means no lunch at all, said Stephen Garcia, director of  the school district's food services branch. For others, "rather than have a  nutritious meal, they'll buy junk food at the local 7-Eleven or some carbonated  drink and candy at one of our student stores," he said.  </P> <P> A typical meal purchased at a Los Angeles school could include the following:  burrito or empanada, taco sauce, fresh fruit, apple-oatmeal cookie and milk. It  is a far cry from a candy and a Coke, and it supplies about one-third of a  child's recommended daily nutritional needs.  </P> <P> Congress passed the National School Lunch Act in 1946 to provide such lunches  "as a measure of national security," after one-third of all draftees rejected  for service in World War II were found to be physically unfit because of  nutritional deficiencies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Billion Cut  </P> <P> The program's most recent problems began with the 1981 Omnibus Reconciliation  Act, the Reagan Administration's attempt to cut the national budget by $35  billion and deal with the deficit. As part of the law, the Administration cut  $1 billion from the school lunch program, said Edward Cooney, deputy director  of the Food and Research Action Center.  </P> <P> At the same time, school districts were promised by the Agriculture Department  that the cuts would be mitigated with a free flow of government surplus food,  Cooney said. The foodstuffs were called "bonus commodities," because they were  given to schools in addition to food and monetary support mandated by Congress.  </P> <P> The bonus commodities helped the schools during a difficult time. They also  helped the federal government, which had stockpiled several billion dollars in  surplus dairy products in an effort to stabilize the dairy industry.  </P> <P> The surpluses came about because of a policy that turned the federal government  into the market of last resort for the nation's dairy farmers. If dairy herds  over-produced and farmers could not sell the surplus, the government bought it.  By the early 1980s, buying the surplus products was costing the government too  much money, and storing it added to the bill.  </P> <P> The bonus commodity program solved the problem. Its attraction to schools was  that they could get as many bonus commodities as they could use without waste.  One of the major items given out was cheese, of which there was so much surplus  that the government kept it in caves near Kansas City, Mo.  </P> <P> But by 1988 the surpluses began to dwindle, Cooney said, even though the school  lunch funding cut in 1981 was not replaced. One reason for the drop in  surpluses, in addition to food-giveaway programs, was the Dairy Termination Act  of 1985, which paid dairy farmers to go out of business in an effort to cut  overproduction. Approximately 1.5 million cows were slaughtered through the  dairy buyout.  </P> <P> In the 1986-1987 school year, cafeterias received $442 million in bonus  commodities from the USDA, said Philip Shanholtzer, a spokesman for the agency.  In the current fiscal year, that assistance has shrunk to about $125 million;  about $100 million of that surplus food is butter.  </P> <P> "The only thing I'm being offered in bonus commodities is butter, and I have  plenty of butter," said Mary Klatko, director of food and nutrition services  for Howard County Public Schools in Ellicott City, Md. "We still had cheese all  of last year in the state of Maryland, right through June. We came back in  September to no cheese."  </P> <P> As a result, the school district is buying cheese and other commodities on the  open market. Between August and December, 1989, Klatko saw her food prices rise  18%, largely because of the drought and other natural disasters. Pizza, a  cafeteria favorite, was hardest hit, she said.  </P> <P> "I was paying 17.5 cents per slice (of pizza) last year because of the bonus  cheese," Klatko said. "I'm now paying 35 cents. . . . I used to offer it every  day in the elementary schools as an alternate. Now it's the highest priced item  we have on the menu. I had to cut it to three days a week."  </P> <P> School cafeterias have traditionally been self-sufficient, but the Memphis city  schools' food service branch will have to borrow from the city's Board of  Education for the first time next year, to make up for an anticipated loss of  $1.5 million in surplus food from the federal government.  </P> <P> "I've been in school food service for 20 years, and this is the first year I  can remember this kind of impact on our program," said Shirley Watkins,  director of food and nutrition services for the Memphis city schools. "The real  trauma for all of us is that we do not see any light at the end of the tunnel."  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) announced that the Senate Committee  on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry will hold hearings on bonus commodities  and other nutrition issues in late February.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Jonathan Gaw in San Diego County and Chris Woodyard and  Thuan Le in Orange County contributed to this story.  </P></p>

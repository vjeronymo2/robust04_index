			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Newly appointed National  Land Agency Chief Megumu Sato is known to have refused to  sanction the execution of death row inmates when he was justice  minister for about a year from December 1990. Sato, 70, has  advocated that Japan should abolish the death penalty.    Sato, a House of Representatives legislator of Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party], a core political party in the coalition  government led by new Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, is also a  Buddhist priest.    Japan, one of the few remaining developed countries with  capital punishment, had not executed death row inmates for three  years and four months from November 1989, but resumed hanging  last year, putting three people to death in March and four in  November.    Sato has been elected to the House of Representatives nine  times since 1969 from the sixth constituency of Osaka  Prefecture. Before becoming a politician, he was a bureaucrat  at the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry and later served as  posts and telecommunications minister from 1984 to 1985.    He was a member of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) -- the  former ruling party now in opposition -- until last summer and  once belonged to the LDP faction of late former Prime Minister  Kakuei Tanaka.    Sato quit the LDP last June and formed Shinseito with other  defectors including Hata.    His late father had served as Defense Agency chief and Osaka  governor.</p>

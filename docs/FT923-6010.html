			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Computer spur for drugs: British Association for the Advancement of Science CHEMISTS designing drugs will soon be able to use virtual reality technology to work from inside three-dimensional images of molecules. Drug design is likely to be one of the most important industrial applications of virtual reality, and the pharmaceutical industry is expected to buy tens of millions of pounds' worth of systems once developments are complete. A VR helmet will give the illusion of walking through the screen of a graphics computer and being surrounded by molecular images. It will be possible to pick up images of atoms and rearrange them in new chemical patterns by moving the head and manipulating a hand-held device known as a 3D mouse or bat. A prototype system - the result of a joint project by York University, the drug company Glaxo, computer company IBM and specialist VR developer Division - was unveiled at yesterday's British Association meeting in Southampton. Project director Dr Rod Hubbard of York University said: 'The sheer quality of change that you experience as you move into three dimensions is difficult to describe. 'Even though the image you see in VR is still crude compared with the high-resolution computer graphics we normally use, this is in many ways compensated by being able both to move easily around the image and to interact directly with the molecular model through natural head and arm movements.' The hardware for the project was made by Division, based near Bristol, which is working with IBM to add virtual reality to the US company's RS/6000 workstation. The VR development system costs about Pounds 50,000, said Mr Pierre DuPont of Division, but it is likely to become much cheaper in the future. It uses a parallel processing computer to cope with the large amounts of data required. Eventually, said Dr Peter Murray-Rust of Glaxo, scientists might be able to 'experience' biological molecules such as proteins instead of having to 'learn' them from two-dimensional books.</p>

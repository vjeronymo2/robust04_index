			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts The Bank of England was lucky in its timing of the latest gilts auction. It coincided both with the currency tension in Europe, which has given sterling a safe haven status, and with heightened expectations of lower interest rates following Tuesday's CBI survey. There is no doubt that these factors boosted demand, especially since the market was over-sold last week in the run up to the sale. Sterling's strength may prove less of a support if calm returns to the ERM following today's Bundesbank council meeting. Base rate hopes may continue to shore up short gilt prices for a while, providing the Bank with additional funding opportunities. That would reinforce the impression that its efforts are concentrated towards the short end of the maturity spectrum where rates are cheaper. Although the Bank has carefully eschewed the US example of making this an explicit policy, it may still worry that borrowing over 25 years at rates around 8 per cent implies little faith in its own anti-inflation stance. Or it may simply believe that borrowing long could become cheaper still. But the luxury of choice is limited. Recent auctions have met heavy demand from overseas buyers who favour short to medium-dated stock. Eventually this demand will abate. The Bank may then have to target domestic institutions who prefer long-dated paper. The risk is that something could have happened by then - like the first sign of higher wage inflation, for example - to have sent the gilt market's rally into reverse.</p>

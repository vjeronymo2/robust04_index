			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Five black girls who failed to make the Palm Springs High School varsity  cheerleading squad have sued the school, its principal and the Palm Springs  Unified School District, alleging that they were passed over because of their  race. The federal court suit charges that "racism is common" on the campus and  that scoring during tryouts for 16 spots was tailored to favor white students.  Represented by attorney Gloria Allred, the girls -- Aneka Knight, Carla  Johnston, Elizabeth Williams, Tisha Pollard and Joy Brown -- ask the court to  direct the district to cease its allegedly discriminatory practices and allow  them to join the team in time for training camp in August. District officials  would not comment on the suit but said a Board of Education investigation found  no evidence of discrimination.  </P></p>

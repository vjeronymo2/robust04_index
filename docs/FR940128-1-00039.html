			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Sanitation Control Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10 that processors and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importers that engage in processing perform sanitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections at specified frequencies and maintain sanitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control records that document the results and frequency of those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections. If these regulations are adopted, the sanitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control records will be subject to the recordkeeping requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in &sect;123.8, including review by FDA investigators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For seafood, sanitary practices affect most directly the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety of those products that do not receive any further cooking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the consumer. These products include raw molluscan shellfish;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finfish destined to be consumed as sushi; cooked, ready-to-eat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products; and certain smoked and salted products. Both finfish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and shellfish are regarded as microbiologically sensitive foods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the potential presence of pathogens, notably  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monocytogenes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Ref. 55, pp. 31 and 32).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. monocytogenes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is a pathogenic bacterium that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> widespread in the environment. Thus, the likelihood of finding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it on the exterior surfaces and viscera of fish is high. Since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1983, several large outbreaks of human listeriosis have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> linked to contaminated foods. Although it is a relatively rare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illness, the exceptionally high mortality rate among susceptible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals makes this illness one of the leading fatal foodborne  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diseases in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Numerous seafood products have been shown to support growth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. monocytogenes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Refs. 56 and 57), and seafoods have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> epidemiologically linked to two outbreaks and one sporadic case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of listeriosis (Ref. 58). Furthermore, several cooked seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products have been recalled from the market in North America  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because of contamination with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. monocytogenes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Ref. 27). Seven  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of nine smoked fish processing facilities recently inspected by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA in New York State had  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. monocytogenes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in the environment or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the products (Ref. 59).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Good sanitation practices are critical to the prevention of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listeriosis and other microbiologically related foodborne  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illnesses. FDA's CGMP regulations for food in part 110 set out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general principles of sanitation that should be followed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plants that manufacture, package, label, or hold human food.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They address such matters as personal hygiene and cleanliness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> among workers who handle food, the suitability of the plant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design to sanitary operations, and the cleaning of food-contact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surfaces. FDA inspections of seafood processors apply the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principles in part 110.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nearly half of the consumer complaints relating to seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that FDA receives in a typical year are related to plant or food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hygiene (Ref. 60). The reasons, while not entirely clear, appear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be related to factors such as the age of processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities, the seasonal nature of operations that affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training, and the turnover of personnel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A representative cross section of those FDA establishment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection reports (EIR's) for domestic seafood manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that revealed CGMP deficiencies for fiscal years 1988&hyph;90  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrates this point (Ref. 61). The cross section involves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 795 EIR's covering 561 facilities. (The number of EIR's exceeds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the number of facilities because followup visits were made to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> check on the status of corrective actions.) The following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentages refer to EIR's with deficiencies where at least some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the deficiencies involved sanitation:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Twenty-three percent documented receiving area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities that were not clean/orderly or in good repair.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Twenty-six percent documented facilities lacking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective insect and rodent control measures in the receiving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Sixteen percent documented failure to handle ice in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanitary manner and to protect it properly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

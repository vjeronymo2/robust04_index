			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Anger of south Lebanon pours into Beirut THE population of Nabatiyeh was roughly 60,000 last Saturday, making it one of the biggest towns in south Lebanon. Yesterday, it was anyone's guess how many people were still living behind the shuttered shop-fronts and closed doors. Some of the few people visible guessed that no more than 10,000 remained. From the roof-top of Nabatiyeh's tallest building, only a handful of people could be spotted either in the streets or peering anxiously from windows. A few cars raced through the deserted roads, swerving to avoid debris or treetop branches sliced by incoming shells. Every 15 seconds, after a thump audible from Israeli positions overlooking the town, and the chilling hiss of an incoming shell, another house would disappear behind a piercing crack and a cloud of dark smoke. On the ground floor of the same building, a modern shopping and office block, the shutters of only one store remained open - Akil Brothers' children's clothes. Inside, on mattresses strewn among rails of bright children's T-shirts, 25 men, women and children were huddled, terrified to move. 'There's nothing here, no food, no petrol,' said Abdel Jalil, a student. 'There is only one shop but it has food for maybe one day.' Mr Jalil said he and the others were too afraid to travel along the road out of Nabatiyeh to safety and, anyway, had neither vehicles nor anyone to stay with in Beirut. 'We'll just stay here,' he said with a shrug. Others in the 70 villages around Nabatiyeh and Tyre, where Israeli jets and gunners concentrated their attacks yesterday did, however, continue south Lebanon's exodus - bringing to perhaps 200,000 the number of refugees to have descended on Beirut since Monday. More will have taken advantage of Israel's short ceasefire late yesterday to leave. But for civilians with no way out the dangers will only increase. Not only is there scant food or water but any visible movement inside or outside their houses is likely to attract the attention of Israeli artillery spotters, who in yesterday's raids were pounding shells repeatedly and devastatingly into selected houses. Israel has made it clear that those who do not heed warnings to leave certain villages, broadcast every 15 minutes on South Lebanon Radio, will suffer the consequences. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon said it was trying to run relief agencies into the worst hit villages to rescue the marooned. But some villages are now hard or impossible to reach. The main road south from Nabatiyeh, an artery for 25 nearby villages, was deserted yesterday for fear of shelling. The road to Jibsheet, five kilometres from Nabatiyeh, was severed completely by a five-foot-deep crater. For the thousands arriving in Beirut without friends or family to receive them, the Lebanese government has so far been able to offer little more than space. Schools and public buildings have been opened to the refugees. But these yesterday were often poorly equipped to cope. Yesterday, and for the first time in a long time, this anger poured on to Beirut's tattered streets. Thousands of Hizbollah supporters marched in a sour and noisy demonstration through the city's centre chanting 'Death to Israel and America,' 'No to peace with Israel.' South Lebanon's problems are now also those of Beirut.</p>

The Russian-made MiG warplane bombed the brigade at  al-'Amaliqah in the southern province of Abyan on Monday,  causing enormous damage but no casualties, the spokesman for the  General People's Congress (GPC) said.    He told AFP that the warplane returned to Badr air base,  near  the southern port city of Aden.    However, a spokesman at the Badr base denied the charge,  insisting the plane was on a routine training mission.</p>

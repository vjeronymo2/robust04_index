			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> 'MISSING' WOMAN CALLS POLICE  </P> <P> A 20-year-old woman reported missing more than two weeks ago recently notified  police that she is safe and living with a family in Los Angeles County,  authorities said today.  </P> <P> Tufa Petelo arrived at the Anaheim police station Friday and told officers that  she left home Sept. 26 after receiving a severe beating from the woman who  reported her disappearance, Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth said.  </P> <P> Petelo informed police of her whereabouts when she heard they were conducting  an extensive missing-person search but declined to press charges in the alleged  beating, Hedgpeth said.  </P> <P> "We have confirmed that she was beaten severely on Sept. 25 or 26 by the same  person who reported her missing," Hedgpeth said. "This caused (Petelo) to run  away. In her mind, she left for her own safety."  </P> <P> Futatia Tausili, 48, the Anaheim woman who reported Petelo missing, originally  told police that she is Petelo's aunt. Police have since confirmed that the two  women are not related. Tausili could not be reached for comment earlier today.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Antonin Baudys today rejected  speculation that the Czech Republic is setting itself apart from  the Visegrad Group. With regard to his canceled trip to Warsaw,  Baudys said that his deputy, Jiri Pospisil, is well qualified to  fully cover for him.    According to Minister Baudys, the envisaged visit by  President Bill Clinton is an exceptional event. However, the  minister noted that the Army is not preparing any extraordinary  measures or alert. The only measure is that the military police  will cooperate with the municipal police, the Interior Ministry,  and other bodies, in order to protect public order.</p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPH N. BELL: THIS WISH LIST DRIVES HIM TO DISTRACTION  </P> <P> I used my Continental Airlines pass to go to Colorado last week, dividing my  time between my grandchildren in Boulder and a visit to Aspen, which I had  never seen in winter. God obliged, giving me a little more winter than I really  needed, which made it a rather hazardous drive from Denver to Aspen.  </P> <P> But I was determined, and I hung in, spending two glorious picture-postcard  days in Aspen, which I had virtually to myself since I beat the beginning of  the ski season by several weeks. All of which is a long preamble to Glenwood  Canyon and the direction it set me thinking.  </P> <P> Glenwood Canyon is a 15-mile-long crevice in the Rocky Mountains that has to be  navigated on I-70 to get from Denver to Grand Junction. For many years when I  drove this route, I-70 dwindled to a torturous two-lane road for this 15 miles,  usually spent behind trucks creeping along at 20 m.p.h. and impossible to pass.  </P> <P> About seven years ago, the state of Colorado set out to build four lanes of  highway through Glenwood Canyon -- and I have watched the project with  fascination ever since. I have no engineering expertise and usually very little  interest in such things, but this is a challenge hard to ignore. Each time I  pass through, a little more of it is done. The one constant is the  30-to-60-minute delay.  </P> <P> Although it is totally out of character, I've never been impatient with the  delay because it gives me time to study how this remarkable stretch of road is  taking shape. I had to traverse Glenwood Canyon twice on this recent trip, each  time with a 30-minute delay. Both ends of the road have been completed, but  there is a seven-mile section in the middle -- including a stretch of tunnel  through solid rock -- that is still under construction. And to this unpracticed  eye, will be for a long time.  </P> <P> As I cleared the canyon and relaxed my grip on the steering wheel, I mused,  half-aloud: "I hope I live to see this finished." It's an old cliche, but it  set me to thinking -- which is mostly what one does when driving long stretches  of open highway alone. And on this Colorado highway on this day, I pondered the  question: What else do I hope to live long enough to see or do?  </P> <P> The road was free enough of traffic that I could jot down my thoughts as they  came to me. So here is a partial list in answer to that question:  </P> <P> * To watch the California Angels play in a World Series. I could probably have  no better guarantee of longevity than this.  </P> <P> * To enjoy the experience, just once, of having our bubble-headed dachshund,  Coco, come the first time I call her. Or the second.  </P> <P> * To see low-cost housing built in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> * To watch Bill Mulligan's UC Irvine basketball team play in an NCAA  tournament.  </P> <P> * To witness a U.S. political campaign devoted solely to the positions of the  two candidates on the issues that divide them.  </P> <P> * To see a cure for AIDS.  </P> <P> * To drive a car powered by something other than an internal combustion engine.  </P> <P> * To see middle-class Southern Californians using public transportation.  </P> <P> * To know that my grandchildren will not have to go to war. Or anyone else's  grandchildren.  </P> <P> * To wallow in a Midwestern fall.  </P> <P> * To eat gravy without worrying about cholesterol.  </P> <P> * To see a cure for cancer.  </P> <P> * To witness an election in which a proud and avowed member of the ACLU wins  public office in Orange County.  </P> <P> * To finish writing the novel that has been in my desk drawer for the last  eight years.  </P> <P> * To hear Richard Nixon admit that he was wrong -- and mean it.  </P> <P> * To see a revival of "Showboat" in which the lyrics of "Ol' Man River" are  sung as Oscar Hammerstein wrote them.  </P> <P> * To read Ariel and Will Durant's "History of Mankind" and the "Interpreter's  Bible" in their entirety.  </P> <P> * To stop searching for simple answers to complex questions.  </P> <P> * To experience a great-grandchild.  </P> <P> * To spend a month is Paris -- while I'm still strong and healthy enough to  walk its streets every day.  </P> <P> * To procure another bathroom at home.  </P> <P> * To develop a tennis backhand strong enough that the people I'm playing will  stop hitting every ball in that direction.  </P> <P> * To see the car telephone outlawed.  </P> <P> * To see the hole in the front of our house put there by a wayward motorist  converted into a magnificent bay window.  </P> <P> * To no longer need to understand how God and evil can co-exist in the same  universe.  </P> <P> I figure this list will carry me to about 2020 at least. I'll have another look  at it then -- maybe on the four-lane highway through Glenwood Canyon.  </P></p>

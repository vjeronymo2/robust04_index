			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Clarke wins the hearts of German industrialists IF Mr Norman Lamont conducted his dialogue with the German financial and industrial establishment via unfriendly newspaper headlines, his successor as Chancellor of the Exchequer is trying a more intimate approach. On Sunday night, Mr Kenneth Clarke dined at the Schloss Hotel, Kronberg, an imposing gothic palace built in the hills outside Frankfurt by a daughter of Queen Victoria. Amid memorabilia celebrating ties between the English and German royal families, Clarke sought to bolster present-day relations between the two countries, hosting a dinner for 11 of Germany's top bankers and industrialists. Yesterday morning, he found himself in the congenial surroundings of the Frankfurter Club, an elegant, wood-panelled mansion built in 1896 which houses an institution deliberately modelled on English gentlemen's clubs of yore. There he talked to 14 journalists, before driving round to the twin towers of the Deutsche Bank, where he met Mr Hilmar Kopper - the bank's chief executive - and three other board members. After that it was off to lunch at the Bundesbank, where officials report that he spent a good 20 minutes in private conversation with Mr Hans Tietmeyer, soon to replace Mr Helmut Schlesinger as president of the German central bank. After the rumpus over sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism last autumn, Mr Clarke's visit to Frankfurt - and later to Munich - was viewed by German businessmen as a welcome attempt to poor oil on unnecessarily troubled waters. Mr Lamont had been happy to blame the rumpus on loose words from Mr Schlesinger, contained in an 'unauthorised' interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper which set off what UK politicians claimed was a 'whispering campaign' to undermine sterling. One banker described Mr Clarke's visit as a 'a very intelligent diplomatic move'. Another, who attended one of the meetings yesterday, said that it hardly mattered that the discussion of the outlook for the German and UK economies was conducted at 'a relatively superficial level': it was Mr Clarke's willingness to come to Germany and exchange views which mattered. Bankers said they were impressed by the direct way Mr Clarke answered questions.</p>

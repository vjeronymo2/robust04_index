			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (11): The stamp of unity - Unification of post codes It was July 1, 1993. The postman arrived at the usual time. 'I thought you might be a bit late because of the new post codes.' 'Oh no - the system is working fine. The Germans have had enough time to tell their friends and contacts about the changes,' said the postman. Not even the post code could escape the affects of German unification. 'After all, we could not have Bonn and Weimar sharing the same post code of 5300. Could we?' said Mr Norbert Schafer, of the federal post office. The west German postal code system was introduced in 1961, the year the Berlin Wall divided this great city. The east German system, considered more rational because it had more post codes covering much smaller areas, was introduced in 1965. But with unification came the re-writing of the post code. The new post code, inspired by the French and Swedish models after two years of research and trials, involved scrapping the existing 5,400 codes and replacing them by 26,400 new ones. Gone is the old 'W', (for West Germany) followed by a number, the city, then another number. Gone too is the 'O' for east Germany. Instead, the post code has been simplified with just a set of numbers preceding the city, town or village. The first two numbers denote the region, the last three the local post office. The German post office spent DM400m on introducing the new system, which included DM200m on its development, such as installing new computers, DM80m on advertising, and DM120m for distributing to the country's 34m households the hefty 1.3 kg new postcode book - which even merited a book review in the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on April 30, 1993. Everything was ready by July 1, 1993, when the two separate postcodes of eastern and western Germany were unified. And the success rate? After a few initial complaints from the large retail and mail-ordering services, the post office authorities feel they can take a bow. 'The acceptance rate has been very fast and high,' said Ms Franzi Koski, an official at the post office. 'Several weeks after introducing it, we had a 90 per cent acceptance. Now, we have about 96 per cent rate. We expect 99 per cent soon.' And the postman will continue to turn up at the usual time.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Potential radiological impacts of TFTR decontamination and decommissioning would not represent potential impacts greater than those from current PPPL operations, which have had no significant consequences. Decontamination and decommissioning activities would result in a dose of less than the adopted design objective of 10 mrem per year to any member of the public from all project sources. It would result in minor releases of activated metal and tritium to the atmosphere and sewer system. The maximum calculated individual public dose would be 2.3 mrem per year, and the increased probability of incremental lifetime cancer risk associated with exposure from this dose would be 1.1 chances in 1,000,000. This very low calculated effect means insignificant risk to the public. Occupational doses would not exceed the PPPL administrative limit of 1 rem per year, which is less than the DOE limit of 5 rem per year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operational occurrences during decontamination and decommissioning that could result in the accidental release of tritium, activated gases, or solids consist primarily of component failures and human error, and any releases would be limited by inventories within the components. The largest calculated dose to the public from decontamination and decommissioning accident scenarios, including beyond design basis accidents, is 390 mrem to a maximally exposed member of the public. The increased probability of incremental lifetime cancer risk associated with exposure from this dose would be 195 chances in 1,000,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The TPX would not present long-term or adverse nonradiological impacts to the public or the environment at the PPPL site. Other TPX nonradiological impacts would be temporary, except for the commitment of a small parcel of land for construction of new TPX facilities. Construction impacts due to test cell modifications and construction of the cryogenic equipment building, tank yards, and electric substation would be minor. All construction would be built on land already committed to DOE operations. This construction would all be within the current land use restrictions governing PPPL site agreements with the DOE. For a construction project of this scope, the potential exists for 2.5 lost workday cases (work related injuries that require time-off from work) over the construction period. Also there would be a 10% increase in the current amount of site traffic, which would increase the potential for on-site vehicular accidents slightly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Radiological impacts from the TPX would not exceed current impacts from PPPL operations, which has not been shown to cause incremental lifetime cancer risk associated with exposure. Potential environmental, safety, and health radiological impacts were evaluated for both deuterium and possible future tritium operations. Atmospheric releases of tritium and activation products constitute the potential sources of radiological exposure to members of the public. Maximum projected atmospheric releases would result in annual effective dose equivalents of 1.2 mrem and 4.6 mrem to a hypothetical maximally-exposed individual at the site boundary during deuterium and tritium operations, respectively, with a maximum increased probability of incremental lifetime cancer risk associated with exposure of 2.3 chances in 1,000,000. These conservatively-calculated dose equivalents are less than the most restrictive limit for public doses caused by airborne releases (the EPA limit of 10 mrem per year). Direct radiation from the TPX would be mitigated with shielding to keep the total effective dose equivalent from all sources at the site boundary within the project design objective of less than or equal to 10 mrem per year. This design objective effective dose equivalent is well below the DOE limit of 100 mrem per year to members of the public from routine DOE operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Normal TPX deuterium-tritium operations would result in total estimated collective effective dose equivalents of 7.5 person-rem per year and 24 person-rem per year to the projected population within the 80 km (50 mi) radius area surrounding PPPL during deuterium and tritium operations, respectively. These doses amount to an average effective dose equivalent of less than 0.002 mrem per year to each individual in the assessment area and would result in less than 1 health effect in the exposed population. On the basis of the collective effective dose equivalent, incremental lifetime cancer risk associated with exposure attributable to TPX operations are not expected to occur. A collective effective dose equivalent of 24 person-rem per year represents approximately .002% of the collective effective dose equivalent from natural background radiation in the area (exclusive of radon). Occupational doses to workers during TPX operations would result from direct radiation and small releases of tritium and activated gases. Operational procedures, administrative controls and monitoring would ensure that occupational doses are kept below regulatory limits and as low as reasonably achievable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accidental releases of radioactive material could hypothetically result from (a) Natural phenomena (e.g., earthquakes), (b) accidents with external origin (e.g., airplane crashes), (c) shipping accidents (i.e., accidents involving the transportation of radioactive material), and (d) operational occurrences (e.g., tritium leaks). All TPX confinement boundaries would be capable of maintaining integrity for design basis natural phenomenon, and therefore a release due to a natural phenomena event is extremely unlikely. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accidents with external origins and transportation accidents involving small quantities of radioactive material would present little risk to the public and the environment. Transportation accidents involving larger quantities of radioactive material, form example tritium, could occur; however, the accidental release of significant quantities of radionuclides has a very low probability because of the demonstrated integrity of the approved containers that would be used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TPX operational occurrences that could result in the accidental release of tritium, activated gases, or solids consist primarily of component failures and human error. Releases associated with these occurrences would be limited by component inventories. The maximum calculated individual dose from accident scenarios is 390 mrem, which is well below the DOE siting guideline limit of 25 rem. Incremental lifetime cancer risk associated with exposure resulting from the collective doses would represent a negligible increase in the total number of such health effects in the exposed population from all natural background radiation doses. The largest potential radiological impacts to the public from TPX accidents, including beyond design basis accidents, are below regulatory limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After TPX operation has ended, a proper NEPA review would be conducted for the decontamination and decommissioning of the facility. It is expected that the waste material resulting from decontamination and decommissioning activities would qualify as low-level radioactive waste and would be disposed of at an appropriate DOE waste disposal facility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TFTR operations would be discontinued prior to TFTR decontamination and decommissioning. Cumulative effects would be minor and would represent a continuation of, rather than a change in, any impacts (negative and positive) associated with TFTR operations. Commitment of 560 m2 (6,000 ft2) of land for the construction of the radioactive waste storage building and 1,300 m2 (14,000 ft2) for construction of a second storm water detention basin would represent a long-term commitment of land use. Environmental releases of small amounts of residual tritium during decontamination and decommissioning would not add measurably to current low levels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No adverse long-term environmental effects are expected from normal operations of the TPX. Tritium releases during normal operations would not constitute a measurable contribution to background radiation levels, because of the small amount of tritium to be released, its relatively short half-life (12.3 years), and rapid dispersion in the environment. There are currently no measurable cumulative impacts occurring between PPPL and other facilities in the region, and none would be expected for the proposed TPX. Releases of radionuclides to the atmosphere by commercial operations (such as hospitals and research laboratories) near PPPL are not detectable in environmental samples collected around PPPL; analyses show no radionuclide concentrations above background levels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Invitation To Comment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DOE invites the public, including states which host DOE facilities and any Indian tribe that might be affected by the proposed action, to comment on this proposed FONSI.

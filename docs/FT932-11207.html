			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / International Company News: Bass talks with Czech brewer BASS, the British brewer, is negotiating to buy a large stake in Prazske Pivovary (Prague Breweries), the Czech Republic's second-largest brewer which was privatised last year. The companies would not comment on the negotiations, but western investment consultants in Prague said talks between Bass and a consortium of investment funds have continued for some months. At the beginning of negotiations, Bass is said to have been seeking a minority position in the Czech company, with the aim of gradually raising its stake through capital injections. The consortium includes some of the largest Czech investment funds which gained control of most of the 72 per cent of the company's shares sold in last year's voucher privatisation. The funds have yet to receive the shares from the government, but they are acting as de-facto owners. The share transfer, due last month, was postponed because of a dispute between Prague and Bratislava. Other shareholders include the National Property Fund, which oversees privatisation, with 10 per cent; employees (10 per cent); Pragopivot (5 per cent), and the Restitution Fund (3 per cent). Total common equity is Kcs880.5m (Dollars 31m). The Czech company was established in 1948 and has three large breweries. In 1991, it reported a pre-tax profit of Kcs217.7m on sales of Kcs1.03bn.</p>

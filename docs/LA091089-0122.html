			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- THE SEARCH GOES ON  </P> <P> I've been reading with interest about the scandals at the Housing and Urban  Development (HUD) Department, and about local communities that are taking  initiatives to provide decent housing for low-income families.  </P> <P> Mismanagement aside, the federal government and HUD have clearly contributed to  the affordable housing crisis. The federal housing budget was substantially  reduced from $32 billion in 1980 to under $8 billion in 1988. There was (not  surprisingly) a corresponding decrease in the number of new families assisted  by HUD, from 316,000 families a year during 1977-1980 to 82,000 families during  1981-1988.  </P> <P> A large crisis looms as (we run out of) federally subsidized low-income  housing: 800,000 HUD subsidized units, built 20 years ago, can be sold by their  developers in 1990; 5,000 units are in Orange County. Rental subsidies, under  Section 8, expire on another 465,000 rental units (nationwide).  </P> <P> This translates into 1,265,000 families who have no place else to go. There are  currently twice as many renters as there are affordable places to live. Half of  those people with incomes under the poverty level already pay more than 70% of  their income on housing.  </P> <P> It's no wonder that people are planning to march on Washington, D.C., this Oct.  7 to demand housing now! Funding must be restored to provide permanent  affordable housing for low-income families. This will match the goal set by  Congress 40 years ago to provide "a decent home in a suitable living  environment" for all Americans.  </P> <P> If HUD cannot administer the funds properly, then I say let's give the funds to  those communities that have demonstrated successful local initiatives to  provide affordable housing solutions.  </P> <P> LINDA LINDQUIST  </P> <P> Lake Forest  </P></p>

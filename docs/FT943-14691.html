			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Sir Ian packs bags and leaves Holmes: 'I am too old to spend my time going back and forth in a crisis' Sir Ian MacGregor, the former chairman of British Steel and British Coal, yesterday quit the UK quoted company scene when he resigned as chairman of security group Holmes Protection. The 81-year-old Scot is also bowing out of the UK itself having decided to sell his house in Scotland and retire to America. Speaking from his home in Massachusetts, Sir Ian said he was stepping down from US-based Holmes after boardroom disagreements. 'My ideas did not prevail and I am too old to spend my time in a long, hot summer going back and forth in a crisis.' The disagreements stemmed from a deal announced last week under which HP Partners, a US investor group, would inject Dollars 10m in return for a 34 per cent stake. Mr Paul Douglas, a director for the past 19 months, succeeds as chairman of Holmes which plans to delist its shares in London and obtain a quotation on the Nasdaq exchange in New York. In recent years Sir Ian has been involved in a number of struggling UK-quoted companies where things have not gone entirely to plan. Mountleigh, the property group, went into receivership while he was chairman and shortly afterwards he was ousted as chairman of specialist printer HunterPrint. 'Lots of people asked me to give them some help and like a boy scout I was always willing to try. But like a doctor, not all my patients survived.' He blames the Mountleigh disappointment on 'the panic that descended on the City when Olympia &amp; York went belly up'. Sir Ian is retaining his directorship at United Gas, the new-born UK-based gas business where he acted as 'midwife'. But he is selling his house in Argyll and will divide his time between Massachusetts and Florida. His children and grandchildren live in America where he spent much of his early career. 'They have put up with my keeping the house for years but I finally got the message that they regarded it as an old man's indulgence. Anyway I have the impression the Scottish climate was better in my youth.' He is still involved with several young US companies. 'I spend a lot of time giving people the benefit of my experience and they spend their time taking very little notice.'</p>

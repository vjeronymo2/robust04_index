			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters believe that States should not charge the State ombudsman for the notifications specified in this subsection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Since the information in this subsection is being disclosed by the State, any fees and charges, or waivers thereof, would be subject to the specific State's disclosure law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters requested that proposed &sect;488.175(e)(4) (redesignated in this final rule as &sect;488.325(f)(4)), be expanded to include requests for appeals as well as results of appeals. A few other commenters suggested that the paragraph be revised to include facility cost reports, confidential survey records, for example, surveyor notes, etc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We are accepting the first suggestion and are revising redesignated paragraph (f)(4), to provide that the State must provide the State's long term care ombudsman with requests for appeals and results of appeals. We are not accepting the second suggestion. The fact that the Congress explicitly provided that a facility's Medicare and Medicaid cost reports are disclosable to the public in accordance with applicable disclosure laws, and not routinely disseminated to any specific party, demonstrates its intention that release of these reports should be based on the requestor's right to know the information. The State's long-term care ombudsman, as well as any other member of the public, may request these cost reports, surveyors' notes, and any other survey-related documents not included in this subsection through the appropriate disclosure mechanism, for example, the Freedom of Information Act, where they will be evaluated accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters, mostly State agencies, were opposed to routinely providing ombudsmen with the information required by this subsection. They contend that this results in a costly and overwhelming task especially in the larger States; for example, California has 1300 nursing homes and 42 ombudsman field offices. They propose that a more reasonable approach to notification would be that in cases where a specified degree of noncompliance exists, for example, substandard care, notification would be automatic; in all other cases, notification would be upon request. Another comment was that HCFA should develop a report using data from current reporting systems to provide the needed information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We cannot accept these suggestions. Sections 1819(g)(5)(B) and 1919(g)(5)(B) of the Act, as amended by sections 4008(h)(2)(N) and 4801(e)(15) of OBRA '90, specifically provide, without exception, that ``States'' will notify ``the State long-term care ombudsman'' of a State finding of noncompliance with ``any'' participation requirement as well as of ``any'' adverse action imposed against a facility in that State. Regarding the number of ombudsmen offices within a State to which notifications must be made, we note that, since the statutory requirement to notify ``the State long-term care ombudsman'' is singular, the State's central long-term care ombudsman office within each State's organizational structure is the intended contact point for satisfying such notification requirements. While we see the function of disseminating the information further among the district and other ombudsmen offices to be the responsibility of the State's central long-term care ombudsman office, each State has the flexibility to design its own system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters wanted HCFA or the State to notify the ombudsman of a nurse staffing waiver within 7 days of its approval. Several commenters proposed that notice of nurse staffing waivers be provided to prospective residents, their physicians, families or legal representatives, the State licensure board for nursing and the State and local medical societies. They based their proposal on the public's need to know, not only from a consumer's perspective, but as taxpayers who directly subsidize the affected facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

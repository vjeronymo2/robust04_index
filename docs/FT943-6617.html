			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Sport: Rude awakening - Cricket / Teresa McLean explains why she is grateful to Mike Atherton Nostalgia is dangerous. Under its spell one looks back on past outrages and sees them as endearing amusements. Rude captains, for instance. Not rude as the match referee thought Mike Atherton was rude at the Oval, looking at his bat 'with an air of dissent' on the walk back from crease to pavilion after his first innings dismissal. But rude in the grand manner, as Archie MacLaren used to be rude to the lesser mortals around him. During the 1902 series against Australia, having argued vigorously with his fellow selectors about who should play, MacLaren is said to have marched into the English dressing-room, looked round at the assembled players and cried out in disgust: 'My God] Look what they've given me this time]' MacLaren's sins, like his many failures as captain of England, were forgiven him because, as his obituary in the 1944 Wisden put it, 'he possessed the grand manner' and people loved his flamboyance, however rude. Atherton is paying the price for having taken over the English captaincy cautiously, in a depressed period of English cricket, with confidence gone, press predatory and management uncertain. Last Saturday at the Oval, I watched Devon Malcolm bowling with terrifying penetration through the South African defences. It was a once-in-a-lifetime sight and I will never forget it. Malcolm's second over was a double-wicket-maiden, which removed opener Peter Kirsten and No 3 Hansie Cronje, leaving the South African score 1 for 3. You could feel the excitement grip the grotty, friendly old Oval, but everyone expected the South Africans to fight back and seize the initiative before long. They did not have a chance, but the sad truth is that England and English supporters have got into the habit of expecting to lose. I remember asking Glamorgan last year how Viv Richards had managed to work such wonders for them in his first year there. I think it was their captain, Hugh Morris, who said: 'You can't imagine what a difference it makes, going out to play alongside someone who expects to win.' English Test matches have gone the other way. They are played in a climate of pessimism which is hard to shake off and is a constant resource of the sceptical press. If the pessimism falters, the next best resource is complaint about one of the old favourites: opponents, umpires, groundsmen or, best of all, captains. South Africa have been welcome opponents this summer, full of enthusiasm and old fashioned sporting spirit. Not suitable targets for complaint. Thus far the umpires could only be praised for their excellent handling of the Oval Test, even when umpire Kenny Palmer's view of Atherton's 'dissent' as 'within the limits of acceptable behaviour' was over-ruled by match referee Peter Burge. Palmer is an old hand, from the days when umpires, not referees, controlled cricket and he continued his capable partnership with Steve Dunne undaunted. Groundsman Harry Brind's pitch was an Oval breath of life into a medium pace series - dry, fast and lively. Test Match Special's Bill Frindall was so impressed with it that he proposed Brind, not Malcolm, as man-of-the-match. Atherton was the obvious target for attack. Under his captaincy this summer England had defeated New Zealand and now had a chance of drawing the series with South Africa, but when Kepler Wessels started digging himself in, lifting the score from 1 for 3 to 73 for 4, English journalists drifted back to the ever useful subject of doubtful field settings. Surely Atherton should have more than two slips? It was the South African journalists who sent pieces home praising Atherton's shrewd handling of his bowlers, particularly Malcolm, whom he was clever enough to bowl only in short bursts. Even if Atherton was right to use Malcolm in short bursts, the timing of the bursts was crucial. Indeed it was and on Saturday it was perfect. Malcolm's first three wickets came in his first two overs, the next three after lunch, the last three after tea, when the crowd roared Malcolm in to the crease to blast South Africa from 175 for 8 to 175 all out. The South Africans were more upset by Atherton's and Graham Gooch's uninhibited pursuit of the 204 required to win than they were by their batsmen falling victim to these spells of glorious bowling. The last hour's play was more humiliating. It carried on England's batting in the cavalier manner defiantly adopted by Phillip de Freitas and Darren Gough the night before. It deprived all South Africa's bowlers of respect and made their main strike bowler, Allan Donald, look pathetic. Gooch, man of caution and experience, hit 33 off 20 balls with the air of one who is bored with the slow pace of Sunday cricket. 'What am I going to say to them back home?' asked the young South African journalist next to me, straightening his blazer and tie. 'I've got Atherton and Gooch cast as anchor men, not meteorites.' After three overs they had scored 38 runs. Though the run rate dropped to eight an over when Gooch was out, Graeme Hick played his shots with a romping power that I have not seen him use in Test matches. Whatever the public's feelings about Atherton before the Oval Test, by the end of it the main feeling was gratitude, not just for winning a match and saving a series, but for releasing in the process an element of flamboyance, of which everyone had long been starved. Priceless stuff, flamboyance.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAT nerves Worries about the cigarette price war in the US overhung international trading group BAT Industries, which reported interim figures in line with market expectations. Profits were up 35 per cent to Pounds 906m and the dividend was raised by 8 per cent, which initially inspired demand for the stock, sending it forward 9 to 459p. However, a sombre analysts' meeting at which the company focused on the stiff competition in the US cigarette market saw initial enthusiasm wane and the shares finished a net 4 off at 446p after volume of 7m, well above usual trading levels. Mr Andrew Mitchell at Smith New Court said: 'Although a cloud remains over the US tobacco side, the dividend yield remains a key attraction in the long term.' Rumours of a big share placing, together with the sale of a large chunk of directors' equity holdings, took the shine off Taunton Cider, although the stock later rallied. The shares closed just a penny off at 204p after hefty turnover of 8.5m. The directors and family interests sold 1.6m shares at 197p. A large line of stock was said to have been placed at 201p. The Greenalls bid for JA Devenish was declared unconditional, coinciding with Schroder selling the rump of stock issued for those shareholders who took the cash alternative. These shares were bought at 350p and placed in the market, with total turnover hitting 10m. Greenalls closed 2 easier at 353p. Devenish finished 9 ahead at 368p. Hotel group Stakis placed 18m new shares in the market through its broker Smith New Court as part of a deal to buy a hotel in York, UK, for Pounds 5.85m. Smith placed the shares at 53.25p with a variety of institutions. Stakis slipped a penny to 55p. A large seller in Wembley left the shares 2 down at 11 1/2 p after turnover of 1.4m. Results from BT failed to excite investors, with worries over increased competition and regulatory concerns overshadowing events. The shares faded to close 1 1/2 off at 417 1/2 p. Reuters Holdings gave up 5 to 1439p in spite of a buy note from NatWest Securities as sellers continued to nibble away at gains made on the recent share buy-back plan. Aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce eased 3 1/2 to 138 1/2 p, with overseas holders believed to have been among the chief sellers. Volume at the close was 3.8m shares. Shares in Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel added 10 at 444p, following Tuesday's agreement between the company and TransManche Link, the consortium constructing the tunnel. National Express ended 9 up at 249p after a stake of around 8 per cent changed hands. Profit-taking after its recent run left British Aerospace 6 lighter at 416p. A slight shortage of stock and a reported recommendation from Strauss Turnbull boosted Smiths Industries, which rose 6 to 357p. The recent positive stance from Panmure Gordon continued to boost Vosper Thornycroft and the shares advanced a further 14 to 641p. Among the motor stocks, T. Cowie firmed 4 1/2 to 248p on the prospect of good August car sales. Profit-takers moved into Pearson after the progress achieved on the previous day on the back of plans to spin off two parts of its operations. The shares retreated 10 to 457p. Fortunes moved in the opposite direction for Mirror Group Newspapers, which enjoyed a rally to recover more of the ground lost in the tabloid price war. At 154p, the stock added 5. Good results from a US rival of lubricants group Burmah Castrol led to demand for the stock. The shares strengthened 15 to 731p, with sentiment boosted by news that it was raising its stake in Castrol India to 51 per cent from a previous 40 per cent. Shell Transport put on 4 at 632p in volume of 2.4m, ahead of next week's figures. Turnover in British Gas rose to 11m as the shares continued their recent recovery, gaining 7 at 306p. There was speculation that further job cuts may be announced if the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommends a restructuring of the business. A summary of the report is expected on August 17. Hopes of a recovery in oil prices boosted Enterprise Oil, which rose 10 to 455p. In the banking sector, hopes that TSB would soon announce the sale of Hill Samuel, its merchant banking subsidiary, helped the shares improve 5 to 201p, in trade of 4.7m. Insurance and financial services group Lloyds Abbey Life climbed 11 to 418p after a 7.3 per cent increase in profits. The agreement between Eurotunnel and TML had a mixed effect on building shares. Costain edged up a penny to 37p, while Taylor Woodrow closed at its starting level of 114p after having reached a high of 116p. George Wimpey receded 6 to 169p after profit-takers took the shine off the rise made on the previous day on the Channel tunnel agreement. Good results from paper and packaging group David. S Smith attracted investor support and the stock appreciated 10 to 380p. Nervousness ahead of ICI's results, due today, saw the shares retreat 9 to 650p. Its former drugs business, Zeneca, also reporting today, gave up 4 to 622p. Television stocks mustered a firm performance, with Scottish TV adding 4 at 513p, Central Independent TV moving forward 5 to 1970p and Grampian TV increasing by 2 to 230p. Business services company Danka Business closed 8 ahead at 230p after an improvement in first-quarter profits. Shares in Goode Durrant brushed aside a full-year loss of Pounds 15.3m and improved 7 to 93p, helped by a confident statement on the future outlook for the company.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TEACHER CHARGED WITH SKIMMING SCHOOL MONEY  </P> <P> A teacher in the Inglewood Unifed School District was charged with grand theft  and embezzlement last week for allegedly setting up a personal bank account to  bilk the school district, authorities said.  </P> <P> Leonard Matthews, who was principal of Hillcrest Continuation High School at  the time of the alleged thefts and has since been demoted, was arraigned  Wednesday in Los Angeles Municipal Court. He is charged with 14 counts of  embezzlement and one count of grand theft involving as much as $4,000,  Assistant Dist. Atty. Tom Gray said.  </P> <P> "He established an account . . . for the purpose of skimming money that  belonged either to the student body or the school district," Gray said.  </P> <P> Matthews, who could not be reached for comment Friday, pleaded not guilty to  all counts. His attorney, Carl Douglas, said Friday that Matthews plans to  "vigorously deny that he committed any wrongdoing or illegality."  </P> <P> Matthews recently suffered a personal tragedy when his son died Oct. 17 after a  long illness. Mallory Matthews, 37, had been acting principal at Inglewood's  Morningside High School.  </P> <P> Leonard Matthews is scheduled to appear in court Nov. 27 for the setting of the  date of his preliminary hearing. He was released on his own recognizance after  voluntarily appearing at the arraignment to answer an arrest warrant.  </P> <P> Matthews, who has already reimbursed the district an undisclosed amount of  money, was transferred from principal to an administrative position in the  district headquarters in 1987 when a finance administrator discovered the  existence of the unauthorized account and referred the matter to Inglewood  police. He was demoted to a teaching position when police referred the matter  to the district attorney's office in late 1988.  </P> <P> Matthews, a 15-year district employee, is accused of depositing school funds in  the unauthorized account over a 16-month period beginning in 1986 and using the  money for such personal uses as groceries, cosmetics and a $218 Nativity scene  that was ordered for the school but sent to his home.  </P> <P> Gray said Matthews paid "a substantial number of personal expenses through the  account."  </P> <P> Matthews allegedly opened the account at Wells Fargo Bank in Inglewood in  August, 1986, in the name "Hillcrest High School Clubs/Leonard Matthews." He is  accused of using the account to divert donations intended for the school, as  well as profits from a student store and employee paychecks that may have been  padded with phony overtime claims.  </P> <P> Gray said Matthews had deposited some of his own money into the account and  used it to pay some legitimate school expenses. "You can't clearly say that he  collected other people's money and used it for wine, women and song" because  some of the money was spent legitimately, Gray said.  </P> <P> Community leaders expressed surprise last week upon learning of the criminal  charges. Noting that it had been more than 18 months since the district  attorney began its investigation, they said they had assumed nothing would come  of the probe.  </P> <P> Norma Smith, president of the Inglewood PTA Council, said that if Matthews is  convicted, "he should pay the consequences." But she also said it was  unfortunate the charges against Matthews were filed so close to the death of  his son.  </P> <P> Ken Gossett, an Inglewood businessman who had criticized the district last year  for not firing Matthews, called Friday for his immediate suspension.  </P> <P> "The school board ought to suspend him," he said. "These are grave charges, not  parking violations."  </P> <P> School board members and Supt. George McKenna could not be reached Friday.  </P> <P> The school board came under fire last January for abandoning plans to dismiss  Matthews and instead demoting him to the classroom. Critics charged that  Matthews' close political ties to city and school officials kept him on the  district payroll.  </P> <P> Matthews had been disciplined by administrators in 1987 for using district  equipment to prepare political literature on behalf of candidates supported by  Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent.  </P></p>

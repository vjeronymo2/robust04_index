			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / The Italian Upheaval: From the banks to drugs, Yes or No WHILE electoral reform and party financing are the main issues on which Italians will vote on Sunday, six other questions require their attention. Voters will be helped to distinguish between them as each question will be on a different coloured voting slip. The six 'other' issues in the rainbow referendum comprise a mixed bag touching on constitutional matters such as the balance of power between state and regional government and specialised issues such as reform of the drugs laws. The balance of power: Three referendums concern curtailing the role of central government in favour of devolving power to the regions. They involve abolishing the ministries of agriculture and of tourism and the performing arts, and removing the Treasury's right to appoint the heads of municipal and regional savings banks. In each case, regional interests claim the tasks can be performed better if responsibility is handed down from Rome. Regional and local authorities already have some role regarding tourism and the performing arts. However, the most important decisions have to be taken in the capital. Reducing the role of the central government is also the aim of the vote on bank chairmanships. Foreign bankers find it hard to believe that Italy's Treasury minister has to choose the chairmen of the country's savings banks. The shift would mark a step towards de-politicising the highly political savings bank system, say the referendum's supporters. Similar arguments surround the vote on abolishing the Farm Ministry. However, here the case against centralisation is harder to sustain in view of the integration of European farming in the Common Agricultural Policy and the need for co-ordinated national positions in Brussels. This explains the strong opposition by some parties to the initiatives to abolish both ministries. By contrast, the fourth referendum on the abolition of the Ministry of State Shareholdings has been made largely redundant following the decision by the Amato government to merge the portfolio with that of the industry minister. The Ministry of State Shareholdings was traditionally a source of power for the governing parties. However, with privatisation a central part of the Amato government's policy, its function has been eroded. Environment and drugs. The two other referendums are a mixed bag. The one seeking to strip local health authorities of responsibility for environmental controls is something of an attempt to transfer power back to the state from local level. The powers would probably end up with the Environment Ministry. Instances of local health authorities being unable to discharge environmental responsibilities abound. In the marble quarries of Carrara in Tuscany, union representatives complain that the local health authority does not police quarrying or pollution controls. Lastly, Italians must vote on abolishing a law which makes the possession of drugs a criminal offence. The motive is not to create a junkie free-for-all but to reinstate an earlier law, now in abeyance, which tried to distinguish between drug possession for personal use, which was not a crime, from holding larger quantities of narcotics, presumably for sale.

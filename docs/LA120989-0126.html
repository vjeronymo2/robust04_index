			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRABUCO HILLS STOPS DRIVE, TOPS ORANGE  </P> <P> The end to 60 years of frustration was only a few inches away. However, Orange  High School came up short again.  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills survived a furious fourth-quarter drive to hold on for a 13-7  victory in front of 7,200 in Santa Ana Stadium to win its second Southern  Section Division VIII championship. But, for a few seconds, it appeared the  Panthers were going to end their long drought.  </P> <P> Orange has not won a Southern Section title since 1929.  </P> <P> But with 54 seconds left, Orange had the ball on the Trabuco Hills 13-yard  line. On fourth down, quarterback Chris Thompson floated a pass into the end  zone to wide receiver Mark Kammerlohr, who had beaten defensive back Rick  Sparks.  </P> <P> Kammerlohr appeared to have the ball for a second, before it rolled off his  fingertips, giving the Mustangs the ball and the title.  </P> <P> "The play was executed well and I thought Mark was going to catch the ball,"  Orange Coach Tom Meiss said. "He made a nice cut, he just needed to be three  inches taller.  </P> <P> "I'll probably think of 150,000 plays between now and if I ever get back into a  championship."  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills (13-1) dusted off a relic to win the game, its defense.  </P> <P> Throughout the playoffs, the Mustangs' defense has merely filled in while the  offense took a breather. But, when it was needed, it came to the forefront.  </P> <P> The Mustangs kept the Panther offense out of the end zone. Orange's only  touchdown came on an interception return.  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills also forced three turnovers.  </P> <P> "We really needed a good defensive game tonight because we couldn't move the  ball," Quarterback Tim Manning said. "That was the best defensive game we've  played this year."  </P> <P> Manning and the Mustangs haven't needed more than a token effort from the  defense throughout the playoffs. In three previous postseason games, Trabuco  Hills had outscored its opponents, 118-56.  </P> <P> But Friday, the Panthers tied up the Mustang offense.  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills (13-1) did gain 276 yards but scored only one touchdown. The  Mustangs also got a pair of second-half field goals by Brent Roper.  </P> <P> Roper, who has only five field goals on the season, made kicks of 30 and 32  yards.  </P> <P> Orange confused Trabuco Hills with a variety of defenses. They sacked Manning  three times and made him throw on the run several times.  </P> <P> Manning completed 14 of 23 passes, but for only 131 yards.  </P> <P> "That was the toughest defense I've ever played against," Manning said. "I'm  sore as hell."  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills was lucky to be tied, 7-7, at halftime.  </P> <P> Leading, 7-0, Orange had the ball on the Trabuco Hills' 10. But Manning  intercepted Chris Thompson's pass at the one and returned it 15 yards.  </P> <P> It was the 23rd career interception for Manning, which tied him with David Hill  of Mission Viejo as Orange County's all-time leader.  </P> <P> "We got down there and I had to go into a spread offense, because our fullback  (Paul Minor) was tired and I took him out the game," Meiss said. "If we would  have scored there and gone up by 14 points, it would have changed the game  completely."  </P> <P> After the interception, Manning drove the Mustangs 84 yards for the tying  score. He six of eight passes on the drive, including a nine-yard touchdown  pass to Julian Ford with 52 seconds left in the half.  </P> <P> The Mustangs made numerous mistakes through most of half. They turned the ball  over twice and had 47 yards in penalties.  </P> <P> It was also Manning's mistake that gave the Panthers their touchdown. On a  second down play from the Mustang 17, Manning tried to hit Ford with a short  pass. However, Jeff Peterson stepped in front of Ford for the interception,  which he returned 25 yards for a touchdown.  </P></p>

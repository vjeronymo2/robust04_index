			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent takes its cue from early US weakness Weakness on Wall Street lay behind the downturn in some markets during the afternoon session. Reviewing possible developments among European equity markets during the first quarter of 1995, Hoare Govett commented that it expected a recovery, 'but returns are unlikely to be spectacular, despite this year's falls'. The broker overweighted France and the Netherlands on a six-month view. 'Paris has underperformed consistently for the past two years ..(and) although liquidity and politics argue against a near-term overweight position, we feel that these factors are offset by the relatively more defensive nature of the market, in view of the risk of negative earnings surprises in Europe as a whole.' Regarding Amsterdam, Hoare was positive because the market was broadly skewed towards sectors which it favoured, namely consumer, services and financials. Sweden and Italy were put on the underweight list, partly as a consequence of having outperformed the European index in 1994. FRANKFURT pushed higher, the DAX index closing the official session up 2.86 at 2,109.01, having moved in a narrow range of between 2,107.55 and 2,113.85. But the market turned sour later, with the Ibis indicated index falling to 2,097.34. Turnover was DM3.5bn. In a preview of prospects for the German equity market in 1995 Bank Julius Bar said that the biggest danger remained the threat of further rises in US interest rates. 'This will lead to repositioning from the equities market into money market funds in the US and investment capital will be repatriated. The German exchange should also suffer from this withdrawal of liquidity in the first quarter. A more favourable trend is likely to set in starting in the spring when reports from companies make clear that the earnings trend is intact.' Banks were stronger: Deutsche Bank gaining DM2.50 to DM726.50, Commerzbank up DM2.00 to DM332.50, and Dresdner Bank putting on DM1.70 to DM406.70. The chemical sector also gained narrowly: Bayer rose DM1.80 to DM361.60, BASF up 20 pfennings to DM318.00, and Hoechst DM2.00 to DM332.00. AMSTERDAM gave up most of Tuesday's gains, with the AEX index down 3.15 at 414.81, after reaching a session high of 418.94. Unilever, down 30 cents at Fl 206, said that it had reached an agreement with Danone of France to buy its 60 per cent stake in a Spanish frozen foods company. Unilever said that it would have full management control and that the stake would eventually be increased. ING, off Fl 1.00 at Fl 82.10, confirmed that it had not been invited for talks on acquiring Hungary's state-owned Budapest Bank. Rodamco fell Fl 1.30 to Fl 47.20 after the group said that it might drop its optional tax free dividend next year. PARIS was affected by the US story and the CAC-40 index fell 28.15 to 1,927.83, once again in very low turnover of FFr2bn. EuroDisney, up 20 centimes to FFr11.55, was heavily traded after confirming that attendances were showing a steady improvement. ZURICH ended lower in a quiet session. The SMI index lost 17.3 to 2,656.2. Holderbank was affected by what brokers described as UK selling on worries about its exposure in Mexico, the bearers falling SFr24 to SFr1,006 and the registered SFr8 to SFr199.00. Zurich Insurance bearers dipped SFr5 to SFr1,255 following Tuesday's announcement of a co-operation deal with Sweden's Trygg-Hansa. MILAN was pulled lower by profit-taking, leaving the Comit index down 3.59 at 634.09. Smith New Court, issuing a long-term buy note on Fiat, off L135 to L5,960, said that its valuation indicated a price target of between L6,800 and L7,300, indicating a 20 to 25 per cent upside from current levels. Positive factors for the car group included the strong advantage it derived from the devaluation of the lira, its low industrial debt/equity ratio, the prospect of new models and new markets boosting sales further, and the potential disposal of some assets providing an additional boost to earnings and cash flow. On the negative side, SMC noted that being a market proxy - representing some 8 per cent of the Comit index - the shares were affected by volatility and political instability in the country. STOCKHOLM saw the Affarsvarlden general index slip 10.9 to 1,463.1. Ericsson, down SKr6 to SKr411, said that it had won an order for the expansion of the mobile telephone network in Jiangsu province, China. Trygg-Hansa B lost SKr0.50 to SKr80 following its announcement of a deal with Zurich Insurance. OSLO moved higher as the All-share index added 3.59 to 655 in high turnover of NKr935m. Brokers remarked that the activity arose from tax-related transactions - investors were exchanging shares with full voting rights for shares with limited voting rights in order to be able to write off their losses while retaining their stakes in the companies. Kvaerner A shares added NKr4 to NKr315, while its free shares closed NKr6 up at NKr317 after it announced that its German shipyard had won a NKr650m contract to build two container vessels.

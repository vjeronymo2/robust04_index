			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: WPP The second coming of WPP has been far more striking than that of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, its great advertising rival. From a low point of Pounds 18m at the end of 1991, WPP's market capitalisation has risen to Pounds 640m. With its share capital due to be increased by 26 per cent next month - as the banks which were left holding preference shares two years ago convert into equity  -that valuation will rise further. Although the placing could be a drag on the share price through the autumn, WPP could end the year with a market capitalisation twice that of Saatchi. Shareholders who suffered massive dilution as part of the financial restructuring will not be celebrating. But fund managers who thought they had seen the last of Mr Martin Sorrell's media conglomerate will have to decide whether to use the share placing as a means of climbing aboard. Judging by yesterday's figures, the foundations for a solid period of earnings growth are in place. Revenue growth of around 4.5 per cent is unspectacular but well up with industry averages, in contrast to Saatchi. The target of 10 per cent operating margins - from 7.3 per cent now - looks within reach. The group's Pounds 280m debt burden also looks less threatening now cash flow is improving and earn-out commitments are tailing off. Plans to float a minority interest in the market research side have been shelved as a result. If WPP can work off more debt and negotiate a better deal on the remainder - it is currently paying the banks a whopping 2 per cent margin over interbank rates - earnings will benefit further. With a sensible capital structure and tight control of costs, advertising need not be the boom-to-bust business of old.</p>

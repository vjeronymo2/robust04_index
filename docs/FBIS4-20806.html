			<p>Members,   Mehri Emerge   <F P=102> 94AF0145C Algiers EL WATAN in French 10 Mar 94 p 1 </F> <F P=103> 94AF0145C </F> <F P=104>  Algiers EL WATAN </F> <F P=105>  French </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial by Salim Ghazi: "The Plot"] </F>   [Text] So what is happening at the National Liberation  Front [FLN]? For several days, judging from all appearances,  Mehri's party has been coping with serious problems with its  base. At least if one believes information that has come in  initially from Biskra, then Skikda, and finally Algiers, a  growing protest movement is reported to be in the process of  taking shape to call the party's current leadership to order.    In Biskra and Skikda, two cities reputed to be solid FLN  bastions, there were many militants who said publicly that they  could no longer recognize themselves in the Mehri team, which  has refused to condemn terrorism, the very team that  assassinated many militants from its base in a cowardly manner.    In Algiers the anger has grown within a provisional  committee  "for the holding of an extraordinary FLN congress" to denounce  the suicidal positions of this same leadership. Most decidedly,  while Mehri continues to distance himself from the government  and sets down conditions to restart the dialogue, the base is  grumbling.    It is true that not all of the FLN's militants have spoken,  but such reactions, coming spontaneously as they do from the  masses, are significant for more than one reason. They convey  the notion that there is a serious difference between the base  and the summit.    Indeed, more democratization is being demanded of a party  that today appears, given its leadership's image, to be  completely overwhelmed by events. If so, then Mehri runs the  risk of paying a high price for his overly refined game, which  has made his once single political party an objective ally of  the obscurantist stripe.    The base, which appears to be asking that the glorious FLN  of  1954-62 be restored to history, wants greater dynamism and a  leadership that is closer to democratic aspirations. It is not  known whether Hamrouche is playing a part in this plot, which  resembles a mini underground revolution waiting to break out  into broad daylight.</p>

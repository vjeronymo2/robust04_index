			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, February 4--The supreme court today  issued contempt notices to the eight top-ranking leaders of the  BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] and its like-minded Hindu  organisations for their alleged involvement in the demolition of  the Babri mosque over a year ago despite the court's order to  protect the disputed structure at Ayodhya.    Taking cognisance of the petition filed by Mr Mohammad Aslam  alias Bhure seeking contempt of court action against the BJP  leaders, including Mr L.K. Advani and others, the chief justice,  Mr Justice M.N. Venkatachaliah, and Mr Justice S. Mohan, granted  three weeks to the alleged contemnors to show cause why [they]  should not be hauled up for violating its orders passed on  November 15, 1991.    In a brief order, the court directed that notices be issued  to the BJP president, Mr Advani, the former president, Dr Murli  Manohar Joshi, the BJP MP [member of Parliament], Ms Uma  Bharati, the Bajrang Dal chief and MP, Mr Vinay Katiyar, the  Shiv Sena MP, Mr Moreshwar Save, the VHP [Vishwa Hindu Parishad]  general secretary, Mr Ashok Singhal, the joint general  secretary, Acharya Giriraj Kishore, and the organisation's  fire-brand, Sadhvi Rithambra.    Already, the then chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Mr Kalyan  Singh, his close aides, including the then district magistrate  and police chief of Ayodhya, had been summoned before the apex  court and were facing contempt of court proceedings. These  proceedings related to the violation of the court's order  against construction of the concrete platform at the state of  the disputed structure and also for their inaction in protecting  the mosque later in December.    As an aftermath of the demolition, riots engulfed the  country, leaving behind several killed and property worth crores  destroyed.    Mr Aslam's counsel, Mr M.M. Kashyap, had submitted that on a  call given by the VHP, the Bajrang Dal, the RSS [Rashtriya  Swayamsevak Sangh] and the BJP in November, kar sewaks had  started converging at the disputed structure site for the sole  purpose to construct the Ram temple there. He had expressed the  apprehension and sought the court's protection for the over  four-century-old mosque.    However, on December 6, two years ago, these kar sewaks from  20 states, who had been trained earlier in the demolition task  at a camp in the outskirts of Ahmadabad, "jumped on the Babri  mosque" and demolished it amid provocative speeches made by the  pro-temple leaders. The then president of the BJP, Dr Joshi, or  Mr Advani did not stop the kar sewaks, the petitioner said.    During their "rath yatra," Dr Joshi and Mr Advani had  mobilised the kar sewaks to execute the "task plan of  demolishing the mosque," Mr Advani had also made inflammatory  speeches during the "rath yatra."</p>

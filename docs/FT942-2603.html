			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: The train running early is late Sir, Does the permanent way have a recurring tendency to temporary derailment? As evidence, may I cite something that we passengers were told by loudspeaker on a long stationary tube train recently? 'We regret to announce You will be running late, Due to an unusual delay. Thank you for travelling On the Central Line. The present delay Was caused because We have been running early.' John Godfrey, 41 Lawford Road, London, NW5 2LG</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (27): Topics in the next issue - Software at work THE Spring 1993 issue of Software At Work will look at: Project management systems. Electronic data interchange (EDI) in the retail business. For both these topics, we are looking for users to interview about the products they use. The hot topic will be rapid application development systems. Project management packages have been around for so long that some doughty de facto 'standards' have emerged. The arrival of PC packages has made this management and resourcing tool available to many more companies. Software At Work's research will cover the entire range, from PC to mainframe offerings. EDI, the paper slayer, has long promised to change the way people do businesss. In retail businesses it offers not only increased efficiency but improved market research. In manufacturing it makes Just In Time techniques a reality. Linked into financial systems, it can cut the ordering and payment cycle. The hot topic: rapid applications development - software tools to write other software - should have sent the programmer productivity rate soaring. With demands for new applications increasing, these tools hold a promise of meeting otherwise impossible deadlines. The two 'user topics' follow the usual pattern of interviewing users of various products: suppliers and users wishing to participate should contact Software At Work (see address below) for the relevant forms, as soon as possible, in writing please, and stating which section is of interest. The Software at Work writing team would also like to invite companies to tell us how they are using software in many other areas: see details on page 20 for topics covered in previous issues; plus a provisional schedule for the coming year. Write to: Software at Work, Surveys Secretary, Financial Times, Number One, Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL.</p>

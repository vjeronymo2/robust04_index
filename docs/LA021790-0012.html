			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CBS SUSPENDS ANDY ROONEY  </P> <P> CBS was totally correct in its timely response to the remarks attributed to  Rooney if for no other reason than to solidify its policy of condemning those  who preach hate and promote bigotry without concern about the consequences or  having to answer for their actions.  </P> <P> Although I am African American and have had my share of prejudicial experiences  resulting from the biased attitudes that are so prevalent in our society, I am  unable to disagree entirely with the remarks by Rooney. Yet, realizing how  deep-rooted the practices are to draw conclusions that all African American  people fall into the category of school dropouts, pregnant, drug users, I have  no choice but to consider such demeaning comments as insulting racial slurs and  agree that CBS took the proper action and set an example that others need to  follow.  </P> <P> JOHN ViDAHL  </P> <P> Windsor Hills  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Daniel Balan: "Colonel Mihai Lupu Is the New </F> Chief of Counterintelligence Division"]    [Text] The newly appointed chief of the  Counterintelligence Division of the Romanian Intelligence  Service [SRI] is Colonel Mihai Lupu, a professional of the  secret services.    Lupu has worked most of his career at Military Unit 0544  (Foreign Information Directorate) both at the headquarters and  outside the Directorate.    In 1983, he was appointed chief of the Directorate and  deputy  chief of Military Unit 0110, which was led by General Victor  Niculicioiu. The unit, one of the most efficient in the former  State Security Department [DSS], was in charge of  counterintelligence in the former USSR area and the other  socialist countries. General Niculicioiu's other deputy was  Colonel Vasile Ionescu, who was transferred to reserve duty  after the 1989 December events.    Colonel Mihai Lupu excelled in the counterintelligence  structures because of his experience at the Foreign Information  Directorate but also because he is considered a very  well-informed person about the methods of the secret services in  the former socialist countries.    After the establishment of the SRI, he worked in the  counterintelligence Division and was General Gheorghe  Diaconescu's deputy.</p>

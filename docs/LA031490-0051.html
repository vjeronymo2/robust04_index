Benjamin Britten's 1947 opus -- based on Andre  Obey's play, Shakespeare's poem and Livy's history -- will be staged by  Christopher Alden. Stephen McCarthy, LBO administrative director, said 50% of  the April 1 box office will be donated to the agency, allowing the financially  strapped opera to cover its costs. SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Probe into share trade allegations Japanese financial authorities have started an investigation into suspected insider trading by employees of a leading drug company based in western Japan. Ten officials of Nippon Shoji, an Osaka-based drug manufacturer and wholesaler listed on the Osaka Securities Exchange's second section, are being investigated by the exchange over alleged sales of 50,000 shares in the company, before the Health and Welfare Ministry announced the deaths of three patients using the company's herpes and shingles drug last October. The executives are alleged to have gained Y150m (Pounds 961,000) by selling on information of the deaths, three days ahead of the ministry's announcement.</p>

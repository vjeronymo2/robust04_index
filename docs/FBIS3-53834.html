Speaking to reporters today, al-Turayfi said that an  agreement on the transfer of four of these functions was reached  at a meeting yesterday evening. These functions are: public  works, natural preservations, arable land registration in Gaza,  and civilian matters.    The Palestinian official added that no agreement has been  reached so far on the transfer of 13 functions. They will be  discussed during the next sessions.    Al-Turayfi noted that the Civilian Affairs Committee today  began its discussion on the issue of transferring the water  board authority from the Israeli to the Palestinian side. He  believes that it will not be easy to reach an agreement on this  matter in a single session.    Al-Turayfi affirmed that all the functions on which  agreements were reached have been put in writing and signed by  both sides.    Replying to a question on issuing Palestinian identification  cards, he said that the committee has not completed its  discussion of the issue and that it will be discussed during the  next sessions. He noted that the committee will continue its  works until Thursday evening.    In another development, 'Ami Gloska, official spokesman for  the Israeli delegation, has stated that the two sides still  disagree on certain points and that it is hard to tell when the  talks will conclude.    Amnon Shahaq, Israeli deputy chief of staff and chairman of  the Israeli delegation to the Gaza-Jericho Committee, said that  there are essential differences between the two sides on the  points the Security Committee is discussing, particularly the  issue of the crossing points. He said that the talks will  continue until tomorrow evening in an attempt to resolve these  differences.</p>

In the Kuzbass, where you were nominated for president and  where miners have been your constant support, an extreme  economic and political emergency has taken shape.    You know that it is connected with the stoppage of  enterprises, reciprocal nonpayments, the nonfulfillment of your  edicts and instructions, and unemployment. People have been  unable to get their wages for five months. There is a wild,  uncontrolled increase in prices. And most important, people are  not protected from the rampage of crime, they live in fear of  their lives in the full sense of the word.    My frequent appeals to the government and to you personally  are left without proper attention. Unless urgent and effective  steps are taken right now, the most terrible thing -- a general  strike -- could occur in the Kuzbass. In terms of its strength  it would be the 1989 strike, in which you took part, but  squared. If it is allowed it will deal a terrible blow to the  Russian economy because the lack of coal will bring everything  to a standstill.    My conscience is clear. I have done everything I could to  warn of this social eruption when I was chairman of the oblast  soviet before you dissolved the representative organs. As God  is my witness people's demands are entirely just; the miners did  not go on strike in 1989 in order to live in poverty and fear,  experiencing every day the violation of human rights. I support  the Kuzbass people's demands and, of course, I shall be with  them.    I appeal to you once again as president to take urgent and  effective steps, including those I have suggested and which are  at present in the hands of your apparatus.    [Signed] Federation Council Deputy A. Tuleyev</p>

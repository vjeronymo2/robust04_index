			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTDOOR LIVING;  </P> <P> ALFRESCO FEAST;  </P> <P> A BACK-YARD ROTISSERIE MEANS COOLER COOKING -- EVEN FOR ROAST LEG OF LAMB  </P> <P> Now foods that require longer, slower cooking can move outdoors. The newest  patio "entertainment centers" serve as mini-kitchens and feature rotisseries,  covered grills and indirect heat (a method in which meat or poultry is roasted,  over a drip pan, by heat sources on either side). Some elaborate setups even  have sinks and refrigerators. One of the benefits of these sophisticated  cooking centers is that, weather permitting, virtually all food preparation can  move to the back yard. Best of all, the new units let you cook a roast -- a  long, hot job in a regular oven -- without raising the temperature in the  house.  </P> <P> Roasts cooked on an outdoor rotisserie are crispy on the outside; yet the meat  remains moist. This is especially true of a boneless leg of lamb stuffed with  curried dried fruit, then marinated and basted with a Sauvignon Blanc-based  marinade. To ensure succulence, check internal temperature during the final 30  minutes of cooking.  </P> <P> Whole onions can be roasted along with the meat, either tucked into the coals  or in the drip pan. Remove any loose skins, but don't peel or cut the onions.  Roast about one hour or until tender, turning several times.  </P> <P> OPEN-AIR FARE  </P> <P> Roasted Onions  </P> <P> Basmati Rice Pilaf  </P> <P> Stuffed Lamb  </P> <P> Tossed Salad with Vinaigrette  </P> <P> (arugula, butter lettuce, escarole, mache,radicchio)  </P> <P> Fresh Fruit  </P> <P> Fruit Ices  </P> <P> Sauvignon Blanc  </P> <P> STUFFED LEG OF LAMB  </P> <P> 1 (8-ounce) package mixed dried fruit, coarsely chopped  </P> <P> Curry powder  </P> <P> 1 cup water  </P> <P> 1 (5- to 6-pound) boneless leg of lamb  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> 2 cups Sauvignon Blanc  </P> <P> 1/3 cup olive oil  </P> <P> Juice of 1 lemon  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons honey  </P> <P>  1/2 teaspoon ground cumin  </P> <P> 1 cup minced onions  </P> <P> 2 cloves garlic, minced  </P> <P> Cayenne pepper  </P> <P> Combine dried fruit, 1 teaspoon curry powder and water. Let stand at least 30  minutes.  </P> <P> Lay leg of lamb out flat, fat side down. Pound with meat mallet to flatten  slightly and form rectangle. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Drain any excess  water from fruit and reserve for marinade, then spread fruit over lamb. Roll up  meat and tie tightly with string in both directions at about 1-inch intervals.  </P> <P> Combine wine, olive oil, lemon juice, honey, 2 teaspoons curry powder, cumin,  onions and garlic in large bowl. Add reserved water and season to taste with  salt, pepper and cayenne. Place roast in marinade and marinate 1 to 3 hours.  </P> <P> Remove roast from marinade and secure on rotisserie spit rod. Roast meat  according to manufacturer's directions to desired degree of doneness (135  degrees for rare, 150 degrees for medium).  </P> <P> Place marinade in saucepan and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer 10  minutes. Use marinade to baste lamb during roasting. Reheat marinade and serve  as sauce. Makes 8 servings.  </P> <P> BASMATI RICE PILAF  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon butter  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon oil  </P> <P> 1 cup basmati rice  </P> <P>  1/2 cup minced onion  </P> <P> 1 3/4 cups chicken stock  </P> <P>  1/2 cup toasted almonds  </P> <P>  1/2 cup plumped golden raisins  </P> <P>  1/2 cup sliced green onion  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> White pepper  </P> <P> Heat butter and oil in medium saucepan. Add rice and onion and saute several  minutes, stirring constantly, until rice is lightly browned.  </P> <P> Add chicken stock, cover and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer 25 to 30  minutes or until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed. Stir in almonds,  raisins and green onion. Season to taste with salt and white pepper. Makes  about 4 cups.  </P> <P> Food styling by Stephanie Puddy; prop styling by Robin Tucker; tableware from  Crate &amp; Barrel.  </P></p>

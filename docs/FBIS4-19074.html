			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "SDP Wants To Have More Active </F> Employment Policy"]    [Excerpt] The SDP [Social Democratic  Party] envisages a sustainable economic growth containing a  job-creation element. The economy's future and employment must  be supported through a broadly conceived program for adult  education and an active labor market policy. To reduce  unemployment a decision is needed which is based on voluntarism  and on agreement among the labor market parties. This is what  the SDP said in a motion on jobs policy which the party  delegates approved in its meeting on Wednesday [16 March].    In its 21-point employment stimulus program, the SDP  promises  100,000 new jobs or training slots this year. It is estimated  that state funding should be increased by 2.5 billion [markkas].  This would increase the pressure for added borrowing this year,  but lead to decreased expenditures in coming years.    A low interest rate would be the main goal for monetary  policy.    An investment program targeting improvements in  transportation, education, research, and product development as  main areas would be sought.    Taxation must be quickly eased to increase domestic demand.  The tax rate for workers and pensioners must be reduced by at  least 1.5 percent.    The reform with the value-added tax should be delayed to  improve employment prospects in the private sector.    To ease unemployment in the construction sector there should  be spending on renovating residences.    An increased effort in adult education and a guaranteed  subsidized job after 500 days of unemployment are other SDP  model proposals.    Unemployment compensation must be converted from the system  of passive subsidies to one with a more active job protection.    With regard to incomes policy, the demands for solidarity  and  competitiveness must be combined. In wage pacts there must be a  goal-directed attempt to improve the employment situation.    The possibilities of taking training or sabbatical leave for  periods of three to 12 months must be facilitated, on condition  that an unemployed worker can be hired through this.

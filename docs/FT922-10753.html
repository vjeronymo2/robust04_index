			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Jobs: The main reasons why so many want out - Study of workers intending to move reveals disheartening view of employers' concern for people WHAT makes people decide to go to a new employer? The question is prompted by something the Jobs column first reported three weeks ago while discussing the recession's effect on British workers' attitudes as shown by two surveys made by the Wyatt consultancy, the original in 1988 and a follow-up late last year. One of the most striking changes since the good times of 1988 - and the one I'm particularly concerned with - is a sharp rise in the proportion of people intending to find a new job as soon as the employment market allows. But as not everyone reading today will have been in the congregation three weeks back, I had better recall the context in which the said rise occurred. The main surprise of the findings was of the cheery sort. Admittedly, the out-of-work were excluded, both studies being confined to people with full-time jobs, over 3,000 the first time and 800-plus in the follow-up. Among those who had survived the recession employed, however, morale had improved between the two surveys. There were several signs of a general feeling that cut-backs had left organisations fitter to profit from economic revival. Almost four fifths, compared with three in five before, felt that the quality of their employing concern's products was good, and 57 per cent compared with 45 said that they would re-commend it to other people as a place to work. Personal satisfaction with the job was reported by two thirds, as against 59 per cent. What bugged me, however, was that at the same time the share intent on changing employers had leapt from 13 per cent to 23. So borrowing Wyatt's breakdowns of the responses to the 99 survey questions, I began examining why so many recession-pounded people should itch to be up and away. The first thing they called to mind was that maxim of the 1914-18 trenches: 'If you knows of a better 'ole, go to it.' Clearly, while folk wanting out in such circumstances must be dissatisfied where they are, their urge can be either positively or negatively motivated. In the positive case, the new hole is sought because it is en-visaged as better in being not just more congenial, but favourably sited for personal advance. In the negative case, the sole reason for seeking the new hole is the belief that a blockbuster is going to land on the present one any minute. Accordingly, I picked out of the consultancy's data three topics on which dissatisfaction would seem apt to give people the positive idea that they'd do better elsewhere. The trio are the opportunities for promotion in the present outfit, its record in selecting the right people to promote, and the pay it provides by comparison with the rates for similar work in other outfits. I also chose one negative spur: anxiety about the longer-term security of the existing job. The result is the table alongside which, for each of the four topics, compares the percentages declaring themselves unhappy most recently with those who did likewise in 1988, together with the shares intending to move. After giving the overall figures at the top, the table breaks them down by sex, age, length of time with the current organisation, and its sector of activity. As may be seen, on the first positive prompter - opportunities for promotion  -dissatisfaction largely worsened between the two dates. Only in three cases was there an opposite swing: people with three to five years' service, and in central government and state-owned operations such as British Rail and public education. Even so, opinions on employers' propensity to promote the right people shifted the other way. An improvement was registered in all groups except manufacturing and 'other service' employees showing no change, and 16- to 24-year-olds and those with five to 10 years service who saw things as worse. Much the same applied also to views on pay-levels as compared with rates elsewhere. All showed at least some improvement apart from manufacturing folk, again with no change, and four opposite movers: the 45-54 age group, those with 10-20 years service, and local government and other service staff. Hence it appears that, on the whole, my three positive pointers contributed at best very little to the increase in intentions to be up and off. But there's no ambivalence whatever on the negative pointer. Anxiety about current job security has risen all round  - suggesting that the main appeal of a new hole nowadays is less the expectation of its being better than the belief that it could hardly be worse. Moreover, that interpretation is confirmed by a special study kindly made by Wyatt of all the ways in which the people intent on moving differed from those who were not. Besides feeling less secure in their present post, markedly more of the would-be leavers viewed their workplace's procedures as not making sense, let alone allowing them to do their job well. They also saw their organisation as quite the reverse of interested in its employees' well being, or in treating them with respect and dignity, or in giving them chances to use their particular skills. In short, the main factors linked with the wanderlust are thoroughly negative. So the fact that the latest survey showed nearly a quarter of workers wanting out, is something of which Britain's employers surely ought to be ashamed.</p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POSITIONING OF STORIES ON MARTIN IS QUESTIONED  </P> <P> I found the article describing Billy Martin's IRS problems together with an  account of his funeral in exceptionally poor taste.  </P> <P> While Martin may have had his personal problems, he nevertheless brought much  color to the game of baseball. He certainly deserved more dignity in death than  The Times accorded him.  </P> <P> NANCY SPIRE, Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

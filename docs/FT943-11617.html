			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Technology: Breast cancer under the needle - Worth Watching Women with suspected breast cancer usually undergo surgical biopsies, which can leave scarring. A technique based on technology developed for Nasa's Hubble space telescope allows the biopsy to be performed with a needle rather than a scapel, leaving a small puncture wound rather than a scar. The technique allows the abnormality to be located by an X-ray imaging device which takes digital images of the suspected mass from two different angles. A computer calculates the co-ordinates of the abnormality, after which the sample is extracted with a needle. X-rays have been used before to locate suspected abnormalities. However, the time needed to take the pictures, develop the film and locate the co-ordinates of the abnormal tissue method takes about 15-20 minutes. The digital imaging device is quicker, gives a higher-quality image and exposes patients to half the radiation of the conventional X-ray method. Nasa: US, 202 358 0000.</p>

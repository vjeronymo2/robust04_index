			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Appointments: Ling moves along Philip Ling, who led the growth by acquisition of Haden MacLellan Holdings, has stepped back into the role of non-executive chairman. The change in his status at the industrial holding company is accompanied by the promotion of his long-time partner Mel Hawley from managing director to chief executive. Ling, 45, says he had been kept busy when the company was being built up, 'but I have not been that involved in actually running it. Mel has been doing that anyway.' As the transactions had thinned out, he had taken on more outside interests. These included non-executive directorships at P-E International, Emess and Ibstock Johnsen, as well as investments in small private businesses. He and Hawley first teamed up in 1982 at London and Midland Industrials. LMI was taken over by Williams Holdings, but Ling bought back some of its subsidiaries. Haden MacLellan was formed in October 1987 with the merger of Haden and Haleworth with the quoted P&amp;W MacLellan. The 1987 crash roughly halved the share price but it then rose for two years, to a high of 257p. The waning of the share price - down to 107 1/2 p last night - has limited the scope for acquisitions.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TIMES ORANGE COUNTY POLL;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS NOT MAKING THE GRADE, MOST RESIDENTS SAY  </P> <P> Orange County residents give their public schools a mediocre report card, with  more than half rating them a C or below in a poll for the Times Orange County  Edition.  </P> <P> But the schools received better ratings in the poll from parents with  school-age children -- the group educators say is most familiar with the  schools. In that group, 55% gave the schools As or Bs.  </P> <P> The survey also asked residents to rate Orange County schools on a variety of  programs and problems. Schools received their best rating in teaching computer  education but their lowest in teaching values and ethics. The biggest concern  about schools today was drug and alcohol abuse by students, according to those  polled.  </P> <P> "Compared to inner-city schools, obviously the schools are rated pretty well  here," said Mark Baldassare, who conducted the poll. "But when you think of the  wealth that exists in Orange County, and the high education of the population  here, these are rather average grades for a group of people who certainly  expect more than average for their own children."  </P> <P> Of the 600 Orange County residents polled Aug. 6-8, only 7% gave the public  schools an A. Thirty-five percent gave them a B; 40% a C; 8% a D, and 3% an F.  </P> <P> But of the 200 or so parents asked what grade they would give public schools in  their area, 11% gave them an A; 44% a B; 32% a C; 7% a D and 5% an F.  </P> <P> The overall findings are similar to results of a nationwide Gallup Poll  released Aug. 24, which showed that most people would give a B or a C to public  schools.  </P> <P> Local educators said they were surprised there was so little difference overall  in results of the Times Orange County Poll survey and national polls, since  Orange County schools generally score higher on achievement tests, teachers  here tend to express greater job satisfaction and school facilities are better  maintained than in larger urban areas.  </P> <P> "I am a little disappointed because I thought the figures would be higher here  in Orange County," said Cynthia Grennan, superintendent of the Anaheim Union  High School District.  </P> <P> On the other hand, educators say, local schools may have been given the  mediocre rating precisely because Orange County's population is wealthier and  better educated on average than the rest of the nation, according to recent  research. The thinking goes that amid a nationwide trend to demand more from  public schools, Orange County residents may apply an even higher standard to  their public schools than the rest of the nation.  </P> <P> Parents who were polled listed a variety of factors that kept Orange County  schools from rating an A+.  </P> <P> "It's not a bad grade, is it?" asked Judy Simpson of Laguna Niguel, the mother  of two school-age children who gave the public schools a B. "But teachers  gravitate to the good, easy type of students. When you have a more challenging  student with different types of learning problems, they don't react as well."  </P> <P> After much frustration with a South County school that, she said, couldn't cope  with her son's slight learning problem, Simpson decided to put him in a private  school.  </P> <P> Simpson said her main complaint about schools is that taxpayers are not getting  their money's worth. Because of the rapid growth in South County, districts  cannot build new classrooms fast enough.  </P> <P> "They're well-run schools, yet it's inconvenient," she said. "The school almost  went to double session, and people were real disgruntled. This is a high-tech  area; we pay $2,000 a year for property taxes. Why do we have to wait so long  (for new schools to open)?"  </P> <P> Parents who took part in the survey and agreed to be interviewed cited specific  situations with their own children and teachers as reasons for the ratings they  gave. Their examples, educators said, illustrate the importance that parents  place on their relationship with their child's schools and teachers.  </P> <P> But school administrators say the public has demanded more of schools even as  society has become more complex and more ethnically diverse. Meanwhile,  technology has advanced at a faster pace than the schools can keep up with,  they said.  </P> <P> "Schools have been getting a bum rap for years," said Ed Dundon, superintendent  of the Garden Grove Unified School District. "Yet, on the other hand, schools  are also being asked to be educators, doctors, dietitians, priests, preachers,  nurses, jailers and all that kind of stuff. We have to provide health  education, marriage counseling, drug addiction education -- more subjects than  those who answered the survey remember from their school days.  </P> <P> "And then people wonder how there's any time left to teach the three Rs."  </P> <P> But several administrators and school leaders said they consider the poll  results a signal that they need to improve their performance, as well as the  image of schools among the general public, particularly people without children  who also vote on school tax questions.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed, but that doesn't really surprise me," Rudy Castruita,  superintendent of the Santa Ana Unified School District, the county's largest,  said of the mediocre grades given the schools by poll respondents. "If you look  at the criticism education has gone through in the last five or six years,  there would seem to be a cloud hanging over us all over the state, and people  appear not to be pleased.  </P> <P> "But it gives us a real challenge to improve. I'd like to see those Bs and Cs  move to As."  </P> <P> In their own defense, administrators and school officials say they are trying  to improve schools at a time when state funding is severely limited. They also  note that California schools have the largest class sizes in the nation.  </P> <P> Teachers fared better in the survey than schools. Only 13% of respondents said  they were "not satisfied with the quality and training of teachers," while 20%  indicated they were "very satisfied" and 55% "somewhat satisfied."  </P> <P> More than three-fourths of the respondents said teachers deserve higher pay,  with 46% saying they should get a "moderate" raise and 32% a "substantial"  raise.  </P> <P> Teachers said they were pleased by the poll's findings on salaries, especially  at a time when the public generally rejects more taxes.  </P> <P> "Everybody likes to receive services for as few dollars out of pocket as  possible," said Jim Harlan, executive director of West Orange County United  Teachers, which represents teachers in five school districts. "Any substantial  teacher pay increase would come out of tax dollars, so I think that says  something when 78% say we should raise salaries."  </P> <P> While 54% of those polled said public schools did an excellent or good job  teaching computer education, less than half thought they were doing an  excellent or good job teaching reading and language, math and science, arts and  culture, thinking and reasoning and teaching children with special needs.  </P> <P> Sixty-two percent of all respondents said they thought the schools were doing a  fair or poor job in teaching values and ethics.  </P> <P> Among parents polled, however, schools got far higher ratings, with 60% of the  parents giving excellent or good ratings for reading and language, and 53%  giving excellent or good ratings for math and science.  </P> <P> In overall ratings, South County respondents gave schools the best grades. In  that group, 11% gave the schools an A, while 39% gave them a B, and 36% a C.  </P> <P> One possible explanation comes from a previous Baldassare poll for the Times  Orange County Edition, which shows that South County residents overall are more  content with their life styles than residents elsewhere in the county.  </P> <P> In the August poll on education issues, more than half of the respondents in  the central, western and northern parts of the county gave a C or lower to the  schools. One respondent offered an explanation.  </P> <P> "I'm very displeased with the system," said Maria Patterson of Santa Ana, whose  daughter attends a junior high school in the Garden Grove Unified School  District. "We have lived in Orange, in Costa Mesa and in Santa Ana, and the  worst school is this one.  </P> <P> "If my daughter was late a few minutes (at her former schools), they would call  me to ask about it," Patterson said. "Here, they don't care. . . . I went and  talked with one of her counselors to see if she needed to go to summer school,  and they said somebody would get in touch with me, but they never did. So to  me, they don't care."  </P> <P> </P> <P> How the Poll Was Conducted  </P> <P> The Times Orange County Poll, consisting of interviews with 600 adult county  residents, was conducted Aug. 6-8. The survey was taken on weekend days and  weekday nights using a random sample of listed and unlisted telephone numbers.  </P> <P> The margin of error for a sample of this size is plus or minus 4%. For  subgroups, the margin of error is higher. The margin of error for a subgroup  such as the approximately 200 parents with children in school, for example, is  plus or minus 7%.  </P> <P> All respondents were guaranteed anonymity. However, some of those who agreed  were later interviewed again for news stories on the poll.  </P> <P> The poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates of Irvine.  </P> <P> OPEN ENROLLMENT  </P> <P> Orange County residents overwhelming favor allowing children to attend any  public school their parents choose.

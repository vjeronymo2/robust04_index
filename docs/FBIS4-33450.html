			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Manuel Cano Iglesias from Camaguey Province for </F> the "Doing Radio" newscast]    [Text] We would like to report the sugar harvest resumed in  Camaguey Province when the Noel Fernandez Central's machinery  was started in Minas Municipality. The central's mills were  started after the recent torrential and extended rains. The  central will also receive raw material from areas around the  Brazil and Sierra de Cubitas Centrals, and zones where the rain  has not delayed the harvest so much.    Within the strategy, work is also underway in complexes  located in the central and southern part of the province. Some  of them will thus participate in the mill work by receiving  sugarcane from their own areas and from neighboring areas.  Within the principle of cutting sugarcane wherever possible and  sending it to whichever central can mill it, Camaguey sugarcane  workers have resumed the harvest operations because they are  aware of the importance of contributing as much as they can for  the country's economy.</p>

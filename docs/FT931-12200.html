			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems urge tax commitment THE LIBERAL Democrats yesterday urged the government to say it would be ready to see taxes rise in future and would temporarily increase public borrowing to finance a job creation programme. Mr Alan Beith, the party's Treasury spokesman, said such an announcement by ministers would reassure the markets, and international investors in particular, that they were serious about reducing the deficit, thus enabling the government to borrow more. Mr Beith, making a clear distinction between borrowing for current spending and for investment, said that acting now to cut unemployment would mean lower borrowing in future. He called on the government - as proof of its financial rectitude - to drop its promise to cut the basic rate of income tax to 20p. The Liberal Democrats urged the government to adopt its 'Action for Jobs' package in the Budget. Mr Beith doubted the effectiveness of short-term tax incentives. In his experience business preferred to be confident about stability. The package of measures would amount to just under an extra Pounds 4bn in borrowing, including projects such as a training programme (Pounds 750m) and investment in housing (up to Pounds 1bn). The party believes that its plans would mean that 350,000 fewer people would be unemployed by April 1994. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, accused the government of complacency and believing its own propaganda, and said that the 'dash for growth' had petered out in the face of the recent rash of bad economic news. The party's proposals also criticise the Labour idea of a 'windfall' tax on the profits of privatised utilities, arguing that it could reduce infrastructure projects and cost jobs.</p>

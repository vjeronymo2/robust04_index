			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Rustam Narzikulov report: "Shushkevich Has Been Converted </F> Into the Ruble"]    [Text] On the evening of 26 January the Belarusian  parliament realized the second of the two possible options for  creating political conditions for the upcoming signing of the  treaty with Russia on merging the monetary systems.    The first was that the parliament, in opposition to its  speaker, was going to declare integration into a confederation  with Russia. Implementation of this option, however, would have  called for considerably greater organizational efforts and  moreover a positive result would not have been guaranteed,  because the Russian Federation leadership would have hardly  agreed to the political merging of the two states. "Friends  from Moscow" advised acting according to the "if there is no  man, there is no problem" principle.    Apparently it was much easier to "remove" Stanislav  Shushkevich, reanimating the old charges of corruption, than  immediately to renounce statehood. The Lithuanian services,  which spirited away Burokyavicius and Yermolavicius, came very  handy as a cause for the resignation of the Belarusian speaker.    Thus the "problem of Shushkevich," who did not show  enthusiasm over the merging of the monetary systems and  therefore introduced a certain element of embarrassment into  bilateral relations, has been resolved and the Russian prime  minister can now go to Minsk in early February is a tranquil  state of mind, fearing no complications.    The protests by Mr. Bagdankevich, chairman of the Belarus  National Bank, can be discounted because he is obligated to  carry out the decision by the republic's parliament. This also  goes for the small deputies opposition.    Strange as it might seem, only Russia stands to gain from  this course of events. If the naive Belarusian ex-communists  think that they will be using the ruble on a par with the  Russian citizens, they are grossly deluded.    In spite of Viktor Gerashchenko's great passion for  supporting national and CIS production by "nonmonetary methods  of fighting inflation," he has enough sense of measure to  prepare the treaty on merging the monetary systems in such a way  that its practical implementation depends on concrete technical  accords. Therefore even with the accepted exchange rate of "one  zaychik [Belarus currency] for one ruble," Belarus will hardly  get the 1.6 trillion rubles owed it, as is apparent from the  treaty. Even Mr. Gerashchenko did not consider it possible to  grant it almost the entire second tranche from the IMF ($1.5  billion) out of his tender affection for the former USSR  brothers.    Signs are that so far the "merging" will be reduced to an  extremely slow and agonizing procedure of exchanging the bills,  which will substantially nullify any gain for the Belarusians.  A similar picture can now be observed in Tajikistan, which has  been in the ruble zone for two months now. The exchange of old  Soviet rubles for new Russian ones is accompanied by so many  restrictions (the population, for instance, is issued bills with  denominations not higher than 500 rubles) that Russia is hardly  feeling the effects of inflation imported from Central Asia.    Incidentally, the main reason for Shushkevich's and  Bogdanovich's doubts about the expediency of entering the ruble  zone was not their hypertrophied sense of sovereignty but the  well-founded suspicions that they will be "fooled."    SEGODNYA has evidence indicating that Belarus will be  confronted with something very much like the Tajik model. If  the idea of quiet sabotage of the treaty is implemented, its  results (political and economic) will have to be recognized as  far from the worst possible for Russia.    A feature of the Russian Federation Government in recent  years, however, has been that its course of action can be  reversed within just one day. Therefore there are no guarantees  that the top leadership of the Central Bank and the Council of  Ministers is not playing its own game, unknown to outsiders, and  that a few months later a new state formation will not emerge --  a Russian-Belarusian confederation. In this event the already  unhealthy Russian economy will have to feed a neighbor with a  population of 10 million.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mikulas Duray and Stefan Pasztor, representatives of  the Hungarian minority in Slovakia, continue to refuse to  postpone the Komarno 8 January meeting of deputies and mayors  who are to debate the possibility of setting up in southern  Slovakia a region with a special legal status.    There is no reason to change anything, Komarno Mayor Stefan  Pasztor said in an interview with CTK. Problems remain and we  need a joint stance of a large number of people. At the same  time he assured that the meeting will be held in accordance with  the law on petitions.    Matica Slovenska [Slovak cultural institution] officials  yesterday appealed for the meeting in Komarno to be cancelled.  In their opinion, the meeting endangers the territorial  integrity of the Slovak Republic. They also demanded that a law  on the protection of the republic be adopted.    Mikulas Duray reckons that it will be not possible to push  through the demands of the Hungarian minority under the present  government. However, he considers a Hungarian self-governing  region, where minority Slovaks would enjoy the same status as do  the Hungarians within the Slovak majority, on a reciprocal  basis, to be a realistic long-term objective.</p>

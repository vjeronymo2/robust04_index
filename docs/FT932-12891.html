			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Attali under attack at EBRD meeting MR JACQUES ATTALI, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, was yesterday subjected to severe criticism from the countries that had set up the bank. In the opening session of the bank's annual meeting, governor after governor admonished it to exercise better control over costs after recent reports of extravagance in the fitting out of the EBRD's new London headquarters. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister and current chairman of the board of governors, delivered only a light rap on the knuckles in the course of the opening ceremony. But other ministers were more outspoken. Representing the only country that had voted against the EBRD's headquarters' budget, Mr John McDermid, the Canadian minister of state for finance and privatisation, said the EBRD should set an example. Fiscal restraint was essential if private sector development was to be fostered in former communist countries, Mr McDermid said. 'Our public institutions must play a part both as agents for change and as examples of an appropriate role for government in economic development. In this connection, EBRD must always be conscious of its responsibilities as a public institution.' Mr McDermid said it was 'essential for the bank to be a leader in promoting efficiency and financial probity'. Canada would work with other members of the bank and its management to ensure that expenditure was kept under control, and 'if warranted, that appropriate remedial measures are taken'. He said: 'Our taxpayers expect no less.' Mr Roger Altman, deputy US Treasury secretary, expressed concern at reports of extravagant spending at the bank. Later he told journalists it was clear that some tightening of internal controls at the EBRD was required. While he said the US believed the bank 'was doing very important work' and that the US was 'not unhappy' with the bank, he failed to say the same of Mr Attali when asked whether he would use the same words about the EBRD president. Ms Helle Degn, the Danish minister of development co-opera tion, who spoke on behalf of the European Community, said the recent information on the bank's spending had been 'a great concern for all of us'. Mr Attali said recent criticisms had 'provided constructive lessons for the bank and for me'. He recalled the bank had decided on some organisational changes. 'I shall carefully oversee their rigorous implementation.' Earlier, Mr Major had delivered a more coded message. After briefly praising the EBRD for generating projects worth Pounds 7.9bn, he said that it must go about its task 'in the most cost effective way possible, ensuring value for taxpayers' money'. Mr Waigel said 'careful handling by the bank of the resources entrusted to it was 'absolutely essential.' Pledge on change, Page 3</p>

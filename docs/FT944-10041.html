			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / International Company News: Solid sales growth lifts Astra A strong rise in sales enabled Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, to lift pre-tax profits by 25 per cent to SKr7.2bn (Dollars 985m) in the first nine months. Sales of the group's two main drugs, Losec and Pulmicort, rose faster than the market average, enabling it to maintain the growth record which has made it Sweden's top company by market capitalisation. It said the favourable earnings trend would continue in the final quarter, although not at the same rate as last year because of a less favourable currency impact. Its A shares rose SKr1 to close at SKr193. Underlying sales were 22 per cent higher at SKr20.06bn, well ahead of estimated market growth of around 4 per cent. Although operating profits were up 40 per cent at SKr6.95bn, a sharp drop in financial income to SKr265m from SKr747m held back the performance at the pre-tax level. The group has been hit by up to SKr200m in unrealised bond losses. Losec, Astra's blockbuster anti-ulcer drug, lifted sales by 36 per cent to SKr6.87bn, against estimated market growth of 10 per cent. Including sales through licensees, sales reached SKr12.9bn. Losec, the world's second best selling drug worldwide after Glaxo's Zantac, received regulatory approval in the third quarter for long-term therapy in Australia, Finland and Canada. There was also a strong performance from the anti-asthma drug, Pulmicort, where sales rose 19 per cent to SKr2.69bn. Astra last week agreed to pay Dollars 820m to US drugs group Merck for a 50 per cent stake in a new venture that will market Losec and other Astra products.</p>

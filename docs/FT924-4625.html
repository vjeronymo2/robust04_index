			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (6): The rise and fall of the Fairfax dynasty CORPORATE CANNIBALS: THE TAKING OF FAIRFAX by Colleen Ryan and Glenn Burge William Heinemann Australia, ADollars 34.95, 457 pages BEFORE Rupert Murdoch there was another, grander, Australian newspaper dynasty. For more than 150 years, the Fairfax family wielded the sort of power enjoyed for briefer periods by Northcliffe and Beaverbrook in Britain and by William Randolph Hearst in the US. It was staunchly conservative, retaining its trust in God, royalty and empire long after many of its more egalitarian countrymen had begun to look elsewhere for moral guidance. But it allowed its journalists a large measure of intellectual freedom; and while its stewardship of the newspapers was coloured by opposition to the Australian Labor Party, it acted, on the whole, with dignity and honour. By the 1980s, the family controlled two of Australia's leading broadsheets, the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age in Melbourne, as well as the tabloid Australian Financial Review; a chain of television and radio stations; and a large number of provincial newspapers and magazines. All dynasties end eventually, but rarely do they self-destruct in the spectacular fashion achieved by the Fairfaxes. In 1987, after the global stock markets' crash, 'Young' Warwick Fairfax, still in his 20s and a Harvard graduate who thought he understood business, mounted a leveraged buy-out of family shareholders. It was a fiasco. Warwick would have inherited control of the company if he had been prepared to wait for nature to take its course. Instead, he was taken to the cleaners by other members of the family and his own advisers. He paid too much and was unable to service the interest costs on bank debt of ADollars 1.25bn and USDollars 450m of junk bonds. By 1990, Fairfax was placed in receivership by its own directors and fell into the hands of its bankers, principally ANZ and Citibank. Warwick departed to live as a born-again Christian in Chicago. The receivership lasted a year, during which bids were invited to buy the group. There were three main contenders: a Melbourne-based consortium of institutions called Australian Independent Newspapers (AIN); Independent Newspapers, the Irish group owned by Tony O'Reilly, former rugby international and chief executive of Heinz; and Tourang, a consortium consisting originally of Conrad Black, Canadian proprietor of the UK Daily Telegraph group, Kerry Packer, the Australian magazine and television owner, and Hellman and Friedman, a US investment bank. (Murdoch would have liked to bid but was ruled out on competition grounds: he controls about 70 per cent of Australia's daily newspaper circulation). Packer's involvement surprised no one; his family had been a down-market competitor of the Fairfaxes for two generations. His father, Sir Frank, who owned the Daily and Sunday Telegraphs in Sydney, sold them to Murdoch in the 1970s, leaving Kerry free to concentrate on television, and he was able to take part in the Tourang bid so long as any holding in Fairfax stayed below 15 per cent. But no one seemed to believe Tourang's claim that Packer would be a passive shareholder. Fairfax journalists, including Colleen Ryan, campaigned actively against the consortium, as did a wider coalition of journalists, politicians and academics. Some of the opposition was heavy: Malcolm Fraser and Gough Whitlam, the former prime ministers, patched up their differences to claim that an Australian press controlled effectively by Murdoch and Tourang would challenge the sovereignty of parliament. Some was disingenuous: much of the comment in the Fairfax press was presented as a debate on free speech, but was really aimed at forcing Packer out of Tourang. Some was inept: an all-party letter to Bob Hawke, then prime minister, urged him to block any bid which would increase media concentration. The book details the financial and political manoeuvrings which led to Tourang buying Fairfax, giving Black a 15 per cent stake and management control. Tourang was always the favourite to win, mainly because it had an exclusive agreement with the junk bond holders negotiated by Malcolm Turnbull, the Sydney lawyer and merchant banker known best for beating the British government in the Spycatcher case. But it was never easy, and the internal tensions nearly tore the consortium apart before the deal was done. The abrasive Turnbull was forced to resign his directorship after falling out with Dan Colson, Black's Canadian lawyer; and Trevor Kennedy, formerly Packer's right-hand man, was dropped as potential chief executive of Fairfax after Colson and Brian Powers, Hellman's representative in Sydney, decided he was a lightweight. Most damaging of all, Packer was forced to withdraw after the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal announced an inquiry into his relationships with Colson, Powers and Turnbull. The tribunal, which had the power to block the deal if it decided Packer was able to exercise control through associates, acted after reading vitriolic diary notes written by Kennedy. While this was going on, Labor faction leaders squabbled about how to formulate regulations on foreign ownership which would keep out Packer and Black while allowing in the supposedly more compliant O'Reilly. Right up to the eve of the receiver's deadline for bids, Tourang was unaware what level of foreign ownership would be allowed. Ryan and Burge, both Sydney Morning Herald business writers, have produced a comprehensive chronicle of events. But the book suffers from what might be called the Insight curse - that style of journalism pioneered by the British Sunday Times in which reams of extraneous detail are introduced for verisimilitude. People are forever shuffling papers or coming in from gardens rubbing dirt off their hands before taking calls. The authors also dig deep into the cliche basket to bring us ashen-faced stockbrokers, hard-nosed journalists, charming Irish leprechauns and sources who remain adamant. The language is at best infelicitous, at worst, ungrammatical. It is a typical journalists' book, long on detail and short on judgment. If you want to know which merchant banker sat down when and where with which lawyer, Corporate Cannibals will tell you. But it has little to say about whether the campaign against Black and Packer was justified; whether, as often suggested, the Canberra government's media policy was formulated to help Murdoch and disadvantage Fairfax; or whether the frequent changes of the rules on foreign investment reflected the exigencies of a special case or the special difficulties of doing business in Australia. Conrad Black might have had something interesting to say about these points. He once described Australian politicians as 'venal' and the bidding process as 'a long, degrading, grotesque charade.' Not much honour and dignity there.</p>

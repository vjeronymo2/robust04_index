Some of Its  Colleagues Promise To Follow Its Commandments"]    [Text] At yesterday evening's news conference in the  Rossiya Hotel well-known opposition leaders presented a  "Statement by Leaders of Parties and Public Organizations 'On  the Illegitimacy of the Constitution Submitted to the Referendum  by B. Yeltsin.'" In the opinion of the authors of the  statement, the constitution restores an authoritarian system; it  was cooked "in the president's kitchen" and was adopted with  extremely gross violations not only of the 1978 Constitution but  even the 1990 Referendum Law, namely: the election commissions  were formed on the decision of the executive branch; they openly  campaigned in favor of the constitution; and the opposition was  not given access to the media, while the vote count was  conducted incorrectly and with widespread rigging. Therefore  the politicians who had invited the journalists proposed that  the constitution be deemed illegitimate. The Federal Assembly,  however, in their opinion may work, but work only with one goal  -- to approve the law on elections to the Constituent Assembly  which in its turn will adopt a new and "fair" constitution.    The statement was signed by Rumyantsev, Aksyuchits, Pavlov,  Astafyev, and other well-known opponents of the presidential  team representing the National Salvation Front, the  Constitutional Democrats, the Russian People's Union, the  Russian Christian Democratic Movement, and other organizations  of similar orientation. What makes the statement special,  however, according to the meeting's organizers, is not the fact  that it bears a few signatures by newly elected deputies to the  Federal Assembly (for instance, Mr. Baburin) but the promise to  join the signatories given by leaders of the Agrarian Party and  the communists. Thus, according to Mr. Rumyantsev, the  agrarians were among the initiators of working out the document,  while according to Mr. Pavlov, not only communist leader  Zyuganov expressed a wish to sign the document, but even a party  plenary session has already made a corresponding decision.    Therefore, in the opinion of the press conference  organizers,  the first sessions of the State Duma will follow not the  presidential scenario wherein "Mr. Filatov wags his finger to  tell the deputies to engage in organizational matters for two  months" but, to the contrary, they will proceed according to the  plan devised by the authors of the statement. With just a day  to go before the opening of the Duma the opponents of the  Yeltsin team are sure that the objective of many factions and  deputies will be to analyze the question of their own legitimacy  in light of the events of last September-October, which will  naturally come into conflict with the goals of the president's  supporters.    Because as of now, according to Mr. Rumyantsev, we have "a  powerless Duma," this opposition inside it will not immediately  lead to the goals declared in the statement -- the adoption of a  law on the Constituent Assembly and a new, "democratic"  constitution. In these conditions special importance will be  taken on not so much by opposition to the government course in  the Duma as by extra parliamentary struggle wherein a weighty  word will be spoken by politicians not elected as deputies, that  is to say, an overwhelming majority of signatories to the  document that was promulgated to the press.    Such hopes are surely not devoid of certain reason. Even  coming from outstanding parliamentarians of the recent past,  however, they appear rather to be illusions since the movements  represented in the Federal Assembly certainly have their own  cadre plans, including with respect to activity outside the  State Duma. And although the upcoming Duma debates cannot  possibly be called cool, it seems that the factions in  opposition to the government will follow the path proposed by  their colleagues with no deputy mandates precisely up to the  point where their fervor results in an undesirable and  irreversible buildup of pressure in the Duma boiler.</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A CLOTHES CALL;  </P> <P> FASHION: NOMINEES TURN OUT IN AN ASSORTMENT OF STYLES -- FROM ARMANI SUITS TO  BEADED ENSEMBLES.  </P> <P> Minis, micros, long skirts and offbeat tuxedos were the styles favored by the  stars Sunday in Pasadena for the 42nd annual Emmy Awards show.  </P> <P> The awards were presented on a seasonably warm afternoon, but about 300 fans  weathered the heat to gather across Green Street from the Pasadena Civic  Auditorium hours before the festivities began. A "Fear God" banner was  stretched across the area.  </P> <P> The fans went berserk when nominee Delta Burke arrived on the arm of her  husband, actor Gerald McRaney. The Designing Woman showed up slimmed down and  beautiful in a black beaded dress with rose lining. McRaney wore a matching  rose in his lapel.  </P> <P> Reporters, photographers and TV cameramen lined the red carpet leading to the  auditorium and screamed and yelled to get the nominees' attention.  </P> <P> "Alfre!" they screamed at nominee Alfre Woodard. "Over here!"  </P> <P> "Who's your date?" they barked at "Twin Peaks" bad boy Dana Ashbrook. The  attractive woman in the gold-and-black full-length dress was his mother.  </P> <P> "Murphy Brown's" Charles Kimbrough, who was nominated for his role as stuffy  anchorman Jim Dial, was one of the first to arrive. He seemed shocked at the  insanity surrounding him. "I'm excited," he declared to the crowd.  </P> <P> Keenen Ivory Wayans, the Emmy-winning creator and star of Fox's "In Loving  Color," walked up the stairs unrecognized in his sweats and T-shirt.  </P> <P> Also unrecognized was singer Julian Lennon in his sunglasses and  double-breasted striped suit. He was accompanying "Wonder Years" regular Olivia  d'Abo.  </P> <P> Craig T. Nelson and Jerry Van Dyke, both nominees for "Coach," mugged for the  photographers. Nelson wore a black tuxedo embroidered with a big orange eagle  designed by his wife. Van Dyke wore a tux with a short jacket that made him  look more like a bellboy than a nominee.  </P> <P> "Quantum Leap" nominee Dean Stockwell quipped to the crowd that "elves" made  his white tux and bolo tie.  </P> <P> Ted Danson, on the arm of his wife, Casey, looked the winner, which of course  after eight nominations for his performance as Sam Malone, the womanizing  bartender on "Cheers," he was. His co-star and nominee, Kirstie Alley, shed the  tailored suits she wears as Rebecca for a Vicky Tiel leopard-print chiffon  gown.  </P> <P> When the doors of the Pasadena Civic finally opened, the stars ran in quickly.  </P> <P> Two-time winner Candice Bergen stopped long enough for some pictures. "Murphy  Brown" wore a drop-dead Karl Lagerfeld two-piece suit from Fred Hayman. She  scurried up the stairs with her mother, Frances Bergen.  </P> <P> Swept hair seemed to be popular. A very pregnant Marg Helgenberger, named best  supporting actress for "China Beach," wore her red locks swept into a '60s  beehive. She designed her copper shift dress with the show's costume team.  </P> <P> "Is that David Lynch?" shouted a photographer. Lynch, the multinominee and big  loser for "Twin Peaks," casually walked over to the throng. "I feel super," he  said in his James Stewart voice.  </P> <P> Harry Hamlin of "L.A. Law" avoided the reporters as he ran up the stairs with  girlfriend Nicolette Sheridan of "Knots Landing."  </P> <P> Plain and classic, though, was the order of the day. Blair Brown, nominee for  "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd," looked elegant in a black dress with  matching shawl.  </P> <P> The "Twin Peaks" crowd seemed subdued. Kyle MacLachlan in his Armani tux smiled  his best FBI smile for the photographers. On his arm was fiancee and series  co-star Lara Flynn Boyle, who also was wearing an Armani. Joan Chen was a crowd  darling in a makeshift flapper outfit she put together from clothes and  accessories in her closet.  </P> <P> Melanie Mayron of "thirtysomething," who had trouble keeping her dress up last  year, had no trouble this year in designer C.D. Greene's black tank dress with  bolero jacket covered in tiny mirrors. Two-time winner Patricia Wettig looked  radiant in her Armani pant suit. She was escorted by her husband and co-star,  Ken Olin.  </P> <P> Corbin Bernsen's vest was made from Japanese kimonos. Wife Amanda Pays wore a  black-and-white mini.  </P> <P> Jamie Lee Curtis wore a red full-length Armani. Her escort and "Anything But  Love" co-star, Richard Lewis, of course, was wearing black.  </P> <P> "I want to marry you, Fred!" screamed a fan as young tuxedoed Fred Savage and  his mother walked through the crowd. He looked as cute as a button.  </P></p>

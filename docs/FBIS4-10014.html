			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Felipe Patury] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- The five golden diplomats of Finance  Minister-designate Rubens Ricupero are ready to leave the  Planalto Palace annex building and occupy offices on the fifth  floor of Block P of the Ministries Esplanade where their chief  will be installed on 5 April. "But we will not go there with a  tape measure to complain about the size of the offices or to  choose secretaries," diplomat Sergio Danese, 39, warned. Danese  will be responsible for contacts with the press. According to  him, integration with former Minister Fernando Henrique  Cardoso's team is so complete that it has even been established  that Ambassadors Julio Cesar Gomes dos Santos, adviser, and  Synesio Sampaio Goes, chief of staff, will continue at the  Finance Ministry for an indefinite period of transition time.    Sergio Amaral -- Rubens Ricupero refers to Second Echelon  Minister Sergio Silva do Amaral, 49, as "my alter ego." A  mountain bike addict, Amaral practices this sport near his  summer home at Pirenopolis (Goias State), 170 km from Brasilia.  Sao Paulo-born Amaral will be promoted to ambassador before the  end of the year. He was a Planning Secretariat adviser while  Deputy Delfim Netto (Progressive Renewal Party-Sao Paulo) was  finance minister and a foreign debt negotiator during Mailson da  Nobrega's days at the head of the Finance Ministry. He has a  PhD in political sciences from the Sorbonne. He advised Rubens  Ricupero while the latter was in Geneva negotiating with GATT  and while Ricupero was ambassador in Washington. Currently, he  is executive secretary at the Environment Ministry. He will  implement the economic program together with the economic team.    Marcos Galvao -- Marcos Bezerra Abbot Galvao, 35, defines  himself as a New York Potiguar [indigenous group from Rio Grande  do Norte]. He is an ambassador's son, is making fast progress  in his diplomatic career, and is appreciated by his colleagues.  Galvao used to draft former President Fernando Collor's  speeches, and is Ricupero's only adviser not born in Sao Paulo.  Galvao was a student in Ricupero's first class; he was the top  student in his course at the Rio Branco diplomatic school. He  acted as his professor's adviser from 1980-82, but only met him  again at the Environment Ministry. He will be in charge of  writing Ricupero's speeches.    Estanislau Amaral -- Business Administrator Jose Estanislau  do Amaral Souza Neto graduated from Getulio Vargas Foundation  and was top student at the Rio Branco diplomatic school. He  left Itamaraty for one year to help his father-in-law manage a  Sao Paulo group working in the field of sugar and fuel alcohol.  Of the five advisers he knows most about economics, after  Sergio Amaral. While in Brasilia he also became an expert in  human rights. He will help write Ricupero's speeches and advise  him on political matters.    Sergio Danese -- Ricupero's future public relations officer  is a writer. Sergio Franca Danese, 39, has a masters degree in  Ibero-American literature from the University of Mexico. He is  the author of "The True Story of the Dodo Bird," a bestseller  among Ricupero's advisers in its second edition from the  Brasiliense publishing firm. He was also a top student at the  Rio Branco diplomatic school. Danese has worked with Ricupero  for longer than any of the other advisers: from 1981-87. In  addition to literature, Danese likes to operate airplanes,  although he does not have a pilot's license.    Debora Barenboim -- Debora Vainer Barenboim, 34, lived in  Paris between the ages of 18 to 29, and only returned to Brazil  to study at the Rio Branco Institute. During the diplomatic  course she met Danese, to whom she has been married for 14  years. She is a pianist, has worked in the Foreign Ministry's  economic area, and served at two diplomatic posts abroad with  Danese. She will be one of Ricupero's spokespersons before  Congress.

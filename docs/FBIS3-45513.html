			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Circular </F> dated 10 July 1991 announced by the Ministry of Foreign Trade  and Economic Cooperation in Beijing on 5 October 1993: "The  Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Announces a  Circular Formulated by the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations and Trade on the Strict Examination and Approval of  Projects Which Use Foreign Capital To Process Imported Waste  Metals for Reexport"]    [Text] Recently, many localities have sought approval for  projects which use foreign funds to import waste metals for  processing and reexport. In light of the fact that such  projects do not fall under the domain in which the state  encourages foreign investment, the wide area covered by the  projects, and their complicated nature and in order to properly  guide the flow of foreign capital so that it can help national  economic development, such projects must be subject to strict  scrutiny before approval can be granted, and management must be  strengthened. Henceforth, it will not be suitable to grant any  more approvals for the establishment of joint-venture and  cooperative projects that involve the simple dismantling of  metals and determine which are useful for reexport or for the  establishment of foreign-funded enterprises (solely owned  enterprises) that engage in the processing of waste metals.  Various economic and trade commissions (offices and bureaus)  should maintain strict standards in the examination and approval  work.

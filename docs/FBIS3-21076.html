			<p>Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lutz P. Schreiber] </F>   [Text]  <H3>  Innovative Polymers Enhance Competitiveness of Many  Industrial Branches </H3>   Japan and the U.S.A. are increasing their strategic  investments. "Long diffusion times in material development  prevents speedy practical application."    Technologies of 21st Century High-Tech polymers  and fiber- reinforced plastics can significantly contribute to  continued competitiveness of the German industry. For this  reason the Federal Ministry of Research and Technology (BMFT) in  Bonn encourages further development in this field and has  included high-performance polymers as a key technology in its  R.&amp; D. strategy for the 21st century. The German plastics  manufacturers are, however, more skeptical about it.    Innovative materials such as high-performance polymers or  fiber-reinforced ones offer a favorable market outlook not for  the manufacturer only. In addition they also influence the  competitiveness of important groups of users, in some cases  considerably. The Federal Ministry of Research and Technology  has an interest in technologies needed for making and  appropriately processing these materials, and even special  interest because of their major significance for future  developments. In the "Technology at the Beginning of the 21st  Century" study made by the BMFT, progress-oriented use of  specialty polymers is regarded as one of the key technologies on  which the health of the national economy will depend.    Accordingly, the people in Bonn have supported materials  research since 1985 with almost 2 billion DM so far, of this  amount 21.2% for new polymers and 19% for  composites. "There  is no doubt that this has substantially contributed to Germany's  ability to maintain parity in materials research with leaders in  this field, namely the U.S.A. and Japan. The German enterprises  which had very actively participated in this program are today,  unlike in 1985, among the enterprises engaged in most intense  worldwide patent activity covering many areas. The problem is,  however, that a German competence in materials and treatment  technologies can today be found only in "islands of experts",  while a consolidation of the acquired know-how into a  comprehensive network is still lacking.    Evidently various German enterprises assess the market  opportunities and possibilities for high-performance polymers  and composite materials differently than do the people in Bonn.  Following the motto "save whatever there is to save" based on  the then prevailing economic trends, many enterprises have  either withdrawn from this business altogether or are about to  cut back their activities in this field. While at Bayer the  emphasis is entirely on further development of engineering  thermoplastics which can be sold in large quantities, Leverkusen  has discontinued making a number of high-performance materials  such as liquid-crystal polymers (LCP) and composites. Contrary  to original expectations, they claim that the volume of these  specialty materials sold has by far not reached the anticipated  level.    The managers at Hoechst do, however, regard at least  liquid-crystal polymers as a still very interesting group of  materials with a future. Otherwise the Frankfurt people would  certainly not expand their production capacity in the U,S.A.,  even though Peter Gleisberg in the Department of Engineering  Plastics knows that for the time being such a high-performance  material will remain a "niche product" only.    Meanwhile the BASF (Baden Aniline and Soda Works) in  Ludwigshafen seeks its opportunities with high-temperature  thermoplastics. Because according to Doctor Eckard Koch,  plastics expert in the Application Engineering Department for  Thermoplastics at the BASF, the increasing demand for these  materials by the electrical and electronic industry as well as  by the automotive industry will ensure their above average  growth rate in the next few years. As to fiber-reinforced  plastics, on the other hand, Leverkusen just as Bayer  discontinued making them.    While consumption of engineering thermoplastics in West  Europe, Japan, and the U.S.A. increased on the average by about  290,000 tons annually (by 110,000 tons in West Europe alone)  during the 1989-92 period, as reported by Bayer reports, the  demand for specialty polymers increased only from 28,000 tons to  37,000 tons over the 1982-91 period. This was too little to  justify the high cost of their development and production.    "Because of high costs", maintains Dr. Manfred Schneider,  "wherever European enterprises lose or do not to recapture their  leading position in technology they are doomed to permanent  failure. We must nevertheless remain innovative over the entire  range of our activities."    "With specialty products alone the German industry, the  European industry as well, will not be able to hold its position  on the market" adds the chairman of the Bayer Corporation's  board of directors. This means, among others, let us not spread  ourselves too thin. In engineering thermoplastics Bayer sees a  greater potential than in specialty polymers.    As to composite materials, the predictions made in the  beginning of the nineteen eighties proved often to be also far  too optimistic. The euphoria based on those predictions induced  quite a flood of investment. This flood was soon followed by a  more sober approach. Many mistakes had been made in production  capacity and market volume planning. After fiber-reinforced  plastics were particularly hard hit by both the recession and  the end of the cold war (the latter resulting in drastic  cutbacks in the military budget and thus in applications for  these materials), many companies pulled the emergency brake:  they sold their business enterprises in this field.    The reaction of the German-American Multi Dupont Ltd to  these events was exactly the opposite. About one year ago this  company first opened its European development center for  composite materials in Bad Homburg. With an investment of over  30 million DM, this company quite obviously bucked the  prevailing market trend. For top management of the Multi Dupont  Ltd agrees with the BMFT that, despite all the problems  involved, high-performance materials and fiber-reinforced  plastics offer important industries some strategic marketing  advantages.    This can be seen in Japan and in the U.S.A. as well.  According to the MITI, the R.&amp; D. efforts of Japanese  enterprises in these areas will intensify and more than a  constant rate in the coming years. They do, moreover, emphasize  particularly effective efficiency-raising measures and  collaboration strategies internationally as well as nationally.  However, only institutes and enterprises already in strong  position technologically will be accepted as partners.    In terms of R.&amp; D. efforts made to develop new  materials, the  U.S.A. by far surpasses Germany for years already. By developing  new materials, the American industry expects to strengthen its  competitiveness on the international market.    In both countries emphasis is on the system concept and on  intensification of nationwide materials research in a  surrounding of dynamic domestic user industries. Compared with  that, in Germany the innovation process is still too much  focused on basic research and manufacture concludes the  "Evaluation of the Materials Research Program" study made by the  BMFT. According to that study, materials research in this  country continues nonetheless on a high internationally  recognized level. It is however necessary not only to keep it at  this level but also to intensify it in selected strategically  important areas of application for high-performance materials.    New high-voltage ignition cables can be installed in motor  vehicles as well as in oil or gas burners operating at  temperatures from -40C to 200C. Owing to layer of  insulation made from fluorocarbon plastics "teflon" and  "tefzel", these cables are 60% thinner the conventional  ones.    Water-resistant sliding bearings made of "iglidur" have been  developed for duty in very humid air. This composite material,  usable at temperatures up to 230C, consists of a  fiber-reinforced thermoplastic and solid-lubricant inclusions.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Kashmiri militants thwarted INDIAN police yesterday used tear-gas in Srinagar, summer capital of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, to disperse several thousand Kashmiris defying a curfew to support a pro-independence march from the Pakistani side of the disputed Himalayan region. Police said 4,000 demonstrators stoned security forces trying to enforce the indefinite curfew, imposed on Monday before the march started. Pakistani troops this week thwarted volunteers of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) from crossing from the Pakistan-ruled part of Kashmir into the region controlled by India. In Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, Mr Amanullah Khan, the JKLF leader, said he had called off the march to avoid further loss of life. At least three people were killed by police shooting on Wednesday amid pitched battles between militants and Pakistani security forces. 'They told us frankly that anybody who today, tomorrow or the day after tries to cross their barrier would be shot,' Mr Khan said. Pakistan banned the march because it feared an incursion along the United Nations-monitored ceasefire line could lead to another conflict with India, which had ordered troops guarding the line to let no one across.</p>

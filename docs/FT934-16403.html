			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: HK group buys Chinese port HUTCHISON Whampoa, the Hong Kong-based conglomerate controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing, is to dominate further China's container-terminal business by acquiring control of the port of Yantian in Guangdong province. The deal is valued at Rmb3.5bn (USDollars 605m). Hutchison owns 60.5 per cent of Hong Kong International Terminals (HIT), which controls more than 60 per cent of the Hong Kong port's container throughput. The expansion into China is seen as a move to ensure the group's continued monopoly on container business within the Pearl River delta region. Yantian, in the north-east of the colony, is the most commercially viable of the Chinese ports being developed near Hong Kong and one of only four government-designated, international deep-water ports. HIT is the largest shareholder in a consortium composed of Cosco, the Chinese shipping group, Mitsui and Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong). The consortium has taken a 70 per cent stake in Yantian International Terminals, funding a Rmb5bn development programme. It is constructing five 50,000-ton container berths and four general cargo berths, to be completed by the end of 1995. Last year, Hutchison bought a 50 per cent stake in Shanghai's container operations for HKDollars 1.4bn. It has formed a joint venture with the port authorities of Zhuhai to operate feeder facilities for Hong Kong and develop a deep water port.</p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV, REASSURED BY THATCHER, OFFERS MOVEMENT ON GERMAN UNITY;  </P> <P> EUROPE: THE SOVIET PRESIDENT PROPOSES LINKING NATO AND THE WARSAW PACT AS  PARTNERS.  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev showed new flexibility on the key issue in  Europe's future, the status of united Germany, after British Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher assured him Friday that Kremlin security concerns will be  respected as its No. 1 military ally is absorbed by the West.  </P> <P> At a subsequent news conference, the Soviet president proposed the creation of  new institutions linking a radically changed Warsaw Pact and NATO "as partners  rather than as enemies" to hasten the end of the East-West divide epitomized by  the two Germanys, now on the road to reunification.  </P> <P> In wide-ranging remarks at a joint news conference with Thatcher, Gorbachev  also repeated his threat to act if Israel continues to allow settlement of  Soviet immigrants on territories seized in the 1967 Six-Day War. But in a  notable departure from what he said five days earlier in Washington, he did not  specifically threaten to halt Jewish emigration.  </P> <P> Gorbachev stressed that he is open to new ideas on the future of Germany,  though he noted that he still has the "same approaches."  </P> <P> "I think I would not unveil any great secret by saying that there have emerged  of late some specific things which are worth thinking about and discussing," he  said. His talks last week with President Bush in Washington and at Camp David  provided "food for thought for both sides," he added.  </P> <P> "My central idea is that we should not confine ourselves to one option, an  option that would necessarily turn out to be one-sided," Gorbachev told the  packed auditorium at the Soviet Foreign Ministry Press Center.  </P> <P> Western diplomats said the Soviet leader's remarks were highly significant for  what they omitted.  </P> <P> "For the first time, he didn't flat rule out Germany belonging to NATO alone,"  said one who attended the hourlong news conference.  </P> <P> Gorbachev received the Conservative British prime minister as both the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization and Warsaw Pact were seeking a new role in a  Europe where their reason for existence -- the perceived threat from the other  -- has vanished or is fast disappearing.  </P> <P> In Moscow on Thursday, Gorbachev and the other Warsaw Pact leaders declared  their intention to transform their seven-nation alliance, formed 35 years ago,  into a chiefly political body by November.  </P> <P> However, as confrontation between the blocs recedes, Gorbachev has rejected  Western proposals that a unified Germany be allowed to belong to NATO without  also being a member of the Warsaw Pact, to which East Germany belongs. Last  month, Gorbachev even said the West's point of view could force the Kremlin to  rethink its approach to all negotiations involving European security and  disarmament.  </P> <P> British officials, however, said Thatcher, an outspoken advocate of NATO  membership for Germany, discussed with Gorbachev a nine-point U.S. plan aimed  at allaying Soviet concerns. In their two-hour conversation, she assured him  that no NATO forces would be stationed in what is now East Germany and that  Soviet troops could remain there for a "transitional period," they said.  </P> <P> Thatcher's aides said the meeting left her feeling more confident that the  East-West deadlock over Germany can be resolved.  </P> <P> "The prime minister felt encouraged," one official told British reporters.  "People have not adopted fixed positions."  </P> <P> At the news conference, Thatcher told reporters that she and Gorbachev  "discussed the consequences of the unification of Germany. The Soviet Union and  the Warsaw Pact will require some assurance to be sure of their own security.  We must find ways ahead to provide that assurance."  </P> <P> She pointedly noted, however, that East Germany is moving toward becoming part  of West Germany, and not the other way around. And West Germany, she said, is a  member of NATO.  </P> <P> In an open difference of opinion with Thatcher, who first met with Gorbachev in  1984 before he became Soviet leader, Gorbachev called for a "new relationship"  between the two alliances that would blur boundaries between them by giving  these two offspring of the Cold War common institutions.  </P> <P> "If from yesterday's statement there emerges a new Warsaw Pact and if NATO does  not engage in maneuvers or pretenses, the emergence of new institutions is  possible," Gorbachev said.  </P> <P> He specifically mentioned the possibility that one alliance "would accept in  its midst a country from another alliance."  </P> <P> However, Thatcher, seated on Gorbachev's left, said, "I do not at the moment  see those common bodies emerging."  </P> <P> The Soviet leader, with whom Thatcher has a clear rapport despite their vast  ideological differences, smiled and said her reserve was because she is a "more  cautious, more experienced politician."  </P> <P> At the news conference, Gorbachev was asked by a reporter to clarify earlier  remarks he had made about Jewish emigration. On Sunday, at the end of the  U.S.-Soviet summit in Washington, he had said that the Kremlin might suspend  its relaxed emigration policy and again prevent Jews from leaving unless Israel  provides guarantees that Soviet citizens will not be settled in the occupied  West Bank or Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> Two days later, a senior State Department official said Foreign Minister Eduard  A. Shevardnadze had given assurances to Secretary of State James A. Baker III  that the liberal emigration policy would remain in place.  </P> <P> A new Israeli government formed Friday specifically reasserted the right of new  immigrants to choose where to live.  </P> <P> Responding to the reporter's question, Gorbachev was vague: "We hope that  Israel will listen to what was said in Washington. . . . If the situation is  such that it is necessary to react, we'll have to use our sovereign rights and  competences to have an influence."  </P> <P> That language appeared to reserve other options for the Kremlin besides  shutting down Jewish emigration, a step that would chill improved U.S.-Soviet  relations and endanger an upgraded U.S. trading status for the Soviets.  </P> <P> Greeting Thatcher in the Kremlin at the start of their seventh meeting in as  many years, Gorbachev said he still felt jet-lagged from his visit to the  United States.  </P> <P> "Yesterday, I almost fell asleep during the Warsaw Treaty meeting," he said as  he and Thatcher posed for photographers. Thatcher later said they had "very  interesting, deep and friendly discussions."  </P> <P> At the news conference, she praised Gorbachev for embarking on "the biggest  changes, the most historic changes" in modern-day Europe, and singled out his  program to inaugurate a range of market-style reforms to replace traditional  Soviet central planning.  </P> <P> Those proposals have aroused widespread worry and concern as well as opposition  from radical and conservative members of the Soviet legislature. Using the  televised news conference as a forum, Gorbachev again called on his countrymen  to be calm.  </P> <P> "I want to emphasize one thing: There is no need to be scared," he said. He  said economic need, and not an ideological veering away from socialism, was  behind the shift to what is being termed a "regulated market."  </P> <P> "Our main concern is that we have empty shelves," Gorbachev said. "That is why  we need a market economy."  </P> <P> On the second day of a four-day visit, Thatcher also held talks with Prime  Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and the defense minister, Marshal Dmitri T. Yazov.  Today she is to fly to Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, to visit a British trade  exposition.  </P></p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Westpac to go ahead with share issue WESTPAC Banking Corp-oration is to proceed with a planned ADollars 500m (USDollars 340.1m) convertible preference share issue following shareholder approval at a fiery special meeting in Sydney yesterday. The issue, important for Westpac's capital adequacy ratios, has already won strong institutional support. It was the subject of one of three resolutions passed at the meeting, but with strong criticism from some shareholders. The other two resolutions concerned a ADollars 14m options package for Mr Robert Joss, chief executive, and the waiver of calls on shares held by nearly 200 executives and former executives of the bank. A minority of shareholders expressed their objection to all three resolutions, criticising the size of Mr Joss' options package and what they called preferential treatment for other Westpac shareholders. But the resolutions were carried on a show of hands and did not require polls. The Reserve Bank said ADollars 600.95m of 7.5 per cent Treasury bonds maturing in July 2005 were sold at an average yield of 7.213 per cent at tender. It said ADollars 201m of 12.5 per cent bonds maturing in January 1998 went at an average yield of 6.488 per cent.</p>

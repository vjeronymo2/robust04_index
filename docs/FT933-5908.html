			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Computers near higher intelligence JAPANESE scientists are set to develop a machine as intelligent as a cat in the next five to six years. This will pave the way for computers more intelligent than humans, according to Professor Kevin Warwick of the University of Reading's cybernetics department. 'Technically we know that certain aspects of human intelligence such as memory, decision-making and logic, can not only be artificially replicated but in fact the artificial form is much faster, more powerful, more flexible and more reliable,' he said.</p>

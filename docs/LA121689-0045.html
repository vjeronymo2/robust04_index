			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EX-INFORMANT SUES DEA, CUSTOMS  </P> <P> A San Diego businessman who acted as an undercover government informant has  sued the federal agencies he served, claiming that they abandoned him when he  was jailed and tortured in Mexico while posing as a member of an international  drug ring.  </P> <P> Kenneth Erickson, 43, filed the suit last week against the federal government  and various agents with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S.  Customs Service, charging that they violated his civil rights.  </P> <P> Erickson contends he lost his house and his businesses -- in all, more than  $2.5 million in assets -- because he was kept in a Mexican prison for seven  months, ignored by the American agents who he claims authorized his travel to  Mexico. He says he wants to be reimbursed for his losses.  </P> <P> The suit, filed in federal court in San Diego, also will raise questions about  whether the U.S. agencies were operating clandestinely -- and therefore  illegally -- in Mexico, said Erickson and one of his attorneys, Paul G.  Edmonson.  </P> <P> "The government advertises that they want individual professionals to help them  track down these drug dealers," Erickson said. "Lawyers, doctors, accountants,  people with business experience. I had a professional business. I helped them,  and I really came to some great harm because of it. And they don't back you up  at all."  </P> <P> David Shaw, the assistant special agent in charge for the Customs Service in  San Diego, conceded in a phone interview that Erickson worked two years ago on  a joint Customs-DEA investigation. But the services are not responsible for any  harm Erickson suffered in Mexico because they did not officially send him  there, Shaw contended.  </P> <P> "When people work for us, we give them the same speech over and over again,"  Shaw said. "Almost anybody that's a manager can recite it by heart -- that if  we instruct you to go, we make the proper arrangements and consult the proper  officials, in Mexico and in Washington.  </P> <P> "If we don't instruct you to go, we tell them, 'We're telling you not to go.  And, if you do go, you're on your own. You're at your own risk.' In this  particular case, that's what we're contending."  </P> <P> Erickson's suit names as defendants Shaw's boss, Kenneth Ingleby, special agent  in charge of Customs in San Diego, as well as Charles Hill, special agent in  charge of the DEA's San Diego office. Phone calls to Ingleby were referred to  Shaw. Hill did not return calls.  </P> <P> Also named as defendants were the agents Erickson said he primarily worked  with, Brian Simon of Customs and Douglas Hebert of DEA, as well as the United  States government. Simon and Hebert declined comment.  </P> <P> Erickson's stint as a government informant began in January, 1987, when he  telephoned the DEA office in National City and said he had information about  what he believed was a drug-smuggling operation, according to the suit.  </P> <P> At the time, Erickson owned several San Diego businesses, including five  limousine services, an auto parts store and an airplane charter firm, the suit  says. The link to the smugglers was a limousine service customer, it says.  </P> <P> Between January and March, 1987, the suit says, Erickson learned that the  smugglers intended to use an airplane to transport drugs into the United States  from Mexico.  </P> <P> Since Erickson had an aircraft charter business, the agents told him his  knowledge of planes and related paper work could make him valuable to the  smugglers and lead to "valuable information" for the two agencies, the suit  says.  </P> <P> Erickson agreed to provide that information, the suit says. In return, it says,  the agents promised to "supervise and protect" Erickson and to give him  expenses as well as 10% of any property seized as a result of information he  provided.  </P> <P> Eventually, the suit says, because of Erickson's clean record, the plane -- a  twin-engine, turbojet Rockwell Aerocommander -- was registered in his name,  with the knowledge and secret help of the two agencies.  </P> <P> During the next couple of months, Erickson said, he made three trips to Mexico,  but mechanical difficulties with the plane and problems with pilots cut two  trips short. The agents knew about and approved both of those trips, Erickson  said, and even picked him up once after he called from Mexico to inform them  one of the smuggling trips had been aborted.  </P> <P> Erickson's last trip to Mexico began Sept. 11, 1987. As the apparent owner of  the plane, he was to straighten out some paper work with Mexican authorities,  who reportedly had impounded the aircraft.  </P> <P> Customs agent Simon directed Erickson to work with DEA agent Hiber, who  approved the trip, the suit claims. It is that alleged authorization that the  two agencies dispute, Shaw said.  </P> <P> The suit goes on to say that neither the Mexican government nor Mexican police  had been told about Erickson's undercover trip. Erickson did not know that, it  says.  </P> <P> After Erickson arrived in Mexico City, he and one of the drug dealers waited  for several days at an expensive hotel, El Presidente, while Mexican  bureaucrats dealt with the paper work, Erickson said. But, on Sept. 17, as  Erickson and the dealer were checking out of the hotel, they were arrested by  Mexican Federal Judicial Police.  </P> <P> Simultaneously, eight others involved in the smuggling group were arrested in  another city, Erickson said.  </P> <P> Erickson was held for eight days at Federal Judicial Police headquarters in  Mexico City, where he was interrogated, beaten and shocked with an instrument  resembling an electric cattle prod, the suit says.  </P> <P> Later, he was transferred to a federal prison near Mexico City, the Southern  Detention Facility, where other members of the smuggling group also were  imprisoned. They had begun to hear rumors of his dual role and beat him, the  suit says.  </P> <P> Erickson said he repeatedly tried to call the DEA and Customs offices in San  Diego. Once, according to the suit, he reached the DEA office, only to be told  by an agent, "You're no James Bond. . . . I don't know where you get off  calling us from Mexico and charging us long-distance phone bills."  </P> <P> Erickson languished in prison for seven months, until April, 1988. Erickson  said Thursday he was released only after Nancy Reagan, the former First Lady,  wrote a letter to the U.S. embassy in Mexico, urging an investigation into his  jailing.  </P> <P> Mrs. Reagan apparently was prompted by letters Erickson's family had written  about him to the White House, Erickson said.  </P> <P> Since his release, Erickson said, he has pressed both agencies for money, but  to no avail. He also filed formal administrative claims for compensation but,  on Sept. 19, those, too, were turned down. "I've had nothing but lip service,"  he said.  </P> <P> The case has been assigned to Judge Rudi M. Brewster.  </P></p>

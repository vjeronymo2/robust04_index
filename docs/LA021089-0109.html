			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOYOLA HOPES TO RECLAIM WCAC LEAD  </P> <P> Loyola Marymount possibly can move back into a tie for the West Coast Athletic  Conference lead with basketball games tonight at the University of San Diego  and Saturday at St. Mary's.  </P> <P> The Lions, 13-8 overall, are 6-2 in the WCAC, tied with St. Mary's in second  place a game behind Pepperdine, which plays at St. Mary's tonight.  </P> <P> San Diego, 6-14 and 1-7, will probably try to slow the tempo. The Lions are  averaging 114.3 points, No. 1 in the nation, and its top scoring trio of Hank  Gathers, Jeff Fryer and Enoch Simmons is accounting for nearly 78 points a  game. San Diego is led by freshman Gylan Dottin's 12.9-point average. ALAN  DROOZ  </P></p>

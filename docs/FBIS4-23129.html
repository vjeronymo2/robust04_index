			<p>SUMMARY                                 With a swiftness that clearly reflected both sides' eagerness to  defuse the crisis on the Korean peninsula, the North and South  have agreed to hold the first ever inter-Korean summit next month  in Pyongyang.  The summit agreement comes in the wake of  Pyongyang's upbeat assessment of the prospects for U.S.-North  Korea high-level talks scheduled to begin in Geneva early in  July.  Underscoring its desire for better relations with  Washington, Pyongyang has muted its commemoration of the Korean  war anniversary.                          END SUMMARY     Judging from the initial reporting by Pyongyang and Seoul media,  both sides seemed to have made concessions in adopting an  agreement at the 28 June vice-premier-level meeting held to pave  the way for the summit (Pyongyang radio, Yonhap, 28 June):     + The North accepted the South's proposal that the meeting  between ROK President Kim Yong-sam and DPRK President Kim Il-song  take place from 25 to 27 July, thereby giving up a propaganda  opportunity.  The North had insisted on 15 August, the date  Pyongyang uses to stage a joint North-South celebration marking  Korea's liberation from Japan, an event to which the North  perennially invites South Korean dissidents and the South  prevents them from attending.     + The South accepted Pyongyang as the venue for the summit  without an explicit pledge that a second summit will be held in  Seoul on "principle of reciprocity."  The agreement calls for the  following round of talks to be "decided" on by the two  presidents.     + The agreement stipulates that both sides "make joint efforts"  to build an atmosphere conducive to the summit, presumably  keeping Seoul from openly pressing for international sanctions  against the North and binding Pyongyang to refrain from extreme  vituperation against the South.  In addition, the agreement calls  for working-level contacts, to start on 1 July, to hammer out  procedural and logistic matters.     Further underscoring the eagerness with which both sides  attempted to avoid controversy and make rapid progress toward  defusing the current crisis, the agreement conspicuously avoided  listing any summit agenda, thus leaving it unclear, at least on  paper, what the two leaders will be discussing when they meet.  In the annals of inter-Korean dialogue, the North and South have  frequently engaged in bitter and prolonged wrangling over  agendas, often resulting in the failure of bilateral talks.     DPRK-U.S. Talks     The agreement on an inter-Korean summit comes  on the heels of Pyongyang's upbeat assessments of the upcoming  DPRK-U.S. talks, slated to start on 8 July in Geneva (KCNA, 27  June).  In the first confirmation of earlier Western reporting on  former U.S. President Carter's recent visit to Pyongyang, a 23  June Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement said that during the  visit President Kim Il-song had made a proposal on the nuclear  issue (KCNA).  The statement described President Kim Il-song's  proposal as an "important" one containing "well-intentioned  measures" Pyongyang will take to "break the present deadlock"  between Pyongyang and Washington and reach a "fundamental  solution" of the nuclear issue.  It also said that the Kim Il-  song proposal led to agreement on the upcoming bilateral talks  and claimed that President Clinton has "welcomed" the North  Korean stand and pledged to formally withdraw the discussion of  sanctions at the UN Security Council.  The spokesman's statement  also expressed hope that the talks will result in a "fundamental  solution" of the nuclear issue and an improvement of bilateral  relations with Washington.     Subsequently, a 25 June Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement  hinted at a possible resolution of the issue of opening up two  suspected nuclear sites that the international community insists  could yield important clues to North Korea's history of past  nuclear reprocessing activity.  Criticizing alleged insistence by  South Korea and Japan on a "special inspection" of the sites, the  spokesman linked the resolution of this issue to conf idence-  building between Pyongyang and Washington.  As the upcoming  bilateral talks proceed "successfully and confidence is built"  between the two parties, the spokesman said, the issue of past  reprocessing will be resolved "naturally."     War Anniversary     Clearly seeking to provide an favorable  atmosphere for bilateral talks, Pyongyang has, for the third year  in a row, toned down its commemoration of the 25 June anniversary  of the outbreak of the Korean war.  Pyongyang media have again  conspicuously refrained from reporting on any anti-U.S. rallies  in North Korea that have traditionally kicked off a monthlong  "anti-U.S. struggle" period.  Moreover, in a move that signified  further downgrading of the war anniversary, Pyongyang radio has,  for the first time, failed to broadcast the commemorative  editorial carried by the party paper Nodong Sinmun.  The North  Korean news agency KCNA, however, carried a summary of the  editorial as usual (25 June).  Far from being belligerent, the  KCNA summary of the editorial called on Washington to end the  confrontation with Pyongyang and on Seoul to work toward  unification so as to avoid the repetition of "the disaster."     However, apparently in anticipation of Seoul's release of Korean  war related Russian documents, which ROK President Kim reportedly  received from Russian President Yeltsin during his recent trip to  Moscow (ITAR-Tass, Yonhap, 2 June), the editorial revived the  claim that the United States started the war.  Moreover,  Pyongyang radio in a 27 June commentary underscored this point,  claiming that Washington "planned, prepared for, and provoked"  the Korean war.  According to the South Korean press agency  Yonhap, the Russian documents reportedly "prove" that the North  invaded the South (2-10 June).     Implications     Pyongyang may calculate that in the worst case  scenario the scheduled inter-Korean summit could provide the  North with a fallback position should the Geneva talks fail.  However, by placing the prestige of Kim Il-song behind the  current push for DPRK-U.S. talks, Pyongyang seems to be  projecting optimism for their success at least for now.     (AUTHOR:  YIM.

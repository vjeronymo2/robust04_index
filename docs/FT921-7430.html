			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Money Markets: UK rates inch ahead RATES edged up across the board, as the UK money markets digested the effects of a weaker sterling and an opinion poll favouring the Labour Party in a forthcoming election. Players interpreted these two factors as implying that the window of opportunity for an imminent base rate cut in the UK had narrowed. The key three-month interbank rate, which closely shadows base rates, closed  1/16 of a point higher than at the opening at 10 5/16 - 3/16 per cent. On the futures exchange, the March short sterling contract tumbled 10 points to its lowest close of the week at 89.80. However, this still implies that the market is expecting a rate cut before the contract falls due on March 18. The favourite date for a cut in UK rates appears to be within two days after the budget on March 10. 'People have given up on the chance of an immediate cut in rates,' said a senior dealer. This would mean more paper being offered in the next few weeks, he added. The overnight rate stayed within a narrow range, neither expensive nor surprisingly cheap. The rate, which hit 10 per cent at its highest, closed at 10 3/4 - per cent. The forecast shortage was larger than in recent days at Pounds 1.05bn, with most of the shortfall arising from bills falling due for repurchase by the market. Treasury bills and maturing assistance also put a squeeze on liquidity, although this was more than offset by injections from exchequer transactions. The Bank of England made its presence known early in the morning with a Pounds 347m purchase of band two treasury and bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, and paper for resale to the market on March 12 and 13 at 10 7/16 per cent. Further operations saw the Bank offering another repurchase agreement, falling due on the same dates, totalling Pounds 50m at 10 7/16 per cent. In the afternoon, the Bank offered to buy band one and two bank bills totalling Pounds 442m at 10 3/8 per cent, and provided late assistance of Pounds 160m. This left the market Pounds 51m short. In Germany, sufficient reserve levels helped call rates ease from 9.50/60 per cent to 9.45/55 per cent. Traders said they did not expect call money to ease much further. In the US, the Federal Reserve stayed out of the market as funds were trading below the perceived 4 per cent target at 3 15/16 per cent.</p>

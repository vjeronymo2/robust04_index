			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Keith Clearwater made five birdies in a seven-hole span on the way to a  six-under-par 65 and a one-stroke lead in the first round of the $500,000 B.C.  Open tournament at the En-Joie Golf Club in Endicott, N.Y.  </P> <P> Clearwater maintained sole possession of the lead when Bob Estes bogeyed his  final hole to finish with a 66.  </P> <P> Fulton Allem, Gil Morgan and Dave Eichelberger were two strokes behind. There  were seven players at 68 and 24 at 69.  </P> <P> Clearwater, who hasn't won on the PGA Tour since 1987, when he became the first  rookie in a decade to take two tournaments in his first year, started slowly  with just one birdie after six holes.  </P> <P> But he strung three birdies together to finish the front side. Two holes later,  he took over the lead after coming up 18 inches shy on a 35-foot eagle putt. He  added another birdie on No. 13 and parred in.  </P></p>

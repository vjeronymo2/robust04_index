			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / UK Company News: Institutions look to Japan ALMOST A quarter of Britain's leading institutional investors are planning to increase their holdings of Japanese equities according to a Gallup survey for Smith New Court, the securities house, which is published today. The latest survey of 90 institutions handling Pounds 594bn of funds carried out earlier this month shows a marked shift in fund managers' preferences for overseas equities. The percentage of fund managers planning to increase their Japanese equities exposure has risen from 5 per cent in March to 23 per cent this month, the highest level since June last year. However, institutions are becoming less positive about investment opportunities in continental Europe and the UK, and there is a growing intention to sell US equities. Only 9 per cent of the survey respondents plan to increase their holdings of UK equities compared with 18 per cent last month, but fund managers appear to be more optimistic about the longer term outlook for UK equities than any other main market. A balance of 78 per cent of respondents are bullish about UK equities over the next 12 months compared with the 58 per cent who are bullish about Japanese equities, 53 per cent optimistic about continental Europe and 27 per cent who are positive towards US equities over the same period. There have also been further upward revisions in the April survey to forecasts for earnings per share growth in the UK, from 12 per cent to 14 per cent for 1993 and from 14 per cent to 14.5 per cent for 1994. Forecasts for dividend per share growth remain 4 per cent and 6 per cent respectively. Optimism is still growing about prospects for the UK economy. In April, 26 per cent of managers thought the general economic situation would markedly improve in the coming year, compared with only 10 per cent in December.</p>

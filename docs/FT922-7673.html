			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Special Report On Residential Property (5): From servants' quarters to luxury homes and back / A look at the market for mews cottages in London THE HUMBLE London mews cottage, cheaply built, poorly lit and with primitive sanitation, has mirrored the changing patterns of home ownership in the capital. When they were first built they were mean little dwellings, with no windows at the rear lest the family in the big house should feel overlooked. Infant mortality in the mews was twice as high as in other streets. Most of the 12,000 mews cottages in London were built in the 19th century, providing outbuildings, carriage garages and servants' quarters to the big houses bought from speculative builders by wealthy traders. East London was inhabited entirely by the poor, where prevailing winds wafted the smells of Victorian life, so most mews cottages are in the west. Not that the occupants enjoyed a high standard of living. Ragged children, unspeakably close encounters with primitive sanitation and visits of tumbrils clearing steaming mounds of 'rose fertiliser' were the daily scenes. The size of the mews reflected the size of the main house. A really successful man would possess a phaeton, or landau, with a landaulet or brougham for his wife: a two-carriage family. Many a mews became little more than stores and workshops once their original purpose ceased. Cars replaced horses slowly in the capital, but in 1896 the law requiring a car to be preceded by a man with a red flag was abolished and the speed limit was raised to 14 mph (oh, to be able to drive so fast now). Dobbin's days were numbered. The cottages have come a long way since they housed the coachman, footman, groom, horses and fodder; most of the big houses have been converted into flats, the mews being sold off separately, some for Pounds 1m or more. However, there is a growing demand from international billionaires for large London houses with accommodation for chauffeurs and butlers and stabling for Rolls-Royces. A perfect example of the clock turning back is at 50 Holland Park, a grand house converted back from flats on the ground and lower floors, with an enchanting mews cottage immediately to the rear, separated by a tranquil courtyard garden and conservatory. The Victorian mansion has a floor area of more than 5,000 sq ft, with at least six bedrooms; the mews has a garage at street level and a large studio above, greatly improved by the windows added to the rear. The price of just below Pounds 2m suggested by Aylesford with Savills is by no means excessive by London standards. Mews cottages appeal to the romantically inclined; often they have been customised to owners' preferences. The trouble is that new owners then want to change everything; so money spent on interior design is seldom recouped. The owner of 24 Jay Mews, a semibreve from the Albert Hall, spent a fortune converting the little house in the best possible taste. It will be a tragedy if someone rips it all out, but it could happen. The moral is: do not spend money on home improvements unless you are going to enjoy them yourself. The cottage has three bedrooms; its features include a two-floor conservatory and a little roof terrace, giving an illusion of great space. Aylesford with Chesterfield give a price guide of Pounds 465,000  - probably not a lot more than the previous owner spent on the elaborate conversion work. One of the London's most extraordinary mews houses is a flooded immitation Roman temple - actually a swimming pool with the mock temple built of Bath stone. The owners of 50 Reeves Mews, in Mayfair, overcame the mews' lack of internal light by building an elliptical skylight. The three-bedroom house is full of surprises, hence the rather high guide price of Pounds 1.75m which Chesterfield, with Sotheby International Realty, places on it. Mews property became so popular a few years ago that French-born Antoine Lurot started his own agency, Lurot Brand (now trading as the London Mews Company), specialising in the little homes. 'When I started the business I toured London on my motor cycle getting to know every mews - some people got rather suspicious,' says Lurot. 'Now we have mews cottages to suit most pockets, ranging from Pounds 65,000, for an admittedly rather short lease, up to Pounds 2m for a very large cottage in Mayfair.' Barnard Marcus is another agent with a good crop of mews homes at present. A neat three-bedroom home in Logan Mews, Kensington, with generous living space instead of a garage on the ground floor - off-street parking is possible - is on sale at Pounds 350,000. Rather cheaper, at Pounds 205,000, is a two-bedroom home in St George's Square Mews, described as one of Pimlico's quietest cobbled backwaters. There is a garage and a balcony at a cottage back in Holland Park Mews. John D Wood is selling the three-bedroom home in this quiet, cobbled mews with a guide price of Pounds 345,000. David Forbes, of Chesterfields, says London's mews homes have special appeal to people whose main residence is in the country. 'They like the peace and quiet of the mews and also the security that the lack of access from the rear usually gives; the rising popularity of the mews is directly in proportion to the growth of the parking problem in London,' he says. Chesterfields recently sold a mews house to a man who lived nearby, simply on the strength of the garage space available for five cars. The mews has come full circle.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Countdown to Stanhope decision Banks which loaned Pounds 140m to Stanhope, the property developer headed by Mr Stuart Lipton, meet tomorrow to decide whether to put the company into receivership. Stanhope's existing loan facility runs out a week today. The 16 bank syndicate led by Barclays can either appoint receivers or give the company more time to come up with an acceptable rescue plan. The two main rescue proposals come from British Land, the property investment company, headed by Mr John Ritblat, which already has a 29.9 per cent stake in Stanhope, and Postel, the post and telecommunications pension fund run by Mr Alastair Ross Goobey. British Land has offered the banks a cash-plus-paper deal for Stanhope's main asset, its half share in Broadgate Properties, which owns the most of Broadgate and Ludgate office developments in the City of London. Mr Ross Goobey's proposal would involve a massive Stanhope rights issue enabling the company to repay the banks and buy the other half of Broadgate Properties from the receiver of Rosehaugh, Stanhope's former development partner. The cost of the Postel proposal would be around Pounds 250m, against Stanhope's current market capitalisation of Pounds 22m. Postel and another UK pension fund would underwrite the rights issue. Mr Lipton, chief executive of the company he founded in 1983, would have a nominal role in a recapitalised Stanhope. However, the British Land and Postel proposals involve the banks taking a write-down of more the 20p in the pound on their loans to Stanhope. It is unclear whether the syndicate, advised by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, is willing to accept such a write-down. The Postel plan may require the support of 75 per cent of Stanhope's shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting, depending on the form of the issue, allowing British Land an opportunity to block the deal. For the Postel plan to succeed, it also has to agree on a price for the other half of Broadgate Properties with Rosehaugh's receiver, Mr Roger Oldfield of KPMG Peat Marwick. According to Broadgate Properties' last accounts, published in October, the net asset value of the company was Pounds 232m, split equally between Stanhope and Rosehaugh. Mr Oldfield is thought to be asking at least Pounds 110m for Rosehaugh's share and has said that he would rather wait for the property market to improve than sell Broadgate cheaply. While the banks agree that unifying Broadgate under a single owner would be the best way of realising value, this could also be achieved by putting Stanhope into receivership under KPMG.</p>

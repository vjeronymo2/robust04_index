			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HEFFERN QUITS CDM TO COACH MIKE BRIGGS  </P> <P> Dave Heffern, Corona del Mar High School tennis coach for the past 10 years,  said he has resigned to coach Mike Briggs, a former Corona del Mar and UC  Irvine player, on the professional tennis tour.  </P> <P> Briggs turned pro after completing his sophomore season at Irvine.  </P> <P> "He turned pro after the NCAAs (in June) and asked me to go out on the tour  with him," Heffern said. "I wasn't really looking for something like this. He's  the best I ever coached. He asked me to travel with him and help him. His  father could pay my salary. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."  </P> <P> Heffern coached the boys' tennis team at Corona del Mar for 10 seasons, winning  the Southern Section 4-A championship in 1983. He also coached the girls' team  for the past seven years. The team won the 4-A title and Keri Phebus won the  Southern Section singles title last fall.  </P> <P> He also coached the girls' basketball team for four seasons in the early 1980s,  winning the 3-A title in 1983. And for the past four seasons, he was an  assistant on the boys' basketball team.  </P> <P> Heffern and Briggs recently returned from a tournament in the Azores, a group  of islands off Portugal. Briggs is trying to compile enough Assn. of Tennis  Professionals points on satellite tournaments to qualify for main events such  as the U.S. Open.  </P> <P> He earned 27 points in the Azores. "It's a good start," Heffern said. "I hope  things turn out well."  </P></p>

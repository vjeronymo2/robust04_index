			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Besieged C&amp;J Clark tumbles to Pounds 1.7m SEVERE pressure on margins and a decline in UK demand helped to cut 1992-93 profits at C&amp;J Clark, the family-owned shoe manufacturer at the centre of a controversial bid approach from Berisford. Pre-tax profits for the 12 months to end-January collapsed from Pounds 20.4m to Pounds 1.7m, after charging Pounds 12.5m for a rationalisation of the group's manufacturing and retail businesses. Some 1,000 of the group's total 18,400 jobs were lost last year as Clark sought to improve its international competitiveness under a three-year plan launched in 1992. Mr Alan Mackay, finance director, said the major part of the costs of this programme had now been taken. Sales were 5 per cent ahead at Pounds 624.6m. Mr Mackay said the group had made progress on promoting Clark as an international brand. 'The real achievement this year has been, that in the midst of all our difficulties, we have given the business a new focus.' The Clark board and its shareholders have been split over the bid from Berisford, recommended by a majority of the board last month. The board has called an EGM for May 7 to discuss the proposals. Prospects for the current year were looking better, Mr Mackay said. The rise in occupancy costs, which had hit Clark severely in recent years, was easing off, while sales in March had been some 10 per cent ahead of last year. Net debt was cut from Pounds 40.8m to Pounds 37.9m, for gearing of 17.7 per cent. On the basis of this outlook, an uncovered dividend of 3.75p (7.5p) is being paid, including a final to take advantage of Budget proposals of 2p (4p). Earnings fell 17.2p to 0.6p. Clark has been under pressure from many shareholders since it cut the dividend from 9.4p to 7.5p in 1992. Many of the 500 family members who control the company rely on the dividend as their main source of income. Although the report described the annual results as 'a major disappointment', Mr Mackay said the return from the footwear division had been slightly better than expected. Volumes had been maintained, in a market which saw UK consumers buying at least one less pair than four years ago. Profits from footwear in the UK and Europe were 42 cent down at Pounds 14.7m. In Australia and North America profits were up 29 per cent at Pounds 4m.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Premium on UBS shares slides ahead of EGM The premium of the registered shares of Union Bank of Switzerland on its bearer shares tumbled yesterday to 14.6 per cent from 19.4 per cent. This is its lowest level since September 29, when the bank announced its proposal to convert the registered shares into bearer shares, thereby reducing their voting power. UBS is fighting an attempt by Mr Martin Ebner, a maverick Zurich broker-dealer, to swing a majority of votes at the annual general meeting next April in favour of strategic changes at the bank. An extraordinary general meeting will be held on November 22 to vote on the share conversion proposal. If accepted, it would slash the voting power of Mr Ebner's BK Vision, a fund with 18 per cent of the registered shares. Yesterday, the bearer shares lost SFr5 to SFr1,230, but the registered shares, which have one-fifth of the bearers' par value, tumbled SFr13 to SFr282. Some Swiss analysts said the premium slide indicated that investor sentiment was moving towards UBS in the tense battle for proxies for the EGM. 'I have spoken to a number of large institutions, and it looks as if people are convinced that Mr Ebner has no strategy, so it is better to take the 15 per cent premium than get nothing,' said Mr Hans Kaufmann, head of Swiss equity research at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich. Analysts said UBS had been lobbying investors, and there was a suspicion that it has been supporting the premium to give registered shareholders an opportunity to limit losses. Other analysts said the premium was hurt yesterday by the publication by UBS of the rules for registering shares before the EGM. New applications may be accepted until November 17, but the bank reserves the right to reject applications after October 25. This increased the uncertainty over what could happen, an analyst said.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yelena Yakovleva: "Harvest Prospects Worse Than </F> Last Year"]    [Text] The most accurate "predictor" of last year's  harvest, the "SovEkon" center, does not promise cheerful  prospects this year. According to its figures Russia will  harvest 80-85 million tonnes of grain.    For comparison's sake last year the country obtained 99  million tonnes of grain and the year before 107 million.    On what does "SovEkon" base its forecast? The area sown to  winter crops has declined by 20 percent and about 2 million  hectares (about 15 percent) of the winter crops that were sown  have died. The sowing campaign began quite well but now the  pace has been reduced, as is borne out by the weekly  information. And if the sowing schedule is extended the  harvesting schedule will also be pushed back.    "SovEkon" also keeps track of information about fuel and  fertilizer stocks. As of 1 May stocks of fuel on the farms were  40 percent less than last year and half as much fertilizer and  toxic chemicals were applied: The soil continues to be depleted.    It is true, as our correspondent Andrey Aderekhin has  reported, that the Kuban grain fields this year will not be  reduced. In the traditional grain regions they are working on  the sowing responsibly and seriously and if necessary going out  on night shifts, although it is a long time since anyone  monitored anybody. The Kuban private farmers have prepared seeds  and equipment in advance. And already the most acute question  is not "how to sow and how to harvest?" but "how to sell most  advantageously?"    Almost everyone is planning a lower yield. But many grain  stocks remain in the country from last year's harvest --  approximately 18 million tonnes. Every month about 2.8 million  tonnes are spent. We are thus provided with "old" grain on  average for six months and for some types through to the next  sowing campaign.    Apart from the Far East and Siberian regions, to which it is  cheaper to deliver imported grain than our own because of the  huge distance it has to travel, Russia will nonetheless manage  with its own grain this year -- that is the stance of Vice Prime  Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha and Agriculture Minister Viktor  Khlystun. In principle these calculations are convincing, but  ultimately it will all depend on the structure of our stocks:  Those 18 million tonnes of grain could contain, for instance,  an insufficient quantity of food grain or corn.</p>

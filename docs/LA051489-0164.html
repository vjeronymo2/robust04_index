			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> CANADA TO CHECK U.S. FUEL  </P> <P> Canada closed 125 U.S. border crossings to petroleum tankers after reports that  some U.S. companies are blending toxic wastes into gasoline and selling the  fuel in both countries. A joint special unit is also being formed to  investigate the reports of contaminated gasoline shipments, Canadian  Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard said. He said the border closures will  permit better inspection of tankers at the remaining 50 crossings. The Toronto  Globe and Mail newspaper reported last week that solvents, toxic PCBs and waste  oil have been mixed into fuels by several firms in New York to save disposal  costs and that the mixture has been sold to unsuspecting customers.  </P></p>

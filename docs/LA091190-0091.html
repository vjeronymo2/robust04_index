			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INS ORDERED TO GIVE DATA ON MINORS IN  JUVENILE HALL  </P> <P> A federal judge ordered the Immigration and Naturalization Service on Monday to  turn over data on the number of minors kept in INS custody at Eastlake Juvenile  Hall in Lincoln Heights. U.S. Chief District Judge Manuel Real granted the  information request from the National Center for Immigrants' Rights Inc. The  group argued that underaged immigrants are subjected to violent abuse by  juvenile criminals in places such as Eastlake, and that it would be  inappropriate to keep minors there.  </P> <P> Attorney Carlos Holguin of the center said the INS has held minors at Eastlake  for up to four weeks, in violation of a court-approved agreement to keep  juveniles there no longer than 72 hours.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Ian Fan, who represented the INS, opposed release of the  data, contending it violated the minors' right to privacy. He also said the INS  has not violated the 72-hour agreement at Eastlake since last November.  </P></p>

At around 10:53 the armed bandits of the South Korean Puppet  Army entrenched on the Taeyonpyong Islet fired their 155 mm gun  toward the Changjae Islet of the North side on the West Sea of  Korea off Pupo, Kangnyong County, South Hwanghae Province.    In this the safety of the fishermen of the North side  engaged  in fishing around the islet was seriously threatened.    It was entirely thanks to the great patience and  self-control  of soldiers of the Korean People's Army that the artillery fire  of the South Korean puppets did not expand into an armed  conflict between the two sides.    This dangerous military provocation committed by the South  Korean puppets in broad daylight was a premeditated act intended  to drive the situation on the Korean peninsula to confrontation  and war.    We cannot but take a serious view of the South Korean  puppets' provocation because it was timed to coincide with  their tenacious plots and war moves to stifle the DPRK, the  bulwark of socialism, over its fictitious "nuclear issue", hand  in glove with outside forces.    The Korean people and People's Army soldiers are sharply  watching with heightened revolutionary vigilance the new war  provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean  puppets.    The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets must  refrain from rash acts, looking straight at the touch-and-go  situation on the Korean peninsula caused by their continuous  provocations for a new war.    If the South Korean puppets keep to the line of  confrontation  and war, defying our repeated warnings, those warmaniacs will be  sternly punished.</p>

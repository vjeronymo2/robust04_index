			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press statement by President Franjo Tudjman following </F> meetings and talks with ambassadors of UN Security Council  members in New York on 21 March -- recorded]    [Text] We have, understandably, discussed, both with the UN  secretary general and the UN Security Council, above all the  extension of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] mandate in the  new climate created by the signing of the Washington agreement  on the Croat-Muslim federation and a confederation between  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. We voiced some criticism, but  it is important in these new circumstances to have UNPROFOR's  mandate redefined so that it can start implementing the Vance  plan and the UN Security Council resolutions.    In this context we drew attention to priority tasks such as  border controls between Serbia and Croatia, the disarmament of  those Serb paramilitary formations -- since there is no peace  without this -- the return of refugees, and the restoration of  communications. We have also pointed out the willingness of the  Croatian Government to take the necessary confidence-building  steps and to guarantee all human rights as well as territorial  self-government to the Serb ethnic community in the Knin area,  the Glina and Knin districts where before the war, according to  the 1991 census, the Serb population was in the majority.    Let me add that I listened with a great deal of satisfaction  to almost all the members of the UN Security Council who  reiterated the support of their governments for the territorial  integrity of the internationally recognized borders of Croatia  and their readiness to define in future UNPROFOR's mandate so  that, as I said, it can carry out its task. Without a solution  of the UN-protected zones in Croatia, there can be no stable, no  final peace in Bosnia- Herzegovina. By signing the Washington  agreement we took a huge step toward peace, but this is also why  the question of the UN-protected zones in Croatia should also be  resolved. Thank you.</p>

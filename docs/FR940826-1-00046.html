Section 4009(g) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100&hyph;203) required that OPOs be designated by Medicare to include no more than one OPO per service area. As the certification process limited only one to an area and some of the OPOs were hospital-based, limiting the OPO's responsibility to a single transplant center became impractical. An OPO (whether independent or hospital-based) is required to service all transplant centers in its area. Accordingly, it would be very rare when a hospital-based OPO would service a single transplant center.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 413.202&blank;Organ Procurement Organizations' (OPOs') or Transplant Centers' Costs for Kidneys Sent to Foreign Countries or Transplanted in Patients Other Than Medicare Beneficiaries <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Existing &sect;413.179 would be redesignated as &sect;413.202 with changes discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Organ Acquisition Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To ensure that there is a more reasonable and accurate determination of the Medicare program's share of heart and lung acquisition costs, we propose to pay transplant hospitals using the same method that we use to determine Medicare's share of the cost of acquiring kidneys. As noted earlier, organ acquisition costs are paid to Medicare-certified transplant centers as cost passthroughs (&sect;412.113(d)). The cost of acquiring kidneys for transplant is determined by using a formula specified in &sect;413.179. Existing &sect;413.179 (redesignated as &sect;413.202 in this proposed rule) requires that transplant hospitals compute Medicare kidney acquisition costs based on the ratio of the number of usable kidneys transplanted into Medicare beneficiaries to the total number of usable kidneys applied to reasonable costs. We propose to expand the applicability of redesignated &sect;413.202 to include hearts and livers by making it apply to ``organs'' instead of ``kidneys.'' We believe that this revision would result in a more reasonable determination of Medicare heart and liver acquisition costs because the kidney formula more fairly accounts for Medicare's portion of such costs, including organ wastage. We would cross refer &sect;412.113 to &sect;413.202 to ensure proper cost determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By making this change, we would ensure that acquisition costs of organs transplanted in non-Medicare recipients are excluded from Medicare payment. Section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act requires that the cost of services be borne by the appropriate payor. Accordingly, the cost associated with organs not used by Medicare beneficiaries must be borne by the responsible individual or third party payor. The law precludes Medicare from paying any costs associated with organs not used by Medicare beneficiaries. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

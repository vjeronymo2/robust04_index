It said the extension of the deadline for candidate lists to  March 25 had allowed for the withdrawal of the NCDP. Printing  of the provincial ballot paper for the North-West region had not  yet begun, so the NCDP would be excluded from the ballot paper.  A total of 26 parties had registered for the election, and 18  were on the National Assembly ballot paper, the IEC said.</p>

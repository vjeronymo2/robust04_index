			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Letter: Arguments against monetary union underlined by events Sir, Amid all the discussions following Britain's decision to leave the exchange rate mechanism (ERM), the most central argument in favour of a free-floating sterling seemed to have been forgotten: namely that it is in the national interest of an economy losing its international competitiveness to devalue in order both to stimulate exports and shift domestic demand away from imported goods due to the shift in relative prices. The second effect will, at the same time, help to limit the inflationary pressures arising from the price rise of foreign inputs. The turmoil that has been seen will in one or two years' time be hailed as the turning point for the British economy, at least as long as the government does not succumb to calls for a too early re-entry into the ERM. European monetary union, if it had been in place already, would have done to Britain exactly the same as German monetary union did to the east German economy. By setting a too-high exchange rate east German competitiveness was sent into free fall, drastically increasing unemployment. In Germany, one might argue, any other exchange rate between the two currencies, and especially a free floating one, was politically unattainable. In Europe, it is not too late yet. In contrast to what the German commissioner, Mr Martin Bangemann, said last Wednesday, the past week did nothing but underline the arguments against monetary union. Fixed (or semi-fixed) exchange rates are fine for stationary (or almost stationary) economic environments, except that in these cases they won't be needed anyway. Otherwise they are not just unnecessary, they are damaging. And economic environments are changing. When will economic policy advisers bother to have just one closer look into what Adam Smith and David Ricardo wrote some time ago?

			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> 5 ABUSED HORSES RETURNED TO OWNER  </P> <P> Five abused horses, including two pregnant mares, were returned by court order  to their owner, Dennis Alamillo of Fillmore, over a protest by the Humane  Society of Ventura County, which spent five months rehabilitating the animals.  </P> <P> Society Director Joleen Hoffman said that both the Humane Society and county  animal regulation had documented a lack of food and water for the horses on  numerous occasions since June, 1989. The horses were impounded March 29, 1990,  after an examination by veterinarian Dr. A.E. Sloan determined that "the horses  were not being taken care of in even a minimal capacity," according to a report  filed with the district attorney's office.  </P> <P> During a hearing Wednesday morning, Alamillo, 28, pleaded no contest to two of  six counts of animal abuse. Municipal Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. fined  Alamillo $530 and sentenced him to three years probation.  </P> <P> "I was amazed the courts could make such a horrid mistake," Hoffman said of the  decision to return the horses to their owner. When Alamillo arrived at the  society's Ojai shelter about 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, Hoffman found it difficult  to believe his court order was genuine.  </P> <P> Deputy sheriffs were called after Alamillo reportedly threatened to walk his  animals out through the society's office. Finally, the horses were taken by  their owner to the corral at the west end of Fillmore's 4th Street from which  they were impounded.  </P> <P> Alamillo's lawyer, Jan L. Helfrich of Ventura, said the reports of abuse were  exaggerated and described the horses as thin but not starved. Although the  paddocks where her client kept the animals have no on-site water, Helfrich said  that Alamillo brought water in daily and that the Humane Society must have  impounded the animals on the only day they were without water. Alamillo could  not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Randall Thomas said the veterinary report on the date the  horses were taken from Alamillo described the water buckets as dry for at least  24 hours and containing dried fecal matter. Pictures taken by the Humane  Society after the horses arrived in Ojai were "compelling," Thomas said. "Two  of the horses were walking skeletons."  </P> <P> Judge Campbell said the threat of jail on two counts of abuse and the terms of  probation, which give the Humane Society the right to monitor Alamillo's care  of the horses, convinced him that "the animals' safety could be ensured."  </P> <P> Hoffman said her staff remained shaken after the court decision. "We're all  shocked and depressed about this." She would not comment on the findings of the  society's first inspection Thursday but said there are plans to file for  restitution of expenses for the care of Alamillo's animals, which she estimated  cost the society more than $3,000.

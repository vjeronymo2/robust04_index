			<p>BFN     [Text] The chief of defense staff, Major General  Abdul-Salam Abubakar, has expressed concern over the incessant  verbal attacks on the government by the retired military  officers. Gen. Abubakar made his feelings known yesterday in  Owerri at the opening of the fourth national conference of  retired Army, Navy, and Air Force officers. Sola Kudaefe reports:    [Begin Kudaefe recording] The chief of defense staff said  that it was politically unprofessional for retired officers to  attack military institutions and therefore carry away the spirit  of esprit de corps they were taught while in service. Gen.  Abubakar spoke of the need for them to be mindful of their  public utterances as the general public will tend to believe  whatever they said as truth.    Another issue that is of concern to Gen. Abubakar is wearing  of military ranks by retired officers involved in partisan  politics. He contended that this was a source of embarrassment  to the serving officers and therefore called on the conference  of the retired Army, Navy, and Air Force officers to offer  recommendations on the possibility of disallowing those of them  involved in partisan politics from wearing their military ranks.  He gave the assurance that the government will always promote  their welfare but quickly added that government alone could not  do it and called on private sectors to help in this direction.    In his address, the military administrator of Imo State,  Navy  Captain James Aniko, pledged that his administration will accord  priority to the welfare of retired officers and men of the Armed  Forces. Navy Capt. Aniko, however, called on the retired  officers to offer useful advice and to assist him in his  programs.    Earlier, the general secretary of retired officers club,  Retired Colonel (Yakubu Anikolasue), called for the  harmonization of pensions and gratuities of retired members.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Urban agencies A ONE-STOP funding agency for urban regeneration is urgently needed. Its most important role would be to provide a single port of call for developers and local authorities who now deal with many different government bodies, departments and agencies. It must control the urban regeneration budget of almost Pounds 900m a year which is currently dispensed through a plethora of government initiatives. The plans announced yesterday for a new Urban Regeneration Agency fall far short of what is needed. The URA will take over only Pounds 130m of the government's spending - leaving huge patronage under ministerial control. Rather than replacing existing agencies in the inner cities, it will add another. By modelling itself on the urban development corporations, it risks perpetuating the top-down approach, rather than encouraging local partnerships between the public and private sector. And it abandons the strategic approach adopted with City Challenge which emphasises the role played in urban regeneration by economic revival, training and housing. Without such strategic elements, the URA will be just another land development body rather than an urban development agency which can genuinely revive Britain's run-down and rebellious inner cities. The government should rethink the URA idea, to create an agency accountable to parliament through ministers, but with clear and monitored targets. Such an agency could and should control most of the government's urban programme. Government should also encourage the URA to extend the strategic approach adopted in City Challenge more widely (minus the threat to withhold funds entirely). Merely creating another agency on top of the rest adds to the confusion and reduces cost-effectiveness.</p>

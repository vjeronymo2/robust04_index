			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission received five comments, four of which supported retaining the Rule in its current form or with minor modifications, and one which supported repeal of the Rule. Most of the comments indicated that the Rule continues to provide a benefit to the industry and consumers, while imposing no significant costs on the industry members. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The one comment opposing the regulation maintained that it imposed an unreasonable burden on the Federal Trade Commission in administering and enforcing the regulation. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice, the Commission requested public comments on the following questions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Comments of the Consumer Electronics Group of the Electronic Industries Association (Electronic Industries Association) at 2&hyph;3; Zenith Electronics Corporation (Zenith) at 1&hyph;2; Chuck Cooper at 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Comment of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, Inc.

Has This Trade Regulation Rule Had A Significant Impact (Cost or Benefit) on Entities Subject to Its Requirements? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The majority of the comments indicated that the Picture Tube Rule has provided significant benefits to the public and the consumer electronics industry, and imposed very little costs on entities subject to the Rule's requirements. One comment noted that the Rule did impose economic costs on television manufacturers in 1966 when the Rule was first promulgated. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  At that time, manufacturers had to prepare and produce new advertising and promotional materials to comply with the Rule. Further, the United States was, and is to this day, the only country that requires screen measurements to be limited to the viewable picture area. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  After the initial modifications, however, the Rule does not appear to have imposed any further burdens on the industry. One manufacturer noted that the Rule has had ``virtually no cost impact'' on the company. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Comment of Electronic Industries Association at 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is aware of an effort by the Canadian government to adopt similar provisions concerning televisions advertised for sale in Canada. Further, the Canadian television industry is considering adopting a voluntary standard that would provide for measurement of only the viewable area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Comment of Zenith at 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

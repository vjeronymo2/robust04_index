			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / International Company News: Esselte ahead 27% at nine months Esselte, the Swedish office products group, saw profits rise by 27 per cent to SKr261m (Dollars 36m) from SKr205m in the nine months to September. Sales advanced by 2 per cent to SKr8.82bn and margins improved but sales in the US, its most important market, were affected by a product substitution programme. Lower hedging income increased costs by SKr40m to SKr143m. The company expects full-year profits to be around SKr400m, compared with SKr301m last year. Mr Bo Lundquist, chief executive, said sales had developed well in western Europe and the Far East. 'The market for office products is continuing to increase,' he said. The strongest divisional performance came from Esselte Dymo, the main office products unit, where operating profits rose to SKr215m from SKr167m.</p>

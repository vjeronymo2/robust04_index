			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: MGN shares to offer yield of 7% MIRROR Group Newspapers shares will be sold bearing a 7 per cent gross dividend yield, a figure designed to attract private investors. The public will be free to apply for almost all the shares laid aside for the UK market. Plans to place a proportion with UK institutions have been abandoned. These were the main points which emerged yesterday in last-minute adjustments to terms of the Pounds 245.5m sale. This amounts to 49 per cent of MGN shares at 125p each. Mr Robert Maxwell, the chairman, will be left with a controlling stake. He gave details of the changes yesterday while announcing that the 196.39m shares had been underwritten at 125p each. The 7 per cent notional yield, based on the dividend which the company said it would have paid if it had been listed throughout 1990, makes the offer pricing look cheaper than expected. However, Mr Maxwell denied the change had been prompted by concerns that the shares would prove hard to sell. Marketing had uncovered 'clear and substantial' interest both within the UK and overseas, he said. Citing strong demand from abroad, particularly in the US, MGN will increase the overseas share allocation to 40 per cent of the total, up from 33 per cent. On the pricing, advisers stressed that the pro forma historic p/e ratio, 10 at the offer price, meant that the rating on the shares was higher than many had envisaged. They said the higher yield provided by a pro forma 6.55p net dividend had been introduced to make them attractive to the private investor. It reduces dividend cover on notional 12.5p earnings per share to 1.9 times. The tabloid-sized prospectus, published yesterday, shows 1990 pro forma pre-tax profits of Pounds 83.4m. Applicants have until May 9 to submit forms which must be for 200 shares or more. The basis of allocation will be announced on May 14 and trading begins on May 21. Observer, Page 18 Lex, Page 20</p>

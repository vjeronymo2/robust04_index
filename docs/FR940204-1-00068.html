			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ms. Dee Warenycia petitioned the Service to list the callippe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> silverspot butterfly as an endangered species in a letter dated January  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14, 1991, which was received on January 22, 1991. The Service completed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a status review and determined that enough information exists to propose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the species for listing. This proposal constitutes the final finding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the petitioned action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 20, 1975, Behren's silverspot butterfly was listed as 1 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 42 insects whose status was being reviewed for listing as either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endangered or threatened by the Service (40 FR 12691). This insect was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed as a category 2 species in the May 22, 1984 (49 FR 21664), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554), Animal Notices of Review. Dr. Dennis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Murphy of Stanford University petitioned the Service to list Behren's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> silverspot butterfly as an endangered species in a letter dated June 28,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1989, which was received on June 29, 1989. The Service determined that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the petition contained substantial information indicating that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested action may be warranted and published notice of the 90-day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finding on November 1, 1990 (55 FR 46080). The Service did not receive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any new information in response to the November 1, 1990, notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the species was listed as a category 1 species in the November  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804), Animal Notice of Review on the basis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant increases in habitat loss and threats occurring throughout  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its range. This proposal constitutes the final finding for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petitioned action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Alameda whipsnake (as the Alameda striped racer) was listed as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a category 2 candidate species in the September 18, 1985 (50 FR 37958),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vertebrate Wildlife Notice of Review. In the January 6, 1989 (54 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 554), Animal Notice of Review, the Service again included the Alameda  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whipsnake as a category 2 candidate species and solicited additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information on its status. The November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804), Animal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of Review included the Alameda whipsnake as a category 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> candidate species on the basis of significant increases in habitat loss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and threats occurring throughout its range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposal to list the callippe silverspot butterfly, Behren's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> silverspot butterfly, and Alameda whipsnake is based on the best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available scientific and commercial information, various scientific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> papers and unpublished reports available to the Service, and information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gathered from various scientists specializing in these taxa, especially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Sterling Mattoon and Mr. John Steiner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Factors Affecting the Species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Lists. Species may be determined to be endangered or threatened due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These factors and their application to the callippe silverspot butterfly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Speyeria callippe callippe <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), Behren's silverspot butterfly ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Speyeria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zerene behrensii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and Alameda whipsnake ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Masticophis lateralis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> euryxanthus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The present or threatened destruction, modification, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> curtailment of their habitat or range <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The primary cause of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> declines of the callippe silverspot butterfly, Behren's silverspot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> butterfly, and Alameda whipsnake is the loss of habitat from human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities. These species are imperiled by the current and potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future destruction and alteration of their habitats due to off-road  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle use, trampling by hikers and equestrians, unsuitable levels of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> livestock grazing, and invasive exotic vegetation. The Alameda  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whipsnake and Behren's silverspot butterfly also are imperiled by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residential and commercial development. Off-road vehicles and human or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> horse trampling pose threats to the colonies of the two butterfly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species as these activities could crush the foodplants of the larvae or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the adult nectar sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The callippe silverspot butterfly was once more widespread in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> San Francisco Bay Area. At least five populations of this species have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been eliminated by urban development and other causes. The species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently is known only from two sites in San Mateo and Alameda  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Counties. One of the known extant populations of the callippe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> silverspot butterfly is located in a city park. This colony is small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and may be imperiled by human-induced and natural causes (Mattoon,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> litt <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., 1991). The other known extant population of the callippe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> silverspot butterfly is found on San Bruno Mountain in San Mateo County  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Mattoon,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., 1991; Thomas Reid Associates 1982). Although the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> majority of the natural areas on San Bruno Mountain have been preserved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and will remain undeveloped in perpetuity, collection of specimens by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amateur lepidopterists poses a threat, as discussed under Factor B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Behren's silverspot butterfly has been extirpated from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant portion of its former range, which extended from the mouth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Russian River in Sonoma County north to southern Mendocino  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> County. One of the six known historic colonies was eliminated by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing development (Mattoon,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., 1989). No specimens have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> observed at the other historic colonies since 1987. Currently, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> animal is known only from a recently discovered locality northwest of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the town of Point Arena in Mendocino County (Sally DeBecker, Pacific Gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Electric, pers. comm., 1990). The site is subject to grazing by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> livestock. Although no plans have been proposed for the site, urban  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development is occurring in the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / BNFL to cut further 550 jobs BRITISH Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) is to shed at least 550 jobs at its Capenhurst uranium enrichment plant, in north-west England, because of the collapse of the world market since the cold war ended. The job losses are in addition to 400 last year, and a further 500 jobs are under threat because of technological improvements. BNFL also announced plans to sell enriched uranium worldwide through a new joint venture with counterparts in the Netherlands and Germany. Enriched uranium has been treated to increase the proportion of uranium-235, the isotope that sustains chain reactions. BNFL produces U-235 by turning uranium into a gas, then centrifuging out the heavier atoms of the unwanted U-238 isotope. Enriched uranium is used in nuclear power station reactor rods and for military purposes. The end of the cold war has cut military requirements and opened the world market for reactor rods to Russian producers with low labour costs. BNFL said yesterday: 'There is now worldwide oversupply and the competition is becoming cut-throat.' BNFL, a public limited company with the government as its sole shareholder, said it would have lost Pounds 6m in the current year had it tried to carry on. It is negotiating to convert Urenco, its partnership with Ultra-Centrifuge Nederland, of Almelo, and Uran-Isotopentrennungs Gesellschaft, of Julich, Germany, into a company. Urenco was formed in 1971 after the British, Netherlands and West German governments agreed to co-operate on commercial exploitation of the gas centrifuge process. Ownership of the new venture will be split equally. Capenhurst's military and civil uranium enrichment operations are being split, with 600 staff being temporarily 'parked' in a new subsidiary until they can be transferred to the European company. The other 550 staff will stay with BNFL to dismantle and decommission Capenhurst's old diffusion plant and carry on making enriched uranium for the Ministry of Defence until the contract to do so expires next year. Fewer than 100 people are likely to be needed at Capenhurst in five years, when Urenco should have developed new, labour-saving technology.</p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LAWYER LOSES APPEAL ON CONTEMPT RULING  </P> <P> The 4th District Court of Appeal on Friday upheld a judge's order finding  embattled San Diego lawyer Richard Degallegos in contempt of court for his  failure to turn over a former client's files to another attorney.  </P> <P> In October, Municipal Judge Lillian Lim Quon found Degallegos in contempt for  misbehavior, willful neglect and violation of his duty to a client. Degallegos  was sentenced to five days in jail, but he filed a petition for a writ of  habeas corpus, prompting the appellate court to release him pending a hearing.  </P> <P> On Friday, a three-judge panel of the court heard brief oral arguments from  Degallegos and Deputy County Counsel Gary Seiser before issuing their decision  denying the petition. In an 11-page ruling, the panel rejected Degallegos'  claim that he was unaware that attorney Diane Campbell was seeking the files of  his former client, Victoria Manriquez. The court noted that Campbell had  written two letters requesting the materials.  </P> <P> The justices also found that Degallegos had the ability to comply with  Campbell's request to deliver the files but "willfully" failed to do so.  </P> <P> Degallegos, 48, said he will appeal the decision. The court ordered the lawyer  to surrender at the County Jail downtown at 9 a.m. March 15 unless a reversal  or a stay of the order is granted by another court.  </P> <P> The ruling was signed by Acting Presiding Justice Howard Wiener and Justices  William Todd and Richard Huffman.  </P> <P> Last month, the State Bar took over Degallegos' San Diego law practice after  Superior Court Judge Michael Greer found Degallegos incapable of serving his  clients. Degallegos is appealing Greer's order. The Bar also is pressing  charges against the attorney in connection with many complaints from clients  who claim he failed to complete work he was paid for, missed court appearances  and misappropriated funds.  </P> <P> Degallegos also is under investigation by the county district attorney's office  and a federal grand jury.  </P></p>

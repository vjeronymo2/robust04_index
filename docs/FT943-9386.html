			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Redrow expands in the south Redrow Group, the house-builder which came to the market earlier this year, is to further extend its operations in the south of England with the acquisition of the majority of the assets of Gudgeon Homes for Pounds 4.6m. The deal will add some 200 plots to the land bank of Redrow Homes (South East) and strengthen the company's regional presence established through the acquisition of Costain Homes in July 1993. The acquisition contains a large amount of work-in-progress at the redevelopment of the former Royal Marine barracks at Eastney, near Portsmouth. Further new sites at Portsmouth and Fareham are included in the deal. The schemes will have an overall development value of about Pounds 18m and provide an immediate profit contribution. This will further utilise tax losses available within Redrow Homes (South East).</p>

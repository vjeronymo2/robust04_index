			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ukrainian RUKh has called for immediate tough  measures against the Crimean leadership. A Monday [16 May]  appeal to the Ukrainian president, parliament and Supreme Court  says that in order to preserve the territorial integrity of the  country foreign interference in the internal affairs of Ukraine  should be rebuffed and an armed conflict provoked by separatist  moves by the Crimean authorities prevented.    The document points to the illegality of the actions of the  Crimean president and parliament, disregard for the Ukrainian  and Crimean Tatar communities and the policy of separation from  Ukraine. The document also claims that the Black Sea Fleet is  used for pressurizing Ukraine. "In these circumstances the  process of withdrawal of nuclear warheads under the trilateral  agreement should be stopped," RUKh believes.    Also on Monday RUKh sent a message to the CSCE and the UN  Security Council that claims that the present situation became  possible as a result of direct and constant interference of  Russian Government bodies in the affairs of a neighboring  country contrary to all declarations of the Russian president  and other top leaders about the observation of the principles of  inviolability of frontiers and guarantees of territorial  integrity.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: Basle shows the collectable face of watches - The latest trends and recent developments at the European Watch, Clock and Jewellery Fair FOR nine days every April, the Musternesse in picturesque Basle, Switzerland's equivalent of the National Exhibition Centre, becomes the Mecca of the watch world. Attracting professional watch buyers (and collectors and enthusiasts) from all over the world, the European Watch, Clock and Jewellery Fair is considered by many to be the world's most important trade exhibition; it is also open to the public. Each year, thousands make the annual pilgrimage to Basle to try to pinpoint the latest trends and to catch up on the latest developments - not only in the Swiss watch industry, but also in other parts of the world, now that Japanese and other manufacturers are admitted to what was once a strictly European fair. There is little doubt that in many countries, watches are becoming more collectable than ever before. The last two or three years have seen the start of a new industry: publishing consumer magazines for watch enthusiasts. These, in turn, have stimulated interest, awareness and understanding. They have enabled people to appreciate watches more for their beauty and for the immense technical skills and creativity which go into the production of fine mechanical watches. To some extent, this is a chicken and egg situation: watch magazines have given readers the information necessary to be able to appreciate watches to the full, but at the same time growing levels of interest in watches have stimulated the appearance of such publications. To a growing and appreciative audience, the watch is much more than merely functional. Wristwatch sales in the auction rooms over the last two or three years have seen prices rise sharply. Time and time again, new world record prices have been established, some of them during the worldwide recession. At the Basle Fair, where some of the exhibitors' stands cost Pounds 1m or more to build, there was mood of relief that the buyers were back. A few months ago, during the Gulf war, many feared the show would prove to be a disaster for the watch industry, but with worst of the crisis over, business was better than might have been expected. It would be wrong to imply that order books were bulging, but many exhibitors claimed they could see light at the end of the tunnel of recession. Times have been tough for most manufacturers, but a few of the most prestigious brands still admit with some embarrassment that there is a waiting list of three or four years for some of their finest  - and most expensive - models. This year, soft, curved lines are the order of the day and complicated dials are still popular in both quartz and mechanical watches. Moon phase dials have been very popular for several years, but their popularity is beginning to wane. The craze for chronographs - watches which incorporate stop watches  -continues, but this fashion may have peaked. At the moment, it is the designers of the finest mechanical watch movements who are being put to the greatest test as public demand for ever more complicated watches continues to grow. Another clear trend has been the announcement of limited editions. There has long been a tradition among the top houses to produce limited editions of some important pieces, but the last 12 months have seen manufacturers at every level of the industry jumping on the limited edition bandwagon. Undoubtedly, consumer interest in limited editions has been spurred on by thoughts of higher values at auction, in years to come, for a numbered specimen of special watch. This belief was perhaps boosted by the remarkable prices paid at an auction in Milan last autumn of Swatch watches, where some limited editions attracted spectacular and totally unexpected prices. However, as more and more companies join in the fray, the importance of a limited edition may be devalued. Patek Philippe, as always, attracted attention for the remarkable design and workmanship in their complicated watches, but they also produce designs whose attraction lies in their classical simplicity. At the other extreme, they offer lavishly gemset creations. They are one of the companies still embarrassed by the length of the waiting lists for a few of their most complicated models. Girard-Perregaux commemorated their bicentenary by producing a new version of their famous Tourbillon with three golden bridges. Only two editions have been made before - one in the 19th century and the other at the beginning of the 1980s - but both were pocket watches. (A tourbillon is a watch in which the entire escapement is fitted into a cage which constantly revolves, a device invented by A. L. Breguet). Girard-Perregaux have spent the last three years creating a superb wristwatch version. The first was completed in January and about 20 specimens will be made this year. Production will continue over a period of five years. Girard-Perregaux will also mark their bicentenary with a limited series of watches, called Anno 1991 and produced in two sizes. Ebel announced limited editions of their Voyager self-winding world time watch in 18 carat gold, which they have called Atlas. The dial features a map of the world, enamelled either with the continents in various colours or, for the sports-minded, in the five Olympic colours. On a strap, the price is Pounds 6,285; on a gold bracelet, Pounds 11,840. There are four series - combinations of the dial variations and strap or bracelets, each numbered from one to 80, and all water resistant to 30m. The other new design from Ebel is named after one of the finest wines: the attributes of a truly distinguished Bordeaux wine, a Grand Cru Classe called Lichine, provided the inspiration for this new model, the pride of the Beluga range which was already the company's flagship collection. In perfect harmony with today's watch fashions, it has generously rounded lines and adds a distinctively masculine accent to the Beluga line. Like its namesake, the Lichine is expected to attract connoisseurs. Interestingly, it is available not only with an Ebel-designed quartz movement, but also with a twin-barrel self-winding movement. This year, many of the top houses are incorporating power reserve indicators (to show the amount of power remaining in the mainspring) in some of their finest models. Ebel's Lichine is a good example, with the power reserve display featured on one of three subsidiary dials on one of the more complicated executions of this important new design. Jaeger-leCoultre are perhaps best known for their Reverso design, the body of which can be flipped over, with the dial innermost, for added protection. This well-established classic is 60 years old this year, and to mark the occasion Jaeger-leCoultre have produced a special version with a power reserve indicator in the top left hand corner of the oblong dial. The case is slightly larger than that of the classic Reverso, but in the same proportions. Its 37 components are cut out of a block of rose-coloured gold and polished, decorated and assembled by hand. The beautiful hand-wound movement can be admired through the transparent sapphire crystal case-back. The rose-gold version is being produced in a limited edition of just 500 pieces. From May next year, yellow and grey versions will be produced in an unlimited series with traditional rhodium-plated movements. Breitling offered an interesting new selection in their Astromat collection. Of particular interest was the Astromat Chron Longitude. This chronograph provides a permanent second time zone indication by means of a second hour hand which, when not needed, can be concealed beneath the first one at the touch of a button. A self-winding, high frequency mechanical movement provides a small seconds hand and date indication, and it also has a short-term time measurement function by means of the centre seconds hand, as well as 30-minute and 12-hour totalizers. A limited series of 38 watches with dials carved out of rock from Mars has been introduced this year by Corum. For several years they have been making meteorite watches whose dials are thin slices of meteorite, but the dials of this latest series are produced from fragments of Martian rock which landed on Earth in 1962. Proof that the meteorites came from Mars was provided by analysis of the planet's surface carried out by the Viking Mars probe in 1976. These watches have cases in platinum and red gold, as well as a certificate of origin for the unique dials. A new name is about to appear in the British market and first recations suggest that it will prove very successful. Sector is a collection of sports watches which combine Italian design with Swiss technology. Following tremendous success in the Italian market, one of the most important in Europe, Sector watches will soon be appearing in British shops. Although the brand is quite young, worldwide sales are expected to reach 450,000 units this year and to double in 1994. For those seeking the ultimate in precision, there are radio controlled watches by Junghans. Radio controlled clocks have been available for three or four years, and now Junghans have miniaturised the same technology for use in a wristwatch. Last year they produced a digital version, but this year they have introduced the much more acceptable analogue version. Radio controlled watches never need adjustment: they receive time signals from the world's most accurate clock, and should be accurate to within about one second in one million years. Each watch has a quartz movement which is regulated every few minutes, if necessary, by the radio time signal. As a result, the watch will set itself to the correct time after a new battery has been put in, and will change from summer to winter time and vice versa. The eternal problems of showing the day of the week, the date and the month are also handled automatically. Technically advanced electronic watches are not, of course, the exclusive preserve of European manufactures. In Basle, Seiko introduced the world's first perpetual calendar watch which shows the right date for 1,100 years. Most perpetual calendar watches will face problems in the year 2100, when it will be necessary to lose one day. Most pre-programmed mechanical and quartz perpetual calendar watches will no longer show the correct date, but Seiko's latest technology overcomes this problem. As a bonus, this model also incorporates an alarm which can be set as much as one month in advance. For the fast-growing band of watch enthusiasts from top sports personalities to musicians, politicians, financiers and advertising agency executives, the choice is enormous and manufacturers are responding quickly to changing demand. The last few years have shown the finest examples to be excellent investments, but a wise adviser is always likely to point out that, like most other investments, values may go down as well as up.

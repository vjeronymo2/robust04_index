			<p>BFN     [Text] Ejup Ganic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency and vice president of the Bosniak-Croat Federation,  who led our country's delegation at the talks in Geneva,  returned to Sarajevo this afternoon. Upon his arrival Ejup  Ganic gave a brief statement on the cease-fire agreement:    [Begin Ganic recording] We have done what the assembly asked  us to do. As far as Gorazde and the talks on the four-week  cease-fire are concerned, we did not agree to freeze [the  positions] that the aggressors tried to impose on us with help  from some UN circles, and we tried to decide on what was best  for our country.    I must say straight away that some new ideas exist. If the  arms embargo is not lifted there should be a reduction in  armament. [end recording]</p>

He was captured at his farm in Buenaventura, in the municipality  of Matamoros, Coahuila. There, one of the many outstanding  arrest warrants against the notorious drug trafficker and chief  of the ``Los Villalobos'' ring was executed.    Thus, the criminal organization was dismantled, with four of  its members apparently killed in the shootout; while two others  were arrested, and one police officer was wounded.    The report from the Federal Highway Police regional  commander, Rodolfo de Leon Barranco, described the incidents at  the drug trafficker's farm when police from various forces  arrived to execute one of the numerous warrants for the arrest  of the ``mafioso,'' perpetrator of various crimes in the  country's principal northern states. The police chief confirmed  the participation of members of the Coahuila Federal Highway and  Ports Police detachment in the operation for the capture of  Villalobos.    The police chief claimed that a confrontation occurred on  that site, in which four criminals, members of the ring and  guards of Jose Alfonso Villalobos Moreno, were killed. Two  others were captured, and a police officer was wounded. He  remarked that the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic  had coordinated the operation for Villalobos's capture, because  it is in charge of the investigation of the ``Los Villalobos''  ring.</p>

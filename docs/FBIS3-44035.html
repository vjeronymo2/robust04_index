A statement from the  subcouncil says the international community should be alerted to  the threat posed to the democratically elected government of  Lesotho.    The subcouncil says any attempt to replace Lesotho's  democratic government by force will not be acceptable to South  Africa, and the president of the African National Congress, Mr.  Nelson Mandela, and various foreign governments, have expressed  their support for the present government of Lesotho. It said  the involvement of the United Nations secretary general, the  South African Government, and the Commonwealth was welcome to  the subcouncil. The subcouncil concluded by saying it will also  welcome the monitoring of the situation in Lesotho and a strong  South African military and police presence on the border between  Lesotho and South Africa.</p>

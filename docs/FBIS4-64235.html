			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Victorino Ruiz de Azua report: "Aznar Says Gonzalez Is </F> Prepared To Ruin Country Rather Than Resign"]    [Text] Madrid -- The People's Party's strategy will not  change over the next few months. It will remain centered on the  economic crisis and political corruption, with the element --  added in the state of the nation debate -- of holding the prime  minister directly responsible for both problems. This was  confirmed by People's Party leader Jose Maria Aznar at the  People's Party Standing Committee meeting yesterday. Aznar  fired very heavy broadsides against Felipe Gonzalez, and went so  far as to say that the head of government "is prepared to ride  roughshod over the country provided that he does not resign."    The main opposition party will also hold CiU [Convergence  and  Union] and Jordi Pujol directly responsible for the  impossibility of submitting a censure motion against the  government. The People's Party leader was sparing of words at  the Standing Committee meeting in Madrid, devoted almost  exclusively to examining the outcome of the parliamentary debate.    Aznar expressed his impression that he "was in touch with  the  public" in the speech which he delivered in the Congress of  Deputies. "We discussed the problems which interest the  public," he stated, and the public "are aware that Gonzalez is  the problem and that he must therefore go."    But, according to the People's Party leader, the prime  minister "has a destabilizing stance, prepared to ride roughshod  over the country and to create an extremely grave and absolutely  uncontrollable institutional crisis rather than resign."    Following this diagnosis, Aznar called on his supporters to  stay "calm in the face of any circumstance which may arise," and  stated that one of the tasks awaiting them is to defend  themselves against the biased impression that there are similar  levels of corruption in all the parties, and to demonstrate that  in this the People's Party members "are not the same as the  Spanish Socialist Workers Party."    In addition, the People's Party has opened up a new line of  argument in order to hold CiU and Jordi Pujol responsible for  the impossibility of submitting a motion of censure against the  government. The People's Party is responding in this way to the  Catalan nationalists' attacks over the weekend. Pujol and  Miquel Roca accused Aznar's party of being anti-Catalan  nationalist, and called for not a single Catalan vote to be cast  for its European slate.    The People's Party response is to try to increase the  pressure on Pujol's coalition in order to ensure that its  support for the government ends up having a cost at the polls.  CiU's support for the government was one of the arguments put  forward at the Standing Committee meeting to explain why  recourse was not had to a censure motion. The other  explanation, set forth by Secretary General Francisco Alvarez  Cascos, is that a censure motion was of no interest to the  People's Party itself.    "In the case of a censure motion, you debate and vote on the  government's alternative blueprint," Alvarez Cascos stated.  "What mattered to us now, what the public were demanding, and  what mattered to the country was to debate the situation to  which Gonzalez' government has led Spain; not what Spain would  be like if the People's Party were in power."    Aznar's party did not wish to distract attention from the  government's responsibilities in the corruption cases, or forgo  inflicting severe damage, and did not do so. This is what  Alvarez Cascos told his Standing Committee colleagues. For the  future, the People's Party leaves the door open to a censure  motion, but states that it it will cross the threshold only if  there is a chance of Pujol and CiU moving.    The Standing Committee meeting was devoted almost entirely  to  the outcome of the parliamentary confrontation, which the  People's Party deems a complete victory, taking as its basis the  opinion polls published by EL PAIS following the last two state  of the nation debates -- 1992's and last week's. Aznar's  political stature, the party leadership believes, has grown  during this time, and the impact of his speeches on public  opinion has increased.    Also on the basis of the polls, the People's Party believes  that an important change has occurred in the public's  priorities, which endorses its strategy. Terrorism has  disappeared from the first place among collective concerns. The  two problems which now worry the Spanish people most are the  economic crisis (51 percent of those consulted) and corruption  (32 percent). Two years ago, the last-mentioned issue was cited  in a predominant place by only 8 percent of those consulted.</p>

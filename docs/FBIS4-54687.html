			<p>BFN     [Text] The fact that the chetnik security services are  aiming to discredit the international humanitarian organizations  that deliver aid to the citizens of Sarajevo is confirmed by the  latest case where they planted ammunition in a convoy of the  French humanitarian organization Premiere Urgence. This is  stated in a communique from the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army Press  Center.    After stopping the French humanitarian convoy, the chetniks  took the drivers and the convoy escorts to Hotel Srbija, and  parked the trucks in front of it. The operation to plant the  ammunition in the trucks was organized by Miso Mijatovic, chief  of the chetnik security services in Ilidza. He supervised the  following members of the aggressor's military police: Sasa  Rodnik, Captain Branislav, Dragan Draskovic, Boban Djurkovic,  Gavro Grubacic, and Zoran Subotic, who brought the ammunition  from a military warehouse in Luzani, and planted it the same  evening among the humanitarian packages.    In the morning the trucks were inspected in front of the  organizer and the members of the humanitarian convoy, while the  SRNA TV team was already on the scene, who filmed and later  broadcast the alleged discovery of the crates with the  ammunition.    This is contained in the statement by the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Army Press Center.</p>

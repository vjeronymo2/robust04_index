			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAST CHANGES IN SECOND HARLEM PROGRAM  </P> <P> Challenges galore awaited Dance Theatre of Harlem's second cast on its second  bill, Wednesday at Pasadena Civic Auditorium.  </P> <P> For Judy Tyrus, who -- with Ronald Perry -- danced the pas de deux in  Balanchine's "Bugaku," it was a test of stylized containment. How to convert  her tensile strength into a sober, geisha seduction? How to approximate the  supple, curving softness of Allegra Kent, who originated the role and inspired  its tortuous extensions?  </P> <P> Easy. By focusing on her expressive hauteur, which Tyrus, with an imperturbable  look and almond-shaped eyes, did consummately. Nor was she a slouch when it  came to the leggy hyperconvolutions or the flat-footed walk taken in tiny steps  or the insinuatingly precious poses.  </P> <P> For those who inherited De Mille's "Fall River Legend," it was a test of  dramatic realism. And if Cassandra Phifer fell somewhat short of the psychotic  rage that signals the Accused's patricide, at least she has put a down payment  on the role. Her encounters with the Stepmother, chillingly manipulative as  danced by Stephanie Dabney and with the Father, remote and remorseless as  danced by James Goree, showed touching vulnerability.  </P> <P> For the principals in Fokine's "Prince Igor" it was a far lesser thing, hardly  more than that of a Vegas dancer. But with her cool elegance Virginia Johnson  brought a regal touch even to the hootchy-kootchiness of the Princess' dance,  while Eddie Shellman gave his grinning-Tartar all to the macho maneuvers of the  Chief Warrior.

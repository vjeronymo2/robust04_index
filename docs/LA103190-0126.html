			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CLIPBOARD;  </P> <P> DISCOVERY;  </P> <P> THE RAND MCNALLY STORE  </P> <P> Travelers looking for "best bets" books, street maps and other guides to their  destinations now have a place in Orange County to stop before they go.  </P> <P> "We carry the world," said Guita Mahmoudi, assistant manager of the new Rand  McNally store in South Coast Plaza.  </P> <P> The atlas publisher's new outlet is one of just nine in the country and the  first in a mall. Its other stores are located in the financial districts of San  Francisco, New York, Chicago (which has two stores), Philadelphia, Cleveland,  Washington and Boston.  </P> <P> According to Mahmoudi, Rand McNally chose South Coast Plaza specifically  "because it was a good mall to be in."  </P> <P> The guidebooks and atlases that have made Rand McNally a household name are  available, of course, as well as books listing hotel and restaurant  recommendations and describing the history of numerous regions.  </P> <P> "We have about 20 books on each country . . . and 2,500-plus maps," Mahmoudi  said. "We have 60 different maps of California cities alone."  </P> <P> Regional topographical maps are also available, some of which focus on  communities such as Laguna Hills or Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> "We have access to almost everything," Mahmoudi said. "If we don't carry it, we  will almost certainly be able to find it for you."  </P> <P> Another section of the store includes educational toys for children.  </P> <P> "The world is becoming so small, and we hear over and over again about how  geography just isn't being taught in school," she said. "People who want their  children to learn these things must teach them at home."  </P> <P> Hours: 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday; 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday and  Sunday (the store will extend its hours during the holiday season)  </P> <P> Address: 3333 Bristol St., Costa Mesa (in South Coast Plaza, second level, near  Bullock's and Rizzoli's Book Store)  </P> <P> Telephone: (714) 545-9907  </P></p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Birds Eye fined over soya content BIRDS EYE WALLS, the food company, was yesterday fined Pounds 4,400 for failing to indicate the use of texture soya protein in the names of some of their beef and chicken products. The company, part of the Unilever group, was also ordered to pay Pounds 15,000 costs by magistrates in Telford, Shropshire, at the end of a two-day trial. Birds Eye Walls had denied seven charges brought by Shropshire County Council's trading standards department. Four charges under the food labelling regulations alleged the names used to describe the products did not mention soya protein, and were 'not sufficiently precise to tell a buyer the true nature of the food'.</p>

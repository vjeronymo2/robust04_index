			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: A success story of swings and roundabouts - The world's emerging markets Emerging markets were the success story of 1993. They not only captured the investor's imagination with their exoticism; they also delivered in terms of performance. The emerging markets index of the International Finance Corporation, a subsidiary of the World Bank, doubled between the beginning of 1993 and 1994. This year, though, investors also got a taste of the volatility which is a feature of these markets - the index fell by 14 per cent in the three months between February and May. It has, however, bounced back and now stands 8 per cent higher than at the start of the year. Rachael Maunders, of Govett Emerging Markets, says: 'Certain markets have bounced back more sharply than others. Some may only have 5 per cent more to go; but others like Argentina, Taiwan and Korea have more scope - possibly 15 per cent or more.' Why invest? A portfolio of emerging markets is not an alternative to investment in more mature markets but, as emerging markets are expected to have far higher growth rates than the OECD countries, a holding is essential for a well-spread portfolio. Emerging markets are more volatile than others, as the chart shows. But Barings (which also has an emerging markets index) has figures to show that not only will a holding of between 10 and 30 per cent, added to a portfolio of FT-A All-Share stocks, increase the return to the investor  - it will actually reduce risk as well. This is because emerging markets tend to behave very differently from each other - when one falls 10 per cent in a week, another will probably be rising just as fast or faster to compensate. Last year, when all the markets seemed to be heading in the same direction - upwards - there were worries that the lack of correlation was disappearing. This year, they have returned to unrelated form: Brazil is up 80 per cent; Turkey is down by two-thirds. Which markets? Emerging markets tend to be categorised according to three main groupings: the Far East, Latin America, and the rest. For many fund managers, the region itself is less important than the quality and tradeability of stocks. Some may also invest on the basis of a certain country's anticipated growth rate. Richard Bade, of Commercial Union, manages the Prosperity emerging markets unit trust and believes that a lot of the uncertainty, which caused the markets to fall earlier this year after the US Federal Reserve bank first raised interest rates, has now gone. 'The sudden reversal in US policy affected capital flows to emerging markets, but the last interest rate move should have been sufficient to satisfy the markets.' His fund is 50 per cent invested in the Far East with a lot of exposure to China, which Bade favours for its culture of entrepreneurship. Some funds also look closer to home. Steve Bates, of Flemings, is positive about eastern Europe, principally Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 'We think there is a cyclical reason to be exposed there because of the leverage to the European recovery, but also for the long-term reason that those economies are starting to grow under their own steam.' Even so, eastern Europe accounts for less than 5 per cent of the fund because the markets are still so small. Arnab Banerji, of Foreign &amp; Colonial, has high hopes for some of the larger markets, particularly Brazil, Mexico, India and South Korea, but he is also keeping a close eye on a few of the relative minnows such as Peru, Bangladesh and Morocco. 'Bangladesh is about the best-performing market in the world this year,' Banerji says. The problem for would-be investors is that it is tiny, with a market capitalisation of about Dollars 1bn. How do you invest? Direct investment in emerging markets is only for the professionals - and even they can find it taxing at times, since these markets tend to be relatively illiquid. The simplest way for UK-based investors to gain exposure is through a unit or investment trust. Since unit trusts are open-ended, the fund manager faces the problem of having to sell holdings quickly to meet redemptions if panic sets in and investors want to liquidate their holdings. Investment trusts, which are closed-end funds, do not have this problem but, instead, might fall to a deep discount if the fund or the countries in which it invests become unpopular. A global fund is less risky than a regional fund because of its wider spread; single-country funds are likely to be more volatile than either. Some global funds are more diversified than others. If a manager takes a big bet on an individual market, and invests a quarter of his fund in it, the fund should outperform its peers if the bet pays off. But if, rather than rising, the market collapses, the fund could lose a large chunk of its assets. Kenneth King, head of emerging markets at Kleinwort Benson, imposes strict asset allocation rules in order to reduce risk. No more than 10 per cent of the fund is ever invested in any single market. If a market has risen more than 50 per cent over a year, the maximum holding is cut to 7.5 per cent. If a market has halved in 12 months, the fund must have 2.5 per cent in it. This approach means that the Kleinwort fund is never affected too badly by the swings in individual markets, which can be extreme: since 1987, Turkey has been the world's best-performing stock market for three one-year periods  -but has also been the worst performer three times. Funds investing solely in emerging markets are relatively recent; few have a track record even of three years. The tables list the performance of those that have more than a one-year record. A number of funds have been launched in the past year. Portfolio's Fund of Emerging Markets fund is a unit trust investing in closed end funds. It picks the funds according to a combination of asset allocation, management quality, size of discount and redemption terms. City of London Emerging Markets - a unit trust which also invests in closed-end funds - this year acquired a twin in the form of the Emerging Markets Country investment trust. Another investment trust too new to be included in the table is Abtrust's Emerging Economies fund, which is the second best-performing in the sector over six months.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Emerging market funds: investment trusts  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fund name                 Size (Pounds m)     1 yr    3 yrs  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Beta Global emerg mrkts           52.3       32.3      82.2 Fleming emerg mrkts              165.7       20.8         - For &amp; Col emerg mrkts            125.7       51.6     180.4 Govett emerg mrkts                43.1       17.0         - Kleinwort emerg mrkts             34.9       27.3         - Templeton emerg mrkts            343.9       18.8     154.2 Average emerg mrkts                  -       22.4     110.4 Average int growth                   -       18.9      68.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The table shows the percentage change of global emerging market investment trusts over one and three years to August 1.

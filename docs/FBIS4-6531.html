			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- Foreign political  parties and public organisations urged the United States to  immediately stop all its hostile acts against the DPRK.    A resolution on invigorating the movement for solidarity  with  the Korean people was adopted at the 14th plenary meeting of the  Central Committee of the Peruvian Communist Party (Red  Motherland). The resolution said the North of the Korean  peninsula has no nuclear issue in actuality and that the  "nuclear issue" was intentionally invented by the United States  to divert elsewhere public attention from their nuclear weapons  deployed in South Korea.    It urged the United States to immediately stop the bellicose  acts and the campaign over "nuclear threat from the North."    The Arab Islamic Democratic Movement and the  Islamic-Christian United Action Front in a letter to the U.S.  President criticized the U.S. for reversing the agreed  conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York and  held that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be  settled through DPRK-U.S. talks.    The group for the study of the chuche idea of President Kim  Il-song in Austria in a statement strongly demanded that the  United States give up the scheme to resume the Team Spirit joint  military exercises and the deployment of Patriot in South Korea  and immediately stop all its hostile acts against the DPRK.    The Congolese committee to support the proposal for founding  the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo in an appeal to the  peaceloving people of the world called on them to heighten  vigilance against the anti-DPRK campaign of the United States  and denounce it.</p>

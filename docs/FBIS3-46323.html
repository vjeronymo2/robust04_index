First, I would  appreciate it if you would briefly tell me about the your  personal history.    [Rong] I graduated from St. Johns University in Shanghai in  1937. Immediately after graduation, I got a job at a factory my  father operated. My father and my grandfather had been engaged  in business since 1901. They operated factories. They mainly  ran a flour mill and a spinning mill, which were regarded as  important national industries in China.    If we briefly follow China's modern history, we realize that  China has experienced the history of imperialism, feudalism, and  bureaucratic capitalism. I was born in 1916, and, since my  childhood, I have witnessed the confused days under the northern  warlords and the Kuomintang [KMT]. Particularly when the KMT  was in power, I witnessed how miserable and how confused the  Chinese people were.    Honestly speaking, for some time before the birth of New  China, I used to have strong expectations for the KMT  government. However, immediately before the birth of New China,  my expectations turned to disappointment. Also, as my parents  inspired me with the patriotic spirit, and as my father had  remained in China at that time, I was also determined to stay.  After China's liberation, my contact with the Communist Party  increased gradually and, by and by, I came to be very impressed  and attracted by the pragmatic attitude of the Communist Party's  leaders and the staff members in dealing with the problems and  in carrying out their duties. While observing their way of  doing things, which was totally different from the KMT's, my  opinion about the Communist Party changed gradually. Thus, I  have come to realize that socialism is the very structure that  can save New China.    Of course, I had to come through very hard experiences  during  the process. In China, we experienced the unique incident  called the Cultural Revolution -- I am sure you are very  familiar with its history. Yet, I have never lost my confidence  in the Communist Party because I firmly believe that the  Communist Party has been working for the people and for the  public. Such a belief has been supporting me when I was  personally in hardship. In 1978, after the Cultural Revolution,  the CPC held the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee and announced that it would change its policy and  emphasize construction of the economy. The Chinese people were  very glad to accept the proposal that all people should exert  themselves in carrying out economic construction. I was very  glad to hear the resolution as I had been interested in industry  and business since my younger days. I felt it was my duty to  contribute to the benefit of the people.    [Takano] It was your sense of duty that made you establish  CITIC [China International Trust and Investment Corporation],  was it not?    [Rong] In April 1979, Mr. Deng Xiaoping, who was vice  premier at that time, called me and several other All-China  Federation of Industry and Commerce [FIC] members and, on the  premise that China was going to carry out a policy of opening up  aimed at economic construction, we were asked to discuss the  meaning of the opening up policy, that is, to discuss how  important it was for China to carry out such a policy. At that  time, Mr. Deng Xiaoping requested that since we were well-known  members of the FIC, we should make the most of our experience  and cooperate with China in carrying out its opening up policy.  Particularly, he asked me to exert myself in introducing  foreign investment into China in the future.    Coming back from the meeting, I considered the theme over  and  over again, and my conclusion was that there might be two ways  we could take for the purpose of introducing foreign investment.  One was to establish an organization similar to the existing  governmental organization through which foreign investment was  to be introduced. The other was to establish an enterprise -- a  public corporation in Chinese words -- and to introduce foreign  investment in the form of issuing bonds in the enterprise's  name. I thought that, by all means, the better way was to  establish a company which will be able to procure funds through  broad contact with foreign enterprises, and I proposed my idea.  I organized CITIC upon obtaining the consent of Mr. Deng  Xiaoping and the State Council, who agreed that my idea was in  line with their's.    [Takano] Please let me ask a question or two. While it  seems to me that the friendly relations between Mr. Deng  Xiaoping and you was an important factor making it possible to  establishing CITIC, I am interested to know who was the first  leading member of the Communist Party with whom you became  intimate after liberation. In the first place, was it Mr. Deng  Xiaoping or Mr. Zhou Enlai with whom you first became very  intimate after liberation, or whose personality made you feel  that the Communist Party is rather acceptable?    [Rong] While I had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Deng  Xiaoping from time to time at central government meetings, I  should say Marshal Chen Yi was the first Communist Party leader  I met. Then, of course, I had the opportunity of meeting with a  number of leaders such as Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou  Enlai, President Liu Shaoqi, and even Marshal Zhu De. In many  cases, I was urgently summoned to discuss China's government  policies. Thus, I have been associating with Communist Party  leaders for several scores of years.  <H5>  I Do Not Agree With the "Great China Economic Sphere" </H5>   [Takano] Though this is my assumption, your relatives are  scattered throughout the world creating a network. Has such a  network proved effective for development of CITIC?    [Rong] Though I suppose the network played its role to a  certain extent, I understand that the China Government's opening  up policy was the main cause for the development.    At first, to explain the idea of organizing CITIC, I  immediately visited, upon obtaining State Council approval,  Germany -- it was West Germany at that time -- France,  Switzerland, Japan, the United States, and Australia. To my  explanation that China was going to open up its door to foreign  countries, the foreign people accepted my explanation as very  fresh news, and told me it was an excellent determination for  China. I understand that the Chinese Government's opening up  policy is a very proper way for China's economic development,  making it possible to introduce and absorb foreign enterprises.    As you know, I was CITIC chairman before I became PRC vice  president, and I feel that the PRC Government's opening up  policy was one of the motive powers which helped CITIC develop  to its present level. Another motive power was the effort  exerted by all CITIC staff members. The third motive power was  the fact that foreign enterprises had become fully confident  that the PRC's opening up policy would never be changed in the  future.    [Takano] My next question refers to the comment you just  made. Particularly since 1991 and 1992, large business groups  consisting of so called "huaqiao" [Overseas Chinese] and  "huaren" [people of Chinese descent] have been actively  expanding their investments in China. A world conference of  Chinese businessmen will be held in Hong Kong at the end of  November 1993. What do you think is the role to be played by  the Overseas Chinese and people of Chinese descent living abroad  in achieving China's economic development, and in promoting  CITIC's business activities?    [Rong] Generally speaking, the Overseas Chinese problem is  very complicated. We use the expression "huaren" for those  Overseas Chinese who have obtained the citizenship of the  countries where they live, and we hope they engage in their  business abiding by the laws of the countries where they live.  They are of course welcome if they want to contribute to their  motherland through their business activities and investments.    We use the expression "huaqiao" for those Chinese living in  foreign countries who have not obtained the citizenship of the  host country. We also want them to carry out their business  firmly abiding by the laws of the respective countries. Of  course, they are welcome to exert themselves for the benefit of  their motherland.    As to the world conference of Chinese businessmen to be held  in Hong Kong you referred to earlier, I understand it is the  second conference. The first was held in Singapore. We did not  originally propose the conference.    [Takano] Recently, Japanese newspapers and magazines have  frequently been using the expression, "great China economic  sphere." It is a very common recognition in Japan that  something like an invisible economic sphere is being formed by  the network of Overseas Chinese and people of Chinese descent  taking part in the Chinese economy's development, which is  considered a very important factor in supporting the future  development of China's economy. Because of your position, I feel  that you are using a discreet expression, being afraid that it  might be taken as a Chinese threat if the Chinese merchants'  power became too strong throughout the world. Yet, what is your  opinion about the potential of an "invisible economic network"?    [Rong] Let me explain my opinion from two points.    First, I want to take the example of Taiwan. Taiwan is part  of China. Hong Kong is to be returned to China in 1997. Macao  is also to be returned to China in 1999. To me, it seems very  natural that these three areas keep very close economic  relations with China. From such a standpoint, we are hoping to  maintain cooperative relations with the respective areas, and to  exchange opinions as to how to attain mutual development.    Second, as I just referred to the problem of Overseas  Chinese  and people of Chinese descent, we do not want to use the  expression "great China economic sphere," and we do not agree  with such an idea.  <H5>  Macrocontrol Should Be Strengthened </H5>   [Takano] By the way, it seems that the Chinese economy has  developed too rapidly, creating an overheated situation, or  creating a bubble economy-like condition in the real estate  field. What is your opinion about the present situation and the  problem points of the Chinese economy?    [Rong] The shift from the planned economy to a market  economy is a very serious conversion creating various problems  during the process. Yet, it is considered natural and  inevitable that such problems are taking place. Since China is  totally unfamiliar with a socialist market economy, having  absolutely no experience in history, and as there is no such  example in foreign countries from which we can learn lessons,  the PRC Government is groping, or trying to find a way, as  development is taking place. Problems always occur in the  process, and it may be inevitable for us to keep moving while  repeating this problem-solving process.    In the process of development, every district throughout the  country became more enthusiastic, making active investment and  exerting themselves for the betterment of enterprises. Although  such enthusiasm is understandable, the only problem is that the  people tend to be hasty and to expect a quick return, thus  creating an overheated condition or, in certain fields, making  excessive investments. China being, originally, a developing  country, its economic structure is not so well-balanced.  Therefore, if an excessive investment takes place at a  particular field, it will create a further imbalance in the  economic structure which was originally out of balance.  Particularly, there has been an active request for investment  in various fields, creating a further shortage of funds. On the  other hand, however, we even experienced confusion in the  monetary order because the Chinese legal system is imperfect.    Also, it is my opinion that the real estate sector, which  you  referred to before as being overheated, is a sector in China  which should be further developed. However, as there is no  established commercial practice [concerning real estate  transactions] in China, the real estate market has been left  uncontrolled, bringing about the rise of real estate prices with  only a few people monopolizing the business. Therefore, the  Chinese Government has decided to employ a macropolicy to  strengthen macrocontrol. I think the situation has been  improved to some extent.    [Takano] I suppose that the introduction of foreign  investment will play a more important role for China's future  development. Though investment from all over the world will  naturally be welcome to China, which countries do you think most  preferable to make investment in China?    [Rong] As we are taking an omnidirection policy in opening  up our door to foreign countries, any country is welcome as long  as it is willing to cooperate with China for mutual development.  Since China is a developing country, we want to promote, based  on our open policy, economic exchanges with foreign countries;  and we think it will be wonderful if, for instance, we can  improve our managerial skills through introduction of advanced  scientific technologies.    We would like to cooperate with Japan, the United States,  and  Europe. However, in view of the geological location and the  cultural history, it is considered easier and more convenient  for China to establish a cooperative relation with Japan. Yet,  as far as we see the present amount of investment by country,  the United States ranks at the top, exceeding Japan. I  earnestly hope that the Japanese investors will invest more in  China.  <H5>  The People Enjoy the Benefits of the Opening Up Policy </H5>   [Takano] I understand that the Chinese Government is  exerting efforts in various ways to solve the problem of  economic differentials between the coastal and inland areas,  which have recently tended to expand. Are you also trying to  ensure, domestically, a well-balanced distribution of funds  invested by foreign countries?    [Rong] It is true that China's opening up policy is being  applied to the coastal areas first, and is to be gradually  spread to the inner areas. Particularly, it is necessary to  develop the social infrastructure in the inner areas. However,  it requires a vast amount of investment, also necessitating a  very long period for redemption. We intend to gradually improve  the investment environment, keeping pace with the promotion of  the opening up policy.    [Takano] In Japan, we use the expression "post-Deng  Xiaoping." Some people are afraid that political and economic  confusion might take place in China with the end of the Deng  Xiaoping era. May I frankly ask you about your opinion on this  point?    [Rong] China has attained its development centering around  economic construction, and the people's standard of living has  been further improved during the process. Around 1978, "the  Three Sacred Treasures" of the Chinese people were a bicycle, a  radio, and a sewing machine. Recently, they are a television, a  refrigerator, and a washing machine. Presently, the standard of  living has been further elevated with an air-conditioner, a  piano, and a camera becoming necessities of life for all the  people.    Since the fruits of China's opening up policy are being most  enjoyed by the people, it is certain that the people will oppose  Chinese Government leaders unless they continue to promote  economic construction. Of course, there may be a variety of  opinions among individual people, which should be considered  natural.    [Takano] Thank you very much.</p>

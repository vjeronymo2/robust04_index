			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. GETS GREEN LIGHT FOR 2 NEW TOLL ROADS;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: STATE TO LET PRIVATE FIRMS BUILD HIGHWAYS IN FLOOD PLAIN AND  RIVERSIDE FREEWAY MEDIAN.  </P> <P> Orange County emerged the big winner Friday when Gov. George Deukmejian  announced that it would receive two new private toll roads as part of a  unprecedented effort in which entrepreneurs would be allowed to build and  operate $2.5 billion worth of private expressways around the state.  </P> <P> One of the Orange County proposals, made by a consortium headed by Texas  computer magnate H. Ross Perot, is to build an 11.2-mile, $700-million elevated  toll road in the middle of the Santa Ana River flood plain. It would link the  Santa Ana Freeway near Anaheim Stadium with the Corona del Mar Freeway near  John Wayne Airport.  </P> <P> The other proposal, by a team including CRSS Inc. and Citibank, is for a  10-mile, $88.3-million toll road in the median of the Riverside Freeway, from  the Costa Mesa Freeway in Anaheim to the San Bernardino County line.  </P> <P> The completion date for the projects would be 1994.  </P> <P> The projects were among four selected by state Department of Transportation  after an unusual competition to see who could best plan, pay for, build and  operate transportation projects before eventually turning them over to the  state. The other two projects selected are in southern San Diego County and in  a fast-growing suburban corridor east of Oakland.  </P> <P> Deukmejian hailed the winners of the competition Friday as part of a "historic  public-private partnership" that would give congestion-weary commuters an  alternative to overburdened public freeways. Tolls on the new roads are  expected to range from 10 to 20 cents a mile.  </P> <P> "While privatizing roads is not something totally new in the country,  California's approach, I believe, is unique," Deukmejian said. "Rather than  dictating which projects should be bid upon, we allowed the private sector the  flexibility to go out and determine the projects that would best serve the  public."  </P> <P> Deukmejian won the right to take toll roads statewide last year in exchange for  his support for a 5-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax increase.  </P> <P> Caltrans Director Robert K. Best also said that "there are a lot of economic  incentives" for large landowners near the proposed toll roads to cooperate with  the projects.  </P> <P> He added that he had not realized before Friday that the winning proposals are  all in heavily Republican areas.  </P> <P> But that coincidence did not escape Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who  said Caltrans' bidder selection showed "a pro-development-at-all-cost attitude.  It's a Caltrans giveaway to Republican supporters."  </P> <P> Friday's action was just the first step toward building the toll roads, giving  the companies the right to negotiate with Caltrans. They still will have to  seek local environmental and planning agency approval.  </P> <P> Katz said he is upset that Caltrans passed over a proposal to build a  high-speed, high-technology train system from Los Angeles International Airport  to Palmdale. The project was the only one among seven submitted to the  transportation agency under the privatization program that did not encourage  the use of cars.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County deserved some extra consideration in the competition because  its residents voted in June to support the 5-cent-per-gallon gas tax, the  proceeds from which are being used to supplement the state's transportation  budget, Katz argued.  </P> <P> Orange County voted against the tax measure, which passed statewide  nevertheless.  </P> <P> "We've definitely been screwed," Katz said of Los Angeles County voters.  </P> <P> Also rejected was a proposal to rebuild San Francisco's Embarcadero Freeway,  damaged in the Oct. 17 earthquake, and another Los Angeles-area entry, for a  15-mile toll road through Simi Valley in Ventura County.  </P> <P> Orange County officials hailed their two new proposed toll roads as crucial  links in a freeway system overwhelmed with congestion but anemic in  construction money.  </P> <P> "I would have been shocked if these two projects in Orange County didn't make  it," said Bruce Nestande of Arnell Development and a member of the California  Transportation Commission.  </P> <P> Friday's announcement brings to five the number of toll roads approved for  Orange County, giving it the lead in private California roads. Two years ago,  the Legislature grudgingly approved the first three such roads, which would  serve southern Orange County. Construction and operation of these previously  approved roads are locally controlled.  </P> <P> The toll roads unveiled Friday would relieve two Orange County traffic  pressure-points. One would cut through the heart of the county in the Santa Ana  River flood plain, starting near Disneyland and Anaheim Stadium, through Costa  Mesa and ending near the airport. The project would be built in conjunction  with the Army Corps of Engineers, which is just beginning construction of an  ambitious flood-control project along the river channel.  </P> <P> James E. Erickson, attorney for the Perot group planning the project, said  commuters can expect to pay $2.50 to travel the road's entire length.  </P> <P> He also said Friday that the consortium now plans to ask Disneyland, Anaheim  Stadium, large office towers and South Coast Plaza to chip in.  </P> <P> "We're going to tell them," the attorney said, " 'If you want to get an  off-ramp into your parking lot, there's some value here. . . . We may be able  to put an off-ramp to your parking lot. Do you want to pay for it?' "  </P> <P> Erickson said the proposed road could also tie into the Amtrak station near  Anaheim Stadium, where the proposed California-Las Vegas high-speed train is  expected to terminate.  </P> <P> The other Orange County project would be a bid to deal with growing congestion  on the Riverside Freeway, where thousands of commuters travel through newer,  more affordable neighborhoods springing up in San Bernardino and Riverside  counties.  </P> <P> Tolls would range from $2 during peak hours to $1 during less congested  periods; limited free access would be given to car pools, public transit buses  and motorcycles.  </P> <P> Other approved projects are:  </P> <P> A 10-mile, $400-million toll road to be completed in 1995 from the Mexican  border to California 54 through vacant land in southern San Diego County.  </P> <P> A $1.2-billion, 40-mile toll road stretching from Sunol in Alameda County to  Antioch, on the edge of Contra Costa County. The road would be the first phase  of a proposed 84-mile loop through a fast-growing suburban corridor that  stretches from Oakland to Sacramento.  </P> <P> Best, the director of Caltrans, said Friday that all of the toll projects would  receive no state or federal money.  </P> <P> Although the state could assist by condemning property, he said, the winning  proposals are planned for existing public rights-of-way or are in favor with  neighboring landowners.  </P> <P> Once completed, the roads would be deeded over to the state, then leased back  to their builders, who would have the right to charge tolls for the next 35  years. Tolls would be set to guarantee a reasonable rate of return and would be  changed only with state approval, Best said.  </P> <P> Asked whether the state would bail out a private project gone broke, Deukmejian  quipped: "We'll let the next governor worry about that."  </P></p>

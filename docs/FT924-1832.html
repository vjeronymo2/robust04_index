			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / ITV will appeal on OFT rulings THE ITV companies decided yesterday to appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission against rulings by the Office of Fair Trading on the new central network system. Earlier this month the OFT said the way the ITV system planned to deal with independent producers was anti-competitive and was in part 'intended to have an anti-competitive effect on the television programme-making and the television broadcasting business'. The commission hopes to deal with the appeal in three months although it has the option under the rules to take a further three months. The ITV companies will appeal against three aspects of the OFT report on the network. The companies object to the OFT decision that ITV can only keep the rights of programmes commissioned directly by the network for five years with an option for a further two. That compares with ITV's proposed 10 years plus an option of five. They are also opposed to the idea that independent producers can be commissioned directly from the centre without the involvement of any ITV company, the responsible broadcaster under the law. The greatest concern has been caused by the OFT decision that options for ITV to acquire rights to further programmes in a series should not be part of standard contracts.</p>

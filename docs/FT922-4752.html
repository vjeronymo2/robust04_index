			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Kenya counts lost years in a tribal wilderness: Hatreds bottled up since independence have been released IN CENTRAL Nairobi a man from the Kalenjin tribe is pulled off the bus by an angry mob and hacked to death on the side of the road. Kikuyu people claim the revenge is justified for the many deaths of their fellow tribesmen killed by Kalenjin warriors in western Kenya. Leaders of the Luhya tribe demand that one of their ethnic group should be Kenya's president. President Daniel arap Moi tells Kenyans to beware of tribal and religious divisions, fuelled by politicians, and reminds them that Yugoslavia has disintegrated because of internal clashes. Seven months after Mr Moi bowed to international pressure and introduced a multi-party political system the genie of tribalism, bottled up and obscured during the repressive years of one-party rule, has exploded onto the political scene. Ethnicity and not ideology is now the key to the country's political future and the outcome of the general election expected within nine months. The Forum for Restoration of Democracy (Ford), an opposition coalition which six months ago offered so much promise, has disintegrated into predominantly ethnicity-based factions and parties while barely a day goes by without violent clashes and deaths. The mounting ethnic fragmentation is threatening the transition to democracy. The failure of Kenya, after 28 years of independence, to have achieved a sense of national identity and compete in forthcoming polls on the basis of alternative political and economic strategies has raised concern in both government and opposition. Mr Paul Muite, a senior Ford leader, conceded recently that, despite the hopes of the younger generation of politicians, Ford had no alternative but to base its political campaign on a cynical appeal for tribal votes and alliances. At the other end of the political spectrum one of Kenya's most senior civil servants said his belief in nearly three decades of development and 'nation building' had been shattered by the explosion of tribalism. 'Ask me what the difference is between all the people running for president in terms of their policies and I haven't a clue,' he said. These rivalries and tensions are exacerbated by the fact that the economy is in severe depression. Gross domestic product growth slowed to 2.2 per cent in 1991, down from 4.3 per cent in 1990 - a real per capita income decline of between 1.5 and 2 per cent. Tribalist political fears are also intensified by competition for jobs, rising land hunger and a Westminster constitution which, based on a winner-takes-all principle, may be unable to accommodate the concerns of minority tribes being marginalised by political change. Those fears are particularly pronounced in Kenya given the political tradition that the tribe that has won the presidency has favoured its own. While many countries have pork-barrel politics, in Kenya it extends to the provision of the most basic services such as clinics, schools or roads. Critics argue that President Moi's warning that multi-party politics would lead to tribal rivalry was a self-fulfilling prophecy, claiming that government has instigated the violence in western Kenya that has claimed 300 lives over the past three months. The allegation has been supported by the clergy and opposition politicians. The government denies the charges. Whatever the truth, it is clear that the years since independence have provided only a veneer of a national identity.  Fundamental divisions remain. Furthermore the bitter historical political cleavages of colonial Kenya are beginning to re-emerge. Before independence in 1963 there were two political parties, Kadu and Kanu, which pitted the federalist Kalenjin, Luhya and other minority tribes who feared political submersion against the centralist Kikuyu and Luo tribes. With Ford looking increasingly dominated by the Luo and the Kikuyu a complex political operation appears to be taking shape led by Mr Martin Shikuku, a Luhya and currently a senior Ford official, to lead the Luhya back to Kanu under Mr Moi, a Kalenjin. Both Mr Moi and Mr Shikuku were leaders of Kadu before the two parties merged at independence. Part of the explanation to the strength of tribal politics lies in the way political power has been used since independence. In his 14 years in office President Moi first sought to redress the imbalance in favour of the Kikuyu tribe left by former president Jomo Kenyatta. But in the later years of his rule he has turned the Kalenjin tribe from a disadvantaged minority to a dominating elite occupying a disproportionate share of senior government and parastatal jobs which has left the Kikuyu in particular feeling they have been marginalised. Many Kenyans are coming to realise that before this minority can be persuaded to surrender power through the ballot box it and its allies will have to be convinced that they will not be expelled from the political arena altogether.</p>

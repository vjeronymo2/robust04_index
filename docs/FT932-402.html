			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Letter: No basis for French accusations about Attali's downfall Sir, Mr Roland Dumas, former foreign minister of France, accuses the 'Anglo-Saxon establishment' of bringing about the downfall of Jacques Attali ('Attali quits as EBRD chief 'in bank's interest'', June 26). Je regrette - only Mr Attali himself is responsible. The 'Anglo-Saxon' press - yourselves in the lead, to your credit - merely brought the facts to light. Indeed, you missed some, such as Mr Attali's responsibility for losing to the World Bank Prof Michael Bruno, former governor of the Bank of Israel, who had accepted appointment as European Bank for Reconstruction and Development chief economist and then withdrew. All this is very sad, for EBRD and Mr Attali. For some time, I strongly defended both, Mr Attali because he brought excellent people to the bank and because he was an eloquent public voice for eastern Europe and the right western policies for dealing with the region. Your own editorial columns have strongly endorsed, for example, his views on opening western markets to the east. Those who saw no need for the bank ignored the historic importance of its mission and the unique profile of its activities. And with an African Development Bank, an Asian Development Bank, and an Inter-American Development Bank, what was anomalous or superfluous about the EBRD? Last autumn it was the 'Anglo-Saxon' conspiracy behind the troubles of the exchange rate mechanism and the franc. From Raymond Barre to Pierre Beregovoy and President Mitterrand's chef de cabinet, we heard the absurd story of Wall Street and the City of London leading the speculative attacks, inspired by Washington and the UK Treasury. Then Le Figaro defended Mr Attali against the Anglo-Saxons after your initial revelations. Now Mr Dumas expresses what will doubtless become conventional wisdom in Paris. In retrospect, perhaps the University of London was wrong in awarding Mr Dumas an honorary degree, at a time when I sat on the relevant committee. It is even more unfortunate that the Anglo-French relationship, whose cause we believed he had served, has been weakened by foolish, thoughtless, entirely unsupported utterances of this kind. Mr Dumas should instead have criticised the arrogance of power and the indiscretions to which it led in the government in which he himself participated. The bank will survive. Under good leadership, it has an important part to play in the economic transformation of eastern Europe and the creation of a dynamic, integrated European economy. Anglo-French friendship will also prosper - indeed, we are told that relations at the official level have dramatically improved since March. I sincerely hope so, since, like many others in the UK, I am francophile and francophone. But to promote that friendship we must vigorously protest instant falsifications of history by our 'friends'. As for yourselves, Sir, you are entitled to say: 'Nous ne regrettons rien.' Richard Portes, Department of Economics, Birkbeck College, University of London, 7-15 Gresse Street, London W1</p>

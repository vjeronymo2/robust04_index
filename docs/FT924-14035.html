			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Bundestag plans tighter control of EC issues GERMANY'S main political parties are expected to reach agreement this week on an important constitutional amendment, giving the German parliament far more power to influence legislation in the European Community. The plan, drafted by constitutional experts from the Christian Democrats and Free Democrats, from the government side, and from the opposition Social Democrats, would set up a form of EC oversight committee, along the lines already operated in Britain and Denmark. The new deal is likely to make Germany a less flexible negotiating partner, just as Denmark and Britain already are, because of their parliamentary control systems. The German plan would require the government to submit all proposed EC legislation to the committee, before it comes up for negotiation in the Council of Ministers, and then to take account of the parliamentary opinion in its subsequent negotiations. It amounts to the first time that the German Bundestag - the directly elected lower house of parliament - has insisted on real powers to oversee and influence law-making in Brussels. Until now, the EC committee of the Bundestag has been little more than a rubber stamp for the negotiations of the German government. Bonn has virtually agreed to similar powers for the 16 federal states in the Bundesrat, the upper house. German parliamentarians defend the proposed enhancement of their powers as an essential element of greater democratic control over Brussels - a demand sparked off by the current debate over the Maastricht treaty on European union. The Bundestag is likely to make the constitutional amendment a precondition for ratification of the treaty. They also say that its aim is to make the EC more democratic, and more integrated, rather than to resist the integration process. However, they admit that it will depend very much on how such a powerful committee operates. The plan won the backing yesterday of the Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Union Bundestag leadership, and is expected to be approved by the full constitutional committee on Thursday. A simple constitutional amendment will be complemented by an accompanying law spelling out the details, requiring the German government to provide comprehensive information to the planned committee on every item of legislation, including an explanation of its purpose, of the government negotiating plans, and of the positions of other member states.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Bakyrchik faces delay at gold mine Bakyrchik Gold, floated in London last year to invest in a mine in Kazakhstan, yesterday reported a two-month delay in commissioning its stage 1 sulphide ore processing plant. This would hold back the forecast initial annual rate of output - 30,000 troy ounces of gold - until January or February next year, said Mr Kevin Foo, managing director. In the meantime, however, following the recent placing and open offer which raised Pounds 25.1m, operation of the Bakyrchik gold mine, on Kazakhstan's north eastern steppes, was being transferred to the Bakyrchik joint venture in which the London-quoted company has 40 per cent. The delay in commissioning the process plant was caused by the failure of the associate oxygen plant and an imposed closure by the Kazakh authorities, who insisted on compliance with practices followed within the former Soviet Union. The Redox sulphide plant itself operated effectively when it had been run at design temperature and pressure. Recovery rates of 90 per cent of the gold were achieved. In line with expectations, Bakyrchik reported a pre-tax loss of Dollars 726,000 (Pounds 442,682) for the half-year to September 30, compared with a Dollars 67,000 deficit previously.</p>

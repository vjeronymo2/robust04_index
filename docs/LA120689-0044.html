			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT SIGNS LAW ADDING WILDERNESS AREAS IN NEVADA  </P> <P> President Bush signed legislation Tuesday designating 733,400 acres of  protected wilderness in Nevada and opening 2.4 million more acres to multiple  use under the management of the Agriculture Department.  </P> <P> The measure creates 13 new wilderness areas in Nevada and adds to one other  existing area. That would put 2% of the state's land under wilderness  protection, preventing development and such uses as timber harvesting, mineral  exploration or intrusion by campers in vehicles.  </P></p>

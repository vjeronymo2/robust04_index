			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / IG Metall calls strike in bankrupt east IG Metall, the German engineering workers' union, yesterday decided to go ahead with strike action in east Germany in protest at the cancellation of their wage contract by eastern employers. The union's national advisory council made their decision in spite of the fact that most of the former state-owned plants in east Germany are effectively bankrupt. Moreover, 80 per cent of the trade union's eastern members are already unemployed. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the union leader, said token strikes would be called from April 1, and a ballot for a full strike was being considered. The workers are demanding that their wage contract, which provides for a 26 per cent pay rise on April 1, and full equalisation of eastern wages with those of west German engineering workers from 1994, be maintained. Mr Steinkuhler, who has been a key negotiator with Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the national negotiations on a 'solidarity pact' to help finance the recovery of east Germany, rejected an offer of top-level talks with the employers in the Gesamtmetall federation. 'Now is not the time for talking, it is the time for paying,' he said at the union headquarters in Frankfurt yesterday. He rejected the 'horror stories' of the employers of looming bankruptcy, and insisted that the eastern plants could afford the pay rise. State-by-state negotiations with the employers on new contracts in the five east German Lander collapsed last month, and official arbitration failed to break the deadlock. The employers are offering a wage rise of no more than 9 per cent on April 1, to compensate for inflation. They are also seeking an extension of the wage equalisation process over several years, to allow the eastern enterprises time to become competitive. They maintain that productivity in east German manufacturing industry is 70 per cent below that in west Germany, whereas engineering wages already stand at 70 per cent of those in the west, and would rise to 82 per cent if the full wage rise was paid. Mr Dieter Kirchner, director of Gesamtmetall, said the employers' move to cancel the contracts was an essential step to free companies, under the direct threat of closure, from the excessive wage burden. IG Metall, the largest and most influential trade union in Germany, says the employers are seeking to break the wage contract system in the east, in order to undermine collective bargaining in west Germany as well. However local officials in the east admit that it may prove very difficult to persuade their members to go on strike, if they fear their companies will simply close as a result.</p>

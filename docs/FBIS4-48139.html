			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In Rwanda, there has been a relative lull in the  battle for control of Kigali this afternoon after a morning of  mortar fire and bursts of automatic gunfire.

I would prefer the matter to be carefully  examined, added Mr. Bizimungu, expressing the hope that the  United Nations would not come to drive the knife in further.

It is part of the whole  process. And at the moment when we speak about a cease-fire,  the other party has a different agenda. We do not recognize  that government. We would suggest instead a meeting with the  representatives of the Army, because, in the main, they are the  ones who are responsible for what is going on, including the  existence of this so-called government.

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Devaluation 'will boost output' MANUFACTURING output is likely to grow by more than the local economy in all but one UK region this year as sterling's devaluation increases competitiveness, according to a report published yesterday. Business Strategies, a consultancy group, says the 15 per cent drop in the pound's value since mid-September together with recently introduced higher investment allowances should particularly help engineering, a sector badly hit by the recession. Better prospects for manufacturing will provide only a modest lift to overall wealth creation and employment, it adds. With growth in consumer spending likely to be muted, and fears about unemployment depressing confidence, the small size of the manufacturing sector 'mitigates against its ability to drive the entire UK economy forward'. In an analysis of the economic consequences of the coal mine closures, Business Strategies says the programme could reduce UK gross domestic product by up to 0.4 per cent. There will be a significant impact on the economies of northern England, the east Midlands and the Yorkshire and Humberside area. In these three regions, the shutdowns are likely to reduce regional gross domestic product by up to 1.8 per cent, 1.6 per cent and 1.1 per cent respectively. Of the 11 regions, only northern England is likely this year to see manufacturing grow by a smaller amount than the regional economy. For the UK as a whole, manufacturing is expected to expand by 2.4 per cent, in contrast to the lower growth for total gross domestic product of 1.5 per cent. The report says the east Midlands, Northern Ireland, Wales, the south-west and the Yorkshire area will be the main beneficiaries of the better prospects for manufacturing, with output from this sector increasing for each region by at least 3 per cent this year. Unemployment is likely to rise to a monthly average of 3.24m this year, 3.28m next year, and fall after that, though it will stay above 3m until 1997. Such a level of unemployment 'may have profound effects' through limiting growth. It 'will certainly pose a huge burden on the economy' at the time of the next cyclical downturn which, the report predicts, will take place in four years after an upturn. According to Business Strategies, engineering production including manufacture of metal goods and vehicles will increase by a relatively healthy 2.6 per cent this year after falls of 7.4 per cent and 2.5 per cent in 1991 and 1992 respectively. Much of this extra production will be due to rising exports, expected to rise by 4.8 per cent for the UK as a whole. Metals, minerals and chemicals will see a rise in output of 2.7 per cent this year while the star of the manufacturing firmament could turn out to be the footwear and clothing industry, with an expected rise in output of 4.7 per cent. Sales volume growth in services generally is likely to be depressed, with output from hotels, distribution and catering expected to rise by just 1.4 per cent this year.

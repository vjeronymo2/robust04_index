			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Mar 02, BNS -- The state border between  Estonia and Russia runs along the present so-called  administrative border, Russia's chief negotiator Ambassador  Vasiliy Svirin stated at a press conference today.    The Russian diplomat said his country's position is based on  the U.N. resolutions and documents as well as the final act of  the 1975 Helsinki conference, under the terms of which the  post-war status quo must be preserved in Europe. Svirin also  pointed out that the agreement on the principles of bilateral  relations concluded between Estonia and Russia in 1991  stipulates that both parties respect one another's territorial  integrity.    Svirin told BNS at the press conference that, if Estonia  also  in the future refuses to demarcate the land border, Russia "will  be forced to do it unilaterally."    "Allow me to remind you that Estonia was the first to  station  its border guards on the present borderline in 1992," the  Russian diplomat said. "The border between Estonia and Russia  runs along its present line, and fruitless discussions about the  issue may further strain the relations between our countries."    Vaino Reinart, head of the Estonian delegation for talks  with  Russia, announced that Estonia proposed during the 17th round of  talks to discuss the border issue and the interpretation of the  1920 Tartu Peace Treaty in the Hague Court.    "Regrettably, the Russian delegation rejected our proposal,"  Reinart said.    Svirin affirmed that Russia does not consider it necessary  to  take the border issue to the Hague Court. He said, however,  that Estonia "has of course the right to approach the court."</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RULING RAISES CUP FOR SAN DIEGANS;  </P> <P> YACHT OFFICIAL SAYS IT'S WHAT THEY EXPECTED ALL ALONG  </P> <P> The club room of the San Diego Yacht Club was filled with lights, cameras,  minicams -- and people. A sign on the wall read "Capacity 120 Persons," but  many more were cramped inside.  </P> <P> A banner on the wall bore a picture of the America's Cup with this inscription:  </P> <P> "Welcome Home, Baby! Our Cup runneth over with joy! Sept. 19, 1989."  </P> <P> A huge angel food cake at the front of the room was decorated with thick  chocolate frosting that read:  </P> <P> "Thumbs Up, Cup!"  </P> <P> Francis S. Radford, vice commodore of the yacht club, called the symbol  appropriate, saying that Tuesday's 4-1 decision by the appellate division of  the New York Supreme Court -- overturning the New Zealand challenge and giving  the Cup back to San Diego -- was "like frosting on the cake . . . the outcome  is what we expected all along."  </P> <P> Gone was any talk that the matter might not be over yet. Michael Fay, head of  the New Zealand Challenge, could still petition the court by Oct. 19 to have  the case heard at a higher level. One point in San Diego's favor is that the  higher court may elect not to hear the case, in effect upholding Tuesday's  ruling.  </P> <P> If that is the case, then the Cup will be contested in full grandeur here  starting in the fall, 1991, almost four years after Dennis Conner, sailing  Stars &amp; Stripes '87, won the Cup for the San Diego Yacht Club at Fremantle,  Australia.  </P> <P> So, in the meantime, San Diego celebrated the decision. Local officials  estimated the Cup could mean a $1-billion windfall for city coffers. Sailing  syndicates from a legion of foreign countries could begin arriving in the city  as early as the fall of 1991, with championship races being held in May, 1992.  </P> <P> Radford and Thomas F. Ehman Jr., the executive vice president and general  manager of the America's Cup organizing committee, told reporters and yacht  club members that they expected the Cup to remain in San Diego and that  preparations for the '92 defense would begin, in Ehman's words, "immediately."  </P> <P> Radford said the San Diego Yacht Club had spent "more than $1 million" on legal  fees in the past year, although he declined to give an exact amount.  </P> <P> While conceding the legal battle as "acrimonious" and "unfortunate," he said  the "perverse side effect" was that awareness of and interest in the America's  Cup had never been greater. He said that San Diego, more than any host city  before it, would be the direct beneficiary of an "unintended but very effective  marketing campaign."  </P> <P> Tom Mitchell, a spokesman for the America's Cup organizing committee, agreed:  </P> <P> "The long-term impact (of the legal battle) is that it's made the event more  popular than ever. People who never heard of the America's Cup have heard of it  now. There was a Gallup Poll last year that pointed out that 79% of the  American public had heard of the Cup. That's incredible.  </P> <P> "As recently as 1983, we were dealing with an event that wasn't all that  popular in terms of international recognition. So, in the long run, it's great  for us. We win in several ways.  </P> <P> "We win not only in the sense that controversy sells newspapers, but now  there's an incredible sense of cooperation between challengers and defenders.  No one wants this kind of bitter acrimony to surface ever again. Everyone has  agreed to a new class of boat, and now we're ready to get on with the race."  </P> <P> San Diego community leaders were obviously optimistic. Vince Benstead,  president of the Greater San Diego Sports Assn., said by hosting the 28th  America's Cup San Diego's status as a sports city would rise. He alluded to  such other events as Super Bowl XXII and the America's Cup Challenge in 1988,  San Diego's being named the site of the 1992 baseball All-Star game (the 1978  game was played here), and "Now this," he said. "I can't think of a more  deserving place."  </P> <P> Benstead said that committees would soon be formed to "organize the event in  every way, shape and form." He said that "every last detail" would include  planning on the part of the city, the San Diego Police Department, the Coast  Guard, the Navy, the Board of Port Commissioners, the San Diego Chamber of  Commerce and the San Diego Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau.  </P> <P> Radford said that May of '92 was picked because February to May "offers the  best four-month window in San Diego from everything to wind and weather to  hotel space. We're looking at a terrific event."  </P> <P> AMERICA'S CUP RULING  </P> <P> The New York Supreme Court returns the America's Cup to San Diego. Rich  Roberts' story, Part I, Page 1.  </P> <P> CUP CONTROVERSY CHRONOLOGY  </P> <P> Feb. 4, 1987 -- Dennis Conner, sailing Stars &amp; Stripes '87 12-meter, wins  America's Cup for San Diego Yacht Club by defeating Kookaburra III in four  consecutive races at Fremantle, Australia.  </P> <P> July 17, 1987 -- Michael Fay, head of a New Zealand syndicate, challenges San  Diego YC on behalf of Mercury Bay Boating Club and declares he will sail a boat  measuring 90 feet at the waterline -- the largest permitted by the rules. His  challenge ignored, Fay goes to court.  </P> <P> Nov. 25, 1987 -- New York State Supreme Court Justice Carmen Ciparick rules  that San Diego YC must defend against Mercury Bay.  </P> <P> Sept. 7 and 9, 1988 -- Conner, sailing a 60-foot catamaran, defeats New  Zealand's 130-foot monohull in two consecutive lopsided races. Fay returns to  court.  </P> <P> March 28, 1989 -- Ciparick rules catamaran illegal, awards Cup to Mercury Bay.  </P> <P> Sept. 19, 1989 -- Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court reverses  Ciparick in 4-1 opinion, restoring Cup to San Diego.  </P></p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Nanny's desperate smacks Sorry about this. I had thought that Mr John Major's 'back to basics' speech of a few weeks ago was a clever piece of party conference nonsense, well suited to soothing his audience, but nothing to do with running the country. That has now been contradicted by weekend reports that the prime minister really meant it - that he has, indeed, sent a round-robin to his cabinet telling it so. Mr Major's purpose, we are informed, is to switch the focus of political debate from the economy to social policy. In the 1980s the Conservatives challenged economic orthodoxy. Now, in the 1990s, they will tackle the areas of social policy in which, it is noted in tones of horror, 'theorists' have dragged professionals and administrators away from common sense. The government will act. It will reduce crime, weed out 'trendy' teachers, re-train social workers, light a bonfire of regulations, make divorce more difficult for parents with children, and, as to unmarried mothers, stand at the council house doorway, arm outstretched, index finger pointing back into the snow. It is hilarious. Downing Street works late and out come these teaspoonsful of populism, served up as the long-awaited warm draught of long-term strategy. Let us sip a spoon at a time. The forthcoming deregulation bill will remove many small irritants, but that is overdue tidying up, not a philosophy of governance. Most Tory administrations slash away at old regulations, although some wait too long for heavy agglomerations to build up. I spent an hour on Sunday cutting accumulated ivy from a strangulated tree-trunk. This does not make me a landscape gardener. We are also promised two criminal justice bills. Voters know, or will discover, that nothing the home secretary has yet announced is likely to prevent a single criminal outside the ranks of those temporarily detained from doing his or her bit of mischief. I have fulminated as much as anyone against the 'child-centred' teaching methods of the 1960s, but, as the national curriculum takes hold, loony classroom practice is becoming yesterday's issue. If not, what have the Tories been doing about education these 14 years? True, social workers are unpopular. For this they have themselves to blame. Their fault is their unwillingness or inability to make a case for their profession, or at least one that outsiders can understand. We may be mildly encouraged by the news that the government plans to modify teacher and social worker training. It would be more apposite to write these long-suffering professionals down as convenient scapegoats. The most curious items in the list are those relating to divorce and lone parenthood, two elements in every package of policies for 'the family'. Like the autumn rains, pamphlets and speeches on this eternal subject patter ceaselessly down upon my desk. 'The traditional nuclear family - breadwinner father married to the full-time mother of their dependent children - is a minority pursuit,' said Ms Patricia Hewitt, the deputy director of the left-inclined Institute for Public Policy Research, in a thoughtful lecture delivered in May. 'Reports of the death of the nuclear family are exaggerated,' writes Mr David Willetts, the Conservative MP for Havant, in a 'Contemporary Paper' (available from W H Smith, 7 Holbein Place, London SW1 8NR). First elected in April 1992, Mr Willetts was quickly made a member of the select committee on social security. He carries the bags of Sir Norman Fowler, the chairman of the Conservative party. Ms Hewitt and Mr Willetts could prove their apparently contradictory assertions by the judicious use of statistics. The former's definition of 'nuclear' alludes to families in which the mother is not working; the latter includes all households headed by a married couple. Confused? En-ter Mr Ian Lang, secretary for Scotland. 'It is important to recognise that the family unit is not always what it was 30 or 40 years ago,' he told Conservative women in Perth on Saturday. When the smelling-salts had been applied, he added: 'We can wish it was not so. But we cannot just wish it away . . . the situation today appears to be less stable than before, but are people on the whole less happy? I doubt it . . .' Another doubter, one suspects, is the chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke. Mr Lang has given the game away, although probably without meaning to. 'In going back to basics,' he said on Saturday, 'we should not pretend that the only family values worthy of the name are to be found in the traditional nuclear family.' He has surely been reading Ms Hewitt. My own view is that this is a field in which the government should tread extremely carefully, if at all. There may be a case for altering the divorce laws so that couples with children are obliged to go through various hoops before splitting up. The relationship between single-parent allowances, the availability of council housing, and the propensity of some young girls in deprived areas to become pregnant is a complicated one. There may be an argument in favour of tightening housing and social security rules, but it should be deployed with care, and kept well away from the Treasury. That, however, is about as far as our political servants should go. Personal relationships should not be the province of any government, least of all a Conservative one that has elevated the cult of the individual to the status of a new religion. The logic of it beats me. Free market prophets recoil from the idea of a national transport policy, on the ground that officials cannot allocate resources as well as the market. An energy strategy is likewise rejected, for the same reason. Social engineering, which is what 'back to basics' means if it means anything at all, is apparently the exception. In the most directly private spheres of life Conservative right wingers aspire to be nannies. They need not be taken seriously. Mr Major's repackaging of familiar policies under a 'back to basics' label is a cry for help. Like so many western politicians, he needs an enemy. The European Commission is not sufficiently threatening. The trade unions have been vanquished. Socialism has gone. The Soviet threat is no more. This explains why the prime minister has put up tired old targets like 'Hampstead' and 'progressives' and 'trendy liberals'. It smacks of desperation.</p>

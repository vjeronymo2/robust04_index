			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "For India's Sake"] </F>   [Text] The feeble and amateurish denial by the Prime  Minister's Office [PMO] that it influenced the postponement of  the first `user trial' of the battlefield support missile,  Prithvi, is not going to cut much ice in a country recoiling at  the rapid pace of encroachment on its security and sovereignty.  From the pedestrian to the policy-making level the mood is  extremely sceptical of official denials that fail to stand up to  scrutiny, even for 24 hours. The fact of the matter is that the  Prithvi was to be tried by the Army for the first time, and for  which enormous logistical preparations had been made months in  advance. At the last moment the test was postponed to an  unscheduled date. Simple logic prompts the deduction that  something is amiss, especially given the PMO's penchant for  overruling those professionally charged with fulfilling their  assigned roles. So is the country to blame for smelling a rat  when the stench is overwhelming.    The attitude of the political authorities to the indigenous  defence programmes is niggardly in its funding and inconsistent  in its policy. But if despite these constraints, Indian  scientists are able to craft weapon systems that rankle some, it  is testimony to the nation's potential. The scientists are  inspired by a vision of India as a proud, respected and secure  nation whose sovereignty is not up for barter. Tragically, this  vision is sadly lacking among those who are taking decisions on  behalf of the people of India. Why accuse Washington of  imperiousness when India's future is being compromised by those  who perceive it to be a poor third-world country unworthy of  aspiring to the top league? This third-best mindset has  contributed to policies that declare India is up for grabs if  some President Clinton or Lee Hamilton so wills. Postponing the  Prithvi trials is yet another manifestation of this servility,  and whatever be the proffered excuses they are not likely to  seem otherwise to someone either in Washington or Warangal.    The US knows what India is capable of achieving and is bent  on ensuring that this is not realised. Applying pressure,  overtly or covertly, leads Washington to believe that India can  be checked. The Indian sees that lesson, and a more significant  one as well. The soldiers who were to begin their  familiarisation with the Prithvi and the scientists who  developed it will now be convinced that when the chips are down  the Government will also go down, on its knees. Delhi's  inconsistency with the trials schedule is not simply a matter of  changing dates. It sends an ominous signal that the country  will succumb even at the cost of its security and sovereignty.  After all, if there can be compromises over trial dates there  is nothing to ensure that induction will not suffer the same  fate. Testing is training, and greater the training the closer  India is to perfection. In effect, it is a simple question of  the vision for India. Prithvi, Agni et al, are metaphors for  pride and respect. They have been made by, and for India. They  are also essential in India's quest for an honourable place  under the sun. But that presupposes a similar quest by those  deciding the destiny of India.</p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. RIVER OFFERS REFUGE FOR HOMELESS IMMIGRANTS;  </P> <P> POVERTY: ABOUT 150 PEOPLE EAT AND BATHE THERE DAILY. DESPITE POLLUTION, THEY  SAY IT IS SAFER THAN SKID ROW.  </P> <P> Stripped down to their underwear and standing knee-deep in algae-covered water,  a dozen men hurriedly bathed and washed their laundry before "the oil and  chemicals" turned the swiftly moving current of a downtown stretch of the Los  Angeles River an iridescent blue.  </P> <P> A few minutes later, ribbons of bluish film began swirling around the legs of  the men, most of whom waded out of the water and onto concrete banks strewn  with rotting garbage and broken glass.  </P> <P> "The chemicals don't bother me," said a 26-year-old unemployed carpenter from  Juarez, Mexico, rinsing suds from his hair with water scooped from the river  with a rusty can. "I use soap."  </P> <P> Less than a mile from the heart of one of the world's most affluent cities,  undocumented immigrants spend their days in conditions that rival the poorest  of those in the Third World nations they left behind. On a river bank often  heaped with junk and garbage, an estimated 150 day laborers bathe, cook, camp,  wash clothes and defecate in treated waste water occasionally polluted with  chemicals illegally dumped in storm drains and gutters that empty into the  channel.  </P> <P> The river people of Los Angeles say the concrete-lined flood-control channel is  a quiet refuge from Immigration and Naturalization Service authorities, police  and the spontaneous violence of downtown Skid Row streets.  </P> <P> With little money and no Social Security numbers, proof of residence or birth  certificates, these men and women from Mexico and Central America find few  public services available to them. So they gravitate to the river in search of  people who speak the same language and are willing to share some beans and  tortillas and whatever else they have cooked by the river's edge.  </P> <P> "For these immigrants, the Los Angeles River has become the village well," said  Alice Callaghan, director of a Skid Row homeless agency, Las Familias del  Pueblo. "It is a place where 150 immigrants a day share friendship, food, news  from their homelands and information about jobs."  </P> <P> Health officials, homeless advocates and custodians of the river, including  railroad police, the Army Corps of Engineers and the county Flood Control  District, say the number of river people is increasing. That has raised fears  about the health and safety of those who live in a place never intended for  human habitation.  </P> <P> "We have to do something to stop this," said Dr. Shirley Fannin, associate  deputy director of the county disease-control programs. "These people are  deluding themselves into thinking this is a healthy, safe place to live, but  they are not thinking about the impact they may have on other people."  </P> <P> Although most of the water in the Los Angeles River is harmless, treated waste  water, more than 60,000 gutter catch basins in the city and thousands more  across the county also funnel pollutants into the stream ranging from motor oil  to insecticides. Late each afternoon, the bluish chemical stream makes its  appearance -- its exact source unknown by the river people or those who oversee  the flood-control channel.  </P> <P> It is an environment fraught with risk, Fannin said. "They do not stay on the  river; they go out to day jobs and come in contact with other people," she  said. "Why do you think Third World countries have tremendous disease levels?  Because they do not understand the connection between defecating in the water  and everybody there getting sick."  </P> <P> Callaghan suggests that it be viewed another way: "We deny people health care  and decent living conditions, then we are aghast when they pick up diseases and  bring them to us."  </P> <P> Transients have visited the river for years, but it is only in recent months  that authorities have become aware of its widespread use by homeless  immigrants. Keeping them out is all but impossible because the channel is  guarded only by chain-link fence, guardrails and occasional security patrols.  </P> <P> Although some have created makeshift shelters along the flood-control channel,  most who use the riverbed say they sleep in the rescue missions, service  centers and streets of downtown Skid Row, which is home to an estimated 11,000  men and women. There are at least 35,000 long-term homeless people throughout  Los Angeles, studies have shown.  </P> <P> Mike Neely, a spokesman for the Homeless Outreach Program of Los Angeles, said  that these immigrants migrate to the river because they "have found that they  are not welcome in town."  </P> <P> "If you've left your native society for another one that doesn't embrace you --  that in fact kicks you," Neely said, "the only thing you can do is find others  just like you with whom you can share your hope and misery."  </P> <P> He could have been talking about Jose, a 33-year-old former government worker  from El Salvador who arrived here last May. His goal is to find a job and an  apartment and send for his wife and four children.  </P> <P> Last Wednesday, he spent the day crouched beneath a bridge on the Los Angeles  River with two unemployed Mexican immigrants -- all of them waiting for their  hand-scrubbed clothes to dry in the sun.  </P> <P> "I'm embarrassed to tell my family I'm down here. . . . I tell them I'm sick  and haven't been able to find a job in three months," he said, clutching a  brown paper sack containing a stale burrito offered by one of his river  comrades. "It hurts being here."  </P> <P> Vince Sato, supervising attorney of the environmental protection division of  the city attorney's office, said his major concern for the people using the  river is the dumping of hazardous wastes and unpredictable flooding that occurs  during rainstorms.  </P> <P> "We receive a lot of complaints from people who have seen, heard or smelled  things in there," Sato said. "Unless you catch (illegal dumpers) in the act,  and catch samples before they are diluted in the river, it is difficult to  prosecute them."  </P> <P> The county Flood Control District analyzes the composition of the water once a  month at five stations between the San Fernando Valley and Long Beach. But  county officials contend that it is all but impossible to trace the source of  potentially toxic substances that occasionally run down the river.  </P> <P> "The water is variable from minute to minute," said Don Nichols, an assistant  deputy director with the county Flood Control District. "People tend to wash  things down those catch basins that probably shouldn't go down them.  </P> <P> "We find anything that will fit down a storm drain system down there -- from  dead bodies to countless types of chemicals. . . . It doesn't happen every day,  but sooner or later it all shows up."  </P> <P> None of that seems to have deterred Jose Sanchez, 22.  </P> <P> "At about 4 or 5 o'clock every day, oil and chemicals come down the river,"  said Sanchez, a day laborer who has been living under a downtown river bridge  for two months. "We don't bathe in it when the chemicals come."  </P> <P> Sanchez and his five companions live on wooden pallets and mattresses in a  trash-strewn alcove of the bridge. He sleeps on a fold-up bed perched on a  10-foot-wide bridge support about 50 feet above the concrete river bottom.  </P> <P> "The life I left in Mexico was no better than this," Sanchez said, running a  hand through a head of hair speckled with white paint picked up at a recent day  job. "What you see here is the life of immigrants who have been in this country  only a few months.  </P> <P> "But here, we are all united because we are all Latinos."  </P> <P> A few hundred yards away, four men fried chopped steak, carrots and onions over  a fire fueled with cardboard and pieces of wood. Their "grill" was a rusty  metal coil.  </P> <P> After breakfast, they planned to disperse to street corners across the city  where they hoped to be hired by employers needing day laborers at construction  sites. At nightfall, they would regroup on the river, one of them said, to  "talk about how the day went, who found work and how we can get work too."  </P> <P> "Here, nobody gets arrested, beat up; nobody sells drugs or begs for money,"  the man said. "The people here are peaceful."  </P> <P> As he spoke, an air-conditioned Amtrak train rumbled by with office workers  hurrying home for dinner. The presence of the bathers is a well-known curiosity  among commuters.  </P></p>

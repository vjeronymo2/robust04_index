			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / How To Spend It: Sales stamina brings home the goodies - Lucia van der Post tracks down some unusual and inexpensive items for around the house NO REAL New Yorker, they say, ever buys retail. Shopping for discounts, for bargains, for end-lines, is a city sport and one that New Yorkers seem singularly well-equipped to play. Here bargain-time is a moveable feast and the best of the prizes go to the fleet of foot. For those in an economical mood, suffering from what my son calls Post-Purchase Depression, now is as good a time as any to stock up on some of the things you need for hearth and home. The Curtain Exchange, for those who have not yet discovered it, is well worth visiting if you are in the market for curtains, blinds and other fabric accessories. The company sells top quality, second-hand curtains at good prices and the branch I have visited (133 Stephendale Road, London SW6) always seems to have a vast range in a wide variety of styles. It has just opened its tenth shop in Parbold, Lancashire, but for details of your nearest branch you should telephone 071-731-8316. Crucial Trading of 77 Westbourne Park Road, London W2 and 4 St Barnabas Street, Pimlico Green, London SW1, always a good source of splendid, relatively inexpensive floor coverings made from seagrass, jute, sisal and coir, and now has a sale in which some of the ranges are reduced by 25 per cent and more. It also has two splendid new ranges of floor-coverings - co-ordinated runners, broadlooms and borders in jute in sophisticated colours at Pounds 9.99 a square yard (Pounds 11.95 a square metre) and some pure wool flatweave carpeting in white, beige, pale chestnut, pale green, dusty pink and yellow at Pounds 20.75 a square yard (Pounds 24.75 a square metre). Kingcome Sofas of 302-304 Fulham Road, London SW10, makers of luxury sofas, are offering 20 per cent off all their designs - sofas are made to individual measurements and design and there is 20 per cent off the fabric as well. Global Village, purveyors of astutely-gauged ethnic furniture and furnishings to sophisticated Westerners, is offering 33 per cent off all its stock and 75 per cent off some of it. There are now 11 shops, including the main one at 4-5 Queen Street, Bath, and the London one at 247-249 Fulham Road, London SW3. Finally, if you do not have the stamina for the sales and prefer to do your shopping in the year-round factory shops and cut-price stores, it would probably be worth your while taking out an annual subscription to The Good Deal Directory. Published 10 times a year, it lists most of the 1,300 factory shops selling everything from designer clothing by such names as Nicole Farhi, Janet Reger, Burberry and La Perla, to cut-price carpets by Axminster, china by Royal Doulton, and fabrics by well-known names. It also lists the annual charity sales and the dress agencies selling nearly-new clothing by designers ranging from Chanel to Valentino. The Good Deal Directory costs Pounds 15 from The Value for Money Company Limited, Freepost (SW 6037), London SW10 9YY or order by telephone on 071-352-8976.</p>

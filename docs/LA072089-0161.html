			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL OKS WIDER CHILD-CARE TAX CREDIT  </P> <P> The House Ways and Means Committee Wednesday approved a sweeping child-care  plan that would provide roughly $5 billion a year in assistance, primarily by  expanding a refundable tax credit for poor, working families.  </P> <P> The plan, approved on a 26-10 vote, contains a number of similarities to  President Bush's child-care proposal. Unlike the Administration plan, however,  its benefits would not be limited to families with preschool-age children. It  also would add about $400 million a year to help the states support child-care  facilities.  </P> <P> It differs more sharply from a Senate bill supported largely by Democrats and  approved last month. A separate House committee is also considering another,  competing bill, but the House Democratic leadership appeared to be lining up  behind the Ways and Means version.  </P> <P> Bush had threatened to veto any measure that would subsidize child-care  facilities, but Administration officials waffled on their position during the  committee's closed debate on the bill, aides said. Although a Treasury official  at the session opposed federal grants to child-care providers, he did not  object to the overall measure.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the committee was nearing a vote on whether the capital gains tax  rate should be lowered, with both the White House and the House Democratic  leadership engaging in behind-the-scenes lobbying.  </P> <P> President Bush, according to lawmakers, began making personal appeals for  support of a bill to reduce taxes on profits from investments, while House  Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) urged the committee to preserve the 1986 tax  law revision, which ended the special rate for capital gains.  </P> <P> Under the child-care measure approved by the Ways and Means Committee -- which  is in the process of drafting a tax bill aimed at raising $5.3 billion for next  year's budget -- poor, working parents could receive a tax credit based on the  number of children in the family.  </P> <P> Under current law, poor families -- regardless of the number of children -- are  eligible for a tax credit that is expected to reach a maximum of $1,002 in  1991. The proposed new approach would increase the amount of the earned income  tax credit to as much as $1,790 for a family with three or more children, with  an additional credit of up to $430 available to families with at least one  child younger than 6.  </P> <P> The bill also would expand the system of making block grants to states to help  pay for child-care services. It would add $400 million a year to the $2.7  billion now being spent.  </P> <P> The overall cost of the child-care package over a four-year period, from 1991  to 1994, was put at $16 billion.  </P></p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / EC report criticises drug prices DRUG MANUFACTURERS in the UK, Holland and Germany are restricting crossborder trade to maintain profits in high drug price countries, a report prepared for the European Commission says. Drug companies keep sales to a minimum when supplying wholesalers in low drug price countries such as Belgium, Spain and Greece. Parallel imports from these countries into the UK, Netherlands and Germany account for up to 10 per cent of prescriptions, but could be higher if trade were free. The report says that companies' grip on supplies is either 'significant' or 'very significant' in holding back parallel imports. This could concern the European Commission as running counter to Treaty of Rome free trade policies. Companies are justified in doing this because price differences are set by governments rather than the market, according to Remit Consultants of London, UK. It identifies other restrictions on parallel imports including changing the name of a drug between different countries. This tactic is common in Germany, where prices are the highest in Europe.</p>

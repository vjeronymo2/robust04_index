			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Arts: Today's Television Embarrassment television moves a step further down the line today with the screening of a quiz show in which, we are assured, the competitors are all homeless, the winner gets a 'dream house', and the losers are left to the mercy of the streets. But don't worry; the spoof is all in a good cause. Channel 4 is presenting Come On Down And Out (8.00) as part of its 'Gimme Shelter' season which is focusing on homelessness. ITV's pilots for possible new comedy series in 'Comedy Playhouse' have mostly been distressingly bad. Today's programme, Cut And Run (8.30) is about a video company asked to film badgers as part of a campaign to prevent development of a golf course. I was becoming disillusioned about Philip Larkin after all the recent nasty revelations, but if his poetry infuriates Professor Terry Eagleton he cannot be all bad. Eagleton wades into Larkin in the latest of the 'J'accuse' series on Without Walls (9.00 C4). The second half of this nearly always interesting culture magazine is, again, presented by Camille Paglia, the American controversialist, who explores 'The Lolita Syndrome'.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Virgin takes BA 'dirty tricks' war to court VIRGIN Atlantic Airways yesterday launched High Court proceedings against British Airways following the failure of the two airlines to settle their long-running 'dirty tricks' dispute. Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman, said the airlines were now 'at war'. Virgin's writ against BA alleges copyright infringement, breach of confidence and misuse of confidential information. Speaking from Arizona, Mr Branson said Virgin had attempted for the past four months to reach a compromise with BA. But he said the situation had turned into a farce and it was now time for the courts to decide. BA said it regretted that Virgin had discontinued settlement discussions. 'BA has made it clear that any liability which it may have will be met in full', it added in a brief statement. The High Court action relates to Virgin's allegations that its bigger UK rival accessed Virgin passenger details and information as well as data concerning aircraft and load factors relating to flights and associated passenger and travel services. Virgin said the proceedings were only the first of several other legal and regulatory steps it proposed taking against BA in various jurisdictions including the US and the European Community. After BA agreed to pay Virgin Pounds 610,000 in libel damages and apologised 'unreservedly' in the High Court in January, Mr Branson warned he intended to take further legal action if he did not secure adequate compensation for the commercial damage he said Virgin suffered as a result of BA's 'dirty tricks' campaign. Involved negotiations between the airlines broke down on March 19 after Virgin rejected a Pounds 9m cash compensation offer because of what Mr Branson claimed was an un-acceptable 'vow of silence' demanded by BA. Relations worsened following a television programme last week renewing allegations that top BA directors were aware of their airline's campaign against Virgin. After the programme, Mr Branson challenged Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, and Mr Robert Ayling, the airline's managing director, to resign or sue the television programme. Sir Michael Angus, BA's deputy chairman, subsequently sent a brief note to Mr Branson with a copy of a statement by the BA board to the airline's staff giving its full backing to Sir Colin and Mr Ayling. It said the board did not question the integrity of the two executives. 'The view of directors is that any claims which Mr Branson thinks he may have should be stated in the appropriate courts and be evaluated after full consideration of all the evidence.' Mr Branson said yesterday Virgin intended to subpoena Sir Colin, Mr Ayling, and Mr Liam Strong, BA's former head of marketing and operations and now chief executive of Sears, one of Britain's biggest high-street retailers, to force them to give evidence in the High Court.</p>

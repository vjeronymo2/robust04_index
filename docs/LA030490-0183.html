			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> REBOUNDING KEYS LIONS' WIN IN WCC TOURNAMENT OPENER  </P> <P> For much of the season, the Loyola Marymount basketball team has won despite  some startling rebounding deficits.  </P> <P> But in the opening round of the West Coast Conference Tournament on Saturday at  Gersten Pavilion, the Lions were the bullies on the boards, and it resulted in  an easy 121-84 victory over Gonzaga.  </P> <P> In advancing to today's semifinals starting at 5, the Lions set a tournament  record for rebounds with 66. Despite an off night shooting from outside, the  Lions got 27 offensive rebounds to dominate inside.  </P> <P> Lions forward Per Stumer led both teams with 12 rebounds, and Hank Gathers and  Bo Kimble got 11 apiece.  </P> <P> Loyola Coach Paul Westhead noted afterward: "The insurance policy we can take  out on advancing is to be committed to the boards. We have not been that strong  in that area, and this was a new dimension for us."  </P> <P> Gathers, who led the nation in rebounding last season and is among the leaders  again, said that at practice Friday, "Coach told everybody when I'm rebounding  strong, everyone usually follows me. So if we're not rebounding, it's usually  my fault. This is bread-and-butter time, so I knew we'd come out strong."  </P> <P> The Lions jumped out to a quick 27-11 lead, hit a lull as Gonzaga pulled to  within 10, then put the game away with a 12-0 run. Despite hitting only one of  nine three-point attempts in the first half, Loyola still had a 59-33 halftime  lead thanks to a 35-20 rebounding edge and 17 turnovers forced by Loyola's  active press. The final total of 121 was another tournament record.  </P> <P> Loyola shot 50% for the game, while Gonzaga managed only 43%. Gonzaga Coach Dan  Fitzgerald said, "We really turned it over; we didn't handle (the press) well  at all. To have a chance, you have to hit a lot of good shots against them and  we did not."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on  24 April on page 39 and Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on  24 April on page 34 carry the identical full page National Party  advertisement. A picture of State President F. W. de Klerk is at  the center of the page under the heading "NOW IS THE TIME..." in  large black letters. The following text is printed over F.W de  Klerk's signature with the party slogans at the bottom of the  page:    "For the last five years it has been my privilege to serve  as  your State President.    "As the leader of the National Party, I made a promise to  guide our nation into a new era of freedom. I have kept that  promise. I made a promise to end apartheid -- and I have. I  made a promise to release Nelson Mandela and unban the ANC and  others -- and I have. I made a promise to hold free elections  where all the people could vote. I have kept that promise too.    "The National Party has kept all its promises.    "After the election we will have a government of national  unity. This means that the political parties will share power.  It is in the best interests of our country that the National  Party should lead that government. If you help us to win a  majority of votes, you will enable me to continue to work for  our vision of a new, prosperous and peaceful South Africa.    "We will have a great deal of hard work to do after the  elections. We have to improve the living conditions of all our  people. Because that is the key to peace and prosperity. We  must build houses for the homeless. We must ensure a high  standard of education for all our people. We must create job  opportunities.    "To do all this, we must make the economy grow through sound  economic policies. We must have low levels of taxation, low  inflation and low interest rates. And we must attract huge  foreign investment.    "Most of all we must restore respect for the rule of law so  that violence, crime and intimidation can be driven forever from  our society. We must ensure that all the people can live in  dignity without fear, oppression or humiliation.    "The only safe choice for all people who want peace, harmony  and a prosperous future is to vote for a strong new National  Party.    "If you give me your help, I promise that we will build a  great new South Africa.    "And as you know -- we keep our promises.    "Come, let us join hands and work together for a better  life."    "F W De Klerk  "Be Sure of a Better Life "Vote for FW de Klerk and the new  National Party "We've made the change"</p>

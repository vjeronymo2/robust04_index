			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chan Po-chung] </F>   [Text] Shenzhen's taxation bureau chief claims the special  economic zone generated tax revenue of about six billion yuan  (HK$5.34 billion [Hong Kong dollars]) last year, with about one  billion yuan garnered from Sino-foreign joint ventures.    Shao Mingyun, director of Shenzhen's Taxation Bureau,  speaking after a seminar on China's new taxation system  yesterday, said this year's revenue would surge to even greater  heights.    "Last year, the Shenzhen government contributed to the  central government a total of 1.1 billion yuan," he said.    "The amount will grow by at least three times this year," he  said.    China's new taxation system, which came into effect on 1  January, introduced new taxes and various administrative changes  throughout the country.    Among these, most concern was voiced about value-added tax,  business tax and consumption tax.    Local manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers have shown  great concern about the implementation of value-added tax,  seeing themselves as the major targets.    However, some of the new taxes might not actually be levied  during the current year, according to Liu Xiaoguang, vice  director of the planning commission for Beijing's Municipal  Government.    "For example, the new capital-gains tax on land will not be  coming into force in Beijing this year," Mr Liu said.    While denying the new capital-gains tax was being ignored by  regional governments keen on attracting foreign property  investors, Mr Liu said the lack of detailed plans from the  central government was behind the non-implementation so far.    He claimed the Beijing government's directorate had been  followed by the municipal governments of Guangzhou and Shenzhen.    Nevertheless, Mr Liu acknowledged that Beijing's property  development would benefit from any delay in implementation.    Nationally, meanwhile, industrial and commercial taxes  brought in 40.7 billion yuan in the seven weeks up to 20  February, up by 27.3 percent on the same period last year.    Industrial production in January increased 33.2 percent  compared with the same month last year, proof that the new tax  system has so far not had an affect on productivity, according  to some Chinese officials.    But some misunderstanding had arisen as some merchants added  new value-added taxes to prices which already incorporated taxes  under the old system.</p>

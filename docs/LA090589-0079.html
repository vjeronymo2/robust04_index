			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Polish Communist Party has asked for six posts in a Cabinet led by  Solidarity Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a senior Communist official said  on a visit to West Germany. Slawomir Wiatr, the party's central committee  secretary for ideology, told journalists in Bonn that Solidarity should also  have six ministries while two smaller parties would take the remaining six  posts. In Warsaw, Solidarity officials said Mazowiecki will announce nominees  for the East Bloc's first non-Communist-led Cabinet this week. He has agreed to  give the Communists the defense and interior ministries and also has offered  the party the finance and economics ministries.  </P></p>

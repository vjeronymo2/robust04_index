			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE;  </P> <P> COUNTY'S BUILDERS ARE BIG WINNERS AT AWARDS DINNER  </P> <P> Orange County may be home to some of the nation's priciest residences and  office buildings, but it is also increasingly the place where developers from  other areas look for new ideas for their homes and offices.  </P> <P> That was made abundantly clear Thursday at the annual awards dinner at the  Pacific Coast Builders Conference in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Orange County builders and architects dominated the event, capturing 16 of the  41 grand awards and 39 of 154 merit awards.  </P> <P> Entries for the PCBC's Gold Nugget awards came from projects in 14 Western  states, making the large number of awards given to county-based firms a lot  more impressive than if the competition was drawn only from California.  </P> <P> Among the winners were J.M. Martin Development, which captured best-of-show  honors for a single-family detached home of 2,500 to 3,000 square feet, and  Newcomb Development's best-of-show for attached homes under 1,200 square feet.  Both winning entries were built in Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Of course, some of Orange County's big names captured awards -- the Irvine Co.  and owner Donald Bren's own development firm, the Bren Co., as well as the  Santa Margarita Co. But so did a host of smaller firms.  </P> <P> The strong showing seems to lend credence to the local development industry's  oft-heard boast that despite a landscape dominated by hulking, flesh-colored  Mediterranean-style homes, there is cutting-edge work being done here.  </P></p>

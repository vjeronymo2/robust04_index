			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaking at a lecture in Tokyo on the afternoon of  16 June, Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] General  Secretary Wataru Kubo touched on a coalition blueprint the SDPJ  plans to submit as early as next week. He said: "Even if we  place our policies highly, this does not always meet the  people's expectations. Our policies should be broad ones that  can win the support of the various coalition parties." In this  way, he indicated his view that in hammering out the party's  alliance proposal, the party will give priority to basic  agreements reached with the ruling parties.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Helsinki Although the market is bracing itself for the imminent onset of the corporate eight-month reporting season, investors are becoming increasingly cautious ahead of Finland's October 16 referendum on European Union membership. Support for membership has fallen over Brussels' reluctance to accept the farming support package. However, Helsinki remains the best performing stock market in Europe this year with the Hex index up 17.8 per cent. In dollar terms, the FT-A Finland index has risen by 40.54 per cent this year compared with a 0.18 per cent fall in the FT-A Europe index. Helsinki retains its supporters, including Peter Lawrence at Kleinwort Benson, who believes that the previous all-time high for the Hex of 2,009.5 is now within reach after five long years. He says that international factors over the next few months could have a negative impact on Finland, but thinks that the prudent 1995 budget and stronger currency should limit the need to raise interest rates in line with Sweden, for example. 'Our belief in the shorter term is supported by the inflow of funds into domestic trusts, as well as evidence that foreigners are strong net buyers of the market,' Mr Lawrence says.

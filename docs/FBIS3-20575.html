			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Regional Specialization of Farming"] </F>   [Text] We propose abandonment of the policy whereby "every  family grows grain, every household being small but all  inclusive," instituting regional specialization of grain farming  instead.  <H5>  Necessity for Grain Region Specialization </H5>   First of all, the principle of comparative benefits requires  regional specialization of grain. The tremendous difference  between one region and another in the quantity and quality of  natural and economic resources forms a basis for regional  specialization. Places relatively rich in resources are better  suited to the production of the commodities they can produce in  abundance. The price of the commodities that they produce by  using the resources they have in abundance is lower than in  other regions. If the price of a commodity differs between two  regions, a profit can be made from the development of regional  trade.    The specialization that stems from comparative benefit  enables a region to produce more goods for shipment; it  stimulates investment in and expansion of low cost industries;  and it forces high cost industries to cut back production,  thereby strengthening regional specialization.    Second, the multiple value effect of regional grain  specialization is increased. Regional growth that is based on  regional specialization and for which trade between regions  serves as a vanguard means that shipment of specialized  commodities promotes other industrial sectors. Grain area  specialization that increases grain shipments can increase  demand for commodities such as chemical fertilizer, electric  power, farm machinery, agricultural pesticides, plastic  sheeting, and diesel fuel. This role is termed a follow-on  relationship. The development of grain specialization can also  promote the development of grain processing industries. This  role is termed a precursor relationship.    Third, grain region specialization helps increase the grain  labor productivity rate. Grain crops are living plants whose  biology must be matched to a proper living environment if they  are to produce commodities of good quality in large amounts.  Growing grain crops in areas that lend themselves to production  and from which economic returns are high enables laborers to  accumulate production experience and helps improve specialized  skills; thus, regional specialization means relatively high  labor productivity rates.    Fourth, grain region specialization can impel the peasants  toward a market economy. In China, more than 80 percent of the  population are peasants who produce grain largely for  themselves. The amount of commodity grain produced for  consumption by the remaining 20 percent of the population in  cities and towns is extremely limited. Grain region  specialization demolishes the existing self-sufficiency economy  in which "every family grows grain, every household being small  but complete." When specialized farming of grain is concentrated  in certain areas, the marketing areas that formerly produced  grain to supply their own needs withdrawing from grain  production, the grain marketing area has to use its own cash  crops or industrial goods in exchange for grain from producing  areas. Regional specialization of grain increases the amount of  demand for commodity grain; it opens rural markets for grain.  Even when grain prices fall, sales increase. The multiplied  sales may very likely be greater than the former total income.  In discussing the regional specialization of grain, we emphasize  the comparative advantage principle, but from the standpoint of  the growing of grain in specialized areas and peasants obtaining  maximum income, the diversification principle is also extremely  important. Since grain crops are highly seasonal, three problems  unavoidably arise.    One is that if nothing is done but farm grain, during the  winter season there is no work to do. The work force and the  means of production are idle. Second, income distribution is  uneven during the year. Third, the time between planting and  harvesting of grain crops is inordinately long. The crops may  sustain a natural disaster, which damages the peasants' income.  Grain farming alone carries very great risks, so objectively  diversification is needed. Grain crops and other agricultural  sectors are interdependent and promote each other's development.  The development of one can spur the development of all the  others. Damage to one means all the others are limited. Only  diversification can bring the greatest returns.  <H5>  Grain Region Policy </H5>   In view of the comparative benefit principle, we believe  that  grain production should be developed in grain producing areas  and in needy marketing areas by instituting specialized farming.  The state treasury and financial policy should tilt a great deal  toward these two areas so that the income peasants receive from  the growing of grain in these two areas is no lower than income  from other than agriculture. The state should ensure that grain  prices in these two areas cover costs plus the average profit  rate in society, commodity grain for the whole country being  mostly provided by grain producing areas, needy marketing areas  striving to attain self-sufficiency.  <H5>  Grain Shipping and Marketing System Decisions </H5>   Following grain market deregulation, the grain shipping and  marketing system functions should be performed entirely by the  market, all grain procurement, marketing, shipment, and storage  being carried out through the market. Market prices should be  set on the basis of market supply and demand.  <H5>  Decisions About Grain Shipping and Marketing System Goals </H5>   The ultimate goal of the grain shipping and marketing system  is to narrow the market price difference between grain producers  and consumers, permitting both grain producers and consumers a  relatively satisfactory price. Narrowing of the production and  marketing price gap requires lowering of shipping and marketing  costs first of all. Second, it requires improvement of shipping  and marketing efficiency as well as the elimination of monopoly  to enable the greatest market contact with traders, but not on  too large a scale so that their decisions do not manipulate  market prices.  <H3>  Microeconomic Decisions of Shipping and Marketing System  Enterprises </H3>   In the provinces and cities that have already deregulated  their grain markets, grain retailing enterprises work through  markets: Government subsidies have either been abolished or will  be abolished within three years, and the wages of staff members  and workers will be uncoupled from state wages within a limited  period, thereby making grain retailing enterprises truly  responsible for their own profits and losses, for developing  themselves, and for limiting themselves. Thus, all enterprises  in the shipping and marketing system are facing a market  competition environment. They no longer perform the task of  stabilizing market prices, this task being borne by the  state-financed stabilization system, i.e., it is borne by the  State Reserve Bureau system. This is not to say that the two  systems have no relations with each other. In a market economy,  the two systems are interdependent and mutually restricting.    In a true market economy, the profit that shipping and  marketing businesses make is the difference in the price paid to  the producer and the price paid by the consumer. If they buy  grain when prices are low during the grain harvest period, store  it, then sell it in a non-harvest period when grain prices have  risen, they earn a seasonal price differential. They may also  make a profit on arbitraging the grain market price differential  in different areas. However, if most grain traders arbitrage,  the price differential between one area and another tends to  disappear. The difference between the price paid the producer  and the price obtained from the consumer includes not only the  seasonal price difference, but also the additional price of  shipping and processing. This means that each time the grain  passes through a shipping or marketing link, an additional price  is added to the price paid the producer.    1. Shipping and Marketing System Storage Decisions    Grain production is strongly seasonal. If the off season  price is very much higher than the harvest season market price,  the retailer can buy it at a low price during the harvest  season, store it, and sell it at a much higher price during the  non-harvest season. Grain dealers have to contend with the  market climate. Just how much grain they buy to store has to do  with the following year market price forecast as well as whether  bank interest rates will rise. It has to do with the four way  division of profits among the state, grain dealers, producers,  and consumers.    2. Grain Dealing Enterprises Arbitrage Decisions    Once the grain market is deregulated, the unevenness of  grain  supplies in different areas will mean a substantial difference  in market prices between one area and another.    In a market economy, grain dealers have information showing  that grain prices are lower in one market than in another. They  buy grain from the low price market and ship it to the high  price market where they sell it for a profit. If many market  dealers are doing the same thing, the prices in different  markets tend to even out, the price differential disappearing.  This is because supplies in the low price markets decline  causing a rise in prices, while supplies in high price markets  rise causing a decline in prices. Thus markets in different  places are linked together by their arbitrage decisions of  traders with the result that price differences between markets  reflect only normal shipping and marketing costs.  <H3>  How Government Intervenes in the Shipping and Marketing  System </H3>   Since shipping and marketing are replete with numerous  external factors such as an extreme grain shortage in multiple  natural disaster years, market regulation will result in a  tremendous rise in grain prices, which consumers will fine hard  to bear. Likewise in exceptional bumper harvest years, grain  prices will fall tremendously occasioning enormous losses for  the peasants. The existence of these external factors means that  market laws no longer apply. In addition, highly efficient  transportation and marketing systems require highly efficient  communications, transportation, and storage facilities. They  require that all contract regulations and statutes be carried  out, and they require credit for storage and processing, and the  provision of market information for all market participants...  These can be built only with government investment. Therefore,  modernization of the grain shipping and marketing system  requires improved efficiency. Government must intervene to the  proper extent.    The goal of government intervention in the shipping and  marketing system is to narrow the difference between the price  paid to producers and the price charged consumers. The size of  the difference in this price depends on the shipping and  marketing system's actual costs and the efficiency of the  services that the shipping and marketing system provides the  market. If costs are high, government can increase investment to  lower shipping and marketing costs. For example, it may lower  state-owned granary rent, or it may issue low interest loans to  the shipping and marketing system. It may also provide special  shipping price subsidies for railroad and highway grain  shipments. If shipping and marketing system efficiency is low,  the government should improve market competition conditions to  conditions for all market participants to enter the market, or  provide better information. However, for government intervention  to be beneficial, skill in intervention must be emphasized.  While enlivening the macroeconomy, a good job of macroeconomic  management and coordination must be done.</p>

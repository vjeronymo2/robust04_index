			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Oliver cuts loss to Pounds 4.87m The Oliver Group, footwear retailer, reduced its pre-tax loss from Pounds 5.2m to Pounds 4.87m in the half year to June 30. Turnover rose marginally to Pounds 37.5m (Pounds 36.8m), but margins were hit by rising occupancy and utility costs, and wide-spread retail price discounting. Losses per share increased to 19.28p (18.08p) and there is no interim dividend.</p>

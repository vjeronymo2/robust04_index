			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Perfect the Mechanism of a Free and Open Market <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, several reports have indicated that ``pay to play'' practices are considered by many municipal securities underwriters to be an ordinary cost of doing business. Because of great competitive pressures to obtain business, municipal securities firms and the offering process are susceptible to abusive political contribution practices. ``Pay to play'' practices raise artificial barriers to competition for those firms that either cannot afford or decide not to make political contributions. Moreover, if ``pay to play'' is the determining factor in the selection of an underwriting syndicate, an official may not necessarily hire the most qualified underwriter for the issue. The proposal makes clear to municipal securities dealers and to officials of issuers that ``pay to play'' practices should no longer be employed to obtain municipal securities business. The proposal will further merit-based competition between municipal securities dealers and, thus, will remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market for municipal securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Promote Just and Equitable Principles of Trade <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal will promote just and equitable principles of trade. One of the primary principles of section 15B is to raise the level of conduct in the municipal securities industry. <FOOTCITE>60</FOOTCITE>  ``Pay to play'' practices undermine these principles since underwriters working on a particular issuance may be assigned similar roles, and take on equivalent risks, but be given different allocations of bonds to sell_resulting in differing profits_based on their political contributions or contacts. The MSRB, under the Commission's supervision, was given primary rulemaking authority to regulate the conduct of municipal securities dealers by adopting rules to promote just an equitable principles of trade. In particular, the MSRB is obligated to assure that municipal securities dealers observe high professional standards in their activities with the public. The Statement of Initiative demonstrates the significance with which municipal securities dealers address reports of abuse in the municipal securities market. The proposal will extend the goals of the Statement of Initiative to all municipal securities dealers attempting to obtain municipal securities business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 60 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Senate Report <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  at 224, 25. Because the MSRB is an SRO for municipal securities dealers, it is an appropriate body to establish just and equitable principles of trade. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Foster Cooperation and Coordination in Regulating Municipal Securities Transactions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal will foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating transactions in municipal securities. The proposal's disclosure and recordkeeping requirements will aid the Commission, the MSRB, and the NASD to oversee enforcement of and dealer compliance with the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Records and Record Retention <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal's record and record retention requirements are consistent with section 15B(b)(2)(G) of the Act which authorizes the MSRB to adopt rules that prescribe the records to be made and kept by municipal securities dealers and the periods for which such records shall be preserved. As discussed above, the proposal's record and record retention requirements, along with its prohibitions on municipal securities business, are designed to prevent ``pay to play'' practices in the awarding of municipal securities business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. First Amendment Guarantee of Free Speech <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commentators believe that the proposal's prohibitions on political contributions impermissibly infringe on the First Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech and association, <FOOTCITE>61</FOOTCITE>  and constitutional guarantees of equal protection. <FOOTCITE>62</FOOTCITE>  These commentators believe that although municipal bond business should not be a ``pay back'' for political contributions, the proposal restricts the ability of municipal securities underwriters and their employees to demonstrate support for state and local officials. <FOOTCITE>63</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 61 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> One commentator, for example, states that ``it is an infringement on individual first amendment rights to prohibit any person's financial support of a candidate because it is `presumed' the contributor is involved in some `pay to play' scheme.''

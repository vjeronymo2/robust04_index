			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Small companies No doubt the commercial logic for SG Warburg of withdrawing as market-maker in more than 350 UK stocks is overwhelming. Trading small company shares can be highly profitable in the good times, but in bearish markets the combination of dealing losses and the opportunity cost of dead capital can become a significant burden. Other houses, though they deny it fiercely, have also been striking companies off their lists. But the scale of yesterday's announcement is alarming for companies and investors alike, and ought to be of fundamental concern to the Stock Exchange. Admittedly smaller businesses are often happy to see their shares tightly held and thinly traded; there are reasons other than buying liquidity for paying the listing fee. Nor can the Exchange force marketmakers to engage in unprofitable business. That said, the order-driven Bulletin Board which already enables trades in about 120 companies to be matched - and to which another 90 may now be added - will be no substitute for many participants for the quote-driven SEAQ system. Investors arguably are already handicapped by wide spreads - but they can only feel more shackled now. It is always possible that Warburg's move is calculated to boost its client list (given that it will surely go on marketmaking for companies where it is corporate broker). But the securities house can hardly be encouraged by the immediate outlook for small companies. As measured by the Hoare Govett smaller companies index, these are now facing their fourth consecutive calender year of underperformance against the market, an unprecedentedly poor record in view of their generally sparkling outperformance over the last four decades. Perhaps it is just another sign that the 1990s in financial markets are going to be very different.</p>

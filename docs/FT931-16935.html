			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Mr Major's new year MR JOHN MAJOR has spent much of the Christmas and new year holiday thinking about domestic policy. With the time-consuming difficulties of the European presidency behind him, the prime minister now wishes to assert himself on the home stage. This is a sound instinct. But it will be difficult to build momentum, for Mr Major's party is still split over Maastricht and dangerously aimless on many other issues. Those who read the Conservative election manifesto carefully eight months ago could see that this was likely to be the case. It was a document which sprayed out specific proposals, but which lacked a firm and coherent foundation. It is true that since the election Mr Major has been quite clear on one issue. He has shown that he is prepared to stake his premiership upon his version of the Maastricht accommodation: a community continuing to grow and extend its range, but at an uneven pace and without enhancement of the powers of Community institutions. Since Britain may yet be six months from final ratification of Maastricht, there is plenty of scope for party in-fighting over this matter to continue. Meanwhile, Mr Major's record on domestic policy is not impressive. His emphasis upon improved accountability of public services is welcome, but on the whole the Citizen's Charter still looks a feeble counterweight to the hollowing of local government and the quango-isation of large swathes of British public life. Pit problems On privatisation, plans to sell off the railways have been modified so frequently that few people now know what the prime minister thinks is achievable. The pit closure programme needed to prepare for the sale of British Coal has thrown the government into trouble on every front of its energy policy, and its intentions for the post office remain obscure. In social policy, the government is hemmed in by its manifesto promises on benefits. Mr Peter Lilley, the social services secretary, and one of the cabinet's manifest Thatcherites, has scarcely broken cover since April. Perhaps this will be the pattern for Mr Major's period as prime minister: a continuing search for the centre ground in his party, in which he manages his way around events with the aid of his patently strong negotiating skills. A managerial premiership of this kind might be viable were Britain's economy and public finances stronger than they are. Yet the reality is of an economy sputtering out of recession, and faced with fearsome levels of public borrowing and balance of payments difficulties. New direction So Mr Major must urgently establish a sense of direction, starting with a plausible medium term framework for the economy. The possibility of continuing with a relatively unradical approach to the functions of the state depends on an early return to sustainable economic growth. Should such growth not be forthcoming, fundamental aspects of economic policy will have to be reconsidered. The principles of market economics are going to be challenged this year in any case, with growing pressure at home for an unspecific form of industrial strategy and what could look like a tempting agenda from the new US administration. But these ideas are largely a distraction. The main issues are how to lock in the real depreciation of the exchange rate, while avoiding permanently higher inflation, and how to redefine the role of the public sector and make it more efficient. The more doubtful economic prospects seem, the more important it will be to redirect government spending and reconsider levels of taxation as well. The government's low levels of indebtedness will allow it to run large fiscal deficits for several years. But adjustments to long-term spending plans will have to be made now if they are to bear fruit even several years hence. Mr Major's instincts are conservative, but circumstances may force him to be more radical than he would wish. Luckily for him, the Labour party, under the leadership of Mr John Smith, appears intellectually dormant. Such luck may not last. This is the year in which Mr Major must shape the character of his administration. The weaker the pace of economic recovery, the bolder the policies that will be required.</p>

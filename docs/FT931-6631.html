			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Bundesbank hints at rate decline: G7 meeting fails to ease concern over unemployment and spreading recession GERMANY'S benchmark short-term interest rates are set to decline but the fall will do little to assuage mounting concern about the European economy among business leaders and finance ministers. As politicians and company chiefs around Europe warn of rising unemployment and spreading recession on the European continent, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, forecast a decline in German money market rates which stand at 8.5 per cent. Speaking after a meeting in London on Saturday of finance ministers from the Group of Seven countries, Mr Schlesinger said that a reduction from today of DM32bn (Pounds 13.5bn) in the minimum reserves which German banks have to hold in non-interest bearing accounts at the Bundesbank should prompt a slight fall in German money market interest rates. Mr Schlesinger gave no hint about whether the Bundesbank might lower its official discount and Lombard rates. The Bundesbank's decision-making council will next meet on Thursday. But his remarks indicated a more relaxed attitude to falling interest rates. They were the nearest that anyone came to encouraging hope of more action to revive the world economy at the meeting of ministers and central bank governors from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. However, a decline in short-term rates is unlikely to be enough to prevent economic slowdown and rising unemployment in Germany and other industrialised nations. Hopes that the G7 might develop a common approach to world economic problems by July's Tokyo world economic summit could not conceal widespread gloom about the global economy and frustration in the US, UK and France that Germany and Japan were not doing more to encourage growth. A Financial Times survey suggests that business leaders in continental Europe are deeply gloomy about their prospects. Some liken conditions to the first oil-shock of the early 1970s. 'Consumer confidence is in free fall,' says Mr David Herman, chairman of Adam Opel, the German arm of General Motors. Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, chairman of Rhone-Poulenc, France's biggest chemicals group, says: 'The state of the European economy is worse even than during the 1973 oil-shock. I don't expect it to improve until 1994 at the earliest.' Mr Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, says the western German economy is heading for a crash landing, dragged down by tumbling industrial production, high unemployment and 'inappropriate' government policies. In an interview with the Financial Times today, he forecasts a fall of up to 2 per cent in west Germany's gross domestic product this year, bringing the pan-German unemployment total to more than 4m by next January. After the G7 meeting, Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, warned that unemployment in Germany would rise this year by between 200,000 and 300,000. Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said the slowdown in Germany was 'of particular concern' and warned of a need for 'deepened international co-ordination' of economic policymaking. Both Mr Sapin and Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor, said they would like to see German interest rates fall, but - like other G7 participants - indicated they had not put pressure on the Bundesbank to achieve this. Participants unanimously praised President Bill Clinton's plan to cut the US budget deficit and his support for the open world trading system, and agreed that their informal meeting provided a good basis for further co-operation. The ministers took no decisions, issued no communique and came to no special conclusions on currencies. Speaking after the meeting, a senior US Treasury official said he would like to see Japan take steps to boost its economy through fiscal measures and 'a further reduction' in German interest rates. Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the Japanese finance minister, said the high level of unemployment in many developed nations was 'a grave issue'. But he said Japan had 'no intention' of taking extra fiscal measures on top of a special package agreed in August and existing budget plans. Mr Lamont, who chaired the meeting, said he did not envisage cutting UK interest rates at present.

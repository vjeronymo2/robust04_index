			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Big shake-up in motor racing GRAND PRIX motor racing, its prestige already damaged by internal political squabbles and the absence of world champion Nigel Mansell, faces a fundamental change as a result of a decision yesterday by its governing body. The Paris-based Federation Internationale du Sport Automobile (Fisa) declared illegal two of the key elements of the Formula One cars which have helped justify grand prix's claim to be at the 'cutting edge' of motor industry technology. It banned electronic traction control and 'active' suspension systems with immediate effect - to the chagrin of such leading teams as Williams and McLaren, which have spent a fortune developing them, and the quiet delight of less financially secure teams who believe they will become more competitive. If supported to the letter by Fisa, this year's championship could have been turned upside down, with leading teams' points being invalidated. But Fisa yesterday decided to ignore the logical consequences of a ruling by stewards at last month's Canadian grand prix that leading cars were already illegal because they had been using the systems for a year or more. The results of all races to date will not be affected. Nevertheless, a crisis atmosphere ruled last night. Williams, world championship leader, has threatened to withdraw from the German grand prix on July 25, and possibly from subsequent races, if its active suspension system - one of its biggest advantages - is banned. The team was meeting in Paris last night to consider its response. The decision could change the shape of grand prix racing, with unpredictable consequences for the vehicle makers and independent commercial sponsors who pour millions of dollars into a global business still described as sport. Mr Max Mosley, Fisa's president, is concerned about falling gates and fading media interest. He wants races to become much closer and more entertaining and thinks the technology ban will help.</p>

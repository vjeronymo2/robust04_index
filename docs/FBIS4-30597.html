			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- The government released a  package of deregulatory measures Tuesday aimed at expanding  domestic demand and thus the nation's appetite for imports, both  intended to upgrade the overall livelihood of the Japanese  people.    The package, which contains 279 deregulatory steps prepared  by the government's administrative reform promotion  headquarters, is the "product of an all-out effort" for economic  restructuring by the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, a  government official said.    The package, a detailed version of portions of a  market-opening program released in March, is designed to  demonstrate Japan's seriousness about deregulation, the official  said.    The official said whoever replaces outgoing Premier Hata,  who  announced Saturday he would resign, will work to enforce the  measures. "There should not be any setback in implementation of  the package under the pretext of the current political  confusion."    The official said the latest package addresses government  restrictions and regulations in four priority sectors -- housing  and land, financial services, information and telecommunications  and market access by foreign firms.    The steps are aimed at promoting new businesses, giving  consumers greater product selection and narrowing the price gap  on goods in Japan and abroad, the official said.    Japan pledged to come up with deregulatory measures before  the Naples summit of the Group of Seven industrialized nations  in July.    The administrative reform promotion headquarters will craft  a  five-year program designed to implement the proposals by the end  of fiscal 1994, the official said.    Meanwhile, government ministries and agencies will be asked  to formulate specific measures in line with new deregulation  guidelines drawn up by the panel.    The guidelines include a drastic review of restrictions  enforced as a way to adjust supply-demand ties for certain  products, a reduction in rate-setting rules for public services,  harmonization of Japan's standards and certificates with  international rules and the halting of business practices that  effectively hamper foreign entry to Japan's markets.    The guidelines also call for clearer, simplified procedures  for administrative permits, including import inspection systems.    The panel urged strict enforcement of the antimonopoly law  to  ensure fair and free competition and called for a proposal by  the end of fiscal 1994 to outlaw in five years some cartels  currently allowed as exceptions under the law.    The panel also unveiled a plan to abolish by the end of  fiscal 1998 the resale price maintenance system, a protective  measure allowed for designated product items.    Other measures designed to spur competition include review  of  screening procedures for corporate mergers and stock ownership  and a change in rules banning establishment of a holding company.    The official said a set of measures announced on housing and  land policies are intended to provide the Japanese people with  high-quality houses at affordable prices.    To that end, rules and regulations in construction and  materials procurement will be relaxed, including acceptance of  foreign data on materials and simplification of building permits.    The panel said the scope of housing construction subject to  public loans will be expanded, while the legal framework for  land development projects will be modified.    It said inspection standards will be eased for companies  trying to enter the information and telecommunications industry.    Charges on services provided by Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone Corp. (NTT) and other common carriers will be set more  freely, with government approval needed only for basic services  charges.    On market access measures, the panel called for smooth  enforcement of steps announced in may to ease the large-scale  retail store law. But it refrained from seeking abolition of  the law, apparently considering its impact on small retailers.    The reform panel said the government will study whether to  allow self-service gas stations by looking into technical  standards and other safety measures that would be required for  such stations.    Other market-access steps include abolition of a law at the  end of fiscal 1996 that limits imports of gasoline and other  petroleum products to oil refiners.    On the financial sector, steps will be taken to liberalize  rate-setting formulas for liquid deposits and housing loans and  promote financial derivatives transactions.    A set of steps to deregulate the securities market were also  included as a way to diversify corporate fund raising.    The panel said the latest package should be carried out  under  supervision of an administrative reform committee, a third-party  organ likely to be created in line with a bill now in parliament.    A follow-up report on the latest package will be worked out  by the end of this fiscal year, the official said.    The package will be formalized by the government but the  timing of the formalization is yet undetermined considering  Japan's political upheaval.</p>

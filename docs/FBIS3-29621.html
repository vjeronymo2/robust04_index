Although Japan has welcomed Pyongyang's promise to open its  nuclear facilities to inspections by the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA), "Japan will not welcome it any more if it  is not to be carried out," Hata said at a news conference.    Hata's remarks represented a criticism of North Korea which  on Monday informed the IAEA that it plans to grant visas to IAEA  inspectors after first talking with the United States.    Inspectors for the UN nuclear watchdog agency had planned to  begin checks of North Korean nuclear facilities this week, but  have yet to receive the necessary visas from Pyongyang.    Hata also suggested that Japan will closely follow the  issue,  saying the situation may change in a couple of days since North  Korea has asked the international nuclear watchdog for  discussion.    In Washington, the State Department said the U.S. will not  set a date for the third round of high-level talks with North  Korea until IAEA inspections begin.</p>

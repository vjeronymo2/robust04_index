			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Kuznechevskiy "Commentary": "Catastrophe of UN </F> `Peace' Plan in Yugoslavia"]    [Text] When last week U.S. Phantoms bombarded Serbian  positions in the region of Gorazde ostensibly to protect UN  peacekeeping forces, some people may also have thought that what  we had here was a desperate desire to contain locally the  conflict between the Muslims and the Serbs that had flared up  around the city in order to be able to settle the conflict as a  whole.    Today, when -- as a result of military provocation by the  Muslims in this region and in the wake of support for this  provocation by NATO military air power -- the Serbs have stopped  holding back and their tanks have entered Gorazde, the situation  has changed abruptly not only in and around Gorazde but in the  whole of the former Yugoslavia.    It must first be observed that the UN plan for a so-called  peaceful settlement in Yugoslavia is finished. The epithet  "peaceful" is no longer appropriate to this plan (after the  appointment of a specialist in airborne operations, the British  General Rose, as commander of the UN peacekeeping forces in this  region, and his being given the right to use NATO war planes  against the Serbs), nor is the word "settlement," since after  the Serbian civilian population was bombarded and a French  reconnaissance plane was fired on by the Serbs, we are talking  about the outbreak of hostilities between the Armed Forces of  the Serbian Republic in Bosnia and NATO.    In short, the past week's events in Bosnia have drawn a line  under more than three years of attempts by the Western community  to resolve the Yugoslav conflict by the methods of diktat (both  diplomatic and military). Today, everything is starting  practically from zero again. And in this zero situation only  two possible scenarios can be perceived. Either NATO goes over  to full-scale military operations against the Serbs. Or all  methods of diktat are stopped and the West recognizes that the  Serbs have an equal status as a party to an agreement and starts  negotiations which can really lead to a peaceful settlement of  the situation in the Balkans (and for this it will be necessary  to repeal UN economic sanctions against the FRY).    In either event, it must be recognized today that the United  Nations, with its methods of peacefully settling the Yugoslavian  crisis, has failed completely as a result of the arrogance of  the Western community which decided that after the USSR's  collapse and the end of the Cold War, the West could on its own  and without Russia's involvement foist a new international order  on the world, in which the whole of the rest of the world that  is not included in the concept of the "Western community" will  carry out the West's instructions.</p>

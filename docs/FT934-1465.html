			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Powerful close to a successful week for shares - Market Report A highly successful week on the London stock market closed last night with market indices powering through to new peaks in heavy trading as investors looked for a base rate cut in the very near future. Stock index futures continued to lead equities, attention switching to the March contract as December expired. Share prices opened higher and, with the exception of a few turbulent moments around 10.15 am when the stock index future expired, moved ahead steadily to the day's peak of 3,350.8, a new intra-day high. Strength in other European bourses strengthened conviction that the Bundesbank will lead interest rates lower across Europe in the New Year. The final reading put the FT-SE at a new closing peak of 3,337.1 for a net gain of 25.9 on the day. This week, the first leg of the three-week Christmas account in equities, has seen a gain of around 2.3 per cent in the Footsie, with new peaks reached almost daily. Investors have become increasingly convinced that, with domestic inflation still subdued and economic recovery apparently under way, interest rates will be soon be reduced from the present 5.5 per cent to 5 per cent and perhaps lower. Confidence has been buttressed this week by the latest statistics on domestic inflation and unemployment. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, the indicator of broader-ranging investment interest, also extended this week's gains, closing yesterday at a new peak of 3,691.7, up 17.6. Seaq volume jumped to 1,015.6m shares, just under the total for session following the November Budget. On Thursday, Seaq volume of 923.3m shares was worth Pounds 1.86bn in retail business in equities. Retail, or genuine customer business, regarded as the most genuine guide to stock market health and profitability, has already exceeded Pounds 6.6bn this week, with Friday's total yet to come; this ensures it a place among the most successful trading weeks of the year. Although turnover was swollen yesterday by the final burst of activity between blue chip shares and stock index futures, there was no gainsaying the optimistic mood of the stock market. The squeeze on marketmakers' positions continued, although pressures are expected to ease now that the stock index futures expiry is out of the way. Once again, the strongest rises came yesterday from shares in the merchant banks, which are active participants in securities markets. Lending banks were also in demand again as dividend growth prospects reflected the rapidly improving health of their loan books. Gains in bank stocks have been resumed after a pause for profit-taking. A firm opening to the new Wall Street session, bringing a gain of 14 Dow points in UK trading hours, confirmed a good performance by the blue chip internationals. Pharmaceutical stocks were in favour while hopes for a rate cut in Germany soon brought buyers in for some construction stocks. Store shares, however, continued to underperform, with the exception of Kingfisher, which responded well to the trading statement from Darty, the French electrical retailing subsidiary acquired last February. In government bonds, short dates again eased but the longer dates extended early gains to close around  5/16 higher. Index-linked bonds were a shade firmer.</p>

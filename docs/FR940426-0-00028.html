			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Further, the improvement in meat quality, which advocates of the CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  process claim, could lead to a greater amount of saleable product. Because the hogs are much more relaxed when slaughtered with CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  than they are when slaughtered by current methods, a number of desirable characteristics are imparted to the meat. The amount of pale, soft, exudative pork, considered undesirable by meat buyers, is reduced under the process, as well as blood spattering and broken bones. Also, less effort is expended on trimming and the removal of quality defects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No adverse competitive effects on small entities resulting from adoption of the rule are anticipated. Because the equipment needed for establishments to benefit from CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  slaughtering is available in a range of prices, larger establishments choosing to use this method will not receive greater proportional advantages than smaller ones choosing to do the same. For the reasons discussed above, the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule imposes no new information collection requirements on official establishments or other members of the public. Under the rules for the use of carbon dioxide to anaesthetize animals before slaughter, establishments are required to sample gas for analysis from representative locations within the gas tunnels which convey the animals. Gas concentrations and exposure times are to be recorded throughout each day's operations. These records are subject to FSIS's standard records retention requirement at 9 CFR 320.3 and must be available to employees of the inspection service. These carbon dioxide monitoring requirements are continued under this final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Humane Slaughter Act (HSA) of 1958 (7 U.S.C. 1901&hyph;1906), as amended, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to designate humane methods of handling and slaughter of food animals. The HSA (section 2 (a) ) sets forth in number of methods of handling and slaughtering that have been found to be human, including the anaesthetization of animals by electrical or chemical means before they are shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast, or cut. These methods are available to slaughtering establishments under the FMIA (section 3; 21 U.S.C. 603). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS was petitioned by the Danish and Swedish Meat Research Institute to amend the Federal meat inspection regulations to permit the use of CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for the purpose of inducing death in swine. The petitioners based their request on studies demonstrating the beneficial effects of this method on meat quality and the efficient handling of slaughter swine. Some Danish firms that export product to the Untied States are planning to install systems for slaughtering swine with CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and FSIS believes it may be potentially beneficial to U.S. industry to make generally available the option of this use of CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The use of CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gas for stunning has been permitted since the early 1900's and is permitted by the HSA. Animals to be anaesthetized by this method are placed on a conveyor and passed through tunnels filled with the gas. They are moved through the tunnels at such a slow rate that they are unconscious when they emerge. They are then shackled, hoisted, stuck, and bled out. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the last two decades, reports in the scientific literature have shown that the stunning of slaughter animals by the administration of CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gas is just as effective as electrical stunning. There is little or no difference between the two methods in the amount of stress inflicted on the animal. Whichever method is used, animals should be carefully handled before slaughter to reduce stress, and sticking (exsanguination) should take place as soon as possible after stunning to prevent a return to consciousness. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the administration of CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , it has been demonstrated that if the concentration of the gas in the tunnels is increased, death ensues. Other effects, including fewer injuries to the animals or establishment employees, have also been noted. Depending on the facilities and equipment used and the technique of administration, CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  stunning of swine can yield meat that has improved color, carcasses with fewer broken bones and blood spots in the most desired cuts, less pale, soft, exudative pork, and higher boning and cutting yields. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

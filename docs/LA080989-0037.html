			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'ABYSS': A WATERED-DOWN CLOSE ENCOUNTER  </P> <P> "The Abyss" (throughout San Diego County) is the most hardware-cluttered movie  imaginable, full of dials and valves and pressure locks and daunting technical  gear, yet it leaves you feeling sappily euphoric. This must be like rapture of  the deep: Machines crash against other machines underwater with a slo-mo bounce  and a bell-like clanggggg; the ocean begins to collect as many floating spare  parts as space and we look at it all benignly, "Thasssss nice." All stress  washes away in this intense, mindless blueness; it's like 2 hours and 20  minutes in an immersion tank full of Scope.  </P> <P> With all its numskullness, "The Abyss" is at heart a sweet movie, full of  people dying and then living for love, and nothing new to add on the subject of  other-worldlings than "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" offered 12 years  ago: "Give 'em a chance. You don't hurt them; they don't hurt you. Who knows,  we might learn something from them."  </P> <P> But the climax of "Close Encounters" was breathtaking and the climax of "The  Abyss" is downright embarrassing; in the light of day, its payoff effect looks  like a glazed ceramic what's-it your 11-year-old made in crafts class. It's  criminal, because the undersea effects are glowingly beautiful and one gimmick  used by the "non-terrestrial intelligence" (jargon theirs) is jaw-dropping.  Perhaps, to keep us in its spell, this final effect should have surfaced at  night.  </P> <P> It's not at all hard to believe that writer-director James Cameron has carried  this film in his head since he was 17; it's a 17-year-old's vision, complete  with men who say "Steady, big fella" to each other without a trace of irony. In  the meantime, however, Cameron and his producer and former co-writer, Gale Anne  Hurd, have learned to make movies like "The Terminator" and "Aliens" that move  with a headlong, punishing pace. So here we are, taking turns between  free-floating and being propelled forward with a whoosh. And all in the service  of a truly footling script.  </P> <P> In brief, Cameron strands a nuclear submarine, armed with a  bomb-to-end-all-bombs, on a shelf in the Caribbean. Two teams are involved in a  rescue against the clock to get the dee-vice: the (mostly) hairy, brawny,  wisecracking crew of Deepcore, a "submersible hyperbaric drilling platform"  lodged at sea bottom -- the gang we may think of as us. And there are the  militaristic crew-cut Navy SEAL (Sea, Air and Land) commandos, who are  definitely them. Threatening them all is a malady called High-Pressure Nervous  Syndrome, a sort of underwater PMS, which causes irrationality and galloping  Oliver Northism. There's also a hurricane battering the Navy forces topside.  And that bomb.  </P> <P> Now you add the personalities. Returning to Deepcore during this crisis is  Lindsey Brigman (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), who seems to revel in her  widespread reputation as "a cast-iron bitch." She has designed every inch of  the steel monster and goes through it turning wheels and tapping valves like  someone tidying up her kitchen after others have been messing in it.  </P> <P> Foreman of Deepcore is Bud Brigman (Ed Harris), her estranged husband,  seemingly thrilled about the split. Head of the loyal SEAL opposition is Lt.  Coffey (Michael Biehn), whose eyes begin rolling like marbles within minutes of  arriving at Deepcore's niche on the ocean floor. Before long, he is carving  hash marks on his forearm with his assault knife. Not hard to tell where the  dreaded nervous syndrome has struck this time.  </P> <P> Most prominent of the crew members are Catfish (Leo Burmester), Harris' huge,  ginger-bearded decompression expert, company for his scarier swims; the  paranoid Hippy (Todd Graff), who has a pet white rat, and a roughneck,  no-nonsense underwater tractor pilot, One Night (Kimberly Scott). If your heart  sinks at names like this, it has every reason to. Not a single surprise of  dialogue or character awaits you.  </P> <P> As these men and women take to the depths in crab-like pods with pincer claws,  or in extended-time diving helmets, or immersed in a liquid that lets Ed Harris  "breathe fluid instead of air," we await the appearance of The Other. Imagine  the surprise of discovering that it's a neon flittering Tinker Bell that leaves  mortals all the better for encounters with its presence.  </P> <P> There are more: rounded glowing transparent creatures in sea shapes. Most  mysterious of all these visions is something like a mercury-glass pseudopod, a  probe with a worm-like shape that can assume any shape and moves with the  liquidity of water. This is the movie's payload, and in this blue, watery  womb-like state it's tempting to float free and just enjoy it and the picture's  frail message about the power of love. If only Cameron knew what to do with his  other-worldlings; an explanation of their world, even a use for them except as  a nifty, power-assisted forklift. So his picture simply dribbles away.  </P> <P> In the matter of hardware (and excepting its final effect) "The Abyss" is  flawless in each technical department; unfortunately, they can't all be  credited here. Cinematographer Mikael Salomon's camera seems to race down steel  corridors, only milliseconds in front of walls of water, and it seems to have  been his formidable job to light up this Stygian universe. The business of  non-gurgling voices at every depth would seem to be a horrendous task,  conquered by sound mixer Lee Orloff. The veteran Leslie Dilley's production  designs are both realistic and properly otherworldly.  </P> <P> But apart from its technical gee-whizzery, "The Abyss" has more than its share  of eyebrow-raisers. As Harris looks unconvinced about taking liquid  fluorocarbon into his lungs in place of air, a wiser source says soothingly,  "We all breathe liquid for nine months, Bud. Your body will remember." That may  be news to many of us ex-babies.  </P> <P> Forget "Quest for Fire," where the half-naked cast huddled under pelts that  must have smelled like wet Airedales. "The Abyss's" permanently drenched crew  wins the Most Pathetic vote in a dog-paddle, including the estimable  Mastrantonio, who must willingly drown herself in another plot-line  mind-boggler. She and the ice-blue-eyed Harris do manage to bring fire to all  this damp tinder, but it can't have been easy.  </P> <P> It's perfectly possible to have a mindlessly pleasant time in the intense  Tidy-Bowl blueness of "The Abyss." You just relax and let go. You may just  wonder when you come out if you haven't pruned a little.  </P></p>

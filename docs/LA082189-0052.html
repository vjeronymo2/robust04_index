AZT now  costs about $8,000 annually for each patient, according to the National  Institutes of Health, and the drug already was available to an estimated  200,000 people with AIDS. "You're talking about $5 billion," said John Klemm,  an analyst for the federal Health Care Financing Agency. "It's a huge burden."  </P></p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Observer: Rocard's work ethic It's back to the drawing board for French ex-premier Michel Rocard. Eleven months after being replaced by the ill-fated Edith Cresson, he can be found at his old workplace, the Ministry of Finance, drawing up a report on the implications for France of a single European currency. It may seem odd that a former prime minister should need such humdrum employment. But in France a premier leaving office keeps the salary (FFr 40,000 per month plus another FFr 17,000 in expenses) for only six months longer, and gets no pension. Those six months expired last November, when Rocard began work on the report. Fortunately he, like many other leading politicians, is a senior civil servant by origin, which provides a substantial safety net. He is an Inspecteur General des Finances, which provides FFr 30,000 monthly. According to his aides, he felt he couldn't accept the money without working for it, and so spends several days a week in the office. That's perhaps because he's a protestant. Not all France's erstwhile Inspecteurs Generaux des Finances are as diligent.</p>

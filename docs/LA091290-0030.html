			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ROYAL BEATS LOUISVILLE IN GIRLS' VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> Wende Brown, last season's Southern Section 4-A Division Player of the Year,  had eight kills and three blocks Tuesday night to lead Royal High to a 15-7,  15-5, 15-0 win over host Louisville in the girls' volleyball opener for both  teams.  </P> <P> Brown got help from Becky Campbell, who added six kills, and Jennifer Hamilton,  who had five kills and six blocks.  </P> <P> "We had a good match against (Louisville) because we played well together,"  Brown said. "We were comfortable with each other's hitting. We are coming  together."  </P> <P> Louisville player Torie Sumner agreed.  </P> <P> "They looked like they had been playing together for a long time," Sumner said.  "Our team was a lot smaller than they were and their blocking was a big  strength in their defense." ADAM BENSON  </P></p>

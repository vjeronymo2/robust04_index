			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Anglo-French ties to grow despite 'teasing' Britain and France are edging towards closer co-operation, particularly in defence and security, despite the two countries' history of ill-tempered spats and sharply contrasting rhetoric over the future of Europe. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, told an Anglo-French audience in London this week that 'there are really no two substantial countries more similar than France and Britain'. 'We differ occasionally, though almost always only by a degree or two, in our response to particular world events,' he added. 'But when it comes to the point . . . we are side by side.' While acknowledging the existence of 'mutual teasing and aggravation' between the British and French media, he stressed the two nations' virtual identity of views over Bosnia and argued that their ideas on the European Union were not far apart. 'Neither for Britain nor for France is there attraction in a vision of Europe which erodes national identity,' the foreign secretary told the Franco-British council. He stressed that for now, Britain and France were the only two European countries which had extensive global interests, and therefore maintained a defence capability that was well adapted to overseas deployment. Germany, prevented until recently by political and constitutional barriers from sending troops into combat overseas, is preparing at least one division for global deployment. However, this is not expected to be ready until the year 2000. Mr Hurd confirmed that the UK and France were engaged in discussions about closer co-operation in military aviation, which were expected to come to a head at the Anglo-French summit in Chartres next month. British officials say these discussions are focusing on relatively technical questions, such as common procedures for sharing air space, which would make it easier for the UK and French air forces to co-operate in humanitarian or peace-keeping missions overseas. French press reports have suggested that a joint headquarters, or even a joint intervention force, could be established. But one British official insisted that at this stage, such speculation amounted to 'adding two and two and making eight'. Setting aside the intense Anglo-French wrangling which has often marred discussions about European security, Mr Hurd said both countries were committed to closer integration of the continent's defence effort. 'The contribution of both Britain and France will be indispensable,' he said.</p>

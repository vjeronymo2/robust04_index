			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Mates at work but strangers in the street: How west Belfast factory staff cope with the Troubles Paddy Auld and Ronnie Lewis work together on the shopfloor at Mackie International, a textile machinery company a stone's throw from west Belfast's 'peace line', the brutal barrier of iron and brick that dissects their city. But when they go home, they go in different directions to different worlds; Paddy is a Roman Catholic and Ronnie is a Protestant. Paddy heads south, across the Springfield Road - dubbed the 38th parallel by battle-weary locals - ignoring the derelict houses abandoned by people too terrified to live on the front line. He returns to Andersonstown and to life in one of the Catholic ghettoes marked on the city's extraordinary religious map. Some of the smarter, new homes he passes on the way to 'Andytown' have metal window grilles to thwart brick-ends and bombs. Ronnie goes north, on to the Highfield estate, where 3,000 families live in the shadow of Black Mountain. There is not one pub for drowning sorrows and the run-down, Protestant streets suggest that hardship in Belfast shows no particular sectarian inclination. Nearly 60 per cent of Highfield's men are unemployed and all but a few of the children at primary schools such as Glencairn qualify for a free lunch. Community self-help is basic and too many youngsters have drifted unthinkingly into the grip of the loyalist paramilitaries. Paddy, a Mackie convenor, recently went shopping with his wife in an exclusively 'prod' neighbourhood. He was spotted by a workmate who greeted him as 'Billy' and passed on by. Paddy recalls: 'It wouldn't have been very clever for either of us if he had been seen there talking to someone called Paddy. It's not just the other side you have to worry about, some on your own side are just as bad.' One of Ronnie's best friends, a Protestant, lives just across the way from him on the Highfield, separated only by the 20ft-high wall which perpetuates the religious divide. When Ronnie's daughter got married, his friend would not cross the line to attend the church. 'He went into town and came back out in a taxi,' recalls Ronnie. Such are the instinctive, unspoken procedures for staying out of trouble in this corner of the UK. Neither man likes talking about 'sides', though it is unavoidable. They say nearly everyone is sick and tired of the madness and united in their wish to see an end to it. They say they are optimists because the alternative is too awful to contemplate but they do not sound entirely convinced that the end is at hand. 'Things are better now. Not long ago when you went to work you didn't know if you would be going home in the evening,' says Paddy. He and Ronnie, a lathe operator who is also a union official, try to recall whether it was two or three Mackie employees who were killed when the Troubles were at their height in the mid-1970s. Some of those working in the company's newly built plant still have their moments. Pat Dougan, the outspoken, North Antrim-born Catholic who is chief executive of Mackie and who daily arrives in his Jaguar XJS from a smarter part of town, recently ran into a fusillade of stones. 'They have regular battles across the Springfield between 4 o'clock and 7 o'clock,' he says, with a shrug of his shoulders. But Mr Dougan, who says 'ethnic cleansing began in Belfast not Bosnia', is not a man to be easily scared off. He arrived at Mackie in early 1992 to try to save a long-established business which once offered a day's wage and a sense of purpose for 7,000 people but which ended up dependent on government hand-outs. He has turned round the business, which is set to make a modest profit this year and, after initially shedding workers, is recruiting again. Mr Dougan, who says 'every additional employee is an extra nail in the coffin of the terrorists', wants the 450-strong workforce up to 1,000 and intends to float Mackie soon. He also wants his workforce, once exclusively Protestant, to reflect the religious make-up of the community; fair-employment regulations in any case make it a pressing priority. But his own Catholic upbringing does not cloud his view of how best to go about it: 'The Fair Employment Commission is insisting that our job ads say we welcome applications from the Catholic community. I refuse to do it. Applications from both communities should be equally welcome if we are talking about equal opportunities. In any case, I could get shot by the 'prods' for following that line,' Dougan adds. So far, however, Catholics account for only 13 per cent of the workforce, a figure which is rising but which gives no grounds for complacency. Mr Dougan says one of the big problems in raising the Catholic intake is finding skilled recruits. The company has agreed to take a quota of new employees from two training centres in Catholic areas. But he says a much broader effort is desperately needed. 'Giving people jobs and meeting the challenge of making Belfast a better place to live in is the way to end the misery and violence. The business community here, including industrialists and bankers, have been cowards. They have chickened out of facing up to the problems, refused to stand up and be counted; lying low is not the answer.'</p>

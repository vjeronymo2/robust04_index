			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [First of a two-part feature article by correspondent Yi </F> Sang-sok from Washington: "Simulated Scenario: Dialogue or War?"]    [Excerpts] A ghost of rumors about a crisis on the Korean  peninsula has been dancing in the United States. It seems that  the ghost has issued "a general mobilization order" to the  people's Cold-War thoughts that had faded since the collapse of  the Soviet Union.    The U.S. high-altitude reconnaissance plane Blackbird  (SR-71)  that disappeared in 1990 is getting ready to be put into  commission again. The voice demanding the cancellation of the  order to withdraw tactical nuclear weapons issued by former U.S.  President George Bush while he was in the office is resounding  fiercely. In addition, some people even insist on a limited  attack on North Korean nuclear facilities, and it seems that the  attack would not be a limited one.    As described above, the heat of the speculation on a crisis  on the Korean peninsula that has spread in the United States is  increasing in proportion to the cooling speed of the fuel rods  taken out by North Korea from its five-megawatt reactor in  Yongbyong. This is a so-called "bandwagon phenomenon".    The U.S. doves, who originally supported a solution to the  North Korean nuclear problem through dialogue, are one by one  leaving their nest for that of the hawks. They have decided to  no longer put up with North Korea's attitude after watching a  series of measures it took. The actual development of the  situation has made U.S. controversialists, who were denouncing  the insistence on attacking North Korean nuclear facilities and  on the inevitability of a second Korean war as a great mistake,  change their position. [passage omitted]    It is interesting that leading U.S. public opinion circles  on  the North Korean nuclear issue make it impossible for people to  categorize their view as conservative or progressive. [passage  omitted]    It is clear, however, that every inch of the arguments by  Americans on the North Korean nuclear issue are based on their  own country's interests. Without mentioning some people's  viewpoint that a scheme is being plotted, it can be said there  is a common view that the United States will not hesitate in  bringing about a war [chonjaengul pulsahal kosiranun ke sangsik]  if it believes that raising the North Korean nuclear issue as an  international crisis is advantageous to itself [segyejok wigiro  pugak sikinun kosi yuikhadago pandandoemyon]. The Clinton  administration, however, does not seem to have decided to fight  with North Korea to the end.    At present, the hard-liners are leading the main current of  the U.S. policy toward North Korea. Accordingly, I think it is  a reasonable view that a stick rather than a carrot is envisaged  in the current U.S. scenario for resolving the North Korean  nuclear issue. Although the stick policy might have been  brought about by North Korea itself, it will certainly worsen  the crisis on the Korean peninsula for the time being. No one  can predict whether the crisis will rapidly increase or decrease  at any point, or will go in a direction that all of us are  concerned about. The North Korean nuclear issue, that has been  dragged out for more than three years, is now on the edge of a  precipice.</p>

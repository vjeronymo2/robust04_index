			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent caught in consolidation mood There were many stories but few themes among the markets yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT came off its intraday high but the DAX index still showed positive form as it closed 14.34 higher at 2,057.77. The index moved between a high of 2,061.45 and a low of 2,050.60. Attention continued to be directed towards Thyssen which is due to release its results today. The shares added DM5.00 to DM237.50 as one German broker lifted its recommendation on the company. Going in the opposite direction was Heidelberger Zement, off DM15 at DM1,165 as it reported a slight rise in nine month turnover. AMSTERDAM advanced a notch helped by a strong recovery in the shares of Royal Dutch which has been dropping back in recent days on the falling price for world oil. The CBS Tendency index added 0.8 or 0.6 per cent to 136.9 as the international put on Fl 3.50 to Fl 194.70. Philips took a dip, off 70 cents to Fl 37.40, on reports which suggested further difficulties with partners involved in CD-I technology. MILAN edged higher although the advance was restrained a weaker lira and bond market. The Comit index advanced 4.67 to 548.56. The mood was also inhibited by political worries ahead of this weekend's second round of local elections, passage of the budget and the start of privatisation of Credito Italiano next week. Ferruzzi soared L2,677 or 8.6 per cent to L33,930 in response to news that a group of foreign creditor banks had joined Italian banks in approving a restructuring plan and that shareholders had approved a capital increase. Montedison, whose shareholders meet today to vote on its capital increase rose L12 to L787. Olivetti, in talks with unions to discuss possible jobs cuts, shed L45 to L1,748. ZURICH was mixed although banks put in a firm performance and the SMI index edged 0.3 higher to 2,738.5. CS Holding added SFr45 to SFr3,595 and SBC was SFr8 higher at SFr480 with the latest warrant issue on a bank basket drawing attention to the sector. Nestle was again the focus of foreign selling, the shares easing SFr10 to SFr1,159. Oerlikon-Buhrle, the arms to fashion group added SFr1.50 to SFr120.50 ahead of its forecast of a slight rise in 1993 group profit. PARIS fell back slightly with the CAC-40 index slipping 9.21 to 2,110.09, ahead of today's expiry of options. Turnover was FFr4bn against Monday's FFr2.8bn. Euro Disney maintained a slight forward momentum, up 50 centimes at FFr32.25 while LVMH, which had improved on Monday, dipped FFr66 to FFr3,685. STOCKHOLM turned round from recent setbacks as the Affarsvarlden general index rose 11.8 to 1,303.6 helped by gains in Volvo. Turnover was SKr1.1bn. Volvo B shares added SKr23 to SKr414 as speculation continued as to the future of the group's proposed merger with Renault of France. According to some estimates the 'No' vote is gaining momentum ahead of next week's meeting. MADRID was weaker, led down by weaker futures and the general index shed 2.60 or 0.9 per cent to 292.94. Banks were among the biggest losers with BCH losing Pta170 or 5.3 per cent to Pta3,050. COPENHAGEN firmed as the market prepared for the maturing of the KFX December future today. The KFX index gained 0.76 to 100.48 in turnover of DKr464m, boosted by a 0.83 point rise in the December future to 100.38. Carlsberg B shares gained DKr5 to DKr265 after a positive analysis of the brewer's long-term profit prospects by Danske Bank. Novo Nordisk shares also rose DKr5 to DKr629, after the recent stagnation for its stock price. ISTANBUL continued to find support as the composite index advanced to its fourth consecutive record close, up 551 or 3 per cent at 18,977.1. Among the most actives Eregli added TL800 to TL8,100. Turnover was TL826bn. ATHENS was little changed as the market spent time analysing the contents of the country's budget. The general share index put on 0.88 to 863.01. Turnover was strong at DKr5bn. The government said that it would have a report ready within a month on the privatisation of public organisations.

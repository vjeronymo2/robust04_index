			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Fever checks new issue flood: A look at a worrying case of oversupply It may be merely acute indigestion, but fears are mounting that the new issue market is suffering from a killer bug. The symptoms certainly worsened this week. Several large flotations were pulled and with the stock market ailing fast many were predicting that the infection would spread. 'The new issue market is virtually shut and companies which do not need the money should do themselves, and everybody else, a favour and wait,' says an adviser to one of the recent casualties. However, the optimists, including advisers to 3i, argue that the problem is localised. The biggest cluster of casualties is in cable communications with two of the biggest UK operators, TeleWest and General Cable, both postponing flotations this week. Most of the advisers involved with the sector believe it is a special case, partly because cable companies are being sold on the basis of future profits rather than current earnings. 'The postponements are a direct result of market volatility. When share prices in general are unstable investors focus on the present and are less likely to believe tomorrow stories,' said one investment banker. He believes that UK institutions were also worried that US investors, who are much more familiar with the cable industry, would shun the issues. 'I don't think they were right but it is true that in nervous times US investors tend to stay at home.' A rival banker believes the resistance encountered by the cable companies was only to be expected. 'Experience shows that when markets are off colour investors want good plain cooking, not fancy food like cable.' The fact that most UK fund managers know little about cable also counted against them. One weary fund manager admits: 'We've ploughed through so many prospectuses over the past few months that the last thing you need is getting you mind round a whole new market. At least we all know what 3i is about.' All involved with the cable companies insist that they will return to the market. 'We will be back as soon as the market is in a better mood but I don't know whether that will be in 6 weeks or 18 months,' says a sponsor. The other sector looking sickly is property, where several recent issues have been scaled back significantly and the flotation of London Capital Holdings pulled. But the picture is patchy. Last week also saw the pricing of shares in Argent, a property investor and developer, which were confidently pitched at a discount of only 5 per cent to net asset value. One broker, not involved with Argent said: 'That pricing demonstrates there is still demand for good companies, even in sectors like property where there have been a lot of floats.' Argent is valued at Pounds 140m and there is general agreement that it is smaller flotations that are particularly vulnerable to the market's malaise. 'If you are floating a company which is a major force in its market, institutions which have holdings in that sector are bound to look at it. The tiddlers they can afford to ignore,' said one adviser. Such an argument bodes well for 3i. 'If you are interested in unquoted company funds at all you are very unlikely to turn down 3i.' Yet even the best quality floats are meeting resistance from some fund managers. According to Mr David Barclay, deputy managing director of corporate finance at NatWest Markets, one institution has declared that it will not look at any flotations in June. Another corporate broker says: 'The best thing sponsors could do is to give investors a summer holiday and come back in the autumn when there is more cash in the kitty.' In spite of the heavy calls on institutional cash flow over the past year the main major investors are not short of money. 'The problem is that funds allocated for small companies have been exhausted by all the flotations,' says a smaller companies analyst. Ironically, one of the flotations postponed last week was Murray Johnstone's Acorn Turst, an investment trust which planned to raise Pounds 60m to invest in small quoted companies and some venture capital projects. The disappointing response from institutions was blamed partly on the past glut of new trust launches and on 3i's flotation. This week also saw a number of profit warnings from recently floated companies which underlined worries about the general quality of the current crop. Says one broker: 'We are near the end of the cycle, and though there are obvious exceptions, we have already had most of the cream.' He believes City advisers need to weed out some of the weaker hopefuls on their books. 'Otherwise there is a risk we could kill off the market completely. In its current state, it would not take much.'</p>

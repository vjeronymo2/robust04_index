			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Finland and Italy lead the field WEAKNESS in Japan was balanced by a gain in the US, and with Europe broadly neutral the FT-Actuaries World Index came out 0.1 per cent higher last week. However, among individual markets there was more movement in Europe than elsewhere, Finland and Italy leading the week's winners with gains of 7.8, and 6.3 per cent respectively. Both markets have seen their domestic currencies devalued this year; Finland also went through the devaluation process in 1991. Foreign shareholders have paid the price, with Finland, in 1992, showing a 1.5 per cent gain in local currency terms but a loss of 13.7 per cent via the US dollar; and in Italy, the loss on 1992 expands from 9.3 to 21.0 per cent. Ms Deborah Boys, technical analyst at James Capel, notes that before its latest upswing the Hex index of the Helsinki stock exchange had fallen from around the 2,000 mark registered in 1989 to a low of 541 in early September this year, a drop of 73 per cent. The recent recovery has been exaggerated by the tightness of the market, and by the sheer depth of its earlier decline. Ms Boys says the gains have coincided with improving liquidity, and in higher volume; but the Hex has not yet broken through the current resistance level around the 730 mark, and a correction could be expected. Italy, too, was looking healthy last week. Market turnover at around L200bn a day was virtually double that of its recent average, says Mr Michele Pacitti of County NatWest. Since the new Milan stock exchange acount started, says Mr Pacitti, the government has suspended capital gains tax indefinitely and cut interest rates. Last week, domestic investors were moved by the subsequent fall in bond yields, and excited by privatisation speculation - specifically about Sme, the food company, but moving on to other privatisation stocks.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 % change  % change in                  % change in local currency**   sterling** US Dollars**              1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of  Start of    Start of                                         1992      1992        1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      -1.17    -0.94  -12.86    -9.72     +6.63       -10.95 Belgium      +1.11    +2.88   -1.59    -1.66    +16.08        -3.06 Denmark      -0.09    -4.12  -33.24   -29.52    -15.89       -29.76 Finland      +7.84   +21.94   -6.34    +1.52     +3.33       -13.70 France       -0.80    +2.67   -5.43    -1.31    +17.05        -2.25 Germany      -2.07    +1.29   -9.62    -7.79     +8.55        -9.35 Ireland      -0.84    -1.33  -22.63   -19.30     -5.66       -21.21 Italy        +6.27   +22.58   -8.63    -9.34     -5.42       -21.02 Netherlands  -1.24    -1.11   -0.62    +2.01    +20.32        +0.48 Norway       +1.62    +2.72  -29.02   -17.41     -6.18       -21.65 Spain        -1.35    +6.72  -25.05   -19.61    -15.23       -29.21 Sweden       -2.02    +6.29  -20.37    -9.42     +3.42       -13.62 Switzerland  -0.29    +1.33   +8.92   +11.81    +31.60        +9.90 UK           -0.34    +4.51   +2.09    +6.50     +6.50       -11.06  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPE       -0.43    +3.75   -3.98    -0.38     +8.64        -9.27  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia    -2.73    -4.25  -17.13   -16.20     -8.23       -23.37 Hong Kong    -1.52   +10.23  +52.88   +43.26    +72.61       +44.15 Japan        -1.18    -1.78  -31.04   -24.77     -8.68       -23.73 Malaysia     +3.04    +9.84  +22.13   +16.27    +50.93       +26.04 New Zealand  -1.38    -5.71  -19.51   -18.04     -4.59       -20.33 Singapore    +4.11    +3.88   -6.88   -12.57     +4.60       -12.65 Canada       +2.75    +3.18   -6.83    -6.33     +4.56       -12.68 USA          +1.18    +2.09   +7.03    +0.65    +20.52        +0.65 Mexico       +0.65   +14.17  +14.28    +6.83    +24.13        +3.66 South Africa -0.77    -6.29  -18.02   -15.76    -26.79       -38.86 WORLD INDEX  +0.08    +1.54   -8.73    -7.56     +7.92        -9.88  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on October 30th 1992.

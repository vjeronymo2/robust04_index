Rodoljub Jovic reporting for Croatian Radio from  Split.    The illegal container carrying undeclared ammunition,  explosives, and other military equipment instead of 6,950  kilograms of petrol and gas has been stored at the Split customs  warehouse. The head of the customs office of the port of Split,  Rade Roso, has completed all the administrative formalities and  has forwarded all the relevant documents to the commander of the  British warship through the mediation of an official agent. He  has also filled out a customs violation report and has submitted  it to the judiciary.    According to initial estimates, the value of the undeclared  cargo is 1 billion 230 million Croatian dinars and the penalty  for such activities is a fine and the compulsory confiscation of  the cargo.    In reference to yesterday's statement by the spokeswoman for  the British peacekeepers, Rade Roso repeated today that the  ship's commander had behaved strangely during the routine  inspection of the container in question. Namely, the  above-mentioned container was opened forcibly because the key  had allegedly been lost and the excuse for this did not strike  us as plausible because it was given after the violation had  been discovered and after the real cargo list had been found  locked up in the container.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Remand prisoner avoids extradition MR Lorrain Osman, Britain's longest-serving remand prisoner, yesterday avoided immediate extradition to Hong Kong on multi-million-dollar fraud charges. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, who signed an extradition warrant on Monday, agreed not to remove Mr Osman to Hong Kong after his lawyers acted swiftly to launch a fresh High Court bid to win his freedom. They issued proceedings after learning through a tip-off that Mr Clarke had made his order and that the Malaysian banker, now in his seventh year as an unconvicted remand prisoner, was in danger of being flown out of the country.</p>

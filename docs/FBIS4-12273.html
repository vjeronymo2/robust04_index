			<p>BFN     [Text] London -- 'Abbas 'Abd 'Awn, an important money  changer, who was executed in Baghdad last Sunday, was reportedly  related to President Saddam Husayn. Iraqi opposition sources  told AL-HAYAH in London yesterday 'Awn "worked for an operation  run by Saddam's sons 'Udayy and Qusayy, which traded in hard  currency in Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq, including the  Kurdish-controlled north."    The Associated Press reported that Arab sources yesterday  cited Iraqi officials as saying that 'Abbas 'Awn was convicted  of dealing with "hostile external powers" bent on undermining  the Iraqi dinar.    Travelers confirm the news of the execution. 'Awn had been  apprehended on 3 January, 1994, but was then released.    According to the same sources, 'Abbas 'Awn was executed by  firing squad, along with his brother-in-law, Qasim Qaqiyah, and  others.    Sources of the "United National Iraqi Opposition" told  AL-HAYAH the day before yesterday that 'Awn was bankrolling  Iraq's military industries. Also executed with him were Majid  Hulw, Qasim 'Abd-al-Karim Hasan, and his chaufeur.</p>

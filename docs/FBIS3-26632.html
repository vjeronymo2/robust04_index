Quoting an old Chinese saying that "on festive occasions  more  than ever one thinks of his dear ones far away", the premier  said that while celebrating the Spring Festival, "we more than  ever think of Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao compatriots and the  Overseas Chinese ."    On the question of Taiwan, he said that it is the common  will  of all the Chinese people to promote reunification of their  motherland in accordance with the principle of "peaceful  reunification, and one country, two systems".    In the past year, economic cooperation across the Taiwan  Straits continued to develop and exchanges between people on the  two sides were expanded, while initial understanding was reached  in business negotiations, the premier said, adding that "we are  happy with such progress".    He expressed the hope that the Taiwan authorities will value  national interests above everything else and work together with  the mainland to push forward the process of reunification.    Li Peng voiced satisfaction with the smooth cooperation  between China and Portugal on the question of Macao, but noted  that the responsibility for the suspension of the Sino-British  negotiations lay on the British side.    He said that no matter what will occur, the Chinese  Government and people are determined and capable to resume the  exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and to maintain long-term  stability and prosperity there.    On foreign relations, Li said China, along with other  countries, will make unremitting efforts toward the  establishment of a new international political and economic  order, the maintenance of world peace and the promotion of  common development.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TEEN CLUB TAKES SOBER VIEW OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE  </P> <P> The line starts forming at 8:15 p.m. There are pale, short-haired boys wearing  baggy pants with white socks, and bright-eyed girls in black leather  miniskirts.  </P> <P> As they reach the front of the line, each submits to a search. Holding their  arms straight up, the boys are patted down by a security man wearing a two-way  communications headset, while the girls open their purses for examination.  </P> <P> Immediately inside the door, an electronic message board spits out red letters  informing the entrants of house rules. "No drugs, no alcohol, no weapons, no  bangers," the machine says, using a slang word referring to gang members. Then,  evoking the name of a device traditionally associated with doctors, but in  recent years favored by youthful drug dealers, the machine says, "Oh yeah, I  almost forgot. No beepers. What are you, a brain surgeon"?  </P> <P> It is Saturday night at Jets, Long Beach's only teen-age nightclub and one of a  handful in Southern California. The club's purpose, according to its owners, is  twofold: to give youths a place to party hard on Friday and Saturday nights in  a drug- and alcohol-free environment and to provide a good living for its two  owners.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Friends Lost to Drugs  </P> <P> So far, they say, it is succeeding wildly on the first count and just barely on  the second.  </P> <P> "I'd lost three of my friends to drugs before I was 16," said co-owner Craig  (Jet) Sutter, 25, for whom the club is named. "What we're doing here is showing  kids that they can have fun without (drugs and alcohol)."  </P> <P> Adds his partner, Karl Kamb, also 25: "There's nothing to do here but dance,  drink Coke and eat candy. It's as innocent as a Little League snack bar."  </P> <P> In fact, the club is the product of a friendship between the two men that dates  back to when they were not much older than Little Leaguers. Born and raised in  Malibu, they were fast friends through most of their childhood and adolescent  years. Later they pursued separate careers -- Kamb into the car business and  Sutter into a career in nightclubs.  </P> <P> For six years, Sutter said he worked at a club for young adults in Santa  Monica, first as a disc jockey and finally as manager. Surrounded by drugs and  alcohol, he developed a drinking problem himself. And although he was able to  eventually get the help he needed to curb it, Sutter said, the experience  motivated him to want to help others.  </P> <P> So two years ago, when the club in Santa Monica closed, throwing Sutter out of  work, he sought out his old friend Kamb and asked him whether he would like to  go into the teen-age nightclub business.  </P> <P> "We see a lot of kids who are literally destroying their lives," Sutter said.  "They have absolutely no future."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unemployment Problem  </P> <P> By providing an environment that is both hip and safe, he figured, he could not  only solve his own unemployment problem but do his bit to help curb teen-age  drug and alcohol abuse.  </P> <P> Kamb liked the idea enough to sink $250,000 into it from his savings, a loan  from his mother and the sale of his house, car and motorcycle. It was with that  seed money that the pair leased and renovated the 17,200-square-foot building  in downtown Long Beach that is now Jets.  </P> <P> After opening a year ago, Kamb said, the new club, which operates only on  Fridays and Saturdays, was attracting about 100 customers a night. Today, he  said, it averages 500 teen-agers on each of the two nights, still less than  half capacity. The owners attribute the significant increase to word-of-mouth  and an ambitious publicity campaign in which Jets deejays preside over  lunchtime dances at various area high schools.  </P> <P> Long Beach Unified School District officials say they applaud the idea of a  non-alcoholic nightclub for teen-agers.  </P> <P> "I think it's great," said Edward M. Eveland, assistant superintendent for  secondary education.  </P> <P> An attempt last year to sponsor a series of Friday night drug- and alcohol-free  dances at Wilson High School had to be temporarily curtailed, he said, after  the appearance of "riff raff from all over the city . . . who were not looking  for fun but trouble."  </P> <P> At one point, he said, the drinking and carousing outside the dance caused  police to be summoned to avoid a violent confrontation. Since then, according  to Wilson High officials, the dances have been resumed with tighter security  that has eliminated the problems.  </P> <P> "I'm behind any kind of activity that is closely supervised and provides a  place where kids can go for entertainment, other than wandering the streets or  attending (unsupervised) parties," Eveland said, referring to Jets, which is  supervised by a staff of young adults. "I think we need more of them."  </P> <P> To accommodate its 15- to 21-year-old patrons, the nightclub features two  separate dance floors, each with its own sound system and deejay.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Different Themes  </P> <P> One caters to lovers of what Kamb calls "top 40s" hits and "ethnic funk," such  as rap music. The other, equipped with a smoke machine and floor-to-ceiling  mirrors, is for more bizarre tastes. On Friday nights, its deejays play  something called "ska" -- a reggae beat favored by "mods" whose style,  according to Kamb, is patterned after the British subculture of the early  1960s. And on Saturday nights the space is taken over by "death rockers," 80%  of whom, he says, wear black.  </P> <P> "These are the kids that the neighbors look at and say, 'My God, it's Satan,' "  Kamb explained. "Actually, they are just ordinary kids into a certain type of  music."  </P> <P> Soon, he said, the club will add a third dance floor.  </P> <P> "Each type of music suits a particular type of kid," Kamb said. "They're very  picky about what they listen to. (The different groups) are like oil and water;  they don't mix."  </P> <P> While admission is $7 at the door, he said, a $2 discount is given to members  of Alcoholics Anonymous and other drug- or alcohol-treatment programs, of which  the club gets many. And although Jets is finally making a small profit, Kamb  said, the profit is still too marginal to have made a dent in his $250,000  investment.  </P> <P> "This is my life," said Kamb, who three weeks ago quit his car sales job to  manage the club full time.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clothing Rules  </P> <P> Teen-agers seem to like the place, despite its many rules, including those  forbidding clothing such as baseball caps and white T-shirts, articles that  have become trademarks of certain gangs.  </P> <P> "It's pretty safe," said Jenna Mitchell, 17, of Long Beach. "We get tired of  going to the movies all the time."  </P> <P> Said David Cowan, also 17, a Buena Park resident who said he is enrolled in an  Orange County drug-abuse program: "I come here regularly. It keeps me sober."  </P> <P> Not everyone was overjoyed at the scene on a recent Saturday night, however.  Allison MacBeth, 18, of Yorba Linda, for instance, said she was disappointed at  the deejay's choice of music.  </P> <P> "It was advertised as Mean Gothic but really it's New Wave," she complained.  "We (Mean Gothic lovers) don't have any place to go anymore. It's annoying."  </P></p>

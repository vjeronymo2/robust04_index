			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Petrochemicals plant inaugurated NORTH SEA Petrochemicals yesterday inaugurated the last unit of a revolutionary Dollars 275m Antwerp-based petrochemicals plant. It is the first of its kind to embrace, in a single complex, the entire production process for polypropylene based on propane and refinery propylene. NSP, formed in 1989, is an equally-owned joint venture between Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, and Himont, a member of Italy's Ferruzzi group and one of the world's leading producers of polypropylene. The vertically-integrated propylene and polypropylene facility includes the world's first propane dehydrogenation plant. The complex is also the first in Europe to manufacture polymer-grade propylene directly from propane gas and refinery propylene. The dehydrogenation unit converts 250,000 tonnes of propane annually and is linked to a 400,000 tonnes - a - year propylene purification unit, which supplies propylene raw material for NSP's 180,000 tonnes-a-year polypropylene plant. The entire complex supplies Himont and Statoil with polypropylene and the excess propylene for their separate downstream processing and marketing activities. The completion of the project comes, however, at a time when the world's petrochemicals industry is experiencing marketing difficulties that have been attributed to oversupply. Dr Italo Trapasso, vice president of Italy's Montedison, president of Montecanini and chairman of Himont, said here yesterday that during 1983-89 the industry had grown at a faster rate than world GNP. Dr Trapasso dismissed the industry's present problems as cyclical and expressed optimism about recent slight growth in the world economy and the outlook for polyolefins, which he called products of the future in relation to environmental concerns and market flexibility. Mr PM Morrione, Himont's president, said that he believed the industry's problems were not caused by excess volumes in the market and pointed out that European and US demand had increased this year by an estimated 17 per cent. Mr Harald Norvik, the president of Statoil, defended his company's investment in the Antwerp facility in spite of prevailing poor market conditions and said his view of polypropylene as a polymer of the future had not changed. Mr Norvik added that Statoil was considering further expansion of petrochemical operations through the addition of a second polypropylene line and a second world-scale MTBE plant in Antwerp. Statoil last year suffered an operating loss of NKr17m (Pounds 1.52m) on its petrochemicals activities, compared with a profit of NKr718m in 1990. On a group basis net profits dipped slightly to NKr4.2bn from NKr4.3bn because of the one-off effect of Norway's tax reform.</p>

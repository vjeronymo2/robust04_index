			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (3): In retreat almost everywhere - Public sector / State-owned companies worth more than Dollars 300bn have been sold by some 50 countries since 1985. Barry Riley reviews the trend towards privatisation IT SEEMS very strange now in this triumphant era of privatisation, but some 50 years ago governments were eagerly nationalising important industries to ensure that the failures of capitalism in the 1930s would not be repeated. As recently as the early 1980s the French socialists were still nationalising substantial concerns. Public ownership would safeguard the public interest, they claimed. Meanwhile, third world governments for much of the postwar era have seen the expropriation of the assets of multinational companies as a natural expression of their desire to assert economic as well as political independence. Such policies were especially rife during the 1960s and the early 1970s. For a long while the Soviet Union and its many satellites provided a model for the nationalisers to follow: the model was flawed, of course, but at least it appeared to provide a viable alternative to western capitalism. Today, however, the public sector is in retreat almost everywhere. The Economist recently calculated that state-owned companies worth more than Dollars 300bn have been sold off by some 50 countries since 1985. At least as much further privatisation is likely to take place by 2000. It is happening all around the globe. Although the UK, which pioneered the process, has more or less reached the end of its 'sell' list, other western European countries such as France and Italy have huge offerings on the stocks. France, for instance, with a new conservative government in charge, has lined up the leading bank BNP as its first candidate, to be sold within a few weeks, and the French Treasury hopes to receive upwards of Dollars 5bn for the government's 73 per cent stake. In fact, France has effectively raised Dollars 19bn in advance by selling 'Balladur bonds' which can be converted into future privatisation stocks. In eastern Europe the sums involved are comparatively tiny but the implications are much more profound. Remarkable strides are being made in privatising great chunks of the economies through a variety of methods including voucher schemes, mutual funds, management takeovers and sales to foreigners. Latin America has become another highly active centre of privatisation. A bandwagon set in motion by Chile has been jumped on by Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela and others. The aim is to attract not only the US portfolio money which has been pouring into South America but also the local funk money which is being tempted back from overseas havens by more financially liberal regimes. The privatised assets tend to fall into a limited number of categories. For instance, according to the investment bank Morgan Stanley 15 national telephone companies have been privatised since 1981 and another 30 are likely to be floated within the next three years. Oddly, though, France Telecom is not yet officially on the list. Three clearly distinct motives are present in the global wave of privatisations. There is a simple desire to raise revenues, at a time when government coffers are often bare. The OECD expects that government fiscal deficits in Europe will top 6 per cent of GDP on average in 1993, because of the recession. Issues running at some Dollars 70bn a year will significantly offset these revenue and spending imbalances. But there is a more direct economic motive, to lift the deadening influence of public control and allow the dynamism of private ownership to boost economic growth rates. This search for a capitalist solution is evident in some of the developing countries where there is now a much greater openness to investment by multinationals, which are seen to be capable of bringing in capital and technology. Sometimes these two motives are directly in conflict, as when state-owned monopolies are privatised. They would be worth more to a buyer if the monopoly were retained, but selling off a licence to print money would scarcely serve the objective of creating a competitive economy. Either the monopoly must be split to create several competitors or a regulatory body must be created to control the monopoly in the public interest. Tricky labour market issues can also be highlighted by the process of privatisation. Often, in the past, an overt purpose of nationalisation and state ownership has been to safeguard jobs. Therefore it is common to find that new capitalist managers can find enormous scope for job-shedding. This has been strongly evident in the UK, for instance, where British Telecom and the electricity generators have sharply reduced their workforces (although in BT's case changing technology may have played an important part). Probably the worst political furore in the UK came in the wake of the privatisation of the electricity industry, for rather indirect reasons: the decision of the electricity bosses, newly freed from political constraints, to cut back on coal burning has had devasting knock-on implications for the coal mining industry. The third important motive is to remove important industries from the constraints of state funding. Where attractive investment opportunities exist it can be damaging to the national economy if capital is withheld for budgetary reasons. Released into the private sector, companies can raise capital subject only to their ability to persuade investors that the terms are attractive. But does privatisation work? There is plenty of evidence of success for the big western privatisations, but the battle is not entirely won in the developing countries. China is, of course, a puzzle all of its own, with a communist government struggling to keep control of a burgeoning private sector. The Chinese economy is paradoxically performing much better than that of Russia, where the attempt to expand the private sector is apparently much more enthusiastic and coherent, but where some important ingredients, such as a flair for business, are presumably in short supply.</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALS / ALLAN SLOAN: SISYPHUS, WILE E. COYOTE AND UAL UNIONS  </P> <P> Watching the poor souls who are members of United Airlines' labor unions try to  buy the company is like watching a dog chase a mechanical rabbit around a  track. You know that if form holds, you will always end up with a frustrated  dog and an untouched rabbit. The only question is how close the dog will get  before the rabbit pulls away again.  </P> <P> Form, so far, has been holding pretty well. The unions' $300-a-share offer for  UAL Corp., which owns the airline, came very close to going through but  collapsed last October, when some banks pulled back their financing  commitments. The unions then bid $201 a share in April, but that offer never  got off the ground because the unions wouldn't put any cash of their own into  the deal and lenders wouldn't finance it.  </P> <P> Now there's a new offer, at a lower price, running around. That offer, which  may have surfaced by the time you read this, doesn't seem likely to go through,  either.  </P> <P> Unless, of course, the unions change their pattern -- tamper with the  mechanical rabbit, as it were -- by putting up cash money as a down payment. Or  unless they find a sucker, such as European plane maker Airbus Industrie, that  is so desperate for United Airlines' business that it will put big bucks into a  UAL leveraged buyout. I wouldn't bet too much on it.  </P> <P> Why am I so down on the union's latest offer? An offer that I haven't even  seen? Because dogs almost always act like dogs, and mechanical rabbits like  mechanical rabbits.  </P> <P> At the risk of being obvious, I'd like to repeat what I said in April, when I  said that the unions' $201-a-share offer wouldn't fly: The 1980s are over.  No-cash-down takeovers are dead, dead, dead. In today's environment, no bank in  its right mind will finance a multibillion-dollar buyout by any buyer who isn't  putting money of his own into the venture. That was true in April, and it's  even more true now.  </P> <P> Reason No. 1 is that banking regulators are giving so-called highly leveraged  transactions the hairy eyeball and are leaning on banks not to make many.  Reason No. 2 is that with dead and dying LBOs littering the landscape, lenders  have remembered that it's just plain stupid to lend money to someone who has  none of his own money at risk. Because, you see, if the deal goes bad, the  borrower can walk away at no loss to himself and stick the bank with a  disaster.  </P> <P> I feel bad for the UAL union members, who have been jerked around for years by  takeover artists and would-be takeover artists, and who got into this whole  messy business to preserve their jobs.  </P> <P> But I get tired of hearing every five minutes that a deal is just around the  corner, stories that are obviously inspired by the unions and by the other half  of the UAL Odd Couple, Coniston Partners. The unions want to save jobs and have  workplace democracy. The Conistons, who own 11.8% of UAL's stock and have a  $150-million paper loss on it, would sell to Attila the Hun, Saddam Hussein or  even Frank Lorenzo to get out of this disaster alive.  </P> <P> But the more important reason to write about the UAL unions' latest travail is  that the unions' series of constantly lower offers shows what has happened to  market psychology in the past 12 months. Think of it. A year ago, the unions  almost pulled off a $300-a-share deal for UAL. Now, they will probably offer  about half that price and will have to be very, very lucky to get it done.  </P> <P> Part of the reason for the decline, of course, is that the airline business is  taking its lumps. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has doubled the price of oil,  which has driven airplane fuel prices through the roof. The U.S. economy seems  headed for a recession (or something worse), which tends to reduce the number  of business people who take airline trips.  </P> <P> But most of the reason is that the junk bond market has turned to . . . well,  junk. The stories that you may have read about the decline in the junk market  are too kind. Any junkmeister willing to talk truth -- which means talking off  the record -- will tell you that for most junk issues, there is virtually no  market.  </P> <P> Banks' junk takeover loans, of course, were made in response to the  junk-financed takeovers mounted by Drexel Burnham Lambert and its clients. In  Drexel's glory days, all it took to become a corporate raider was Drexel's  phone number. Drexel could raise endless amounts of junk bond money to let  anybody take over anything. Issuing a press release was enough to put a company  in play. The commercial banks got into the junk takeover loan business to seize  back the business that Drexel had gotten by issuing junk takeover bonds.  </P> <P> But for the Drexel game to work, you need a real market for junk bonds -- a  market in which you can buy or sell securities without changing their price  much. In today's junk market, buying bonds is easy; you just can't sell them.  Unlike the New York Stock Exchange, in which brokers match buyers up with  sellers, bond markets consist of dealers buying bonds, holding them and  reselling them. With junk bond prices plummeting, no one wants to hold them.  </P> <P> Think of the junk market as 100 sellers all looking for the exit; only there  isn't any door. Which is why the junk market has pretty much croaked. And why,  unless the unions put up real money or find an investor who will, the UAL  buyout will always be a dog.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 1989 ALL-COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> FOUR TEAMS PLACE TWO PLAYERS EACH; SIX PLAYERS REPEAT  </P> <P> Four of the dominant teams in San Diego high school basketball placed two  players each on The Times' 1988-89 All-County teams.  </P> <P> The Torrey Pines and Lincoln boys and Point Loma and Vista girls each had a  pair of players picked, and four of the eight were repeat selections.  </P> <P> Torrey Pines' Courtie Miller and Kevin Flanagan were named to the boys' team  for the second consecutive year. Lincoln's Joe Temple and Aaron Wilhite were  selected for the first time.  </P> <P> Returners Chris Enger of Vista and Monica Filer of Point Loma led their teams  to section championships and into the Southern California Regional finals.  Enger was joined by teammate Dana Christofferson, Filer by Tyeast Brown.  </P> <P> Other repeaters were Madison's Robby Robinson and Mission Bay's Cristina  Willis.  </P> <P> Players and coaches of the year will be announced at The Times' awards  breakfast April 2 at the Anaheim Hilton Hotel and Towers.  </P> <P> BOYS  </P> <P> Tony Clark, 6-7 junior forward, Valhalla  </P> <P> Clark's talent was most apparent after teammate Rafid Kiti suffered a collapsed  lung and missed several games late in the season.  </P> <P> Clark had been used to relying on Kiti and his 24-point average to take  pressure off the inside game. But when adversity struck, Clark got better. He  scored 55 points in one game -- the highest of any player in the county this  season and third on the all-time section lists -- and 47 in another. He led  county scoring for much of the season and finished with a 30.4-point average,  second on the section all-time list.  </P> <P> Clark, who utilizes a strong power game and his rebounding skills, also showed  he could score from the outside. He shot 59% from the field and 77% from the  line and was named the Grossmont League 2-A player of the year as Valhalla won  its first basketball title.  </P> <P> Kevin Flanagan, 6-9 senior center, Torrey Pines  </P> <P> A former teammate called Flanagan "the toughest guy in the world." Maybe a  slight exaggeration, but Flanagan was tough enough, averaging 10.9 rebounds and  18.1 points to help the Falcons to the Division II championship.  </P> <P> Flanagan, a three-year starter, was recently selected to play on the McDonald's  Western All-Star team. In the fall, he will attend Arizona.  </P> <P> Clark James, 6-4 junior guard/forward, San Diego  </P> <P> Control Clark James, and you have a chance to defeat San Diego, or so it was  this season. In the Cavers' four regular-season losses, James averaged just  nine points. But in 17 victories, he averaged 26.  </P> <P> James led the young (one senior starter) and talented Cavers to a second-place  finish in the City Central League behind Lincoln, which defeated San Diego  twice.  </P> <P> He was even more important in the playoffs, leading San Diego to the Division I  championship game (a 64-49 loss to Poway) after two regulars were declared  ineligible.  </P> <P> Ray McDavid, 6-2 senior guard, Clairemont  </P> <P> Maybe the only guy in town who can polish off McDavid in a one-on-one pickup  game is his coach, Greg Lee, who started on two national championship teams at  UCLA. But with Lee at courtside, McDavid was virtually unstoppable in the City  West League this season, finishing fourth in the county in scoring with a  25.1-point average.  </P> <P> McDavid led his team to the Division III championship game at the Sports Arena,  where it lost to Lincoln. A three-sport athlete who also competes in football  and baseball, McDavid balanced his game between powerful dunks and a smooth  jump shot.  </P> <P> Erik Meek, 6-9 sophomore center, San Pasqual  </P> <P> Meek is the youngest member of The Times' All-County team but has always  performed beyond his years in basketball. He averaged 22.6 points (ninth in the  county) and 11.8 rebounds a game. In two years, he has scored more than 1,000  points, and schools such as Arizona and Syracuse have shown an interest.  </P> <P> "He is the most promising basketball player out of San Diego in a long time,"  San Pasqual Coach Tom Buck said. "San Diego is in for a treat the next two  years."  </P> <P> Buck said Meek needs to get better defensively but that he has already vastly  improved: "He's starting to get his whole game together."  </P> <P> Against Madison in the playoffs, he scored 39 points and had 26 rebounds and  eight blocked shots.  </P> <P> Courtie Miller, 6-8 senior forward, Torrey Pines  </P> <P> A three-year starter for Torrey Pines, Miller has earned respect from his  teammates and coaches for being a team player who places winning before  individual accomplishments. John Farrell, the Torrey Pines coach, says he  watched a great progression over the last three years.  </P> <P> "Courtie has really matured, not only as a basketball player but as a person,"  Farrell said. "He has been a real pleasure to be around."  </P> <P> Miller was The Times' boys' player of the year last season. This season, he  averaged 21.1 points, 10.9 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 4.1 blocks.  </P> <P> He led Torrey Pines to the section Division II championship and the semifinals  of the Southern California Regionals, where the Falcons lost to Dominguez  despite his 31 points.  </P> <P> Miller, who will play for San Diego State, was chosen a preseason Street and  Smith honorable mention All-American.  </P> <P> Robby Robinson, 6-4 senior guard/forward, Madison  </P> <P> Robinson was a man without a position but a master of all this year. As the  lone returning starter, Robinson played point guard, shooting guard, low post  and even some center. He finished second in the county in scoring (27 points a  game) and led the Warhawks in assists as well. And he guarded the opponent's  best player in every game.  </P> <P> "For a while, (not having a position) used to bug me," Robinson said. "I'd  practice at guard all week and then get moved down low in the game, and it  frustrated me. But I've learned to do what it takes."  </P> <P> Will Tate, 6-0 senior guard, Southwest  </P> <P> Gifted athletes often must choose the sport for which they will accept a  college scholarship.  </P> <P> Tate is one such athlete. In basketball, he was Metro Conference player of the  year this season and co-player of the year in the Mesa League last season. In  football, he was named Metro offensive player of the year and to The Times'  All-County team last season.  </P> <P> He will play football for San Diego State.  </P> <P> "Basketball was his No. 1 sport at first," Southwest Coach Steve Selland said,  "but then he came to like football more."  </P> <P> Tate averaged 16.4 points, 6.4 assists and five steals to help lead the Raiders  (21-8) to the section Division I quarterfinals and school's best record ever.  </P> <P> Joe Temple, 6-3 senior guard/forward, Lincoln  </P> <P> Lincoln Coach Ron Loneski is running out of adjectives to describe Joe Temple,  and with good reason.  </P> <P> Temple set section records for steals in a game (15), season (173) and career  (301), was third in the county with 25.8 points per game, averaged 11.3  rebounds and three assists and led Lincoln to a 26-1 regular-season record and  its second consecutive Division III title.  </P> <P> He scored 30 or more points in eight games and was held under 20 just twice (he  had 17 against Madison and 15 against Poway). Despite having never played  basketball before the ninth grade, he was a three-year starter for the Hornets,  averaging in double figures in points and rebounds all three years.  </P> <P> Temple also is a 6-foot-6 high jumper in track and received a scholarship offer  to play tight end for San Diego State's football team. He has a 3.0 grade-point  average at Gompers, a math/science/computer magnet school.  </P> <P> Aaron Wilhite, 6-8 senior center, Lincoln  </P> <P> The only thing bad about Aaron Wilhite this season was timing. Against  Christian, Wilhite had 27 rebounds and 31 points, but Temple scored 35 points  and set a section record with 15 steals.  </P> <P> In the Hornets' next game, Wilhite set a section record with 39 rebounds, but  that too went largely unnoticed because it was the final game of the regular  season and Lincoln already had wrapped up its fourth consecutive City Central  title.  </P> <P> Said Loneski of his three-year starting center: "Aaron is the greatest  overachiever I've ever coached."  </P> <P> Like Temple, Wilhite averaged in double figures in scoring and rebounding for  three seasons. In 1988-89, he was sixth in the county in scoring with a 23.9  average and had 15 rebounds, three assists and 3.5 steals per game.  </P> <P> GIRLS  </P> <P> Rebecca Aase, 5-8 junior guard/forward, Santana  </P> <P> Aase came on strong in the second half and finished as the Grossmont  Conference's leading scorer with 16.9 points per game. She also led the  conference in free throw shooting (48 of 64, 75%).  </P> <P> Aase led Santana to a 6-0 Grossmont 2-A League record and was named the  league's most valuable player. She was especially effective when center  Stephanie Thompson missed several games with an injury. Santana finished the  regular season with a No. 3 county ranking and went to the section Division I  semifinals.  </P> <P> Tyeast Brown, 5-11 senior center, Point Loma  </P> <P> Brown had 538 rebounds this season, second most in San Diego Section history.  </P> <P> "She's probably the best defensive low post player I've ever coached," Point  Loma Coach Lee Trepanier said. "Even better than Terri Mann (former Point Loma  All-American). Tyeast played against players much bigger than her all year. She  had to play good technical defense."  </P> <P> Brown also averaged 15.6 points.  </P> <P> Dana Christofferson, 5-9 1/2 senior forward, Vista  </P> <P> Although overshadowed by Chris Enger, Christofferson was Vista's defensive  catalyst and went about her business quietly but intensely.  </P> <P> "She was our best defensive player," Vista Coach Joe DeMaria said. You don't  get a lot of recognition on defense, but she was really effective on both sides  of the court."  </P> <P> She came on strong in the second half and scored in double figures in 17 of the  last 18 games. She averaged 12.9 points (14.2 in the playoffs) and 7.8  rebounds.  </P> <P> Christofferson was named to the Palomar League first team and will most likely  play basketball at UC San Diego. She has a cumulative 3.9 grade-point average.  </P> <P> Dasheila Dixon, 6-3 sophomore center, Lincoln  </P> <P> Lincoln Coach Dorothy Robinson said before the season, "With all the kids I've  converted from track to basketball, we've got speed." Robinson also had height  in 6-3 Dixon, the only sophomore on the girls' All-County team despite her  having played basketball for just 1 1/2 years.  </P> <P> Robinson said Dixon is far from reaching her potential and is just starting to  realize she can dominate. Late in the season, she became only the fifth girl in  section history to score 50 or more points in a game, when she had 50,  including 26 in the third quarter, against Christian.  </P> <P> Dixon was third in county scoring (26-point average) to go with her 10-plus  rebounds per game.  </P> <P> Chris Enger, 6-4 senior center, Vista  </P> <P> More often than not, Enger inside the key meant points for the Panthers. She  averaged 28.2 points during the regular season and 32 in the playoffs and was  the Panthers' leading rebounder with a 14.6 average (19.7 in playoffs).  </P> <P> Enger averaged 8.5 blocked shots per game, 9.5 in the playoffs.  </P> <P> "She's the most talented player in the county," DeMaria said. "She runs the  ball better than most guards. She's very diversified. She runs, she shoots  inside and out and defensively she's a problem for other teams."  </P> <P> She might attend Oregon State or the University of San Diego.  </P> <P> For the second consecutive year, Enger was voted the Palomar League player of  the year. Vista (28-4) won its first Division II section title and reached the  Southern California Regional Division II final before losing to Anaheim  Katella.  </P> <P> Monica Filer, 5-7 senior guard, Point Loma  </P> <P> Point Loma finished 32-2 this season, largely because of the play of this slick  point guard. Filer dished out a state-record 390 assists this season, pushing  her career total to 773. She also averaged 22.1 points.  </P> <P> "Having Monica on the court is like having six players on the court," Trepanier  said. "She took care of the other girls, making sure they were doing their  jobs. She was a true captain -- a real leader."  </P> <P> Mesega Johnson, 5-6 senior forward, Southwest  </P> <P> Johnson kept the Raiders from self-destructing after they lost four starters  during the course of the season. She finished as the county's No. 4 scorer  (25.6 average), behind three other All-County selections.  </P> <P> Southwest finished 15-9 and tied for third in the Metro Conference, and "that  was directly attributed to Mesega and her stabilizing influence," Coach John  Boone said.  </P> <P> Her best game was against Morse, where she set a school scoring record (48) and  pulled down 21 rebounds.  </P> <P> Johnson is strong and quick -- she was the league 100-yard dash champion her  freshman year -- and still learning. "We haven't even scratched the surface yet  with her potential," Boone said.  </P> <P> Rochelle Johnson, 5-11 senior center, Patrick Henry  </P> <P> Johnson averaged better than 20 points and about 16 rebounds a game for an 18-8  team.  </P> <P> "She probably has more raw talent than anyone I've ever coached," Patrick Henry  Coach John Ferguson said. "She was the team most valuable player, high point  and rebound person, and she was a real team leader. She worked real hard."  </P> <P> Susie O'Brien, 6-0 senior forward, San Marcos  </P> <P> O'Brien finished with a 29.9 average to lead the county in scoring but had  pushed that average to 30.5 at midseason. She also averaged 15 rebounds.  </P> <P> She led San Marcos (21-7) to the Avocado League championship and the section  Division II title game (won by Vista) and was the league player of the year.  She is a three-time first-team all-league selection.  </P> <P> Cristina Willis, 6-1 senior forward, Mission Bay  </P> <P> Willis started for three seasons for her father, Larry. She finished this past  regular season fifth in county scoring with 24.4 points per game.  </P> <P> Willis also averaged 12 rebounds and four assists. Teams figured out quickly  she was the player to stop and often triple-teamed her.  </P> <P> "That was just typical," Larry Willis said. "When she had the ball, she had  three people on her. She got used to that."  </P> <P> Willis led the Buccaneers to the semifinals of the Division II playoffs, where  they lost to San Marcos.  </P> <P> Rick Hazeltine, Jim Lindgren, Scott Miller and Don Patterson contributed to  this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ALL-COUNTY BOYS  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Tony Clark  </P> <P> School: Valhalla  </P> <P> P: F  </P> <P> Hgt.: 6-7  </P> <P> Yr.: Jr.  </P> <P> Key Stats (per game): 30.4 points, 59% field goals  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Kevin Flanagan  </P> <P> School: Torrey Pines  </P> <P> P: C  </P> <P> Hgt.: 6-9  </P> <P> Yr.: Sr.  </P> <P> Key Stats (per game): 18.1 points, 10.9 rebounds  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Clark James  </P> <P> School: San Diego  </P> <P> P: F  </P> <P> Hgt.: 6-4  </P> <P> Yr.: Jr.  </P> <P> Key Stats (per game): 17.3 points  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Ray McDavid  </P> <P> School: Clairemont  </P> <P> P: G  </P> <P> Hgt.: 6-2  </P> <P> Yr.: Sr.  </P> <P> Key Stats (per game): 25.1 points  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Erik Meek  </P> <P> School: San Pasqual  </P> <P> P: C  </P> <P> Hgt.: 6-9  </P> <P> Yr.: So.  </P> <P> Key Stats (per game): 22.6 points, 11.8 rebounds  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Courtie Miller  </P> <P> School: Torrey Pines  </P> <P> P: F  </P> <P> Hgt.: 6-8  </P> <P> Yr.: Sr.  </P> <P> Key Stats (per game): 21.1 points, 10.9 rebounds, 4.1 blocks  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Robby Robinson  </P> <P> School: Madison  </P> <P> P: G  </P> <P> Hgt.: 6-4  </P> <P> Yr.: Sr.  </P> <P> Key Stats (per game): 27.0 points  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Will Tate  </P> <P> School: Southwest  </P> <P> P: G  </P> <P> Hgt.: 6-0  </P> <P> Yr.: Sr.  </P> <P> Key Stats (per game): 16.4 points, 6.4 assists, 5 steals  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Joe Temple  </P> <P> School: Lincoln  </P> <P> P: F  </P> <P> Hgt.: 6-3  </P> <P> Yr.: Sr.  </P> <P> Key Stats (per game): 25.8 points, 11.3 rebounds, 5.7 steals  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Aaron Wilhite  </P> <P> School: Lincoln  </P> <P> P: C  </P> <P> Hgt.: 6-8  </P> <P> Yr.: Sr.  </P> <P> Key Stats (per game): 23.9 points, 15 rebounds, 3.5 steals  </P> <P> </P> <P> ALL-COUNTY GIRLS  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Rebecca Aase  </P> <P> School: Santana  </P> <P> P: G  </P> <P> Hgt.: 5-8  </P> <P> Yr.: Jr.  </P> <P> Key Stats (per game): 16.9 points, 75% free throws  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Tyeast Brown  </P> <P> School: Point Loma  </P> <P> P: C  </P> <P> Hgt.: 5-11  </P> <P> Yr.: Sr.  </P> <P> Key Stats (per game): 15.6 points  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Dana Christofferson  </P> <P> School: Vista  </P> <P> P: F  </P> <P> Hgt.: 5-9  </P> <P> Yr.: Sr.  </P> <P> Key Stats (per game): 12.9 points, 7.8 rebounds  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Dasheila Dixon  </P> <P> School: Lincoln  </P> <P> P: C  </P> <P> Hgt.: 6-3  </P> <P> Yr.: So.  </P> <P> Key Stats (per game): 26 points  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Chris Enger  </P> <P> School: Vista  </P> <P> P: C  </P> <P> Hgt.: 6-4  </P> <P> Yr.: Sr.  </P> <P> Key Stats (per game): 28.2 points, 14.6 rebounds, 8.5 blocks  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Monica Filer  </P> <P> School: Point Loma  </P> <P> P: G  </P> <P> Hgt.: 5-7  </P> <P> Yr.: Sr.  </P> <P> Key Stats (per game): 22.1 points, 11.5 assists  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Mesega Johnson  </P> <P> School: Southwest  </P> <P> P: F  </P> <P> Hgt.: 5-6  </P> <P> Yr.: Sr.  </P> <P> Key Stats (per game): 25.6 points, 12 rebounds  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Rochelle Johnson  </P> <P> School: Patrick Henry  </P> <P> P: C  </P> <P> Hgt.: 5-11  </P> <P> Yr.: Sr.  </P> <P> Key Stats (per game): 20 points, 16 rebounds  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Susie O'Brien  </P> <P> School: San Marcos  </P> <P> P: F  </P> <P> Hgt.: 6-0  </P> <P> Yr.: Sr.  </P> <P> Key Stats (per game): 29.9 points, 15 rebounds  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Cristina Willis  </P> <P> School: Mission Bay  </P> <P> P: F  </P> <P> Hgt.: 6-1  </P> <P> Yr.: Sr.  </P> <P> Key Stats (per game): 24.4 points, 12 rebounds, 4 assists  </P> <P> </P></p>

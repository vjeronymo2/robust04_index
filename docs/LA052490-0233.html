			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA  </P> <P> Plan to Cut Water Use OKd  </P> <P> Officially noting that the city is in its fourth year of drought, the Board of  Directors voted Tuesday to implement voluntary restraints on water use,  including sending drought-buster field crews into city neighborhoods to  identify water-wasters.  </P> <P> If that gets no response, board members indicated, they are prepared to impose  rationing.  </P> <P> Under the program, field workers will encourage apartment dwellers to install  high-efficiency shower heads, faucet aerators and toilet dams. The city is also  working to restore four contaminated wells in the Arroyo Seco to service by  installing a treatment plant. The Metropolitan Water District, which supplies  60% of Pasadena's water, has urged the city to reduce water consumption by 10%.  </P> <P> Director Rick Cole suggested that the city's conservation efforts might be more  effective if those who use a large amount of water were billed at a higher  rate. "We should make people pay for the water they waste," he said. The  voluntary restraints, he said, are "a thimbleful of solution to a bucketful of  problems."  </P></p>

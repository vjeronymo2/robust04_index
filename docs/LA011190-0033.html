			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR COINS: QUARTER EAGLE MAY BE WORTH A LOT  </P> <P> Question: I recently received an 1856 $2 1/2 gold coin. It has a Liberty head  and is in very good condition. Could you let me know how much this coin may be  worth? -- W.J.C.  </P> <P> Answer: On the surface, the answer is quite simple. Your quarter eagle is worth  $200 and up, depending upon condition. But it's more complicated than that.  </P> <P> Quarter eagles, an interesting denomination, were minted from 1796 to 1929.  This distinguished series not only has many dates, but there were also many  design changes plus different varieties within the types. In addition, the coin  was produced at different mints. Your coin, issued shortly before the outbreak  of the Civil War, not only came from the Philadelphia Mint, which was the  workhorse of the day, but also from some branch mints. It is the coins from the  branch mints that carry the extra premium because of their low mintages.  </P> <P> As an example, the Philadelphia Mint (no mint mark) produced 384,240 $2 1/2  gold pieces in 1856. But the Charlotte (N.C.) Mint (a C mint mark) produced  only 7,913 of these coins, the Dahlonega (Ga.) Mint (D mint mark) produced 874,  the New Orleans Mint (0 mint mark) issued 21,100 and the San Francisco Mint (S  mint mark) made 72,120.  </P> <P> As you can see, the lower mintages from the branch mints make those coins more  valuable, providing the condition is equal. So, while the basic price is about  $200, yours could be worth considerably more. Look for a mint mark on the  reverse, just above the 2 1/2 D. If you find a C or D, congratulations. You're  in the money.  </P> <P> Q: After my brother's death, we found nine 10- and 20-mark gold pieces,  Deutsches Reich, dated 1872, 1888, 1894, 1895 and 1893. The coins are in good  shape. What are they worth? -- H.E.M.  </P> <P> A: Your German coins are essentially bullion pieces. The 10 marks are worth  about $75 each; the 20 marks are in the $95 to $110 range each.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coin News  </P> <P> The Jaffa, eighth coin in the Sites of the Holyland series, is now available.  The three-coin Jaffa set commemorates one of Israel's oldest cities, predating  biblical days. The three coins share a common reverse (pictured) featuring the  Jaffa port as seen from the sea. The obverse depicts the denominations -- 5 new  shekels (for the gold coin); 1 new shekel (the silver proof) and one-half new  shekel (for the silver uncirculated coin). The edged 12-sided sections allude  to the 12 tribes of Israel. Three-coin sets are $260; the gold coin separately  is $195 and a set of both silver coins is $64. To order contact Intergold,  Israel Coins and Medals, 23326 Hawthorne Blvd., Suite 150, Torrance 90505;  (800) 472-6327.  </P> <P> Four Certsales, consisting of coins certified by the Professional Coin Grading  Service and Numismatic Guaranty Corp., have been scheduled for 1990 by Pacific  Coast Auction Galleries.

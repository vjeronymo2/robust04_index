In an  interview with INTERFAX, Zorkin noted that so far he had not  received such an offer and that it was too early to comment on  such rumors.    At the same time, Zorkin said that the task of the new  movement Accord for Russia (he was one of its initiators) is to  unite various social and political forces. Zorkin stressed that  the appeal of Accord for Russia to citizens should not be put in  opposition to the agreement on civic peace in Russia prepared in  the Kremlin.    According to Zorkin, he has not yet decided whether he will  stay in the Constitutional Court, resign or get involved in  politics, all the more so since the court's activities are still  suspended and "it is ridiculous to pretend that it is working."    At the same time, such a situation to some extent can be  justified, Zorkin believes. "If the Constitutional Court starts  to work now, in the present unclear legal situation, it would  find itself in a false situation," Zorkin said. There is only  the new Constitution. The Duma has not in essence adopted a  single law, there is no clear legal field. The Constitutional  Court is the body oriented for an absolutely clear legal  situation with a good-working mechanism of the division of  powers and a legal basis."    Perhaps this is the reason why the authorities are not  encouraging the Constitutional Court to start working  immediately, Zorkin suggested.</p>

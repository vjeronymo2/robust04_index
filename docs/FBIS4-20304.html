			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The State Issues Policy Adjustments </F> Regarding Enterprise Groups"]    [Text] Recently the relevant agency of the state issued  five adjustment policies on enterprise groups:    1. The central government directly regulates and controls  the  enterprise groups with separate plans nationwide, breaking down  the preexisting confines resulting from enterprise groups' being  owned by the various sectors and localities.    2. The leadership system of enterprise groups in cities with  separate plans assumes three forms: first, the state establishes  its representative bodies such as boards of directors and  management committees which will exercise leadership over the  collectives with separate plans; second, enterprises based on  the joint stock system may use the system of general manager  responsibility under the leadership of the board of directors;  and, third, enterprises based on all-people ownership may use  the system of general manager responsibility under the  leadership of the board of directors.    3. The state will give some financial means to enterprise  groups which are covered by the trial operation of the separate  plan system. Those enterprises which meet the requirements may  create financial companies, and may issue bonds and stocks  domestically with the necessary approvals.    4. Enterprise groups covered by the trial operation of the  separate plan system are granted some autonomy regarding foreign  trade operations.    5. The top executives of enterprise groups covered by the  trial operation of the separate plan system have the right to  give approvals on matters of production, business operation, and  circulation.

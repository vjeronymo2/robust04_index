			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 4 KENTUCKY SHERIFFS ARRESTED AS FBI CLOSES DRUG-PROTECTION TRAP  </P> <P> The sheriffs of four counties in the eastern Kentucky hills were arrested  Thursday on charges that they took money to provide protection for drug  traffickers passing cocaine through the state.  </P> <P> The FBI set up the sting operation last year with two agents acting as Chicago  businessmen interested in shipping cocaine. At one point, cocaine packages were  airdropped onto a farm owned by one of the officers, authorities said.  </P> <P> "What this particular situation does reflect is the absolute corrupting  influence of drugs," said U.S. Atty. Louie DeFalaise. "As far as law  enforcement officials . . . this is the largest case that we can recall."  </P> <P> The sheriffs and two other officers were charged in a 42-count indictment that  accused them of conspiracy, drug distribution and protecting other drug  traffickers.  </P> <P> Forty FBI agents fanned out through the contiguous counties of Breathitt, Lee,  Owsley and Wolfe to make the arrests Thursday.  </P> <P> Detained were Lee County Sheriff Johnny Mann, 39; Breathitt County Sheriff Dean  Spencer, 46; Wolfe County Sheriff Lester Drake, 51; and Owsley County Sheriff  Billy McIntosh, 57.  </P> <P> Also arrested were Beattyville Police Chief Omer Noe and Wolfe County deputy  Wilson Stone.  </P> <P> At a hearing before a federal magistrate, five of the men were released on  bond. Mann was denied bond after an undercover agent testified he had promised  during the yearlong sting to kill anyone who set him up.  </P> <P> According to the indictment, agents first met with Mann in Lee County. He  allegedly introduced them to the other local law officers.  </P> <P> From August, 1989, until this month, the agents paid officers more than  $85,000. The money was in exchange for protecting the agents' fake cocaine and  marijuana smuggling and distribution business from police detection and other  interference, the indictment said.  </P> <P> DeFalaise said the cocaine, which totaled almost 250 pounds, was never  distributed for sale to the public.  </P> <P> The initial conspiracy and extortion counts carry a maximum penalty of 20 years  in prison and a $250,000 fine, or both. The drug counts carry a minimum prison  term of 10 years to life and a fine of $4 million.  </P></p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Sedgwick disappoints City with 5% advance Sedgwick Group, the insurance broker, yesterday announced a 5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 43.6m for the first quarter of 1994, up from Pounds 41.6m. The figures disappointed most analysts, however, and the share price fell 6p to 197p. The result was affected by a poor performance from Sedgwick's UK reinsurance business, and a combination of restructuring costs and a seasonally quiet start to the year at Noble Lowndes, the employee benefits consultancy. Revenue from brokerage and fees increased to Pounds 239.8m (Pounds 204.9m) while interest and investment income fell Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 9.6m, reflecting lower interest rates. Mr Stuart Tarrant, finance director, said the results were in line with the statement at the annual meeting that Sedgwick would experience a flatter first half and stronger second half, compared with previous years. He said present performance was in line with budget forecasts. Sedgwick Payne, the reinsurance arm, was hit by the large number of clients who have withdrawn from the London underwriting market. But Mr Tarrant said the business would improve in the second half. Noble Lowndes, acquired from TSB on September 30, was affected by restructuring in the US, where 150 people were made redundant through the closure and merger of offices. Mr Tarrant said the more substantial UK business had performed in line with expectations. Earnings per share dipped to 5p (5.7p) as a result of the August rights issue.</p>

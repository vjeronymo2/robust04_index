			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> N. KOREA OFFERS SMALL BORDER OPENING  </P> <P> North Korea offered Friday to open a small stretch of its border to promote  unification with South Korea, but its capitalist rival dismissed the gesture as  insignificant.  </P> <P> Pyongyang announced that it would open the northern sector of Panmunjom, a  border village, on Aug. 15, according to Naewoe Press, a semi-official South  Korean news agency.  </P> <P> North Korea said opening the area, about 800 yards long and 500 yards wide, is  intended to promote unification of the Korean peninsula. It urged South Korea  to do the same.  </P> <P> The opening, however, would not permit foreigners to travel past the perimeter  of Panmunjom, a truce village that straddles part of the 155-mile border  between the two Koreas. The village is jointly controlled by North Korea and a  U.N. Command.  </P></p>

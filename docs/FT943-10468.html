			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Focus on drugs sector while blue chips drift Wall Street Blue chip stocks drifted slightly easier yesterday in a cautious session highlighted by news of takeover activity in the pharmaceuticals sector, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 3.56 off at 3,792.66, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 edged ahead 0.89 to 461.45. Volume on the Big Board came to 282.4m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was up a scant 0.85 at 440.59 and the Nasdaq composite slipped 1.11 to 723.69. At the opening, the market picked up where it left off at Tuesday's close. In the final minutes of the previous session, American Home Products surprised Wall Street by announcing an offer to acquire American Cyanamid for Dollars 8.5bn, or Dollars 95 a share. Trading in both issues was halted on the news. When it resumed yesterday, Cyanamid jumped by 43 per cent, or Dollars 27, to Dollars 90 3/4 and it was the most heavily traded NYSE issue with 7.2m shares dealt. SmithKline Beecham, which had been discussing an asset swap with Cyanamid before the bid surfaced, firmed Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 28 1/2 . AHP gained Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 57 3/8 . Signs of further consolidation in the healthcare industry inspired heavy activity in other drugs stocks. Warner Lambert jumped Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 72 1/2 on volume of 2.4m shares, while Schering Plough climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 67 7/8 . But Bristol Myers Squibb lost Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 53 1/2 . The enthusiasm, however, never spilled over into other sectors, as investors continued to tread water ahead of Friday's crucial report on July employment conditions. Yesterday's economic news mostly conformed to the expectations of analysts. The Commerce Department reported a 0.2 per cent gain in its June index of leading economic indicators, mostly because of rising prices for raw materials. The data presaged a moderating growth trend in the second half. New orders of factory goods, up 0.8 per cent last month, came in a shade under the consensus forecast. Factory inventories edged higher for the fifth time in six months, but economists had expected as much. Since the reports held no surprises, they were ignored by investors, who were still looking to confirm suspicions that the Federal Reserve would delay its next move to tighten credit. In the meantime, share prices tended to drift lower. Among the Dow industrials, United Technologies, down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 62 1/8 , was hit by profit-taking. Caterpillar eased Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 108 5/8 but International Paper added Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 76 3/8 . A second hostile takeover announced just after Tuesday's close raised a ripple of excitement yesterday. Unitrin surged 24 per cent, or Dollars 9, to Dollars 49 3/8 on news of American General's offer to pay Dollars 50 3/8 for each share. The suitor's shares added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 28 1/2 . Other insurance issues held fairly steady. On the Nasdaq, Snapple Beverage was marked down Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 15 1/4 after the company posted second-quarter net income of 19 cents a share, two cents less than analysts had expected.</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SAN FERNANDO BREEZES TO VICTORY OVER TAFT  </P> <P> Taft High Coach Tom Stevenson is the kind of guy who would wear shorts in a  blizzard. Friday night, he did just that.  </P> <P> In an unseasonably cold windstorm that was enough to chill the hardiest of  souls, San Fernando won in -- appropriately enough -- a blowout.  </P> <P> The Tigers scored twice in the first five minutes and poured it on in the  second half of a 37-0 victory in a Northwest Valley Conference game at San  Fernando.  </P> <P> These were not the winds of change: It marked the third shutout of the season  for San Fernando, which has not lost to Taft since 1979.  </P> <P> "That was a good, old-fashioned Eastside . . . whipping," Stevenson said. "They  dominated us from start to finish. It was embarrassing."  </P> <P> San Fernando (4-2, 2-1 in league play) was led by running back Leonice Brown, a  senior transfer from Crespi who scored a career-high three touchdowns on runs  of 19, three and 21 yards.  </P> <P> Brown finished with a game-high 79 yards in 13 carries. Backfield mates  LaKarlos Townsend and Will Taylor added 60 and 56 yards, respectively.  </P> <P> Once again, it was the unselfish Tiger trio that led the way. Brown said that  he didn't mind sharing the load one bit.  </P> <P> "It doesn't matter how many yards we get," Brown said. "As long as we win, who  cares who has the most yards?"  </P> <P> In this case, it was Brown's younger brother, Johnnie, whose yardage won't show  up in the offensive totals.  </P> <P> Leading, 15-0, San Fernando applied the coup de grace with 5 minutes 53 seconds  left in the third quarter. Taft (3-2, 2-1) drove inside the Tiger 10, but the  drive stalled and Stevenson sent in the field-goal crew. Kicker Carlos  Mansilla's 19-yard attempt struck one of his linemen and Johnnie Brown scooped  up the loose ball and raced 86 yards for a touchdown and a 23-0 lead.  </P> <P> "That was tight down there," San Fernando Coach Tom Hernandez said. "That could  have turned it around. But we make the big play and take it in. It was tight,  real tight."  </P> <P> Thereafter, Taft came undone.  </P> <P> Brown scored on a three-yard run with 8:52 remaining and from 12 yards with  3:25 left.  </P> <P> Taft, which lost five fumbles, was held to 90 yards. Tailback Darnell Hendricks  gained 39 yards in 14 carries. San Fernando gained 235 yards, 195 on the  ground.  </P> <P> A 25-yard "punt" return by Townsend gave San Fernando the ball on its own 27 in  the first quarter. Taft, heading into a strong head wind, elected to have  Mansilla kick a line drive out of field-goal formation.  </P> <P> On the first play, Taylor broke loose and scored for a 6-0 lead with 9:50  remaining in the quarter.  </P> <P> Taft didn't do much better the next time it got its hands on the ball, mainly  because it never got its hands on the ball. Quarterback Karlon Mack fumbled the  snap from center on first and 10 from the Toreador 28, and San Fernando's  Anthony Murray recovered.  </P> <P> Three plays later, Leonice Brown took a pitch around right end for a 19-yard  touchdown, giving San Fernando a 12-0 lead.  </P> <P> San Fernando's Jose Servin kicked a 40-yard field goal into the wind to give  the Tigers a 15-0 lead with 8:20 left in the half.  </P></p>

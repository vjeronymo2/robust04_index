			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- Japan has prepared a draft  amendment to legislation that would partially lift curbs on  foreign lawyers wishing to practice in Japan, officials said  Wednesday [16 March].    The draft, released to members of the House of  Representatives justice committee, constitutes a proposed  amendment to a law regulating the professional activities of  foreign lawyers in Japan.    The draft bill envisions conditionally authorizing Japanese  and foreign lawyers to run a joint law firm and provide legal  consultation services, although it will keep a ban on the  personal hiring by foreign lawyers of Japanese lawyers in Japan.    One of the two conditions mandates that Japanese lawyers  wishing to start a joint law firm must have practiced for more  than five years since registering with the Japan Federation of  Bar Associations.    Under the other condition, however, the proposed legislation  will continue to bar foreign lawyers from arguing both criminal  and civil cases in Japanese courts.    If the two conditions are met, a joint law firm as an entity  will be authorized to hire Japanese lawyers, according to the  text of the bill.    If enacted, the amendment will allow a client to receive  consultation services regarding Japanese and foreign laws from a  single law firm.    The government plans to introduce the amendment in  parliament  in early April. If approved, it will come into force within a  year.    The amendment will also soften the current law's principle  of  mutual benefits, thereby authorizing lawyers from countries that  ban foreign lawyers' activities to practice law in Japan.    The amendment calls for qualifying foreign lawyers, who have  practiced law for more than five years in countries where they  obtained licenses, to practice law in Japan.    It will also soften a five-year requirement by allowing such  lawyers to count up to two years of practicing law in Japan as a  legal trainee as part of the five-year requirement.    The legislation will allow foreign law firms to use in Japan  the corporate names they use in their countries of origin.    The amendment was sketched out as a result of joint study by  the Japan Federation of Bar Associations and the Justice  Ministry.    Its broad outline was released as part of a package of pump-  priming economic measures in February by the government of Prime  Minister Horihiro Hosokawa.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Technology: Stoking up the engine - Bill Clinton has pledged to make technology a central focus of his administration. FT writers look at what the investment really means 'THE GESTALT of the gigabit' is President Bill Clinton's new catchphrase for the high-technology focus of his administration. He has proposed a Dollars 17bn (Pounds 11.9bn) four-year plan for new and expanded federally-funded technology projects and tax incentives. Creating new 'high-value jobs' is the primary goal of the Clinton technology policy, which the president unveiled during a visit to Silicon Valley last month. He called for the creation of a 'public-private sector partnership' that will generate investment in technology development and encourage the formation of high-tech companies. We want to 'generate more of these kinds of companies, more technological advances to keep the US always on the cutting edge of change and to make sure that we'll be able to create a lot of good new jobs in the future,' the president told workers at Silicon Graphics, the computer workstation company where he unveiled his technology initiatives. Almost 40 per cent of the proposed technology budget is in the form of research and development tax credits designed to encourage private-sector investment. Responding to industry demands, the president has proposed the tax credit be made permanent. Over the past few years the tax credit has been enacted each year, but only after it expired, so companies could not count on it when drawing up their R&amp;D budgets. The president's broader economic plan also includes tax incentives for long-term investment in small companies and some tax relief on capital investments for larger companies. However, the tax cuts will be at least partially offset by an increase in corporate tax rates. On the spending side, the Clinton technology policy proposes a significant shift in the use of federal funds to back non-defence research. In the 1993 fiscal year, the civilian share of the total federal research and development budget was approximately 41 per cent, or Dollars 27.9bn, according to the administration. The president aims to increase this to more than 50 per cent, or Dollars 36.6bn by 1998. In future, the US government will play a direct role in helping companies to develop and profit from innovations rather than funding defence or space missions that serendipitously provide 'spin-offs' for the commercial sector. The flagship of the technology plan is the 'information superhighway' scheme; a nationwide high-speed broadband communications network linking businesses, schools, libraries, hospitals, government offices and, ultimately, homes. Another example of 'industry-government partnership' in the Clinton technology policy is the advanced manufacturing initiative which will provide matching funds to industry consortia, using Sematech, the US semiconductor industry research group, as a model. The federal government will also match state and regional funds to create a national network of 'manufacturing extension centres' that disseminate information on the latest manufacturing technology. The National Institute of Standards and Technology's advanced technology programme will be significantly expanded to provide matching grants to industry-led research and development projects including consortia such as Sematech. Funding for Nist will be increased from Dollars 381m in 1993 to Dollars 1.2bn in 1997. Other national laboratories will also be drawn into the effort to boost industrial competitiveness. The Clinton policy sets a target of 10 to 20 per cent of the budgets of the labs being devoted to research and development partnerships with industry. Clinton also aims to cut spending on 'big science' projects, while maintaining basic research as a high priority. Although sceptical about how much impact these programmes will have, US high-technology industry executives are generally happy with the Clinton administration's increased focus on technology. 'We are pleased to see the new administration emphasising the high-technology segment as the key to rebuilding the manufacturing infrastructure of the US,' said William Reed, president of Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International, an industry trade group. The president's leadership in establishing programmes and policy directions geared to advancing the development and use of technology will have more impact than the money being spent on technology policy, says Ed McCracken, president of Silicon Graphics. The high-tech industry is also responding keenly to the president's call for industry-government co-operation. Semi, for example, is proposing a government-backed consortium to develop manufacturing technology for flat panel displays, such as those used in portable computers. Currently, Japan dominates this market. The readiness of US high-tech industry groups to accept a more activist role by government is in some ways surprising. Silicon Valley, in particular, has long been known for its independent, entrepreneurial companies. 'There is still a cowboy spirit in Silicon Valley, we like to think we can take care of ourselves,' says McCracken. Nonetheless, he believes that an 'arm's length' relationship between industry and government no longer makes sense. 'With the issues facing our country today, in particular the need to create jobs, I believe that we have to work together.' Yet to be seen, however, is whether the policy will produce a net increase in employment. Although a sampling of almost 700 venture capital-backed start-up companies created over 22,000 jobs last year, according to a recent survey, total employment in the US electronics industry has declined in each of the past four years. New companies are not creating jobs as fast as established companies are laying off workers. It is also evident that technology eliminates jobs - on the factory floor and in the office. Yet to remain competitive companies have to become more productive and cannot afford to be afraid of losing jobs, industry executives say. 'If you assume that those jobs are going to go away, then you have to deal with the problem. One of the things I like about the Clinton programme is that he seemed to be ready to tackle this issue,' says McCracken. The ability to adjust to the rapid changes brought about by technology advances is one of the trademarks of a successful high-technology company. The government, Clinton says, must work more like that, adopting the philosophy of the high-tech industry, or the 'gestalt of the gigabit'. 'I believe my job as president is to try to adjust America so that we can win in the 21st century, so that we can make change our friend and not our enemy.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Clinton's technology proposals (additional funds) 1994-97  ----------------------------------------------------------------                                                         dollars m Nasa civil aviation and short-haul aircraft research          600 Dual-use technology for defence reinvestment and transition                                              1,331 Federal Co-ordinating Council for Science Engineering and Technology (research initiatives)           1,206 High-performance computing                                    784 National Institution of Standards and Technology            1,306 National labs (non-defence)                                   146 Information highways                                          275 National Science Foundation                                 2,297 Government automation and efficiency                        2,649 Extend R&amp;D tax Credit                                       6,437  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Total:                                                     17,031  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Source: White House  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

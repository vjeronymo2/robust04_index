			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Boundary change threat to Smith PROPOSED boundary changes in Scottish constituencies could result in Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, having to contest a marginal seat at the next general election. Under proposals announced yesterday by Scotland's Boundary Commission Mr Smith's Monklands East constituency near Glasgow would be reshaped and become vulnerable to the Scottish National Party. A new seat of Cumbernauld and Airdrie would take in areas of Cumbernauld, where the SNP is strong. At last year's general election Mr Smith had a majority of 15,712. The SNP calculated yesterday that ward-by-ward voting in last year's district council elections in the proposed Cumbernauld and Airdrie constituency gave the SNP 47.1 per cent of the vote against Labour's 45.2 per cent. Mr Jack McConnell, secretary of the Labour party in Scotland, said that on voting records going back for several years he was confident that Labour would win the seat comfortably 'especially with the leader of the party standing'. But Mr McConnell added that the proposed new boundaries for the area would be challenged, resulting in a public inquiry, because they cut across identifiable communities. The boundary commission might then have to come forward with new proposals.</p>

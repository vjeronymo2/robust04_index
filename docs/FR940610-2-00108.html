Instead, he has the discretion to give each factor the weight he deems appropriate, depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> David E. Trawick, D.D.S.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Docket No. 88&hyph;69, 53 FR 5326 (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this proceeding factors one, two, three, and five apply. Factor one is applicable based upon the California Board of Pharmacy's suspensions and probation terms imposed on the licenses of Respondent pharmacy and the pharmacist's license of Mr. Kastigar in 1985 and 1988. Factor two applies because Respondent dispensed controlled substances without a physician's authorization or for no legitimate medical reason on a number of occasions between 1983 and 1993. Factor three is applicable based upon the conviction of Mr. Kastigar in the Municipal Court for the South Bay Judicial District, County of Los Angeles, State of California, of one count of unlawfully furnishing controlled substances. Factor five applies because Mr. Kastigar made two material falsifications on the application he submitted for a new DEA Certificate of Registration on June 4, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No evidence of explanation or mitigating circumstances has been offered by Respondent. Therefore, the Deputy Administrator concludes that Respondent's application for a DEA Certificate of Registration must be denied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104, hereby orders that the application executed by Village Drug, on June 4, 1993, for a DEA Certificate or Registration as a retail pharmacy, be, and it hereby is, denied. This order is effective June 10, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 3, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen H.

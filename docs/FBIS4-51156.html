			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Kuo Hung-chih (6753 1347 3112): "Russia To </F> Authorize China To Manufacture Sukhoi Su-27 Fighters"]    [Excerpt] Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  arrives in Beijing today for a four-day visit. Aside from  discussing economic issues with Beijing, he will conclude with  the Chinese side a final agreement on authorizing the latter to  manufacture Sukhoi Su-27 fighters.    According to a source in Beijing, China is discussing the  issue of transferring manufacturing techniques for Su-27  fighters. Beijing is very likely to gain the license. While  meeting with high-ranking Beijing leaders, Chernomyrdin will  probably finalize the move. The mainland has purchased 26  Su-27's from Russia and an order for another 26 Su-27K's is  under negotiation.    Apart from matters related to the Su-27, Chernomyrdin will  reportedly discuss cooperation between the two countries in the  hi-tech field, including cooperation in the hi-tech defense area.    Aleksandr Shokhin, deputy Russian prime minister and head of  the Russian side of the "Russian-Chinese Economic, Trade,  Scientific, and Technological Council," yesterday called upon  Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of China's Central Military  Commission. Though both sides did not disclose the specific  contents of the meeting, it is believed that they must have  touched upon arms deals. Shokhin is responsible for trade with  China, while the arms deal is part and parcel of bilateral trade.    Shokhin came to Beijing to attend the "Russian-Chinese  Economic, Trade, Scientific, and Technological Council" meeting  due to open on next Tuesday. The meeting is scheduled to be  held once a year, but it has been 18 months since the last  meeting. In the first quarter of this year, the bilateral trade  volume dropped by 43.5 percent compared with the same period  last year. The coming meeting is designed to clear away  obstacles hindering the expansion of bilateral trade. [passage  omitted]</p>

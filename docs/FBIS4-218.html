			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town April 4 SAPA -- The South African Police  Union [SAPU] has threatened to strike unless member salaries are  increased to the levels of the National Peace Keeping Force  [NPKF]. Lt-Col Andy Miller, SAPU national and Western Cape  president, said on Monday [4 April] that members were prepared  to "sacrifice the election" if their demands for wage parity  were not implemented by April 13.    The union, which represents 20,000 members, made the threat  despite a Transitional Executive Council (TEC) proposal to  treble police salaries from R22.50 [rands] to R61.50. The TEC  Law and Order Sub-committee is expected to hear the proposal on  Thursday. Col Miller said, however, that a crippling strike on  the eve of the election could only be averted if police were  paid the same as their NPKF counterparts, many of whom earned  double. "I wouldn't call that blackmail. I'd call it justice.  We've been treated like animals," he said. He said the TEC's  proposed increases would fail to match those of the NPKF, whose  members would earn an additional R35 per day once they were  deployed.    "We will not allow policemen to strike," Law and Order  Ministry spokesman Craig Kotze said on Thursday. He said there  was "no reason" for a stoppage and "all channels were in place"  for policemen to air their grievances.</p>

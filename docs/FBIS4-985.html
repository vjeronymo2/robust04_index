			<p>BFN     [Text] Four accords concerning the creation of the new  Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, FADM, were signed in Maputo  yesterday by General Tobias Dai, on behalf of the government,  and General Edmundo de Morais, of the Mozambique National  Resistance.    Those documents dealt with hierarchical structure, general  organization, and the organization and training of the battalion  of special forces and of air force personnel.    Aldo Ajello, head of the UN Operations in Mozambique, said  that the signing of those documents is a step forward toward  pacifying the country.</p>

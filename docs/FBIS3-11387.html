			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Mary Simon] </F>   [Text] Geneva, 11 Mar (PL) -- After approving more than 100  resolutions, the 50th session of the UN Human Rights Commission  ended with a feeling of uncertainty about the commission's  impartiality and credibility.    The concern about impartiality, closely linked to the  credibility factor, is based on the Commission's attitude toward  specific subjects, such as the people's right to  self-determination, economic, social, cultural, and children's  rights.    Although generally those points are given importance on the  agenda, when discussed they are viewed with a sense of critical  selectivity toward developing nations.    In contrast, extremely serious matters that prevail in the  so-called industrialized societies, where for example there is  social and labor discrimination against women, are overlooked.    Selectiveness is also used when judging specific countries  where special rapporteurs have been appointed, even though  within the commission, no one doubts that the alleged violations  requiring specific supervision do not exist.    A very interesting example is Cuba, which has had an  appointed special rapporteur whose mandate was the result of  U.S. political manipulation of the island's situation since 1990.    Of the 108 resolutions adopted, those referring to topic 12  on the agenda -- violations occurring anywhere -- the majority  condemn Third World countries, while similar texts linked to  practices in the industrialized West are nonexistent.    Many participants of the forum continue to wonder how much  longer they must wait before the principles of impartiality,  nonselectiveness, and objectiveness return to the Commission,  and some even wonder if they were ever present.    Other sectors besides the 53 Commission-member countries,  such as nongovernmental organizations (ONG) have described the  50th session results as unbalanced.    In evaluating the meeting, Reed Brody, director of the  International Human Rights Juridical Group and the person who  coordinates the efforts of more than 3,000 ONG, said it is very  easy to condemn small countries, but when it comes to powerful  countries that commit violations, destroy ethnic identities, or  maintain thousands of prisoners, the Commission is paralyzed.    By observing the countries where rapporteurs have been  appointed (Afghanistan, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Haiti,  Iran, Iraq, South Africa, Sudan, and the former Yugoslavia), it  is obvious that no West Europe country is on the list.    The 50th session, however, heard numerous reports of  violations against immigrants, racial discrimination,  mistreatment, and abuse of power by police forces in countries  like France, the United States, and the UK, to mention a few.    A dozen industrialized nations were mentioned in the ONG  reports and even in the rapporteur's report on the sale of  children, child prostitution, teen pornography, illegal  adoptions, and the illegal commercialization of transplant  organs, but none were subject to rapporteurs or condemned.</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The cost of a fair deal - Products appealing to consumer conscience Two years ago, Justino Peck, a cocoa farmer from a small village near the Maya mountains in Belize, abandoned his crop following a collapse in international prices. Now he is back in production with a three-year contract to supply cocoa beans to Green &amp; Black's chocolate company in Britain. Maya Gold chocolate made from Peck's beans went on sale in 80 supermarkets in the UK last week as the first product to carry a seal of approval from Fairtrade, an organisation which is trying to ensure workers in the Third World get a better deal. In July, the Royal Society for the Protection of Animals (RSPCA) plans to issue its own label - Freedom Food - for meat and eggs which have been produced, transported and slaughtered in a humane way. Both organisations hope to capitalise on the conscience of the 1990s consumer who fills his supermarket trolley with environmentally friendly washing powder and recycled toilet paper. A poll by NOP for Christian Aid conducted in October last year found that 68 per cent of the 1,000 adults surveyed said they would be willing to pay more for products that guaranteed a fair return to farmers and workers in the Third World. The average amount consumers were prepared to pay was 25p on an item that normally costs Pounds 1. The RSPCA's own research has indicated that 30 per cent of those polled would pay up to 50 per cent more for meat from an animal that had been well treated. Maya Gold chocolate costs Pounds 1.55 for 100g compared with 65p for the same amount of Cadbury's Bourneville chocolate, but the company says it contains three times as much cocoa. Green &amp; Black's is paying the Belize farmers 48p per lb for their cocoa beans which is higher than the current free market price of 41.5p per lb. Similarly, Cafedirect, a high-quality ground coffee containing beans from Costa Rica, Mexico, Nicaragua and Peru, pays its suppliers up to double the market rate paid by other companies. Cafedirect, which has been on the supermarket shelves for two years, will carry the Fairtrade mark from April. Fairtrade is looking at other products such as tea and honey, but these are not likely to capture more than a very small share of the mass market. Although many consumers say in market research they want to pay more for a 'conscience' product, it is hard to get them to part with their money. The Co-operative Wholesale Society has been looking for several years to launch its own brand of 'conscience' products such as coffee, tea and honey. But 'when it comes to the crunch, particularly in a recession, people are looking for bargains', says Martin Henderson from the Co-op. The Co-op was the first supermarket chain to carry Cafedirect, but has found that sales have been disappointing. 'We're looking for a bigger volume market to move into, but we haven't cracked it yet,' says Henderson. The most important problem faced by retailers and companies looking to appeal to peoples' consciences is in how to turn aspirations into hard cash. Mike Sharp, marketing manager for the RSPCA, says the problem lies in public confusion over claims made by certain products. Consumers are also cynical about being offered another marketing ploy. The RSPCA is hoping that its Freedom Food mark will not only occupy a niche but also cover as wide a part of the market as possible. 'The consumer response has been very positive because the RSPCA is trusted as an independent party,' said Sharp. The label will be issued on pork and eggs in July and move to all other products derived from animals in the longer term. Richard Adams, who runs the New Consumer Organisation, a research group, thinks the way to encourage the public to buy 'conscience' products could be to group them in a separate High Street store. He is currently conducting a feasibility study.</p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: Disney film chief leaves as unit is revamped Walt Disney said that Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg is to step down as chairman of its film entertainment unit, Walt Disney Pictures, when his contract expires at the end of next month. The group also announced that the film unit is to be restructured. It will be split into two separate entities: one for television and telecommunications, which will be run by Mr Richard Frank, currently president of Disney Studios, and one for movie production and distribution, to be run by Mr Joe Roth, chairman of the group's Caravan Pictures affiliate. The departure of the 43-year old Mr Katzenberg is a blow to Disney. Under his tenure, Disney has been one of the most successful studios in Hollywood. This year, the animated film The Lion King was a huge international hit and is poised to become one of the most successful films of all time. Mr Katzenberg's decision to leave Disney is believed to be related to the failure of Mr Michael Eisner, the group's chairman, to appoint a successor to Mr Frank Wells, the former Disney president who was killed in a helicopter accident in April. Mr Katzenberg's achievements in his nearly 10 years as head of Disney's studios had appeared to make the 43-year old executive a natural heir to Mr Wells' position. When Mr Eisner declined to appoint a new president, it was widely seen as a rejection of Mr Katzenberg as a potential future Disney chairman.</p>

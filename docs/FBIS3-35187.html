			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin and Shlomo </F> Dror]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Numerous incidents took place  yesterday throughout the West Bank, including Hebron, Halhul,  and Ramallah. In Halhul, residents rioted in protest over the  16 February killing of a local resident by soldiers. The man, a  student by the name of Marwan Sa'ada, was 19 years old. Two  Halhul residents sustained slight injuries yesterday. Army  sources said the locals threw stones at soldiers, who opened  fire in response. One of the injured is 19-year-old 'Abid  Muhammad Sa'id.    Palestinian sources said the second casualty, Ayub Milhim,  was shot in the head by settlers traveling in a car that came  under a barrage of stones. The two wounded men were transferred  to the 'Aliya and al-Wahali Hospitals in Hebron.    Four locals were wounded -- two in Rafah and two in the  Jabalyah refugee camp -- in clashes with soldiers in the Gaza  Strip yesterday. Two soldiers were slightly injured by stones  in Gaza. They received medical treatment on the spot and were  sent back to their units.    A resident of the al-Mughazi refugee camp in the central  Strip was murdered yesterday because he was suspected of  collaboration. The man, 'Abdallah Abad, was abducted from his  home by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] activists. His wife  was seriously wounded.    Military sources have stated that a rise has been noted in  incidents in the territories inspired by Hamas and the Islamic  Jihad. The security forces are still in pursuit of the  terrorist squad that murdered Shin Bet squad operator No'am  Kohen near Ramallah.    Yesterday, the terrorists who murdered No'am Kohen this week  called on Palestinian collaborators to turn on those who  recruited them and promised protection and pardon to anyone who  murders his operator.    Declaring a war on the Shin Bet, the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam  squad pledged to put an end to the phenomenon of Palestinian  collaboration with Israel. "We will regard every collaborator  who kills his operator and brings us his weapon and identity  card as a convert," said a leaflet disseminated by a group  calling itself the "al-Qassam Psychological Warfare Department."    Squad members said they will arm the converted collaborators  and find them asylum.    An approximately 50-year-old resident of Bethlehem was found  battered and tied up in a cave in Jerusalem yesterday. A  preliminary investigation revealed that the man had been  kidnapped from his home by three masked men who accused him of  collaboration with Israel. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: EDS wins Xerox network contract Electronic Data Systems (EDS), the computer services company owned by General Motors, has won a Dollars 3.2bn 10-year contract to take over operation of Xerox's computer and telecommunications network worldwide. The 'outsourcing' contract is believed to be the largest of its kind, and the first to encompass the worldwide information management operations of any company. Under the arrangement, EDS will assume responsibility for Xerox data-processing, telecommunications and computer network services in 19 countries, and provide and maintain the computer applications that support Xerox's internal business processes. It will take control of data centre operations, including the main ones in the US, the UK and Brazil; worldwide voice and data communications; desktop systems support; and existing business-support applications. Xerox will retain responsibility for determining the architecture of its computer systems, strategy and new program development. It will also continue to service and support its customers. Some 1,700 Xerox employees, including 1,400 in the US and 750 in the UK, will transfer to EDS over the next 18 months. Xerox has taken the unprecedented step of outsourcing almost all its information management operations to 'focus resources on our core business of document processing, which is critical to ensure our continued success in a fiercely competitive industry', said Mr Paul Allaire, Xerox chairman. He said the outsourcing arrangement would cut costs. 'This is the first truly global commercial information-management outsourcing arrangement and provides an opportunity for EDS to showcase its proven capabilities,' said Mr Les Alberthal, EDS chairman, president and chief executive. The Xerox contract follows EDS's recent Dollars 1.5bn order to handle computer operations for the Inland Revenue, the UK tax authority.</p>

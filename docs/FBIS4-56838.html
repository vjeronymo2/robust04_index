			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Leaks and Tips" column] </F>   [Text] In violation of electoral provisions, some PRD  [Democratic Revolutionary Party] candidates in various electoral  districts offered to buy votes with payments ranging from  $20-$30 per vote. This was also an old practice of ousted  General Manuel Antonio Noriega's associates. The Office of the  Electoral Prosecutor should immediately conduct a detailed  investigation of this crime. The purchase of votes occurred in  Cabuya, Anton... Parque Lefevre... Rio Abajo, as well as in  David and Puerto Armuelles. [ellipses as published]    At the Salinera voting table in Nata, even presidential  ballots were stolen. These ballots, according to what was  learned, were removed by PRD activists. Also, in Chitre, Ocu,  and Parita, PRD activists protested at several voting stations  with other parties. The PRD activists arrived at the time of  closing of the voting tables to cast their votes, which is  illegal.</p>

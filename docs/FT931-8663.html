			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Non-executive directors Lord Moore of Lower Marsh, a former Conservative minister until 1989 and chairman of Credit Suisse Asset Management, at BLUE CIRCLE INDUSTRIES. ***** Frank Knight, deputy chairman of Asda and Berisford, at LONDON INTERNATIONAL GROUP. ***** Michael Blackburn, recently retired chairman of Touche Ross, at JW SPEAR. ***** Nicholas Ward, group md of the Brent Walker Group and former chairman and chief executive of Macarthy, and Charles Goodson-Wickes MP, an occupational physician and PPS to the minister for housing and planning, at NESTOR-BNA from June 1. ***** James Meynell, a director of Watchname and Cardiac Controls Inc, at WESTMINSTER SCAFFOLDING GROUP. ***** The Earl of Limerick (above) has been given a licence to print money. The former merchant banker has taken over the chairmanship of De La Rue, the world's largest commercial printer of banknotes. Pat Limerick, 62, replaces Peter Orchard, chairman for the past five years, who died suddenly last month. He has been on the De La Rue board since 1983 and since a couple of his colleagues - Sir Douglas Wass and Martin Harris are retiring this year - he was one of the most senior non-executive directors and a natural successor to Peter Orchard. De La Rue is also strengthening its board. John Robb, Wellcome's 56-year-old chief executive, has been appointed a non-executive director and Robert Gardner, 56, managing director of De La Rue's payment systems division, also joins the board. He came from Gestetner in July 1990. Despite his aristocratic background, the Old Etonian sixth Earl of Limerick is well plugged into the City - which could be useful if corporate predators were ever to show interest in De La Rue again. A chartered accountant by training, he spent 20 years as a director of Kleinwort Benson rising to be deputy chairman. A former chairman of the British Overseas Trade Board and British Invisibles, he has a number of other chairmanships including Pirelli UK and AMP Asset Management.</p>

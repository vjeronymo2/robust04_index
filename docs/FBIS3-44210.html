Armed clashes are taking place there in which military  personnel is actively involved. The impression is created that  the instigators of the disturbances are trying to exploit  dissatisfaction in the Army circles with the number of  unresolved socioeconomic problems to overthrow the legitimate  government of Lesotho. Expressing serious concern in connection  with the development of events in this country, with which we  have long-standing friendly relations, the Minister of Foreign  Affairs of Russia calls upon the parties to the conflict in  Lesotho to put an end to the bloodshed, proceed to a peaceful  settlement of their disagreement within the framework of a  political dialogue in the interest of the people of Lesotho,  peace and stability in the whole region of southern Africa, and  its further democratic development.

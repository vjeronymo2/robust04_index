			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / China's exports up by 31.2% China's exports continued to grow more strongly than imports in the seven months to the end of July, indicating a smaller trade deficit for the year than forecast, Tony Walker reports from Beijing. According to Chinese customs statistics, exports reached Dollars 58.74bn (Pounds 39.1bn), an increase of 31.2 per cent over the same period last year. Imports totalled Dollars 58.81bn, up 19 per cent. In July exports grew much faster than imports: they were up by 35.7 per cent compared with a rise in imports of just 9.7 per cent. This indicates imports continue to slow in response to tight restriction on credit imposed in July last year and tightened in the early months of this year. China last year recorded a Dollars 12.2bn deficit on its trading account compared with a surplus of Dollars 4.4bn in 1992. Chinese economists had forecast a Dollars 10bn trade deficit this year, but it now seems likely it will be less. Chinese customs reported that to the end of July, Japan was China's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching Dollars 23.15bn compared with Dollars 20.98bn for Hong Kong and Dollars 17.2bn for the US.</p>

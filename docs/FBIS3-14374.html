Speaking to reporters here this afternoon on the sidelines  of  the Arab League Council meetings, the Qatari minister said that  during his meeting with Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id  al-Sahhaf yesterday, he urged Iraq to implement the Security  Council resolutions on the Gulf war so that the embargo imposed  on Iraq could be lifted. He noted that contacts are under way  to study Iraq's proposal to form a popular committee from the  Gulf states to visit Iraq to resolve the problem of Kuwaiti  prisoners there. The results of these contacts, he added, are  not clear yet.    On reports that Qatar will extend a natural gas pipeline to  Israel, the Qatari foreign minister said: The Israeli side has  proposed this matter to us but we told them that we could not  talk about it as long as Israel is occupying Arab territory.</p>

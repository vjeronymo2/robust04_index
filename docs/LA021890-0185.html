			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RACE WAS EASY COMPARED TO WINNING FANS;  </P> <P> NASCAR: WALTRIP ENJOYED NEW-FOUND POPULARITY LAST YEAR. NOW HE CAN RELAX AND GO  FOR TWO IN A ROW TODAY.  </P> <P> The way Darrell Waltrip looks at it, he expects to successfully defend his  Daytona 500 title in today's $2-million stock car race, but even if he doesn't,  he figures he can't lose.  </P> <P> "I'm having a better time down here than ever before," he said. "I used to come  to Daytona and get bugged all the time about why I never won the Daytona 500.  And when I went out on the track I'd hear nothing but boos.  </P> <P> "All that's behind me now. I don't get those terrible questions about winning  and I hear cheers instead of boos. How can I lose in an atmosphere change like  that?"  </P> <P> Waltrip also considers himself fortunate not to have been caught up in the  last-lap accident during the first Twin 125 Thursday at Daytona International  Speedway that knocked Hendrick Motorsports teammate Ken Schrader off the pole  and back to the rear of the field.  </P> <P> When Schrader's Chevrolet Lumina got loose and starting spinning off the third  turn, Waltrip was sandwiched between Schrader and the Pontiac of Hut Stricklin,  but he managed to squeeze through with inches -- maybe only a half-inch -- to  spare before Stricklin smacked into the side of Schrader's car.  </P> <P> "I've never turned a steering wheel that much in my life," Waltrip said. "That  was sooo close, I couldn't believe I actually got through. Maybe it's an omen."  </P> <P> Waltrip believes in omens.  </P> <P> Last year when he finally won his first Daytona 500 after winning three Winston  Cup championships, he was driving No. 17, was in his 17th Daytona 500, and his  daughter, Jessica, was 17 months old after being born on the 17th of September.  </P> <P> "Winning the Daytona 500 is like winning the Super Bowl in football," Waltrip  said. "When I came around Turn Nine at Riverside in 1981 and the crew hung up  that sign, 'Hello Champion,' I thought it was the greatest thing that could  ever happen to me on a race track, but winning the Daytona 500 is right there.  </P> <P> "It not only got the monkey off my back about why I couldn't win it, it also  seemed to change the public's attitude toward me. It hadn't been easy on me or  Stevie (his wife) hearing those boos race after race.  </P> <P> "There were times when Stevie dreaded driver introductions. She would walk out  with me to make me feel better, but it hurt both of us.  </P> <P> "I think winning here, after there had been a lot of talk about me being over  the hill, that started the ball rolling the other way. I know a lot has been  said about that deal at Charlotte where Rusty (Wallace) knocked me out of  $200,000 on national TV in the Winston, but I was already hearing some cheers  before that.  </P> <P> "Fans saw how excited I was about winning here, jumping up and down and doing  my little dance, and Stevie and Jessica being with me in the winner's circle,  and fans started saying, 'Hey, maybe Darrell Waltrip's a good guy after all.' "  </P> <P> Waltrip went on to win six races and challenge for the Winston Million after  winning at both Daytona and Charlotte, N.C. He fell short of the $1 million at  Darlington, S.C., but he still says that "having a big year in 1989 probably  meant more to me than any other year."  </P> <P> At year's end, he was given NASCAR's most-popular-driver award at a banquet in  New York. It was the first time he had even been a contender for the honor.  </P> <P> "I had no idea I would ever win that award," Waltrip said. "I think a lot of  fans were voting for Stevie and Jessica as much as for me, but winning it rates  right up there with my Winston Cup championships and the Daytona 500."  </P> <P> Now, as befitting a popular defending champion, Waltrip must turn his attention  to today's 500-mile race, opening event of NASCAR's premier racing series.  </P> <P> "We're definitely one of the cars to beat," he said. "I'd like to win six or  eight races this season, starting right there, and when we don't win, I want to  be the car to beat. The Lumina is proving to be a good change after the Monte  Carlo."  </P> <P> Waltrip drove a Monte Carlo in last year's victory, but Chevrolet switched to  Lumina in the middle of the '89 season, and Waltrip won the Coca-Cola 600 at  Charlotte in the car's second outing.  </P> <P> "If we can go through this season without some of those DNF's  (did-not-finishes) that hurt last year, I don't see why we can't win the  championship. I'd like to win my fourth one in my 40s."  </P> <P> Waltrip turned 43 on Feb. 5.  </P> <P> Schrader's crash has changed the complexion of the race. Instead of his Chevy  sitting on the pole, it will be Geoff Bodine driving Junior Johnson's Ford out  in front. When Schrader dropped to the rear in his backup car, it meant that  everyone behind him moved up a slot, and Bodine was next after winning one of  Thursday's qualifying races.  </P> <P> Dale Earnhardt, who won the other Twin 125, will start alongside Bodine on the  front row.  </P> <P> Waltrip, who finished fourth in Bodine's heat, will start from the fourth row.  </P> <P> "We'd have liked to qualify better and be on the front row, but starting where  we are isn't going to hurt. We did some testing in the wind tunnel during the  off-season and we're confident we can be as fast as anybody on the track,  although the new restrictor plates tend to equalize everybody out."  </P> <P> NASCAR officials, who installed a one-inch carburetor restrictor plate in 1988  for races at Daytona and Talladega, Ala., to help reduce speeds that were  approaching 215 m.p.h., made further restrictions this year by cutting the  opening to 15/16ths of an inch.  </P> <P> The new rule will cost the cars about 40 horsepower.  </P> <P> The race shapes up as a classic confrontation between Chevrolet and Ford, with  Pontiac hoping to spoil the party -- especially the Pontiac of Richard Petty,  which made King Richard look 20 years younger than his 52 when he led  impressively in one of the Twin 125s.  </P> <P> Bodine, Bill Elliott and Mark Martin, all of whom displayed a winning potential  in Thursday's races, will drive Fords.  </P> <P> "We won the qualifier by conserving on fuel," Bodine said. "Sunday, you'll see  us using more horsepower and running harder, but the lessons we learned saving  fuel could help like it did Waltrip last year."  </P> <P> Schrader appeared to have the 1989 race well in hand until Waltrip skipped a  late pit stop to cruise home on fumes and win the race.  </P> <P> Elliott, who hopes to wipe out the memory of some misfortune here last year  with a strong ride, may be the sleeper in the field.  </P> <P> "Everything is better than last year," Elliott said. "It had to be. Last year,  I got a ticket for turning out of McDonalds the wrong way, then drew 13th in  the (Busch) Clash, and the next day broke my arm. One improvement this year is  that I'll drive with two arms instead of one."  </P> <P> Now that Schrader, the pole-sitter, is starting in the back row, the Chevrolet  leadership falls to Earnhardt and Waltrip.  </P> <P> Earnhardt, the hard-charging three-time Winston Cup champion, finds himself in  much the same situation as Waltrip did last year. He has won 39 major races but  has driven in 11 Daytona 500s without a victory.  </P> <P> "I've always run real good here, I just haven't managed to win," Earnhardt  said. "Every time the car has been right, we've been in the fight, and the car  feels right this year.  </P> <P> "With hardly any rain, and so much rubber being laid down by all these other  classes, the track is going to be really slick, and I think that will be in my  favor. Not many guys like slick tracks. I've always been more comfortable on  them than most anybody.  </P> <P> "I hope it's hot Sunday. If it is, a lot of guys will make a lot of changes to  get their car feeling right, and they're liable to get all screwed up. I don't  plan on adjusting anything. I'm just going to hold the throttle wide open,  clean the windshield, get a drink of water and say, 'Let's go.' I just want gas  and tires. I don't want to turn any bolts."  </P> <P> Surprisingly, the Pontiac driven by Wallace, the defending series champion,  does not appear to be a factor. Wallace, who finished 15th in both of the last  two races last year, will start in the 38th qualifying position alongside Jimmy  Means after running poorly in his qualifying heat.  </P> <P> In the early running, Schrader will be the car to watch as he attempts to pick  his way through the field from the rear.  </P> <P> "It was tough to give up the point, but we'll just have to make the best of  it," Schrader said. "The backup car was pretty equal, and with 500 miles we  have plenty of time to work our way back.  </P> <P> "The important thing is that NASCAR ruled that we're still eligible for the  Unocal bonus."  </P> <P> The Unocal 76 Challenge bonus, which started out with $7,600 offered to the  first driver to win from the pole, has now reached $212,800. There have been 28  races without a winner from the pole.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DAYTONA 500 LINEUP  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.45IN:2.99IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> POS  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> DRIVER  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> CAR  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Geoff Bodine  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Ford  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Dale Earnhardt  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Chevy  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Harry Gant  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Oldsmobile  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Bill Elliott  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Ford  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mark Martin  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Ford  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Jimmy Spencer  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Pontiac  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Darrell Waltrip  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Chevy  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Phil Parsons  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Oldsmobile  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Richard Petty  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Pontiac  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Bobby Hillin Jr.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Buick  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 11  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> A.J.

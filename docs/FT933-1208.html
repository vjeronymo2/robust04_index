			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (15): Malaise follows a golden age - The Group of Seven / Why the doubts and uncertainties surrounding the Tokyo meeting were in marked contrast to mood of the mid to late 1980s THEY are the most exclusive club in the world. But the Group of Seven - comprising the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada - is riven by self doubt. The recent Tokyo world economic summit - the 19th year such annual meeting - highlighted the G7 malaise. To the untutored eye, the fact that the leaders of the most powerful industrialised democracies were prepared to take three days out of their schedules to discuss problems of mutual concern seemed a sign that international policy co-operation was in good fettle. But even before the talks began it was clear that not all the G7 heads of government relished the prospect. And the Tokyo summiteers, spurred on by Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, spent part of their time working out how to make future occasions less unwieldy. The doubts and uncertainties surrounding the Tokyo meeting were in marked contrast to mood of the mid to late 1980s. That was the golden age of the G7, when some observers predicted that the group would grow into a directorate for managing the world economy. In high profile agreements such as the February 1987 Louvre Accord, G7 finance ministers aspired to control the world's most important exchange rates with the aim of promoting trade and furthering prosperity. As the 1980s progressed, the leaders met yearly in conditions of escalating pomp and grandeur to celebrate strong economic growth, falling unemployment and the spread of free market ideals. True, there were some discordant events such as the global stock market crash of October 1987, while some cassandras began to grow alarmed at the growth of public and private sector debt in the big Anglo-Saxon economies. But these worries were not allowed to interfere with the perception that the 1980s, culminating as they did in the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of communism, were a living testimony to the west's economic and political success. The subsequent spread of recession from the US, Britain, and Canada to continental Europe and Japan was slow to dent such optimism. Last year's G7 annual economic summit in Munich grossly exaggerrated the ability of the industrial world to resume growth and create jobs and failed completely to anticipate the past year's upheavals on world financial markets. So it was a sadder group of leaders, many of whom were preoccupied with domestic difficulties, that met in Tokyo's Akasaka Palace in July. All faced political problems and poor opinion poll ratings at home. One G7 leader, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, had lost a general election shortly before the summit and was soon to lose his job. But recent setbacks do not mean that the G7 is finished. The increasingly interdependent world economy is a powerful reason for maintaining a forum in which leaders and finance ministers can meet and get to know each other. At ministerial level, the G7 is still capable of action. The finance ministers, together with foreign ministers from the group and representatives of the European Community, hammered out a package of measures to assist Russia in April of this year. True, the support was criticised by many as small compared with the huge economic problems faced by Russia and other members of the former Soviet Union and eastern bloc countries. But it was followed at Tokyo by agreement to mobilise more funds and technical assistance to aid privatisation in Russia. Over the past year, arrangements have also been made under G7 auspices for a nuclear safety programme to deal with the hazards in Chernobyl-style nuclear reactors in former communist states. Although the G7 finance ministers have long since abandoned any idea of closely co-ordinating economic policies, their meetings, usually three times a year, provide a valuable occasion on which to swap notes and experiences. Since taking over as US Treasury Secretary, Mr Lloyd Bentsen has been keen to encourage the G7 finance ministers' meetings. Participants report that the atmosphere has improved and that the discussions are less quarrelsome than before. At least once a year, the G7 finance ministers carry out 'mutual surveillance' of each economy's performance. This economic 'weight watchers' club' can, through peer group pressure, act to prevent one or several G7 members adopting policies that threaten overall economic prosperity. The G7 can also promote ideas. The finance ministers' last meeting in Washington in April focused on long term structural problems such as health care costs, education and training and the ageing of populations. The discussions are thought to have helped Mr Theo Waigel, the Bonn finance minister, win the argument in Germany for later moves to limit sickness payments and open a debate in Germany about making its labour market more flexible. Viewed over the long term, there is little doubt that the G7 meetings since the early 1970s have helped prevent the world falling prey to protectionism. But the G7 nations have failed to build on this achievement sufficiently to secure agreement among themselves on the ambitious trade liberalisation package which is being negotiated under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in the Uruguay Round. G7 leaders have called for a successful conclusion to the round in successive annual summit meetings since the end of the 1980s. Their words have been repeated in the many communiques issued by their finance ministers. Yet in spite of all the huffing and puffing, G7 trade negotiators and farm ministers have been unable to stitch up agreement. It remains to be seen whether more than seven years of negotiations can be completed by the most recent deadline of mid-December this year. The G7 summit in Tokyo, like the preceding summits in Munich, London and Houston, ended with a ringing declaration on the need for a successful completion of the trade talks. It is the group's 'highest priority', the Tokyo communique said. The statement was rather more credible than past G7 utterances on trade because talks among the so-called quad countries (the US, Japan, the EC and Canada) immediately ahead the summit had produced an agreement to reduce or eliminate tariffs on a wide range of manufactured products. Difficult detailed trade discussions lie ahead. What is certain, however, is that the future of the G7 has become linked to that of the Uruguay Round. A failure to conclude the Gatt talks could deal a mortal blow to the credibility of the G7 after its leaders have so often pledged to liberalise world trade.</p>

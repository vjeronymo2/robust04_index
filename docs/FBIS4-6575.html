			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- The American Friends  Service Committee in a recent statement urged the United States  to stop utterance threatening military action and resume talks  with the DPRK.    The statement warned that the U.S. deployment of Patriot in  South Korea, resumption of Team Spirit joint military maneuvers  and pursuit of international "sanctions" would only aggravate  the tensions and increase threat to the DPRK.    Therefore, the only way of relaxing the tensions is  dialogue,  said the statement.    The statement demanded that the United States put the final  stop to the Team Spirit maneuvers, withdraw its troops from  South Korea, reduce its nuclear weapons and equitably apply the  nuclear non-proliferation policy to all countries so as to take  the lead in the promotion of the denuclearisation of the Korean  peninsula and the rest of the world.</p>

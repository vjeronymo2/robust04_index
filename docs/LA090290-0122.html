			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: IN XANADU BY WILLIAM DALRYMPLE (VINTAGE: $9.95,  ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> In 1988, William Dalrymple and a friend set out to retrace the route of Marco  Polo, from the shrine of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem to Shang-tu, the  summer palace of Kubla Khan in Inner Mongolia (the Xanadu of Samuel Taylor  Coleridge). The journal of their 12,000-mile trek across Asia is a highly  entertaining blend of geography, personal anecdote and history, as the author  describes various places along their route in both the past and present.  </P> <P> In the most intriguing section of the book, he traces the probable origin of  the three Magi mentioned in the Gospel of St. Matthew to the Zoroastrian  observatory at Saveh, in modern Iran.  </P> <P> The accounts of bad food, wretched lodgings, unpleasant weather and overly  zealous Chinese security officers suggest that much of Central Asia is better  visited in the pages of a book than in person. Happily, Dalrymple seems to have  fared better than his model: Polo's tales of the opulence of the Mongol court  were greeted with such skepticism that a new comic character appeared at the  Carnival in Venice -- Marco Millions, who regaled audiences with his fantastic  exaggerations.  </P></p>

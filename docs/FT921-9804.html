			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / No early campaign pointers from Iowa FOUR years ago, the people of Iowa went to their precinct caucuses believing they were helping to choose a president. Tonight, considerably fewer will brave the Midwest winter. And the nation is barely interested in their opinion. The state's political activists are left to reflect on why the national media circus will be pitching its tents - and taking the quadrennial financial windfall - elsewhere. The reason is simple. With Iowa's own Senator Tom Harkin seeking the Democratic nomination and assured of victory in the state by a considerable margin, none of the other Democrats felt campaigning here was cost-effective. When Mr Bob Kerrey, another Democratic presidential candidate, conceded Iowa to Senator Harkin last October, saying he intended to concentrate his scarce campaign resources on next week's New Hampshire primary, it signalled the deathknell of Iowa as a 'kingmaker' state, undermining its previously key position as the first test of popular opinion. Iowa, an agricultural state in the heart of the Great Plains, has a long record of contrary politics. Its influence on the nomination process has again and again helped give the Democrats, in particular, presidential candidates who were far more dovish and interventionist than mainstream America. Republican nominations have traditionally been more influenced by conservative and anti-tax New Hampshire - which in the 80s, at least, has given the party a candidate more in tune with the country at large. Had Iowa been a factor in this year's election, voters would have heard a lot more about aid to the Soviet Union - which would benefit the state's grain farmers - and probably less about the recession, which has left Iowa's farm economy relatively unscathed while it has battered New Hampshire. With the main contenders giving Iowa a miss, it will now fall to New Hampshire to make the running. Ever since former President Jimmy Carter used Iowa to launch his 'guerrilla campaign' for the Democratic nomination in 1976, the state's highly unrepresentative influence had been artificially created by the national media in their haste to fire the starting gun on the campaign and establish an early 'pecking order' among candidates. The 'grassroots appeal' tactic had also been employed by Mr George McGovern's campaign in 1972, and - less successfully - by the anti-Vietnam war supporters of Mr Eugene McCarthy in 1968, but it was Mr Carter, in spite of coming second in the poll to an 'uncommitted' grouping of delegates, who used the media to capitalise on his unexpected performance. The contest had become all about exceeding expectations, often with campaign staff deliberately downplaying candidates' prospects to prevent them underperforming. In effect, anything less than a landslide for Senator Harkin tonight would be considered a failure. Iowa Democratic chairman Mr John Roehrick and other party officials had expressed fears last year that a 'favourite son' candidacy by Mr Harkin might discourage other Democrats from participating, particularly given difficulties in fund-raising and the seemingly unshakable incumbency of George Bush in the wake of the Gulf war. And so it has proved. The only reason for a candidate to take an active part in Iowa's pre-nomination contest is to gain national media exposure and, by performing well, generate momentum which can be translated into recruiting and fund-raising elsewhere. In 1988, the caucus 'winners' in delegate terms were Republican Senator Bob Dole and Democrat Mr Richard Gephardt, both from neighbouring farming states. Just as with Mr Carter in 1976, however, the perceived winners, in terms of exposure and, importantly, credibility, were the two preachers; Rev Jesse Jackson and former television evangelist Mr Pat Robertson, who beat the then Vice-President Bush into third place in the Republican poll. By abandoning the contest, the candidates have removed the need for the media - and the country - to take any regard of tomorrow's outcome. The legacy of the Iowa caucuses will be that they provided an early kick-start to some campaigns that were otherwise dead (Gary Hart), and killed off some others which probably deserved a wider audience (Bruce Babbitt).</p>

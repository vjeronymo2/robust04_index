			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: P &amp; O hit by profit revisions TRANSPORT and property group Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation (P &amp; O) suffered a steep drop after the company stunned the market by reporting interim figures significantly below the worst market forecasts. Profits fell 11 per cent to Pounds 80.1m, against a restated Pounds 89.9m. The range of forecasts was Pounds 95m to Pounds 130m. The shares initially hardened a penny to 669p as dealers appreciated the fact that the company was to make a much predicted enhanced scrip dividend alternative. However, this brief optimism turned to gloom as analysts were presented with a poor view of the near term outlook at their meeting with the board. Aside from the disappointing profits, researchers were particularly concerned by the higher than expected debt levels, the prospect of stiffer competition from the Channel tunnel next year, and overcapacity in the container shipping market. As securities houses downgraded current and following year's forecasts, the shares dropped 49 to 619p in hefty trade of 16m, the highest daily total since 1989, with income funds said to have been the day's biggest sellers. Analysts were particularly angry that the company had given no indication of the state of current trading, several complaining that this could have been covered when the company met them in June. Mr Mike Stoddard at Charter house Tilney, who reduced his year-end forecast by Pounds 28m to Pounds 225m, said: 'It appears the City confused the company's long term optimism with the state of current trading.' UBS was said to have cut its forecast by Pounds 40m to Pounds 250m, while Nikko was believed to have reduced its estimate by Pounds 25m to 245m.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Iceland to study undersea electricity link to Britain THE DEEP and murky waters north of Scotland could be set for a new buzz if a feasibility study to transmit electricity underwater from Iceland to the UK turns into reality. The National Power Company of Iceland has commissioned Pirelli Cables, the UK subsidiary of the Italian cables and tyres group, to look into the possibility of laying an undersea power link to Britain. The 1,000 kilometre cable would be almost five times longer than any existing underwater power link. Lying at depths of up to 1,000 metres, it would pose a new technological challenge to the cable-laying industry, including working in some of the world's coldest and most dangerous waters. Moreover, transmitting electricity over such a distance would also involve huge energy losses, making the scheme potentially uneconomic. 'That is one of the things we will have to study', a Pirelli official said yesterday. The scheme may have been given a boost by the end of the Cold war. The waters north of Scotland are plied by the submarine fleets of Nato and the former Soviet Union. The seabed in the region is believed to contain many sophisticated listening devices, which could be disturbed by the proximity of heavy electric transmissions. Iceland has immense capacity to generate power through hydroelectricity. However, its potential has so far been largely untapped as a result of its small population and limited industrialisation. Current consumption of electricity from hydroelectric sources is just 6bn kilowatt hours a year, against an estimated capacity five times as high. The UK, which already imports some electricity from France through cables beneath the Channel, is expected to have a surplus by next century. And by the end of 1994, Scotland will be able to export twice as much power to England and Wales. But the UK could represent just the beach-head for a series of further cables taking Icelandic electricity to continental Europe. With growing concern about nuclear power and the environmental damage of many coal-burning power stations, hydroelectric energy generated from Iceland's prodigious mountains and streams could find a ready market in an increasingly 'green' Europe.</p>

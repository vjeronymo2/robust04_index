			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / EC goes to court over trade policy GERMANY and the Netherlands are to be taken to the European Court for defying European Commission efforts to forge a unified trade policy toward cheap imports from China and former Communist countries. The Commission wants to abolish - or harmonise - national quotas on imports in order to impose an EC-wide quota to match the single European market. These national quotas number around 6,500, with many dating back to the second world war. The court action is the latest incident pitting a free-trade minded Bonn government against the Commission and the majority of the country's EC partners: Last week Germany lost an appeal to the European Court against a new EC banana regime which discriminates against high-quality bananas from Latin America in favour of Caribbean and African producers. Last month an EC-German row erupted over Bonn's refusal to apply token trade sanctions against the US on telecommunications. The Germans cited a 1954 non-aggression pact with the US on trade sanctions, and the issue remains unresolved. Last December EC foreign ministers were supposed to agree to liberalise quotas, but failed because the issue was linked to a proposal to strengthen the use of EC trade weapons such as anti-dumping.</p>

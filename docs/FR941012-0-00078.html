			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters, however, stated that for several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons instructions should not be kept with machines or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instead should be distributed as part of the training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program (Ex. 5&hyph;12, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;67, 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;4, 9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;19, 9&hyph;22; Tr. W1 66, 134, 185, 235, W2 225, OR 31, 59, 263,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 378, 629). First, these commenters said instructions kept  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with machines would be damaged or destroyed. They stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that instructions would be subject to vandalism or would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disappear if kept with machines or vehicles. They also said  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions would become dirty or be destroyed due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse weather in which machines and vehicles are operated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result, these commenters stated that they store  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator instructions at the company office, in the crew  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transport vehicles or at the work site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, several commenters said that it was not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to keep instructions with machines because they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have limited utility (Ex. 9&hyph;4; Tr. W1 134, 186, OR 80, 117,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 378, 430, 629). Some of these commenters said instructions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pertain primarily to maintenance of machines and scheduling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of maintenance and, therefore, should be kept where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance will be conducted. Other commenters said that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions contain such general information about machine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation that their only utility is for someone who is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unfamiliar with the operation of the machine. Instead,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these and other participants said the manuals should be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in operator training sessions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, some participants said that instructions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently given to new employees to read as part of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> orientation sessions (Tr. W1 66; OR 31, 263, 629). These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participants also said that if operators need to refer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> routinely to instructions at the work site, they should not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be allowed to operate the machine and should receive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional training rather than being allowed to rely on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the comments and testimony received,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA has decided in the final rule to require that operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and maintenance instructions be available on the machine or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the area where the machine is being operated, such as at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the landing or in a crew transport vehicle located in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area where the machine is being operated. OSHA believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ready access to instructions is important for several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons. As OSHA explained in the preamble to the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, instructions are necessary not only for maintenance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel but also for operators who are unsure or unaware  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of safe operating procedures pose hazards to themselves and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> co-workers. Maintaining these materials in the immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work area of the machine assures their availability and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases the likelihood of their use when needed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA also believes that instructions have utility for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators in specific circumstances. Instructions give the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator a ready reference source when a new or unique  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situation is encountered (e.g., operations on terrain where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a combination of hazards are present, such as swampy, rocky  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or loose ground). If unusual problems or emergencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring prompt correction arise during operation, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions provide the operator with correct information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to resolve the problem rather than guessing about a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solution. In addition, some machine operators perform their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> own maintenance. By keeping instructions on the machine or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the immediate work area, these operators can quickly deal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with maintenance issues as they arise. Therefore, OSHA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that instructions are useful for the operator only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when they can be immediately accessed rather than being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housed at an office that may be miles from the work area or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA also agrees with commenters who said that if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions are not kept in the work area of the machine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they will not be used. OSHA is concerned that if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions are not in the area where the machine is being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operated, operators will be discouraged from stopping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production to go get the instructions. Instead, employees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will decide to ``take their chances'' in dealing with unusual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems or emergencies, which could result in serious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injury.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the issue of weather damage to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions which are kept on the machine or in the machine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work area, OSHA notes that a hearing participant pointed out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that in recent years, manufacturers have been providing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weather-resistant instructions which may be kept with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> machines (Tr. OR 205). Moreover, it should not be overly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult for an employer to place the instructions in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weather-proof bag to keep them with the machine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA does agree with commenters' position that if an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator must  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> routinely <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refer to instructions in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operate a machine or vehicle, additional training or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supervision is necessary. The final rule does provide such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional training for that operator. However, there may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well be instances in which the employee may need to consult  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the manual in order to deal with a problem that arises  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the use of the equipment. For that reason, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions should be immediately available to employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, OSHA is requiring in this final rule that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions be maintained in the immediate work area of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> machine so they will be available both to the machine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator and to maintenance personnel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Obtaining operator manuals or instructions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing notice OSHA also requested employers to discuss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their experience with trying to obtain operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions or replacement instructions from dealers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers. OSHA wanted to gather information on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of machines that come with instructions and on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degree of ease in obtaining replacement instructions. Very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> few participants commented in this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Arts: Trumpet and piano - Recital At Hakan Hardenberger's trumpet recital with pianist Roland Pontinen, the audience was full of serious, short-haired teenagers and smaller, well-kempt children in the tow of parents, aunts and grandpas. Budding trumpeters, surely, even though Hardenberger and Pontinen are rather shaggy - dark and blond respectively. Hardenberger has set a famous standard, and must owe some of his success to being spotted as a teenager. He began his international career 15 years ago, and is now 32. Most countries can boast a superb trumpet or two, or three; but they rarely travel as stars, for they all play the same marketable solo repertoire consisting exclusively of the Haydn Concerto in D. True, a few 'period' specialists struck lucky when the 18th century came into vogue, with all those fleet, high-flying solos for the old valveless trumpet that taxed players whose expertise was geared to Wagner and Strauss. (And Elgar - or any local equivalent.) Young Hardenberger, however, was peculiarly fortunate in being both precocious and omni-competent. He has not squandered his good fortune on easy success: prompted or inspired by him, Birtwistle, Ligeti and Henze have composed trumpet works that are substantial gifts to the meagre repertoire. On Tuesday he ventured in another direction, no less bold but almost archaeological, trying out unknown pieces with piano from earlier this century. The programme included two of the Paris Conservatoire's annual competition-pieces (such as all wind soloists depend upon). A suite by the eighty-something Florent Schmitt - who lived on and on while his music declined from fine early-century works to brittle 'Les Six' pastiches - sounded sprightlier than most of his later products. An early 'Legende' by Georges Enescu carried an authentic whiff of period drama, heady and moody. We heard also Antoine Tisne's more recent sequence, Heraldique: whimsically intense and personal, if not so potent as to drive one off in search of more of his music - not right away, anyhow. By contrast a trumpet sonata by George Antheil (at 52), once known in America as the avant-garde 'Bad Boy of Music', proved vapidly cute, downright retarded. In Pontinen's thoughtful hands (assisted on the ivories by one Hardenberger finger), Charles Ives' 'Three Page Sonata' for piano - actually 8 or 10 pages long, and almost a half-century older than the Antheil - sounded the authentic note of passionate modernism. Pontinen was less happy in Stravinsky's virtuoso transcriptions of 'Mouvements' from his Petrushka. They were adapted for the young Artur Rubinstein, partly to please him but surely no less out of mischief: they are recklessly difficult, and in those days Rubinstein hated practising. Nowadays, when everybody knows the orchestral originals, pianists must face up to the crazy challenge of recapturing all that colour and all that teeming vitality. Pontinen, very workmanlike, fell short of that - and it was a mistake to play only two movements, without the tuneful, exhilarating catharsis of the third. The recital concluded with Hardenberger's own transcription of An American in Paris, calculated to appeal. Though every player in the world must long to play Gershwin's first trumpet, this was not the way to manage it. For one thing, fattening his role by cannibalising the other instrumental parts flattened some inspired contrasts: in the Charleston, for example, muted trumpet was no substitute for Gershwin's soaring violins. For another, Pontinen - as one might have guessed from his Petrushka - never, ever swings. Readers who look on the bright side might see that as a sign that American music has not invaded European music completely, not yet.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [B. Prespa article: "Do the Serbs Have the Money To </F> Colonize Kosova?"]    [Text] Recent reports from Kosova mention new Serbian  plans to colonize this part of former Yugoslavia. Various  figures have been tossed out to the media, testifying to a  fiendish policy in Belgrade to depopulate Kosova by expelling  the Kosovars over the border. Fear of a Kosovar exodus is  present in Albania, especially in areas bordering the former  Yugoslavia. Asked about the danger of war, the Albanian  authorities mention as one of the consequences a mass exodus of  Albanians from Kosova toward their kin-state. Nevertheless, it  seems that the Serbs want to accomplish their plans without the  help of weapons, as in Bosnia, but with the aid of money. ATA  reported a few days ago that Belgrade had placed an additional  400 million German marks [DM] at the disposal of Kosova  colonists, with more to come. In the last four years, 120,000  Albanians have been dismissed from their jobs and about 300,000  have been forced to leave Kosova. These are alarming figures  when one remembers that the population of Kosova is no more than  2.5 million Albanians or 400,000 families. A simple calculation  shows that every family has been affected by exile or job  dismissals.    During the existence of the former Yugoslavia, colonists  were  brought to Kosova mainly from Croatia, Slovenia, or  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Now, after the destruction of the Yugoslav  community, Serbia's scope for activity has significantly  narrowed and the colonists that can be cajoled into moving to  Kosova are no doubt Serbs and Montenegrins. It is thought that  Belgrade intends to bring 600,000 Serbs to Albanian-populated  territories to change the population's ethnic structure. About  23 years ago, the Serbs forced the Kosovars to abandon their  country and it is well known that hundreds of thousands of  Albanians emigrated to Turkey under duress. As in the case of  Bosnia, the Serbs consider the Albanians of Kosova as Muslims  first and Albanians second. Nevertheless, their common  nationality and language shared with the 3 million Albanians of  Albania cannot be denied. Under the circumstances of the  economic crisis that has engulfed the former Yugoslavia, where  you need a suitcase full of dinars to buy a loaf of bread, it is  astonishing to see mention of such astronomical sums, which  could far better be invested in the development of Kosova. It  seems that the Serbs invest for one thing alone: a Kosova  without Kosovars. This would be the investment of the century,  an investment to be used as an argument against anybody with any  claims to Kosova and the 2 million Albanians living there.    If Tirana is also aware of such figures, the Albanian  Government must protest to all the international organizations,  because the depopulation of Kosova would have immediate  consequences for Albania. It is easy to imagine what would  happen if hundreds of thousands of Kosovars were to enter  Albania, forcibly expelled by Belgrade. The effects of such a  policy, if it were to be tolerated, would be felt by every  Albanian family from north to south, because every Albanian  family would have to shelter an Albanian from Kosova. The time  has come for government propaganda to sensitize the  international public. Solely through the speculations of a few  itinerant journalists, Belgrade has accused Tirana of militarily  preparing the Kosovars for war, while remaining silent over the  DM400 million and other figures. Tirana cannot accept a Kosova  without Kosovars if it thinks even for a moment about Kosova and  the Albanians living there and if it thinks for a moment about  an Albania different from the one we have today.</p>

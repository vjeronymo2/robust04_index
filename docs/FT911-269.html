			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Trials of setting a date in court: Delays surrounding the Guinness case THE second trial arising out of the Guinness affair, which had been scheduled to start last week, seems unlikely to begin before October. Earlier dates are still being mooted, but there is a growing feeling that, because of outstanding appeals and the approach of the season when witnesses and judges like to go on holiday, the autumn is the most realistic prospect for the start of the trial. Mr Roger Seelig, former corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell, and Lord Spens, former director of corporate finance at Henry Ansbacher, are due to stand trial accused of involvement in an unlawful share support operation mounted by Guinness in 1986 during its bitterly-fought takeover battle with the Argyll supermarket group for Distillers, the Scottish drinks group. After several postponements the case, which is expected to last between three and four months, had been scheduled to get under way at Southwark Crown Court ion London last Tuesday. However, because of appeals by Mr Seelig and Lord Spens against pre-trial rulings by Mr Justice Henry, and appeals by three of those convicted in the first Guinness trial last year, that fixture was not met and further delays became inevitable. Mr Seelig and Lord Spens want to challenge in the House of Lords the Court of Appeal's rejection of their appeal against Mr Justice Henry's ruling that evidence they gave to Department of Trade and Industry inspectors investigating Guinness can be used by the prosecution at the trial. The two men argue that the inspectors should have cautioned them against self-incrimination and that the failure to caution makes it unfair for their evidence to be used at the trial. It is an issue which is central to current concern about the powers given to those investigating fraud and the absence of a right to silence for those suspected of white-collar crimes. A prerequisite for an appeal to the Lords is for the Appeal Court to certify that the case raises a question of law of general public importance, which it will be asked to do this week. If that hurdle is surmounted the court will either give leave to appeal or tell Mr Seelig and Lord Spens they must seek leave direct from the Law Lords. Unless there are grounds for expedition, the time lapse between a Lords appeal being lodged and heard is at least six months, which would suggest a hearing date no earlier than November. Even if expedited, an appeal lodged this month would be unlikely to come on before October, because of the legal summer vacation in August and September. Given that the Law Lords' rulings are not normally handed down until four to six weeks after a hearing, the trial date could well be pushed back towards the end of the year. Mr Seelig and Lord Spens have waited more than three years to come before a jury, Mr Seelig having been arrested on October 15 1987 and Lord Spens on March 10 1988. The prosecution of the seven men originally charged in the Guinness affair was transferred from Bow Street magistrates court to Southwark Crown Court in November 1988, when it was expected that the trial would begin the following summer. By June 1989 the date had been moved to the following January. In October 1989 Mr Justice Henry decided on split trials, with Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman and chief executive, in both, and with Mr Seelig, Lord Spens and Mr David Mayhew, senior corporate finance partner of Cazenove &amp; Co, the stockbrokers, alongside him in the dock in the second trial. When the first trial began in mid-February last year it was anticipated that the second would start the following October. When Guinness One ended in late August, however, Guinness Two was pushed back to January 14. Mr Saunders, who had been convicted on all but one of the charges he had faced in the first trial, was dropped from the second. Shortly before Christmas the second trial was split, hiving off Mr Mayhew to be tried in Guinness Three. Since the beginning of this year legal arguments and appeals, coupled with Lord Spens' new lawyers' need for more time to prepare his defence, have resulted in further postponements. Originally both defendants were represented by QCs, junior barristers and solicitors. In April 1989 Lord Spens announced that he could no longer afford the mounting legal costs and was dropping his lawyers. Last November he was granted legal aid, however, and will be defended at the trial by two junior barristers and solicitors. Last year Mr Seelig also decided he could no longer afford legal representation and has since conducted his own defence. The two men are jointly charged under section 13 of the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act with conspiring to induce Distillers shareholders to exchange their holdings for shares in Guinness by the dishonest concealment of material facts. Mr Seelig alone faces a similar charge under the same act, as well as two charges of false accounting. Lord Spens is charged with one false-accounting offence.</p>

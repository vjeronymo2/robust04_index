			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Soft shoe start at Lithuanian stock exchange - A footwear group making the running on day one CLINKING champagne glasses, paeans to capitalism and a row of women in folk costume were the main feature at yesterday's ribbon cutting ceremony at the Lithuanian Stock Exchange in Vilnius. Trading volume came a poor second. Modelled on the French system, the first national stock exchange in the former Soviet Union began with 29 registered brokers and 19 listed securities, including three offering preferred and ordinary shares. The opening day was, by any standard, quiet with five securities traded for a total turnover of just 1,630 Litas (Dollars 408). Silva, a footwear and haberdashery concern, was the hot stock with 285 shares traded at Lts1.05 each. The Paris bourse, which helped set up the exchange under a FFr5m (Dollars 870,000) grant from the French government, has taken a cautious tack. Securities can rise or fall by no more than 10 per cent between the weekly Tuesday sessions. All transactions will be done by cash trade only on a book-entry basis, with a clearing settlement delay of four days. The Lithuanian exchange, like the one in the Czech Republic, grew directly out of the mass privatisation programme which has sold 1,586 state-owned enterprises since 1991. Only 16 companies were registered in time for the start of trading, but all companies privatised by public offer eventually will be listed. Trading volume, in the meantime, is going to stay tiny. Mr Stephane Remus, project manager from the Paris bourse, said the market was intentionally simplified to attract small investors. 'If someone expects a million dollar turnover the first year,' he said, 'they're foolish.' Instead, a weak banking system, shortage of capital and insider trading are possible problem areas. Crime has been a prominent feature of capitalism in the former Soviet Union. But Mr Remus views bankruptcy, not yet seen in Lithuanian despite the existence of a year-old bankruptcy law, as the biggest threat to engendering public trust in the exchange. Vilnius hopes to emulate the growth at other east European exchanges. In Warsaw, turnover is now running at Dollars 250m per week. Budapest and Prague manage weekly volumes of Dollars 5m and Dollars 3m respectively. Next in line is the Kiev exchange, due to open around the New Year. The Ukrainian government has set up a central depository but has not yet formalised the legal framework needed for trading securities, according to Mr Paul-Francois Dubroeucq, director for international affairs and development at the Paris bourse. Lithuania has been an 'exceptional success', Mr Dubroeucq said, because legal and economic reform has been synchronised. At the freshly renovated exchange headquarters, only six of the 29 registered brokers have offices above the main floor. A lucky one, Mr Vaidas Savukynas, a 24-year-old who seven months ago founded his one-man brokerage, reported a good first day: four deals, worth Lts528 (Dollars 132). 'Just the beginning,' he said.</p>

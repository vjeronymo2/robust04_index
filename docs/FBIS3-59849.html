Russia's dithering on the  transfer of the cryogenic technology to India notwithstanding,  the two countries are still each other's largest partners in  science and technology. And the scale of their scientific  co-operation is probably the largest between any two countries  in the world.    The ties have been further strengthened by the  just-concluded  visit of a high-level delegation of Russian officials and  members of the Russian Academy of Sciences, led by the Russian  deputy prime minister and academy president, Mr Yuri Osipov. The  most significant event of the visit was the signing of the  agreement for a joint venture for design and production of light  transport aircraft (LTA).    Before his departure to Moscow, Mr Osipov told this  reporter:  "Certain parts of the cryogenic contract signed in 1991 do not  go with the present Russian law. But our scientific co-operation  covers a vast range of areas. We have a lot in common. We mean a  lot to each other."    During its 10-day stay here, the Russian team did not hold  any specific talks on the cryogenic deal, Mr Osipov said. But  there was a general agreement between the two countries that  discussions on the issue would continue, he added.    As both countries are hard pressed for funds, the emphasis  in  their scientific collaboration is on programmes of mutual  economic benefit. There were also efforts to involve private  companies from both sides, Mr Osipov said. A case in point is  the involvement of a private company, whose name has not yet  been revealed, in the light aircraft programme.    The 22-member Russian delegation included an academician Mr  G. I. Marchuk, a former president of the Russian Academy of  Sciences and academician, Mr A. M. Prokorov, one of the Nobel  prize winners for the invention of laser. This was the fifth  meeting under the ILTP [Integrated Long Term Programme]. Each  country hosts the meeting every alternate year. This year's  talks have revived the warmth between the science establishments  of the two countries, which, as one Indian scientist put it,  "had lost their touch after the break-up of the Soviet Union."    The scientific co-operation between the two countries is  covered under the ILTP agreement signed in 1987 by India and the  former Soviet Union. The two countries are working jointly on  about 100 projects. The programme involves 55 institutions in  India and 71 in Russia. The Indian side has 240 co-ordinators  and the Russian side 172. There has been an exchange of 1,600  scientists since the programme began.    The 16 areas covered under ILTP include biotechnology,  material sciences, computers, radio-physics and ecology.    The light transport aircraft is being developed by the  Bangalore-based National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL) of the  Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the  Russian Myashischev Design Bureau. The 14-seater aircraft,  called Saras-Duet, will have a Canadian twin-turbo-propelled  engine with a range of 2,000 km and speed of 550 to 600 kmph.    It is 50:50 partnership between India and Russia. The cost  of  development as well as two aircraft is estimated at $30 million.  The first prototype is likely to be ready by 1995.    Another important area of co-operation is the blue laser  equipment which can be used for curing TB. Trials under the  joint programme are going on at the Mehrauli TB Hospital in  Delhi and Choithram Hospital in Indore. The technique involves  insertion of optical fibres into the veins through a laser beam  passed to the affected part. A few terminal cases have been  cured during trials but how the technique works is yet an enigma  for scientists. This is probably the reason why the health  ministry has not yet cleared it.    One of the PARAM supercomputers developed by C-DAC, Pune,  has  been put up for demonstration at the Institute of Computer-aided  Design in Moscow. The Moscow institute is developing software  using PARAM. The software is to be sold in India and Russia, as  well as third countries.    The two countries are also working on a joint programme to  develop electronic earthquake sensors. The project taken up by  the Chandigarh-based Central Scientific Instrument Organisation,  attempts to marry India's expertise in electronics to the very  effective sensors, developed by the Russians. The electronic  sensors will be used by the Indian Meteorological Department for  seismic surveys.    The joint programme on catalysis could be useful in  pollution  control as well as production of petroleum or high-quality wax  from methane. The Novosibirsk Institute of Siberia the  Dhanbad-based Central Fuel Research Institute and the National  Research and Development Council are working jointly on the  development of such catalysts.</p>

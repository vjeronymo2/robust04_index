			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (6): Chief adviser has finger on pulse - Profile / Colin Powell There are very few aspects of Jersey life that Mr Colin Powell, chief adviser to the States, is not concerned with. Whatever the topic and whoever you are discussing it with - politician, civil servant or someone from the private sector - at some point they will refer to Mr Powell. He has his finger on every pulse and has built up and retains an extensive knowledge of how the island operates. His knowledge, combined with his modest and unflappable manner, has earned him the deep respect of everyone he deals with. 'I see myself as a servant; an adviser to the politicians. You hope that what you have to say will be taken on board, otherwise an adviser's work would not be very satisfying,' he says. His diligence and attention to detail over the past 25 years have certainly earned him the open ears of Jersey's foremost movers. But Mr Powell is not a Jerseyman. He was born and educated in Surrey before taking his economics degree at Cambridge. He followed this with two years in the economic section of the British Iron and Steel Federation in London, before taking an economic adviser's post in the Northern Ireland government at Stormont in 1963 - where he stayed until the end of 1968. Mr Powell moved to Jersey in 1969 to take up the newly-created post of economic adviser. He said the need arose for the job from two factors. 'By the second half of the 1960s, the island's population was increasing by around 1,000 a year. This put considerable strain on the economy and the politicians wanted to know how to control it. Secondly, the lack of economic information made it difficult for Jersey to decide which situation was best for it with regard to the UK's attempt to join the EEC.' His first big task was to produce an economic survey of the island, which was published in 1971. This has been the basis for much of the island's subsequent development. Initially, it was thought that a new survey would be produced after 10 years, but Mr Powell's annual reports and statistical digests have provided the updates. Always a forward planner, he has decided to write a new edition of the economic survey as one of his retirement tasks. He hopes to retire in 1997 when he will be 60 and his other retirement task will be to write a history of Jersey as an international finance centre. 'When I first came here in 1969 the finance industry was 9 per cent of the island's income. Now it is 50 per cent and most of the growth was in the 1970s and 1980s.' 'My job changes all the time. In the past 25 years no two years have been the same and you have to be adaptable. If a small island is to be successful it must be adaptable. It does not control market forces and must be able to respond flexibly. I have to respond to changing political as well as economic influences,' he said. Jersey's Policy and Resources Committee, responsible for co-ordinating and prioritising the work of other government committees, was formed in 1989. 'Underlying that was the need for co-ordination and corporate thinking. The role of co-ordinator fell to me because there was no one else in this position. In 1992, it was agreed the role I was performing was not very aptly described and would be better described as chief adviser.' He feels the new system has worked well, providing a more corporate approach to matters. 'This is particularly so now the island has come through a period of recession. We were faced with the need to prioritise and exercise restraint, which the island had not had to do for some years. 'Jersey is very lucky. Its economy is based on two industries - finance and tourism - that face positive markets. I see no reason why growth should not continue over at least the next 10 years.' But he feels there will be changes. 'Jersey is a niche market player and has to respond to circumstances in the outside world. Although faced with a difficult economic climate, I still expect Jersey to remain something of a jewel in the economic crown of Europe.'</p>

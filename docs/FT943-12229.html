			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Solid growth at Capital Cities Capital Cities/ABC, the US entertainment group, yesterday reported a 25 per cent increase in second-quarter profits and record earnings per share. It was boosted by another strong performance from its network, cable and international television businesses. In the quarter, Capital Cities earned Dollars 189.5m on net revenues of Dollars 1.54bn, up from Dollars 151.9m on revenues of Dollars 1.44bn a year earlier. Earnings per share of Dollars 1.23, up from 92 cents a share, represented a record for the company. However, it was achieved in the wake of stock repurchases by Capital Cities which reduced the number of shares outstanding by almost 11m to 154m. The strong second quarter took the company's first-half profits to Dollars 305.6m, compared with Dollars 222.4m in 1993 (which excludes a Dollars 12.1m charge to cover early debt redemption). The company's flagship ABC television network had another good quarter. It benefited from increased advertiser demand and improved cost comparisons, which offset the absence of earnings from the lucrative Academy Awards show, which this year was broadcast in the first quarter. In the 1993 fiscal year, it went on air in the second quarter. The company reported significant growth in its radio business and cable and international group operations, which include its rapidly-growing ESPN all-sports cable channel. Earnings from publishing interests were also higher, attributable to gains in newspapers and specialised publications. The second-quarter results pleased investors, who bid the stock up Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 79 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Carlzon ally steps down from SAS executive post A SECOND senior executive at Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) is to step down from his post following the surprise resignation on Monday of Mr Jan Carlzon as president and chief executive, it emerged yesterday. The departure of Mr Steffen Harpoeth, the deputy president and close ally of Mr Carlzon, is one of the management changes that were expected in the wake of the announcement that Mr Carlzon was quitting day-to-day leadership of the airline to concentrate on negotiations over Alcazar, a four-way alliance with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair and Austrian Airlines. Mr Harpoeth's responsibilities were corporate control and finance. He has not been involved directly in the Alcazar negotiations and it is understood he will not be involved. His departure is likely to strengthen allegations, widely aired in the Scandinavian media, that Mr Carlzon was pushed out as head of SAS, which is jointly owned by Sweden, Denmark and Norway, because of concerns over its recent dismal financial performance and scepticism over the viability of Alcazar. These allegations have been denied by SAS and blamed on longstanding tensions between the three national camps within SAS, particularly Danish trade union hostility towards Mr Carlzon, who is Swedish. SAS insists Mr Carlzon's desire to devote himself full-time to the complex Alcazar project should be taken at face value. Mr Carlzon has acknowledged that the long-drawn out Alcazar negotiations have diverted attention at SAS away from the task of reversing a three-year record of losses. Officials say a far-reaching rationalisation programme aimed at raising efficiency by 50 per cent in the five years to 1996 has come close to a standstill after initial savings of SKr3bn (Dollars 380m) were achieved in 1991 and 1992. Losses in the first half of the year reached SKr609m, compared with a full-year loss in 1992 of SKr743m. Mr Jan Rainas, Mr Carlzon's Norwegian successor as chief executive, has said his priority is to get the rationalisation effort back on track. This is likely to entail a further retrenchment from the Global Travel Service System strategy espoused by Mr Carlzon in the late 1980s. However, Mr Rainas is due to leave SAS next April to head Norske Skog, the Norwegian forestry group, leaving the airline without clear management leadership should the Alcazar project collapse. SAS is therefore dangerously exposed if Alcazar does not work, but Mr Tage Andersen, the Danish chairman of SAS, has stressed his commitment to it. For all the denials of divisions within SAS, there have been conflicts of interest between the Danish and Swedish camps. Denmark wants the headquarters of the Alcazar project to be based at Copenhagen's Kastrup airport, while many in Sweden would like to see Mr Carlzon as the project's leader.</p>

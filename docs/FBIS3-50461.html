			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Adela Leal] </F>   [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Fernando Ochoa Antich has  downplayed reports that members of the Venezuelan military are  smuggling weapons to the Colombian guerrillas, saying that  cross-border gun running is nothing new.    Ochoa Antich said: The truth is that gun running to Colombia  has always occurred. On a number of occasions Colombia has  informed Venezuela of the problem, and we have investigated and  taken disciplinary action within the FAN [National Armed Forces]  to prevent such practices.    In reply to a question asked during a year-end toast at  Miraflores Palace, the foreign minister said, "The amount of  money Colombian guerrillas sometimes offer for Venezuelan  weapons is so high that it tempts military or police personnel,  but the truth is that the quantities of arms sold are very  small."    Ochoa Antich added: One cannot say there exists massive arms  smuggling from Venezuela to Colombia. Instead, there are small  sales because of a lack of control. In no way, however, does  this influence the military situation in Colombia.    Meanwhile, the foreign minister expressed satisfaction over  the Colombian Government's decision to support antiguerrilla  measures endorsed by Venezuela. Ochoa Antich said: This is what  we have constantly asked from the Colombian Government -- that  it take appropriate actions to ensure that attacks from its  national territory against Venezuelan territory are not  encouraged.    Ochoa Antich also disputed information coming from Santa Fe  de Bogota that says a force of 20,000 Venezuelan soldiers has  been deployed along the border. Ochoa Antich said: According to  what the defense minister told me, normal border reinforcement  movements are under way because of security problems in the  area. Anyway, in our territory we can carry out whatever  movements we deem necessary without taking into account any  other country.</p>

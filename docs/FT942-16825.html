			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Bidders attracted to Scots pits sale Two companies yesterday announced the formation of a joint venture to bid for the Scottish region of British Coal in a move which strengthens the industry's belief that the corporation's assets north of the border may be its most attractive. Miller Group, a construction and mining company, and Ryan Group, a coal producer, said their company Scotcoal would bid formally for the Scottish region after publication in June by the government of information on British Coal. Several other companies have formed a consortium, Mining (Scotland), also with the intention of making a bid. Mr David Cawthra, Miller chief executive, said both Miller and Ryan saw Scotland as the main opportunity in the privatisation of British Coal. Mr Crispian Hotson, Ryan chief executive, said that unlike other areas of the UK, demand for coal in Scot-land was growing, from 4.5m tonnes this year to an estimated 7.5m in 1998. This was partly because of the strengthening of the electricity interconnector between England and Scotland which will enable the Scottish power companies to export south of the border. Mr Hotson said he was also interested in Scottish coal because of its low sulphur content and the extensive reserves at Longannet, the country's last deep mine in operation. Longannet produces coal at about Pounds 1.40 a gigajoule, the joint venture estimates, against sale prices in contracts with Scottish Power and Hydro-Electric of Pounds 1.50 falling to Pounds 1.30 in four years. Ryan is also considering a bid for British Coal's north-east region in association with Alcan, the north American aluminium company. Mr Cawthra said Ryan and Miller had assets of about Pounds 100m. The two companies currently mine more than 2.5m tonnes of coal a year in Scotland, representing more than 40 per cent of British Coal's Scottish production. The Scottish region is one of five being sold. Sales are expected to be effected by early next year. Greener valleys, Page 16</p>

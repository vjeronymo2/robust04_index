			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Nordic countries contest the spirit of EC policy on alcohol - Monopoly issue complicates EC membership talks WHEN the European Commission told Sweden that it must scrap its alcohol monopoly, it brought to the fore one of the most sensitive and difficult issues in the Nordic countries' EC membership talks. Sweden, Norway and Finland have operated Europe's most restrictive alcohol regime for much of this century and none shows any sign of giving up the policy without a fight. The EC says the restrictions have to go because they conflict with rules on free movement of goods and non-discrimination. For the Nordic countries, it is a case of public health, for the EC it is one of competition. The issue could have a decisive impact on whether the Nordic countries can get their membership applications approved by referendum. Sweden and Norway each have more than half a million supporters of the temperance movement; if mobilised, this could be sufficient to swing an otherwise close vote against membership if the EC line prevails. Puritan attitudes to alcohol date back to the 18th and 19th centuries when heavy drinking was rife. Both Norway and Finland had a spell on prohibition earlier this century, before their current monopolies evolved. The aim today in all three countries is to discourage alcohol consumption by maintaining high prices and limiting availability. Public opinion on the issue is split. A poll in Sweden last week found that 43 per cent of the public wanted the alcohol monopoly retained; a recent Norwegian study said as many as 59 per cent backed the current regime. Norway and Sweden are taking the strongest line in the EC talks, saying that they want to retain monopolies over both imports and retail sales of alcohol. Attitudes are more relaxed in Finland, which has indicated that it considers retention of the retail monopoly to be the important issue. The Commission does not dispute the Nordics' contention that their policies have cut alcohol-related problems - meaning everything from liver cirrhosis to drunken driving and violence in the streets. But it says they can find ways of meeting their health objectives without retaining a formal monopoly. That could be through taxes, licensing, advertising, better information, and restrictions on sales to young people, for example. Sweden counters by saying it is already doing much of what the commission recommends. It argues that it should be allowed to adjust its monopoly in so far as it transgresses EC competition rules, but that public health arguments should outweigh any requirement to scrap the monopoly. As part of this emphasis on adjustment, Systembolaget, the Swedish monopoly retailer, is about to widen its selection of imported brands to demonstrate that the country's alcohol monopoly is not about favouring domestic suppliers. Moves such as this may not be sufficient to win the argument. The Nordic countries still have to persuade a sceptical European Commission that the nanny state should have the right to dictate people's drinking habits. And they have to address evidence that actual levels of drinking are much higher than official statistics suggest. According to Norwegian estimates, the country's spirits consumption is doubled if duty-frees, smuggling and home-distilling are taken into account. It is difficult to see how a satisfactory solution can be worked out, given the weight of tradition and long-standing policy on the Nordic side, and the EC's intransigence towards monopolies on the other. One answer could be to scrap the import monopoly and agree to phase out the distribution monopoly over a number of years. But Swedish politicians, at least, fear they will not be able to sell that to the temperance lobby. They say alcohol is one of the issues on which the EC has to show increased flexibility if Swedes are not to get a negative view of membership. One Swedish politician comments: 'It will be far better for the monopoly to disappear naturally, with prices coming down as import restrictions disappear, than if it is forced on us politically. People will see it as a classic case of unwarranted meddling by Brussels in our internal affairs.'</p>

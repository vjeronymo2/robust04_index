			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (24): Rapid growth from a very small base  -Developments in the financial sector Finance is one of the fastest growing areas of the Bolivian economy. Central bank figures show the financial sector growing by 21 per cent in 1992, 14 per cent last year and an estimated 12.4 per cent this year. According to Mr Edward Derksen, chairman of BHN Multibanco, a Bolivian commercial bank, the country's bigger banks are growing by 30 per cent year. 'With a stable currency and low interest rates abroad, we have had capital repatriation,' he says. Yet this rapid growth is from a very small base. The basic business of banking remains a mystery to a large majority of Bolivians. Mr Guido Antezana, who stepped down this year as head of the country's banking association, points out that there are only 350,000 deposit accounts in a country of 7m people. Some 45,000 depositors hold 85 per cent by value of all bank accounts. 'This shows how deep the financial function goes in Bolivia,' says Mr Antezana. The financial sector is only now recovering from the devastation wrought on it during the hyperinflation of the early 1980s, which damaged the credibility of both the Bolivian currency and the banking system. By the end of 1985, the financial meltdown left the banking system with just Dollars 50m in assets. Banking assets have since recovered to Dollars 3.27bn at the end of last year and the banks' capital to Dollars 225m. But, says Mr Antezana: 'We are barely back to the financial assets that were held by the banking system in 1978.' Hyperinflation has left another legacy: the banking system's switch to dollars. The proportion of dollars in banks has grown in recent years as money has been repatriated from abroad and left on deposit in the US currency. According to the World Bank, 85 per cent of deposits in Bolivian banks were denominated in dollars at the end of 1993, compared with 77 per cent in 1989. The majority of local currency deposits in the banking system are held by the government. This switch to the dollar clearly reduces the mechanisms available to the government and central bank for the control of economic policy. A report from the economic consulting firm Muller &amp; Associates points out that this - together with the concentration of deposits in a relatively small number of hands - 'makes the Bolivian economy more vulnerable to external shocks.' It also leaves the economy more vulnerable to money laundering by drug traffickers. The US government says that the country is still not an important centre for money-laundering. Yet it argues that the situation may change because money laundering is not considered a crime, 'dollarisation' is advanced and the banking superintendency refuses to share information with agencies fighting drug traffickers. Better liquidity, the perception that the banking system is more or less secure except for a couple of smaller institutions, and that the country's political and economic risk rating have improved, have all combined to bring down lending spreads. The country risk premium on dollar deposits is about 5-6 per cent on deposits. Lending spreads are down: interest rates on big bank deposits vary between 9 1/2 and 11 per cent; and on loans from 12-13 per cent for the best customers, to 16-20 per cent. A new banking law, pushed through under World Bank insistence, was passed in 1993. It brought capital requirements to international standards and set up a superintendency of banks. Critics say the superintendent has been given too much discretionary power - and provides a poor example for the regulatory regime which the government intends to set up for newly-capitalised companies. Mr Antezana says that more than a dozen banks with adequate minimum capital are awaiting a decision to allow them to open, but permission has not been granted or denied. When the bankrupt state banks were formally closed - the last in December 1992 after the World Bank made this a condition of a loan it was granting - the then superintendent was accused of reallocating the accounts in a discretionary manner. According to Mr Fernando Candia, the central bank president, the central bank has been operating with complete de facto independence in monetary and exchange rates since the present government took over last year. The government is proposing that the independence of the bank in monetary and exchange rate policy should be granted by law. To activate the financial system fully, especially the securities markets, a number of other legal changes are being proposed. A new securities law is planned to overhaul the antiquated rules. There is a small fixed interest market - turnover this year is expected to reach Dollars 1bn compared with Dollars 120m in 1991 - which is increasingly being dominated by private sector users rather than the government. However, approval of issues by the securities commission is slow. There are two independent stock exchanges, created as part of the IMF and World Bank conditions for structural adjustment, but there is no share trading - although two share issues are listed. The La Paz stock exchange started operation in 1989, trading in central bank deposit certificates, bonds and fixed-term deposits of private banks which account for 85 per cent of 1993 trading volume of Dollars 578m. The Santa Cruz stock exchange trades in bills and some bonds, but no fixed-term bank deposits. The two equity issues are likely to be joined in the next few months as Cochabamba Power and Light is floated domestically and internationally. The possible sale of the La Paz electricity distribution company next year may add another company. But it is hoped that the biggest boost to the equity market - and to the development of national savings - will come from the capitalisation process. Under that process, the shares of up to 50 per cent of the capitalised companies will be distributed equally among Bolivians aged over 18. This will involve the establishment of some 3.7m separate retirement accounts. The first task will be to establish who the eligible Bolivians are - a difficult one, because the names of a large number of Bolivians are unknown to the state. Pension fund managers will be invited to bid to manage these non-contributory retirement accounts. Already, six pension fund groups, mostly local banks often with a Chilean partner, are in place. After the bidding process, which is likely to take into account a variety of factors, including commissions, holders will be free to shift pension fund managers. The law will require that those individuals who decide to contribute to their own private pension funds  - to be introduced as part of the proposed pensions reform - will have to hold them with the manager who has the account containing shares in the capitalised companies. The government estimates there are some 300,000 potential clients who will sign up for such contributory pensions. According to Mr Ruben Ferrufino, a senior official working on the pension plan, the likely lack of liquidity in the capitalisation shares will impose limits on the amount that can be sold at one time. This liquidity shortage may also mean that capitalisation shares will be listed on stock exchanges outside the country. Proceeds from sales of shares in the non-contributory funds will be directed into contributory funds. Because of the limited investment opportunity in the domestic market, investment outside Bolivia is likely to be restricted to 30 per cent, a high percentage compared with other countries in the region with private pension systems. Even if the plan can be guided through Congress, where the government coalition has a majority, opposition is inevitable and is likely to be strongest from the national trade union federation. Existing pensioners worried about losing their pensions, and the managers of the small existing pension funds - all severely hit by hyperinflation in the 1980s - which coexist with the bankrupt state pension fund, are also likely to oppose the changes.</p>

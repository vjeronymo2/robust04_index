			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Next steps for the EC TWO VISIONS vie for supremacy in the 'construction' of the new Europe. One vision is of a new superpower, its economy sharply defined by its frontiers and its policies a mixture of warily liberal and aggressively interventionist. This Europe views outsiders as adversaries and power as its proper pursuit. The contrasting vision is of a Europe open to the world. This Europe sees its economy enriched and its welfare enhanced by a combination of economic competition and policy co-operation with outsiders. Both internally and externally, the European Community should choose the second vision. This is of particular importance in executing the programme that is now, after the Maastricht summit, again the centre-piece of internal development: that to complete the internal market. This has far to go if such important barriers to an open and competitive market as nationalistic public procurement, public monopolies and unduly restrictive regulation of financial services are to disappear. Equally important is whether the internal market is to be fiercely competitive or whether cartelisation, encouragement to mergers and joint ventures, and generous state aids are to repeat the failures of policies pursued by individual member states. Only a competitive European market will create companies that can compete, without protection, on the global stage. If European companies are unable to compete, because they have been too long protected from the need to do so, then the EC itself will turn protectionist. From electronics to cars, European business must realise that it can only hold its markets by supplying goods to customers, not pleas to politicians. Stagnating economy Completion of a competitive internal market is made vastly more difficult by the stagnation now befalling the European economy. That stagnation is equally threatening to the EC's other main economic goal: monetary union. For the European economy is being strangled by interest rates suitable to the unique circumstances of Germany. The question of realignment arises. As Bundesbank vice-president Hans Tietmeyer has rightly said, a decision to upvalue or devalue a currency in the ERM has to be made by the national government in question. But he also stressed that 'we don't live in a fixed exchange rate system yet'. A general realignment would be undesirable within the current ERM, for three reasons. Only if there is a chance that the D-Mark might be subsequently devalued, could interest rates in other currencies fall much below those in Germany. This would amount to the Bundesbank's abandoning the position that the D-Mark should always be the safest currency in the system. Only large devaluations would make much of a difference either to competitiveness or to relative interest rates (by making subsequent revaluations more likely). But the possibility of large realignments in an ERM without exchange controls would make it highly unstable. Counter-inflationary credibility would be impaired as well. General policy A few countries may decide that they are so far from equilibrium that they might as well start again at different exchange rates, provided only that they give some hope of growth. But, as a general policy for the EC, realignment would be a disaster. For the most part, countries should soldier on with their parities in the knowledge that German rates will turn down again, perhaps in the not too distant future. In the meantime, those countries that hope to stay the course should move swiftly to greater independence for their central banks and, at the same time, push for more influence over the management of the ERM. Completion of the internal market and maintenance of monetary stability are the twin challenges of 1992 in the EC's internal development. Neither is as important as what awaits the EC externally. But they are the condition for all the rest. The EC matters to the world, because of the success of its economy. That success remains the foundation of its future.</p>

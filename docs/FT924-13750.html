			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Treasury management set-up to alter THE TREASURY has altered its internal management structure to improve decision-making after acting on suggestions from Mr Howard Davies, the director-general of the Confederation of British Industry. The move to set up an all-encompassing management board at the Treasury, in place of a number of committees that decided on internal policies, is part of a broad effort by the department to take on new ideas after criticism that it has become cut off from academic economists and industry. Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary, asked Mr Davies for advice last year. At that time, Mr Davies, who took over as head of the CBI in July and is a former management consultant, was controller of the Audit Commission, a government public-spending watchdog. Mr Davies made his suggestions at a special meeting in the spring this year with about 15 senior Treasury officials held at the chancellor's official country residence. The Treasury's new management board, headed by Sir Terry, includes the top 10 or so Treasury officials and meets once a week. It is largely concerned with non-political judgments and does not in-clude government ministers. The board replaces the Treasury's former policy co-ordinating committee which considered broad questions of economic policy, and several other loosely formed groups that considered questions of internal management such as staff organisation. Senior officials felt, after taking soundings from Mr Davies, that the structure of the co-ordinating committee and the other committees had become too unwieldy, which made it more difficult for the Treasury to focus its thoughts and make timely decisions. Mr Davies's work for the Treasury has now ended. He helped the Treasury, unpaid, in his spare time from the Audit Commission. Some of the ideas generated from his suggestions - such as the need for less secrecy, with more contacts with outsiders - were outlined by Sir Terry to the Treasury's top 70 officials at a meeting at the Institution of Civil Engineers earlier this month. Behind Sir Terry's decision to enlist Mr Davies for advice was the latter's reputation as someone who combines knowledge of Whitehall with wide experience in the business world. Mr Davies was a Treasury official for six years until 1982, then spent the next five years with the McKinsey management consultancy.</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Cork Gully drops appeal CORK GULLY, the insolvency arm of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, will not appeal against a disciplinary judgment on two of its partners in connection with their appointment as administrators to Polly Peck International, the collapsed fruit and electronics group. Mr Michael Jordan, head of Cork Gully, and Mr Richard Stone, head of corporate finance, were last month fined the maximum Pounds 1,000 by the professional conduct committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The two were deemed to have breached ethical rules for taking the appointment after Coopers &amp; Lybrand had a continuing professional relationship with Polly Peck and Mr Asil Nadir, its chairman, during the three years before the company was placed in administration in October 1990. They had 28 days to appeal, but have decided not to take action. However, they still face a hearing before the institute's insolvency licensing committee in December. A key part of their defence was that Coopers' internal systems did not pick up the fact that the firm was already conducting work for Polly Peck. Mr Chris Hughes of Cork Gully said yesterday that problems had been caused by the difficulty of operating two different systems in Cork Gully and Coopers when the firms merged in 1989. He said there had been substantial improvements in the past 12 months, including the merger of the two computer systems and rewriting of software.</p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FIREFIGHTERS COOKING UP HOT BREAKFAST  </P> <P> Enough pancakes, eggs and sausage to feed several thousand people will be  cooked up by Villa Park's volunteer firefighters at the 27th annual  Firefighters' Breakfast on Sunday.  </P> <P> The money generated by the $2 breakfasts goes to scholarships and community  service programs, and all the food and labor for the event will be donated by  the local Ralphs market and the city's volunteer firefighters, County Fire  Department spokeswoman Kathleen Cha said. The yearly breakfast routinely draws  more than 3,000 people in a city that has fewer than 7,000 residents.  </P> <P> The event runs from 7 a.m. to noon at Fire Station 23 at 5020 Santiago Canyon  Road in Orange. Tickets are available at the Villa Park Pharmacy and the fire  station.  </P></p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / One in 10 newly qualified teachers 'unsuited' for job ONE IN 10 newly qualified teachers is 'unsuited to teaching', according to the Office for Standards in Education. In its first report on the standards of new teachers since Her Majesty's Inspectorate became a part of Ofsted earlier this year, the watchdog said the finding 'raises the crucial question of how these students were selected for training, allowed to complete their course successfully, and gain appointments'. It added: 'Both the training institutions and the schools share the responsibility.' The inspectors found that those teachers unsuited to the profession were predominantly unaware that they were unsuited, and that heads also failed to realise their prob-lems. Only 54 per cent of new primary teachers felt adequately prepared to teach reading. The inspectors further called for more work using information technology to support teaching. The Department for Education, which is planning to make changes to teacher training, said the survey highlighted the need for close scrutiny of initial teacher train-ing. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, announced proposals to reform initial teacher training last month which would include more school-based training for teachers, and new qualifications. He also advocated relaxing the requirement that teachers of infants should be graduates. Teachers for children of all other ages would still need to be graduates, according to the proposals. Teachers' associations said the Ofsted findings showed that the present teacher training system was working well. They pointed to the finding that 71 per cent of lessons taught by new secondary teachers and 73 per cent by new primary teachers were judged to be satisfactory or better. Mr Jeff Holman, assistant secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, pointed out that the proportion of 'satisfactory' new teachers correlated very closely with the proportion of all teachers judged to be satisfactory. He said: 'I think it's a very encouraging report. It shows that teachers who had just come out of college were well prepared by their higher education training for teaching.' The National Union of Teachers attributed the high proportion of unsuitable candidates joining the profession to the high level of unemployment. The union said: 'The difficulty in getting a job now would persuade many people to stay in the profes-sion, even if they are not suitable.' It also said that poor resourcing, particularly in primary schools, made it difficult for headteachers to monitor new teachers as adequately as they wished.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva and </F> Aleksandr Kharchenko]    [Text] Dushanbe, 4 Mar TASS -- Head of the U.N. mission of  observers in Tajikistan, Liviu Bota, positively estimated the  aspiration of official Dushanbe towards a political dialogue  with the opposition and spoke for acceleration of this process.  The high-ranking representative of the United Nations believes  that the negotiating process is a concrete step towards peace,  national reconciliation and stability in the Republic.    Liviu bota stated this today in an interview with ITAR-TASS  commenting on the latest initiatives of the Tajik authorities in  establishing contacts with representatives of oppositional  circles of different political orientation. In this connection  the head of the U.N. mission of observers noted that this  international organization was prepared to render feasible aid  in arranging these negotiations.    Ramiro Peres Ballon, U.N. secretary-general's special envoy  currently staying in Tajikistan, agreed to participate in this  process. In reply to a question by ITAR-TASS correspondent if  the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border under conditions of  continuous armed provocations there, may affect the negotiating  process, the U.N. representative said that, in his opinion,  clashes on the border are not of a mass character and was  skeptical about the possibility of large-scale operations there.  However, he stressed that at the moment of the talks all combat  actions and other negative incidents on the frontier should be  ceased.    Assessing the present social and political situation in  Tajikistan, Liviu Bota noted that over the last year on the  whole it certainly has changed for the better, become much  quieter, although not everywhere, he admitted.    Specifying his thought, Liviu Bota explained that there were  separate facts of violations of human rights in Tajikistan, as  well as infringement of security guarantees for Tajik refugees  returning from Afghanistan.    According to the head of the U.N. mission, this is not the  policy of the government. In the conditions of Tajikistan, he  noted, when as a result of the recent civil war many people lost  their relatives, a factor of revenge is acting. This should not  be disregarded, Liviu bota explained, although the United  Nations categorically condemns each such fact and informs the  Tajik leadership about them.    At the same time the U.N. official said that he would like  to  emphasise that the government naturally is responsible for  everything which is going on in its republic including such a  sphere as the observance of human rights. It is very important  the U.N. mission of observers meets with understanding in this  issue on the part of the Tajik leadership, Liviu Bota stated.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Cabinet prays for deliverance with tied hands MR John Major has retreated. He had no other choice. When the prime minister met his senior colleagues on Sunday evening the analysis they received from Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, was as unequivocal as it was gloomy. With the rebellion on the Conservative backbenches swelling by the hour, Mr Ryder stated bluntly that unless the government swerved it faced certain defeat. A dozen backbenchers had stated publicly that they would vote against the pit closure programme. More importantly, scores of others were threatening privately to do the same. Mr Major faced the prospect not of a narrow defeat, but of a rout from which his government would never recover. The emergency cabinet meeting yesterday morning knew it had no option but to recognise that reality. Now the government must pray that the new package works. The signs last night were that Mr Michael Heseltine, self-styled president of the board of trade, may have to go further still to satisfy the disquiet on the Conservative backbenches. Many want the independent inquiry demanded by Labour rather than a phasing in of closures. But either way the government is severely damaged. Last month the prime minister's economic strategy was tossed aside by the speculators on currency markets. With it went much of his authority in the country and on his own backbenches. Mr Heseltine is staying on. Downing Street indicated that there had been no question of resignation even being discussed. After all, if Mr Norman Lamont could survive the biggest U-turn in economic policy since the late 1960s, Mr Heseltine could hardly be sacked for a medium-sized swerve. But the Prezza, as he now likes to be known, will find it hard to restore his reputation - impossible perhaps if he has to give still more ground in tomorrow's debate. Three factors ensured the defeat over coal. All three promise further trouble as the government seeks in coming weeks to push through draconian cuts in public spending and ratification by the Commons of the Maastricht treaty. The most important was genuine horror among Tory MPs at the scale and speed of the proposed pit closures. The decision - and the apparently arbitrary way that it was taken - reinforced the view that the Whitehall cocoon had left ministers hopelessly out of touch with the mood of the country. The fate of 30,000 miners replaced Europe as the lightning conductor for all the discontent over the economy which has bubbled beneath the surface since sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. Tory MPs who have been promising their constituents economic recovery for nearly two years are finding the excuses wearing thin. The second factor is linked. The vacuum in policy left by the ERM debacle alongside the fall in the government's majority to 21 at the April general election has tilted the power balance at Westminster. In the 1980s the government's majority was more than 100, leaving backbench Tory MPs as simply lobby fodder. Now that they have real power they intend to use it. But the third reason for the government's defeat at the hands of its own supporters has nothing to do with coal. For one sizeable group of Tory MPs - the Euro-sceptics - the furore over the pit closures was simply an opportunity to weaken the prime minister. The cabinet wants to bring the Maastricht bill back to the House of Commons next month. The Euro-sceptics judge that anything that can be done to damage Mr Major before then will reinforce their campaign against ratification. Mr Major can claim justly that the arguments of many - even among those with much purer motives - are riddled with contradictions. No one has argued harder for cuts in public spending than those members of the 1922 committee who have most loudly condemned the pit closures. But the prime minister can take little consolation from the inconsistencies. A party manager par excellence, he now presides over a party which threatens to become unmanageable. One minister was driven to comment yesterday that the rebels and the irreconcilables must simply be told to make up their minds whether they want a Conservative government. The problem is he could not be sure of the answer.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): London Tube strikes closer after union vote PASSENGERS on London Underground face the likelihood of 24-hour strikes after workers voted by a margin of nearly two to one in favour of action over job losses. Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT transport workers' union, said one-day strikes were the strongest possibility among options for taking action, although he hoped for positive discussions with London Underground before action was taken. Mr Knapp was planning talks with the TSSA white-collar union, whose members have also voted for strikes, to decide together on what form of action to take. It is thought that Wednesday and Thursday of next week are among the most likely days for the first strike. But the possibility of mediation to settle the dispute was opened up yesterday when London Underground said it would welcome 'some outside third party assistance if necessary to enable the union to talk to us.' London Underground has rejected internal railway arbitration machinery, but yesterday's statement could mean it would agree to talks involving the conciliation service Acas. The threat of strikes on the Tube coincides with the possibility of similar action by British Rail workers, who are balloting on industrial action in protest against a 7 per cent pay offer. In the London Underground ballot, 3,760 voted for striking with 1,945 against. About 60 per cent of those eligible to vote did so. London Underground said the result, with 40 per cent not taking part, suggested many workers did not have their hearts in what it said would be pointless strikes. There would be no compulsory redundancies and job losses would be achieved through natural wastage, it said. After the cutting of 1,005 jobs was complete, the organisation would still employ 21,500, against 19,600 two years ago. Mr Knapp criticised London Underground's revival of attempts to introduce flexible working practices which it modified two years ago because of a strike campaign. He said it was difficult to estimate what its real plans for job losses were. London Underground said the job losses comprised 50 among station managers; 120 foremen; 80 leading railmen; 300 booking clerks; 80 train operators; 200 guards; 70 engineers; 20 cleaners; and 85 in administration.</p>

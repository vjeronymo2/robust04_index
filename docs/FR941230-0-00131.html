			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) HEP will also determine: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The maximum number of national needs areas for which funding may be requested in a single proposal; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The degree levels for which funding may be requested in a single proposal; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The minimum and maximum number of fellowships for which an institution may apply in a single proposal; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The limits on the total number of proposals that can be submitted by an institution, college, school, or other administrative unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) All of these determinations will be published as a part of the program announcement in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .(e) For each USDA Graduate Fellow who desires to be considered for a special international study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowance, the project director must apply to HEP for a supplemental grant in accordance with instructions published in the program announcement in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Each application must include an ``Application for Funding'' (Form CSRS&hyph;661) and a ``Budget'' (Form CSRS&hyph;55). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) To provide HEP with sufficient information upon which to evaluate the merits of the requests for a special international study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowance, each application for a supplemental grant must contain a narrative which provides the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The specific destination(s) and duration of the travel; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The specific study or thesis/dissertation research activities in which the Fellow will be engaged; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) How the international experience will contribute to the Fellow's program of study; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) A budget narrative specifying and justifying the dollar amount requested for the travel; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Summary credentials of the faculty or other professionals with whom the Fellow will be working during the international experience (summary credentials must not exceed three pages per person; ``Summary Vita_Teaching Proposal'' (Form CSRS&hyph;708) may be used for this purpose); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) A letter from the dean of the Fellow's college or equivalent administrative unit supporting the Fellow's travel request and certifying that the travel experience will not jeopardize the Fellow's satisfactory programs toward degree completion; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) A letter from the fellowship grant project director certifying the Fellow's eligibility, the accuracy of the Fellow's travel request, and the relevance of the travel to the Fellow's advanced degree objectives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The narrative portion of the application must not exceed 10 pages, excluding the summary vita/vitae. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) All complete requests will be evaluated by professional staff from USDA or other Federal agencies, as appropriate. Evaluation criteria will be published in the program announcement in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Awards will be made to the extent possible based on availability of funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Any current fellow with sufficient time to complete the international experience before the termination date of the grant under which he/she is supported is eligible for a special international study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowance. Before the international study or thesis/dissertation research travel may commence, a Fellow must have completed one academic year of full-time study, as defined by the institution, under the fellowship appointment and arrangements must have been formalized for the Fellow to study and/or conduct research in the foreign location(s). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;3402.6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Fellowship appointments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)(1) Fellows must be identified and fellowships must be awarded within 15 months of the effective date of a grant. Institutions failing to meet this deadline will be required to refund monies associated with any unawarded fellowship(s). Fellowship appointments may be held only by persons who enroll and pursue full-time study in a graduate degree program in the national need area and at the degree level supported by the grant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In addition, fellows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) must be newly recruited; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) must not have been enrolled previously in the academic program at the same degree level;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) must be citizens of nationals of the United States as determined in accordance with Federal law; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) must have strong interest, as judged by the institution, in pursuing a degree in a targeted national need area and in preparing for a career as a food or agricultural scientist or professional. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) It will be the responsibility of the grantee institution to award fellowships to students of superior academic ability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) A doctoral Fellow who maintains satisfactory progress in his or her course of study is eligible for support for a maximum of 36 months within a 45-month period. Master's level Fellows, maintaining satisfactory progress, are eligible for support for a maximum of 24 months during a 33-month period. However, it is the intent of this program that Fellows pursue full-time uninterrupted study or thesis/dissertation research, including time spent pursuing USDA-funded special international study or thesis/dissertation research activities. For Fellows requiring additional time to complete a degree, it is expected that the institution will endeavor to continue supporting individuals originally appointed to fellowships through such other institutional means as teaching assistantships and research assistantships. For Fellows who complete the program of study early (less than 24 hours for Master's degree or 36 months for doctoral degree), the institution must refund any unexpended monies to the granting agency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

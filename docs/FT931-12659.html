			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Richmond Oil &amp; Gas slides Pounds 386,000 into the red RICHMOND Oil &amp; Gas, the struggling natural resources company which lost its main asset to creditors last summer, plunged into the red with losses of Pounds 386,000 for the six months to September 30. The pre-tax return, struck on sales 74 per cent lower at Pounds 1.5m, compared with a profit of Pounds 23,000 last year. Mr Robert Fox, chairman and chief executive, said the depressed results reflected the loss of the Richmond Ranch properties in June. Stripping out the return from discontinued activities, Richmond incurred losses before tax and exceptionals of Pounds 781,000 on sales of just Pounds 2,000. There was an exceptional gain of Pounds 130,000 due to a surplus on asset disposals, including the sale of an equipment supply business and some oil and gas interests. Mr David Wilkinson, a director, said liquidity remained tight. However, the group had cut costs by about Pounds 900,000, including a reduction in workforce from 200 to 10. Richmond retained an interest in just 10 producing wells, Mr Wilkinson said. However, revenue was expected 'shortly' from other assets on which well tests were being carried out. An expanded drilling programme was planned in the Panhandle properties in Texas for the latter part of 1993. Mr Wilkinson said this would be funded by the cash flow from successful wells drilled by March 31. Richmond also announced that it had found an investment partner for its Siberian joint venture. However, the deal had not yet been concluded. The group said it had completed its drilling programme on the San Juan Basin, which is up for sale. It expected at least Dollars 5m for its San Juan interest. Earlier this year, the SFO launched an inquiry into aspects surrounding Richmond's 1989 flotation.</p>

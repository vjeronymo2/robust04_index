			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Brussels, 25 May (EFE) -- Chilean Agricultural  Minister Emiliano Ortega said today that the agreement reached  with the European Union (EU) to export apples and pears "will  allow higher" prices to enter the European market and alleviate  "the high tariffs" affecting Chilean fruits.    "This agreement is extremely important, as it inaugurates a  more normal relationship with the EU," said Ortega, after  signing the agreement with Rene Steichen, European agricultural  official, at the EU headquarters in Brussels.    The agreement reached last week in Brussels is temporary,  until the commitments of the Uruguay Round of the GATT talks --  which are improved in this agreement -- go into effect in 1995.    Chile promised to immediately withdraw the charges submitted  to GATT against the European Community regulation on the  importation of apples and pears with reference prices and  compensatory rates penalizing the low price imports.    As a result of the Chilean-EU agreement, the tariffs Chile  had to pay on its exports of apples and pears have been reduced  by half. Therefore, the current tariff of 6 percent for apples  drops to 3 percent and the tariff of 4 percent for pears drops  to 2 percent.    The agreement also established that the entrance price of  these fruits can drop to 12 percent (it is currently 8 percent)  below the European reference price without receiving the penalty  of the highest EU tariff (54 percent), but rather a lower tariff  of 11 percent.    The basis to be taken into account for the overall  calculation of the entrance prices of apples and pears into the  EU will also be 60 percent of the total amount at the lowest  sale prices, instead of the current 30 percent.    In addition, after Chilean apples' absence from the price  list on the European market for four days (instead of the  current six), the compensatory rate will be eliminated.    Steichen expressed his satisfaction over a "friendly  solution" having been found to this conflict, which began in  September 1993 when Chile decided to file charges. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 26 (YONHAP) -- The Korean agricultural  team has gone on the offensive in trade negotiations. In recent  talks, Seoul has bluntly told its trading partners to import  Korean farm products or accept its export conditions, the  Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said Tuesday.    The ministry held separate quarterly beef talks with  Australia, New Zealand and the United States this month and  strongly urged them to carry forward this year's excess import  volume to the 1995 quota. It reminded them of Seoul's  concessions to beef exporters in a series of talks and the  Uruguay Round negotiations and told them it was their turn to  compromise.    In a meeting with visiting Chinese Internal Trade Minister  Zhang Haoruo on Monday, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries  Minister Choe In-ki pointed out Korea's growing trade deficit  with China in the agricultural sector.    Korea imported 1,055 million U.S. dollars worth of Chinese  farm, fisheries and livestock products last year while exports  only came to 35 million dollars, resulting in a  1.02-billion-dollar deficit. Seoul reportedly asked Beijing to  import more Korean processed farm goods, vegetables and apples.    Choe, meeting his Canadian counterpart Ralph Goodale last  Saturday, strongly requested that the North American country  lift a ban on Korean apples. Goodale, in turn, asked Korea to  purchase 300,000 tons of feed barley and lower tariffs on rape  imports. Seoul refused, pointing out that barley was  inefficient as feed compared with other grains and because Korea  would nevertheless have to import barley from next year under  the UR agreement. It also explained that it could not lower the  tariff on rape because rape farmers on Cheju island would be  hurt. Canada, the world's largest barley grower, has been  persistent in trying to sell its products to Korea.</p>

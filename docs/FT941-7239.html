			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: CEGF placing oversubscribed The institutional placing for the Central European Growth Fund, an investment trust to be managed by CS First Boston, was oversubscribed at Dollars 150m (Pounds 103m). Up to Dollars 50m more is expected to be raised from the public offer, which opens today. The fund, which although dollar denominated will have a London quote, will invest in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, with up to 20 per cent elsewhere in central Europe. The main focus will be on small to medium-sized companies (Dollars 20m to Dollars 300m capitalisation) listed on the Prague, Warsaw and Budapest stock exchanges, but a proportion will also be invested in companies expected to gain a listing within two years. Mr Charles Harman, of CS First Boston, described these economies as 'not so much emerging markets as re-emerging markets' with a strong industrial tradition and low wage costs. CS First Boston has been active in the region for several years, including managing Dollars 750m of funds for local clients. Investment of money raised through the issue will take place gradually over the next six to 12 months, to avoid pushing up share prices with a flood of new money. This will also allow the fund to take advantage of privatisations expected in the near future. Ordinary shares are offered at Dollars 1, with one warrant attached to every five shares. The impact of issue expenses will mean that ordinary shares will have an initial net asset value of 96.2 cents. The public offer closes on March 11, and dealings in the shares and warrants is expected to start on March 21.</p>

Comrade Li Zemin stressed: In learning from Comrade Liu  Lingying's advanced deeds and ideas, first, we should learn from  her in putting the interests of the state and people above  everything else, and in creating an atmosphere in which everyone  should subordinates their own interests to those of the whole  and protect and contribute to the latter. Second, we should  learn from her in being highly responsible for her work, being  willing to work at an ordinary post, being selfless and  dedicated to her work, being cautious and conscientious, and  working hard in a down-to-earth manner. Third, we should learn  from Comrade Liu in having firm faith in socialism and a lofty  outlook on life. Fourth, we should learn from Comrade Liu  Lingying in being ready to take up the cudgel for a just cause,  being selfless and dauntless, and daring to firmly fight against  a criminal. Fifth, we should learn from Comrade Liu Lingying in  always upholding principles, handling matters impartially, being  content with a plain or even poor life, being scrupulous in  separating public from private interest, and never abusing her  power to seek personal gain. Her ideas, values, moral  character, and work style are good, indeed.

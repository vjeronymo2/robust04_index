			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (11): Display - the next steps / Screen Technology IT IS axiomatic that, without the thin flat liquid crystal display, the notebook computer that dominates the portable market today could never have been built. Display technology will also play a pivotal role in determining the shape, size and function of the next generation of portable computers. Liquid crystals are odd substances, sharing properties of both liquids and solids. After their discovery in 1888, they remained a laboratory curiosity until 1963 when RCA, the US broadcasting company, found that by applying an electrical charge, the liquid crystal molecules could be made to realign so that they could either pass, or block, polarised light. Ten years later Sharp, the Japanese consumer electronics group, sold the first calculators with LCD screens. But when the first transportable computers emerged in the early 1980s, they packed tiny cathode-ray tube displays. These were heavy and power-hungry and were quickly replaced by the LCD panel which has since become the standard for portable computing. Nevertheless, over the past decade there has been growing pressure from portable computer users for clearer, brighter screens and in particular recently for high-resolution and colour screens able to do justice to sophisticated software packages like those running under Microsoft's 'Windows.' In simple 'passive' LCD devices, known as twisted nematic (TN), liquid crystal molecules are held in a double sandwich of polarising filters and glass plates. Individual cells can then be made to lighten or darken by applying a charge. This is fine for a small display; unfortunately, however, as the size of the display increases, the contrast between dark and light areas declines. To compensate for this, manufacturers have sought to increase the twisting effect and thereby heighten contrast. They have developed 'super twisted' nematic displays (STN) which produce the blue screens familiar to portable and laptop computer users, and 'double super twisted' nematic (DSTN) displays in which two STN cells are used. Finally, there are 'triple super twisted' nematic (TSTN) displays which use a refracting polymer film applied to the STN cell, allowing thinner displays with higher contrast. Today's new slimline notebook machines, like the 3.6lb Dell 320SLi, boast these significantly improved LCD screens which also consume less power than their predecessors, enabling manufacturers to cut battery weight. Dell's 320SLi features a 9.5 inch LCD that uses 75 per cent less power than the conventional edgelit LCD but is still able to offer a high contrast ratio of 12:1 and 640x480 (VGA) resolution. However, despite these improvements, 'passive' LCD technology still has some shortcomings. In particular, the contrast is still insufficient to reproduce the entire range of colours available on a CRT, and LCDs have relatively slow response times which mean that moving images in particular tend to blur and leave shadows. These problems are overcome by using another form of LCD screen. Most notebook manufacturers now sell premium-priced top-end machines with high definition full-colour LCD screens using 'active matrix' thin film transistor (TFT) technology in which contrast and response time are boosted by adding a transistor 'switch' to each display cell or pixel. However a TFT display is an extremely complex device consisting of 10 to 15 layers of materials, finely etched circuitry, and around 1m transistors that can be shorted out by a microscopic speck of dust. Predictably, manufacturing defects are high and, despite manufacturing improvements, up to 20 per cent of the displays have to be scrapped. But, as yields improve, prices are beginning to fall. Aside from passive and active matrix LCDs, there are two other relatively common screen technologies in current use: gas plasma and electroluminescence. Unlike LCDs, which need back or sidelighting, gas plasma displays generate their own light. A particular advantage of the technology is that response times are fast. The price of gas plasma portables is lower than that of active matrix systems, and colour plasma displays are technically possible. Electroluminescence (EL) screens are also fast, can support very high resolutions and are cheaper than TFT displays, but they tend to be power-hungry. Manufacturers have therefore been investigating other newscreen technologies including ferro-electric LCDs and metal-insulator-metal (MIM) screens, both of which have yet to make their way into full commercial production. In MIM displays, a layer of insulator is sandwiched betweentwo layers of metal. They provide high contrast and may eventually be cheaper than TFT machines. However, mass production techniques for MIM displays have yet to be devised. Some industry analysts and manufacturers believe that in the longer term ferro-electric LCDs, pioneered by Thorn EMI in the UK and Cannon in Japan, offer the most promise because potentially they have significant advantages over TFT displays. FLCDs use a different type of liquid crystal which reacts more quickly and, most importantly, is bi-stable. This means that if a pixel is switched on so that light cannot pass, it stays like that; if it is switched off so that light can pass, it stays like that too. Because only those parts of the screen that have changed need to be updated, battery life can be increased by 20 times or more. FLCDs are also lighter, brighter, easier to view and cheaper than TFT screens, but have been more difficult to develop as a practical screen because of their sensitivity to shocks although this problem now appears to have been overcome. Mass production of FLCDs is probably at least three years away, but they should be significantly cheaper than TFT systems because no transistors are required. Their fast response times and high contrast should also make them ideal for pen-based computer systems. In the meantime Mr David Brooke, Dell Computer's European product marketing manager for portables, believes that most of the exciting developments over the next year will involve conventional (LCD) screen technology. In particular, he argues that advances in LCD technology will enable manufacturers to build smaller and lighter machines with higher resolution displays - closing the quality gap with desktops. He also expects more notebook computer manufacturers to offer interchangeable modular screens - ranging from low cost mono twisted nematic LCD screens all the way to high definition colour TFT displays. Adopting a modular screen design will help manufacturers reduce the need to maintain high stock levels while customers will benefit from greater choice and flexibility.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN JOURNAL;  </P> <P> TAX BOARD DUEL FOUGHT WITH GADGETS  </P> <P> It was high noon at the Big Fresno Fair and Brad Sherman was sidling up to  prospective voters outside the Pronto Pup corn dog stand.  </P> <P> "Hi, I'm running for the State Board of Equalization," declared the balding  36-year-old Granada Hills tax attorney and accountant. "And I'm handing out  combs for two reasons: So you'll remember my name and on the theory that you  can use one more than I can."  </P> <P> Dean Kourafas, who had been sipping a beer, gladly accepted the blue notion.  But the black-haired Fresno food marketer later acknowledged that he was more  than slightly befuddled about what Sherman will be doing if he is elected to  the five-member board next month.  </P> <P> "Board of Equalization," pondered the young Fresno resident. "Isn't it  something to do with raising food and providing programs for the needy?"  </P> <P> Not quite. But not quite surprising either.  </P> <P> In an era in which California politics seems synonymous with big money and mass  media campaigning, the race for the nation's only elected tax appeals board is  something of an anomaly. Here, the question of name recognition extends beyond  the candidates to the government body itself.  </P> <P> "Some people think it's some sort of a civil rights commission," says  Republican Claude Parrish, who is running against Sherman to represent a  3-million-voter district stretching from Santa Monica to San Francisco.  </P> <P> Change the name to the State Tax Commission, chimes in Sherman: "Then, people's  ears might perk up."  </P> <P> Of late, the obscure but powerful board -- which rules on personal and  corporate tax appeals and oversees the collection and distribution of sales,  gas and cigarette taxes -- has been receiving more attention than usual. That's  because member Paul Carpenter was recently convicted of federal extortion  charges stemming from his previous service as a state senator.  </P> <P> However, little of the media focus has spilled over to the candidacies of  Sherman and Parrish, who are vying for a seat being vacated by unsuccessful  state Insurance Commissioner candidate Conway Collis.  </P> <P> There is no question these lonely men of California politics want this  $95,000-a-year job.  </P> <P> Sherman is a Harvard Law School grad and political junkie. He lived in Orange  County in the late 1960s and early 1970s, graduating from Corona del Mar High  School and spending a year at Orange Coast College before moving on to UCLA and  Harvard. He says he literally went for broke, selling the three condos he owned  and moving into a $600-a-month apartment so he could loan his campaign almost  $400,000 for the six-candidate Democratic primary. A good portion of the money  went to pay for being included on influential election slate mailers in Los  Angeles and San Francisco.  </P> <P> Sherman figures that because the district is solidly Democratic his party  affiliation alone gives him a nearly insurmountable advantage this fall. If  elected, he expects to eventually see the loan repaid through future campaign  contributions.  </P> <P> "And if I lose," he adds, "I'm a 36-year-old lawyer with no net worth. I won't  be all that different from a lot of yuppie lawyers."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Parrish, a former barbershop owner from Canoga Park who has more  recently worked as controller for a small securities firm, is combing the  countryside seeking endorsements from county assessors. He also held a  fund-raiser this week at the well-appointed Petroleum Club in downtown Los  Angeles, featuring another politician known for his traveling, former Los  Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty.  </P> <P> With an outsize district and less than $20,000 cash on hand for each, the  candidates say that full-scale advertising efforts in major metropolitan areas  are both uneconomical and unfeasible. Moreover, they note, the board race draws  virtually no big city TV or newspaper coverage.  </P> <P> So, after covering such bases as ballot designation -- Sherman says his polls  show the title "CPA" really helps -- the pair have little choice but to wage  what is essentially a small-town campaign over an area the size of some states.  </P> <P> Last week, Sherman motored more than 1,000 miles through Watsonville, Paso  Robles, Hanford and Santa Barbara, slowing down for interviews at weekly  newspapers and radio stations.  </P> <P> He was chauffeured by his secret weapon: his mother, Lane Sherman, whose  consuming passion, along with the success of her children, is long-distance  driving. Lane Sherman still lives in Newport Beach and her mother is a resident  of Leisure World in Laguna Hills.  </P> <P> Arriving in Fresno Thursday, mother and son set up shop outside the main  entrances to the Big Fresno Fair, where up to 75,000 people passed daily.  </P> <P> "I'd like to introduce you to my son, Brad," said Mrs. Sherman, as she  energetically handed out brochures. "My son, he's a tax attorney and a CPA."  </P> <P> Wearing a blue suit and suspenders in a sea of plaid and denim, it was hard to  mistake Sherman for anything else.  </P> <P> Yet the bookish candidate, who has represented California Common Cause in  legislative hearings on tax issues, did exhibit a sense of humor. By handing  out his combs and quips, he became the first statewide candidate in recent  memory who has sought to use male pattern baldness to his advantage.  </P> <P> At night, mother and son moved inside the fair to collar crowds streaming in  for performances by Johnny Cash and Engelbert Humperdinck. Virtually the only  large audience they passed up at the fair was the one at a Joan Jett rock  concert.  </P> <P> "The median voter in this state is 55 years old," explained Sherman, whose  platform stresses professionalism and the elimination of big business tax  loopholes. "I'm sure Joan Jett is a wonderful lady and deeply concerned about  the political issues of our time. But the crowd she attracts does not represent  high voter turnout."  </P> <P> Parrish, meanwhile, has been reaching out to voters by appearing at any public  forum that will have him.  </P> <P> "I never turn any invitation down," confided Parrish, who has failed in  previous runs for Congress, school board and the Board of Equalization. "I get  a lot of invitations -- but to be honest, it's because the district is so  large."  </P> <P> Speaking at a senior citizens' political forum in Van Nuys last week, Parrish,  43, promised that he would save taxpayers' money by employing "strict  conservative accounting principles."  </P> <P> Then he unveiled his answer to Sherman's combs: potholders.  </P> <P> Parrish placed the kitchen mitts on a table next to stacks of brochures, bumper  stickers, pens and posters. Within minutes, they had been scooped up, while  most of the other candidates' election paraphernalia remained untouched.  </P> <P> At 39 cents each, Parrish later explained to a reporter, they cost more than  four times as much as Sherman's combs. "But combs you lose. A potholder lasts  and lasts."  </P> <P> The candidate concluded with a campaign pitch: "Who then is the more effective  candidate at spending money? I think I am."  </P></p>

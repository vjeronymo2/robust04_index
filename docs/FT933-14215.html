			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / P&amp;G to unveil cost-cutting package at rare meeting PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE, the US consumer products giant, is expected to unveil a wide-ranging cost reduction programme, probably including substantial job cuts, at a rare meeting today with Wall Street analysts. The meeting comes two days after P&amp;G, which faces increasing competition from cut-price labels, announced plans to slash the price of its liquid laundry detergents in the US market. That move is expected to hurt not only the manufacturers of cheaper products but also Anglo-Dutch Unilever, P&amp;G's main US rival. Unilever's shares fell 24p to 593p on the London Stock Exchange yesterday. The analysts' meeting at the company's headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio, will be the first held by Mr Edwin Artzt, P&amp;G's chairman, since May 1990. P&amp;G, an unusually secretive company, is expected to spell out how it intends to reach its previously announced goal of cutting overheads as a percentage of net sales from 14.5 per cent to 12 per cent over the next three years. Some analysts have speculated that this could involve the loss of 10,000 of the group's 102,000 jobs around the world. However, the overwhelming majority of any reductions is expected to be voluntary, through early retirement and similar programmes. P&amp;G needs to prune costs to complement the price cuts it has been making to maintain market share in the face of competition from discounted brands. It has revamped its US marketing strategy, introducing a policy of 'value pricing'. This involves cutting down on short-term, deep-discount promotional deals, which periodically slash the cost of products to the retailer, and replacing them with a system of more consistent lower prices. However, the change has stirred up opposition among less efficient retailers, who have relied on deep-discount promotions for a substantial part of their profits. Tuesday's detergent price cuts stem from this marketing battle. P&amp;G is cutting the price of its Tide and Cheer liquid detergents by 15 per cent from August 2, with lesser reductions on other detergents, dishwashing liquid and fabric softener. The company indicated the move was aimed at narrowing the gap between its products and cheaper brands, but analysts said it appeared as much a strike against Unilever, which has just introduced super-concentrated versions of its liquid detergents. 'There is no better time for price cuts than in a competitor's new product launch,' said Mr Gabriel Lowy, of securities firm Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Lex, Page 20</p>

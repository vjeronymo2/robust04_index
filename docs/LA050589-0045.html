			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NOON TOPS STATE MARK IN SHOTPUT  </P> <P> Fallbrook junior Brent Noon bettered the state record in the shotput Thursday  when he threw 69-feet-8 1/4 in the the Warriors' dual meet against Orange Glen  at Fallbrook.  </P> <P> Also in the meet, Lenny McGill of Orange Glen had a 1989 state-leading triple  jump of 50-4.  </P> <P> Noon surpassed the record of Capistrano Valley's Brian Blutreich, who threw  69-6 1/2 in 1985. Noon also increased his 1989 national lead to 3-0 3/4 over  Louisiana's Ken Marshall, younger brother of the Washington Redskin linebacker  Wilbur Marshall. The throw was also ninth best on the all-time national list.  </P> <P> McGill's triple jump was one inch better than Phouphet Singbandith of Anaheim  Magnolia High. While there was no wind gauge present, the wind was said to be  negligible.  </P> <P> Baseball  </P> <P> Avocado League  </P> <P> Escondido 4, San Pasqual 2 -- It has been said that baseball is the only place  where a sacrifice is really appreciated.  </P> <P> If so, Brian Frank and Jeff Hopkins gained some respect from their teammates  when each drove in a run with a sacrifice fly during host Escondido's victory  over its cross-town rival.  </P> <P> "We work on that a lot, we try and move the runners over any way we can," said  Escondido pitcher Robert Erp (7-2), the beneficiary. "And we got a couple of  them today."  </P> <P> In the first inning, Frank delivered a long fly out to center -- long enough  that Gerald Cabral was able to tag up at third and trot across the plate for  the Cougars' first run.  </P> <P> Now fast-forward to the sixth, Escondido clinging to a 3-2 lead. Jim McCarthy  is standing on second, the result of a whistling double down the left field  line. Up steps Frank.  </P> <P> "I was trying to hit the ball to the right side to get the runner to third,"  Frank said.  </P> <P> Frank, a right-handed batter, did get it over to the right side, all the way to  the warning track in right. Once Eric Marsh caught it, McCarthy took off for  third and made it without a play.  </P> <P> That set the stage for Hopkins, who also flied to right to score the runner.  </P> <P> Another Cougar, catcher Tom Afenir, contributed in a more dramatic way in the  fourth inning by delivering his third home run in the past two games.

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> VIRGINIA DEFEATS VIRGINIA TECH  </P> <P> Fullback Durwin Greggs ran for two touchdowns as No. 18 Virginia defeated  Virginia Tech, 32-25, Saturday in a nonconference game at Charlottesville, Va.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers (9-2) held off a second-half comeback by the Hokies (5-4-1) to  win their fifth consecutive game. The nine victories tie the school record.  </P> <P> With Duke beating North Carolina State Saturday, Virginia and the Blue Devils  are both 5-1 in Atlantic Coast Conference play and tied for first.  </P> <P> Virginia Tech trailed 24-0 at halftime, but rallied behind reserve quarterback  Rodd Wooten, who took over when Cam Young left on the opening series of the  third quarter with an arm injury.  </P> <P> Virginia Tech scored on an eight-yard pass from Wooten to Myron Richardson, and  then Virginia answered with a 22-yard run by Greggs.  </P> <P> Vaughn Hebron returned the ensuing kickoff 53 yards to the Virginia 45, and  eight plays later, Marcus Mickel scored on an 11-yard reverse. Wooten's  conversion pass to Phil Bryant cut Virginia's lead to 32-16 with 1:17 left in  the third quarter.  </P> <P> Virginia Tech drove 56 yards midway through the final period, with a one-yard  run by Rich Fox making it 32-22 with 5:25 to play.  </P> <P> South Carolina 27, North Carolina 20 -- The Tar Heels took a 13-12 lead early  in the fourth quarter, but Harold Green scored on a 19-yard run and Scott  Windsor returned an interception 60 yards for another touchdown a minute later  as Gamecocks won at Chapel Hill, N.C.  </P> <P> A controversial pass-interference penalty kept alive the drive that led to  Green's touchdown. The call was made by the side judge standing about 30 yards  from the play. A wild protest by North Carolina Coach Mack Brown led to an  unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty.  </P> <P> The victory assured the Gamecocks (6-3-1) of their third consecutive winning  season for the first time time since the early 1930s. North Carolina fell to  1-9.  </P> <P> Southwestern Louisiana 42, Lamar 33 -- Brian Mitchell set an NCAA record for  career rushing touchdowns by a quarterback as he led the Rajin' Cajuns (6-4)  over the Cardinals (4-6) at Lafayette, La.  </P> <P> Mitchell, who had 214 rushing yards, ran for a school-record five touchdowns  and now has 43 career rushing touchdowns, which breaks the old mark of 39, set  by Freddie Solomon of Tampa from 1971 through '74.  </P> <P> Mitchell also became only the fourth player in NCAA history to rush and pass  for 1,000 yards each in the same season. A 159-yard passing performance next  week against Arkansas State would make him the first player in NCAA history to  rush for 1,000 yards and pass for 2,000 yards in a single season.  </P> <P> The 5-foot-10 senior, who passed for 162 yards, scored on runs of one, 11 and  one yards in the first half and three and four yards in the second half.  </P> <P> East Carolina 31, Temple 24 -- Travis Hunter threw two touchdown passes, caught  a third and ran for another score as the Pirates (5-3-1) beat the Owls (0-10)  at Greenville, N.C.  </P> <P> Wake Forest 29, Tulsa 17 -- Phil Barnhill threw four touchdown passes to lead  the Demon Deacons over the Golden Hurricane at Winston-Salem, N.C.  </P> <P> Barnhill had two scoring tosses to Ricky Proehl and one each to Steve Brown and  Scott Clinard as Wake Forest improved to 2-7-1, possibly ending Tulsa's (5-5)  hopes for a bid to the Independence Bowl.  </P> <P> William &amp; Mary 24, James Madison 21 -- Robert Green scored the winning  touchdown on a nine-yard run with 8:04 remaining in the game at Williamsburg,  Va.  </P> <P> The Dukes blew a 21-10 halftime lead, getting only two first downs in the  second half.  </P> <P> The Indians, ranked No. 12 in Division I-AA, improved to 7-2-1, while the Dukes  dropped to 5-4-1.  </P> <P> Louisville 40, Memphis State 10 -- Curtis Lipsey scored on runs of six and 63  yards as the Cardinals (5-4) beat the Tigers (2-8) at Memphis.  </P> <P> Louisville led 17-3 at halftime after an array of Memphis State mistakes. All  of the Cardinals' first-scoring came after Memphis State turnovers.  </P></p>

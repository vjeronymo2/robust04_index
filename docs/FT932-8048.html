			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: EniChem's big losses hit Snam results SNAM, the gas distribution subsidiary of Italy's Eni energy and chemicals holding company, suffered a steep drop in net profits to L139bn (Dollars 90.79m) last year from L636bn in 1991. As with Agip, the Eni-controlled upstream oil and gas group which reported a sharp earnings decline last week, Snam's profits were pulled down by impact of the steep losses at EniChem, Eni's chemicals subsidiary. EniChem, in which Snam and Agip have substantial stakes through the Sci holding company, recently reported losses of L1,560bn for 1992, more than double the amount lost the previous year. Snam, which is on the Italian government's privatisation list, also blamed its profits drop on continuing losses in the mining and metalurgy businesses. Group turnover fell slightly to L10,807bn from L11,244bn in 1991, with a slight decline in sales of natural gas to 48.1bn cu metres. Operating profits rose by 8.9 per cent to L2,200bn</p>

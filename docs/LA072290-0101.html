			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DROUGHT AND PORTER RANCH  </P> <P> Where is the water to come from the Porter Ranch development? Do the City  Council members think that they like Moses can stand on the rock and strike the  rock and water will come out of it? This appears to be about the only source  left if the Southern California development interests are to continue to  prevail against the increasingly clear constraints of diminished sources of  water.  </P> <P> And what is the mayor saying about "conservation?" Conservation for what, more  Porter Ranches?  </P> <P> BESS CHRISTENSEN  </P> <P> Lompoc  </P></p>

The Egyptian Government asked the Jordanian Government  to postpone the Higher Jordanian-Egyptian Committee meetings,  which were scheduled to be held at the end of this month, to  another date to be fixed through bilateral contacts. According  to Egyptian sources, the meetings will be held in April. The  Egyptian Government attributed this postponement to Egyptian  Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi's preoccupation with urgent  domestic and foreign affairs.    Official Jordanian sources were displeased with the  last-minute Egyptian request, the second of its kind, as it  indicates that the Egyptian Government is not serious about  strengthening its relations with Jordan.    It will be recalled that Jordanian-Egyptian relations have  been strained due to the Gulf war and the Middle East peace  process, for which Egypt is apparently very enthusiastic, not to  mention the profit and loss factors.</p>

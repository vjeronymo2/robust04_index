			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome may seek listing in New York WELLCOME, the drugs group, is understood to be planning a New York Stock Exchange listing as part of the sale by the Wellcome Trust of a large part of its shareholding. Wellcome Trust, the medical charity, is reducing its stake from 73.6 per cent to a minimum of 25 per cent through a sale this summer. Later this week it is expected to get High Court clearance to take its stake below 50 per cent. It is thought that Robert Fleming, the UK merchant bank which is the global co-ordinator for the sale, believes that the key to the success of the sale is getting US institutional investors to buy. Without strong demand from the US it could prove difficult to sell the full 48.6 per cent available at near the market price. The final amount to be sold will not be determined until close to the price fixing. At yesterday's close of Pounds 10.15, down 17p, the 48.6 per cent is worth about Pounds 4.2bn. The issue is likely to be organised in a similar way to a US-style initial public offering. The same structure will be used throughout the world. Although Wellcome's roots are in the US and nearly half its profits are made there, it is not well known on Wall Street. Less than 2 per cent of the shares are held internationally, whereas about a quarter of Glaxo's are US held. While some 40 US analysts publish research on Glaxo, only six US houses write about Wellcome, and of these four have London-based analysts researching the company.</p>

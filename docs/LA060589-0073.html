			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Driving for Dollars: What may be one of the best jobs on the East Coast was  uncovered recently when Boston Edison Co. sought a rate increase: Budget  documents revealed that the chairman's chauffeur is paid $60,000 a year. Not  even Donald J. Trump's driver makes that much and he's been with the real  estate tycoon for 10 years. The chauffeur's salary is among the $185,000 that  the utility spent last year to provide company officials with cars and  chauffeurs. News of the expenditures comes as the company seeks an $85-million  rate increase, or about $50 more a year from its customers.  </P></p>

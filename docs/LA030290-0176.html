			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> U.S. CUTS GERMAN BORDER PATROL  </P> <P> The U.S. Army today said it has cut the number of patrols along West Germany's  borders with East Germany and Czechoslovakia, which for decades formed the  boundary line of the Cold War.  </P> <P> The announcement was the first sign of change in the traditional vigilance  along the border and reflected the democratic change sweeping the East Bloc.  </P> <P> In all, the Americans are responsible for a 630-mile stretch of the border,  Staff Sgt. Elayne Venema said. Several hundred of the 250,000 U.S. troops  stationed in West Germany have been involved in the day-to-day patrols in the  area.  </P></p>

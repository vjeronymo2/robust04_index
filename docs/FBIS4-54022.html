			<p>CSO     [Text] Leading banks such as Fuji Bank and Dai-Ichi Kangyo  Bank, which had been considering the issuance of preferred stock  in the footsteps of Sakura Bank, have decided to take no action  on necessary revisions to their bank charters during the  upcoming June 1994 shareholders meetings. They have arrived at  the assessment that there is no need to issue preferred stock to  improve their bank equity position, because an improvement in  stock prices has caused a rise in the equity of the respective  banks. There had been the view that the issuance of preferred  stock on the part of banks would translate into the diversion of  a large amount of funds and an adverse effect on the stock  market, but that issue can now be avoided.    Preferred stock does not provide for voting by the holder,  but offers a higher dividend than that payable on the common  stock. Financial institutions consider preferred stock as a  favorable instrument for increasing equity. Issuance of  preferred stock requires a revision of the bank charter  authorizing the board of directors to take the issuing action.    Sakura Bank, which was behind the industry in improving its  equity position, revised its charter at the shareholders'  meeting in June 1993 and in March 1994 issued 100 million yen in  preferred stock. Since the sale went well, the majority of the  leading banks considered taking similar action, but decided  against such revision of their charters.    The reason given was that the dividend obligation would be  higher than with common shares and would be a costly action.  Further, a rise of equity ratios (based on a broad definition of  equity ratio in comparison with a calculation of assets  considering various risks) at the banks concerned above the  required level of 8 percent lessened the need to replenish  equity, providing another reason to forgo a revision of  charters. The Bank of Tokyo equity ratio stood at 10 percent at  the end of March 1994, and it reached 9 percent at the  Industrial Bank of Japan, which was relatively low.    The unfavorable attitude of the Ministry of Finance [MOF]  toward charter revisions also served as a reason for the banks'  decisions to forgo the changes. In administrative guidance  issued in February 1994, the MOF had encouraged the issuance of  preferred stock, but after March it came to the decision that  any attempt to raise large amounts of capital would have an  adverse effect on the supply and demand situation in the capital  markets and reversed itself in asking that the banks forgo their  plans to revise their charters.    The MOF had estimated that if bank charters were revised,  banks would issue preferred stock en mass and soak up about 1  trillion yen in funds from the capital markets. It appears that  the MOF had come to the conclusion that any large-scale funding  actions by banks would lead to a drop in stock prices.</p>

I put this question to First Vice  Premier Yegor Gaydar on the eve of the holiday. Now I can see  that his answers will not please everybody. Therefore you will  have to decide yourselves for what to blame Gaydar.    First all of, I would like to know which course the reforms  may take: "onward" or "backward"? And which actions by the  authorities can indicate to us, the philistines, a landmark....  I was asking Yegor Timurovich about his forecasts for the  future in the sphere of economics but, to be sure, in responding  to them, he could not do without politics.    [Gaydar] It is an unrewarding business to make predictions.  Especially since the situation in economics and in politics this  new year will depend not so much on the auspiciousness of the  stars as on the conclusions drawn from the events of the  outgoing year. I can say one thing with certainty, though: The  Russians will be scolding the authorities.    [Vishnevskaya] This is what authority is for -- to criticize  it. This is so natural! In any country, let alone ours, with  so many outstanding problems....    [Gaydar] The whole point is for what they are blamed. If  for the fact that although there are goods in the shops, the  shop windows and shelves are still a far cry not only from those  in Brussels but even in Warsaw.... And prices keep growing,  although at a slower pace than just recently. But they keep  growing anyway! And the fact that production has to be  restructured and that it has become difficult to market goods  owing to competition and even to reduce personnel, which is  especially painful and hard, and that those dismissed cannot  find a job in their speciality -- if this is what they blame it  for, let them. This is like a sobering cold shower -- not to  slacken. But if it is blamed for the fact that some goods are  not available at any price while those that do appear on the  shelves are so expensive that they are beyond reach, that money  again is losing value, that the ruble is depreciating with every  passing day, that savings can be kept only in hard currency, but  this is impossible because its cash circulation has been banned,  that the producers and the consumers are deeply in debt to each  other.... well, then, here things are bound to go beyond mere  grumbling.    [Vishnevskaya] The latter scenario is too familiar: It is  reminiscent of 1992. Again the same old story? Is this  possible?    [Gaydar] Alas, if we get frightened once again and, instead  of continuing a tough policy but the only feasible economic one,  begin to pump the country with money, then inflation will  accelerate in spring, leading to nonpayments, a budget crisis,  and then an economic crisis. And whereas last year the  fluctuations in economic policy were if not justified then at  least explicable, this year they are fraught with catastrophe  and are definitely not inevitable.    [Vishnevskaya] But possible? There are prerequisites for  that. The present parliament differs little from the previous  one. It seems that two months ago you said that you were  haunted by a terrible dream: You enter the State Duma and what  you see is the Supreme Soviet.... Has the nightmare become a  reality?    [Gaydar] Well, the situation surely cannot be called satin  smooth [barkhatnaya]. Yet I have never worked in a satin smooth  situation.... As for today's situation, it is radically  different from that in September. At that time there was a  severe conflict between the parliament and the government, with  the president's edicts being immediately countermanded and with  a complete power vacuum in the regions while decisions made at  the center by one power branch were blocked at the local level  by another branch; there was no budget for the fourth quarter.  Things were heading toward a political crisis.    [Vishnevskaya] And did come to it.    [Gaydar] But now the situation is different! There is the  main thing -- the constitution, and within its framework,  separation of powers. There is a strong presidency. And the  parliament, too, is different. We have the largest faction in  it, which, including the presidential power of veto, can block  most irresponsible decisions.    [Vishnevskaya] And what if it cannot? The faction is large,  all right, but Russia's Choice is not a parliamentary majority.  The government, too, after the elections, has acquired a  coalition character, which is obvious to all. Is normal work  possible in such conditions without infighting and confrontation?    [Gaydar] Our disagreements are largely exaggerated. Of  course, they are there but they relate to "superficial" matters  and, moreover, are easily removed. For instance, the Yabloko  bloc believes that the main shortcoming in government  performance is its weak antimonopoly policy. Who would disagree  with that?! Are there any ideas on strengthening it? Are there  people to translate these ideas into life? You are most welcome  into the government to implement them! Naturally, we shall not  be demanding that anyone either recognize the flawlessness of  our policy or publicly renounce their own views.    [Vishnevskaya] Does this mean that the road into the  executive branch is open to all regardless of political  persuasions?    [Gaydar] To all who can and want to work in it, implementing  its program. I am categorically against people opposed to the  program joining it -- no, not the program of Russia's Choice but  of the government. Their place is in parliament where they can  argue, promote their ideas, and in the end exercise control.    [Vishnevskaya] And what if such "promoters" are in the  majority within the government?    [Gaydar] This would mean a change of course. Then the  Russia's Choice faction will have to decide on the expediency of  some of its members working in it. But I do not think that  things will come to that. In any event, we are not making any  ultimatums or conditions.    [Vishnevskaya] But the policy of the present government is  also far from ideal. For instance, you are being criticized for  artificially maintaining the ruble rate against the dollar.    [Gaydar] This is from the "what they blame us for" series of  questions. So far the ruble is not overrated: In its  purchasing power the ruble approximates 30 cents. This is how  it should be in an economy at our level of development.  Questions arise for a different reason. In 1992, when the rate  was strongly devalued, it appeared profitable to take any raw  materials out of the country at any price, an opportunity used  by many. We were criticized for that (and quite justly, too!).  Today it is not beneficial to "dump" Russian raw materials on  the world market at throwaway prices, and we are being  admonished for that. And it is good that we are! There is no  such task as to take the resources out of the country: You can  trade in what yields a profit.    [Vishnevskaya] This means that the ruble rate is downgraded,  although it is realistic. At what level are you going to  maintain it?    [Gaydar] We shall try to make sure that its growth proceeds  at half the rate of inflation.    [Vishnevskaya] Incidentally, inflation in December is  expected at a level of 12 percent. This, however, does not  include the last week of the year, which can change the entire  picture. Is this a result of government policy?    [Gaydar] It certainly is. Please note that in December  there were payments to pensioners, and the "Vorkuta" problem was  resolved. Overall, during the year the inflation growth rate has  more than halved. If we go on like this -- and we set the  target of bringing it down to 5 percent by the end of 1994 --  the main thing will be accomplished: It will become profitable  to invest in production. Combined with tax breaks for producers,  this constitutes a foundation for industrial revival in 1995.    [Vishnevskaya] A rosy prospect, although a very remote one.  And what kind of "new life" will begin at the start of the new  year? Prices will jump, of course....    [Gaydar] Only to the extent to which we shall not be able to  restrain inflation. As for imports, the new year is no  threshold here. New import duties have been postponed until  March. Moreover, they will not bring about any revolution in  prices.    [Vishnevskaya] What will they be like? There are various  rumors to that effect.    [Gaydar] They will be various, exactly. High for luxury  goods and low for staples. The basic principle is that import  duties should bring revenues to the state treasury and protect  domestic producers. That they must be introduced, all  government members are sure.    [Vishnevskaya] Why then not as of 1 January?    [Gaydar] The level of duties is a matter of dispute, mainly  for agricultural produce. Our agro-industrial departments  represented in the government by Aleksandr Zaveryukha are  insisting on a "prohibitive" level of duties to discourage the  import of foodstuffs. Others maintain that they should be made  normal, not protecting Russian producers from competition but  stimulating it.    [Vishnevskaya] And how will this dispute affect prices in  the shops?    [Gaydar] High import duties mean a jump in prices not only  for foreign goods, which may not be so terrible after all. But  also increases in domestic prices: Moscow sausages will be  competing not with Dutch sausages but with Orel sausages, whose  prime cost is no lower.    [Vishnevskaya] But Muscovites are buying for the most part  on another market: It is enough to go to the Kievskiy or the  Belorusskiy railway terminal.    [Gaydar] Duties have nothing to do with this! Incidentally,  there are no duties on the output by the main agricultural  exporters to Russia -- the majority of our former Union  republics. While we were being criticized for lacking a  position on relations with the CIS states, we concluded free  trade agreements with them. Therefore prohibitive tariffs on  food imports from there have been blocked by a system of  interstate agreements.    [Vishnevskaya] And one final question: With what feeling  did First Vice Premier Yegor Gaydar see out the year 1993, which  has been so rich in events?    [Gaydar] I have found myself is a rather funny situation. I  worked in the government in 1993 for slightly more than a  quarter of a year, since 20 September, and by the moment the  election campaign got under way, it appeared that the "Gaydar  team" was responsible for everything. Those who were there for  the whole year got away with impunity, as it were. We became  the only ones who did not reject criticisms and complaints. As  a result, we had the unpleasant duty of responding without the  pleasant comfort of making decisions, administering, and being  in control. I have drawn a lesson from this situation: One  must never create the illusion of responsibility for decisions  made as part of a political line which is pursued not by you and  not in the way you think is reasonable.</p>

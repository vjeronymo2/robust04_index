			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Clinton to launch plan to reform US welfare system President Bill Clinton will today present his plan to 'end welfare as we know it,' an ambitious blueprint for overhauling the US benefit system in a way intended to encourage and force people to move off the dole and back into the workforce. The plan, which has been under consideration since Mr Clinton took office a year and a half ago, is built around a two-year limit on payments under aid to families with dependent children, the main US welfare programme, which supports about 5m families. Mr Clinton is due to outline the plan in a speech at Kansas City, Missouri. After the two years of AFDC cash payments are exhausted, most recipients unable to find a job would be required to enrol in a one-year government work programme. Unlike some proposals circulating in Congress, the Clinton plan would allow people to re-enrol repeatedly in these programmes, so long as they continued to look for work and did not turn down a job offer. A Republican plan would permit states to cut off people still jobless after three years in a government work programme. Virginian voters in a Democratic party primary election will choose today a candidate to face the Republican nominee Mr Oliver North for a Senate seat. Incumbent Senator Chuck Robb is expected to sweep the primary, but the real race will be elsewhere as independent candidates battle to gather enough nominating signatures to get their names on the ballot for November. By the time the polls close at 7 pm Mr Douglas Wilder, Democratic former governor of Virginia, and Mr Marshall Coleman, Republican former state attorney-general, must present documents with about 15,000 signatures, including at least 200 from each Congressional district in the state.</p>

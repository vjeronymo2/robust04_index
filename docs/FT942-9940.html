			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Russia to purchase German carriages The Russian government has agreed to buy some 500 railway carriages worth DM500m (Pounds 200m) from Deutsche Waggonbau, east Germany's leading railway equipment manufacturer, in a deal which should save some 2,000 jobs. Agreement to go ahead with the contract, in spite of the severe shortage of hard currency in Russia, was reached by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, and Mr Alexander Shokhin, his Russian counterpart, in the wings of President Boris Yeltsin's current official visit to Germany. The deal is still for rather less than the DM910m outstanding from an original Russian order, placed in 1991, but suspended because of the payments problems. The new order will have full cover from Germany's Hermes export credit insurance agency. 'The workforce at Deutsche Waggonbau, especially at Ammendorf (near Halle) can finally breathe easily,' Mr Rexrodt said in Bonn. He said the Russians were also considering taking a shareholding in the east German enterprise, one of those which has yet to be successfully sold by the Treuhand privatisation agency. The future of Deutsche Waggonbau is particularly sensitive for the German government, because of state elections to be held next month in Saxony-Anhalt, where the Ammendorf plant is situated.</p>

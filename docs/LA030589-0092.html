			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLIPPING OUT  </P> <P> Regularly each week, I read the entire Book Review section to an elderly friend  who is blind. She can be a little testy. Three-fourths of the way through  Richard Eder's "Richard Poor" Endpapers, she interrupted with, "Yes, yes. Let's  stop before he says that reverses are proverbial."  </P> <P> I obeyed willingly. It is a poor piece, clumsily arch.  </P> <P> FRED SCIFERS  </P> <P> INGLEWOOD  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRIEND SOUGHT IN SLAYING OF N.Y. POLITICIAN  </P> <P> Police pressed their search Saturday for a retired prison officer that they  suspect may have killed former state Sen. Vander Beatty, apparently in a rage  over losing a child support dispute.  </P> <P> Beatty, 49, was killed Thursday by a gunman who strode into his Brooklyn  campaign office and shot him almost point-blank, then drove off in a car that  was found stalled and abandoned three blocks away.  </P> <P> Police Sgt. Tina Mohrmann said police want to question the car's owner, Arthur  Flournoy, 51, of Brooklyn, a city Correction Department employee for 22 years  until he retired as a captain in 1986.  </P> <P> Flournoy and Beatty had been friends for 30 years, since college.  </P> <P> "We are leaving no stone unturned," Mohrmann said. She refused to comment on  reports that the Brooklyn apartment of Flournoy's girlfriend has been searched.  </P> <P> Authorities said Flournoy wanted to decrease his child support payments to his  former wife, and hired attorney Harry Pollak for that purpose on the advice of  Beatty.  </P> <P> Pollak told police he appeared in state Supreme Court on Thursday morning with  Flournoy to move for reducing aid to his two teen-age children. The judge  denied the motion and an angry Flournoy assaulted Pollak in the elevator, then  walked away, the lawyer said.  </P> <P> Beatty was shot about 45 minutes later, police said.  </P> <P> Barbara Flournoy told authorities she had not heard from her ex-husband since  he disappeared. Police were said to have searched Flournoy's home and that of a  girlfriend.  </P> <P> Police have yet to find the murder weapon, Mohrmann said.  </P> <P> "He seemed a strange person," Pollak reportedly said of Flournoy. "His attitude  was not good. He punched me. Before yesterday's (Thursday's) thing, I told him  I was going to withdraw from the case."  </P> <P> Beatty was running for a political committee chairmanship and authorities said  Flournoy appeared at his campaign headquarters several times.  </P> <P> Once an outspoken advocate for the black community and a political powerbroker,  Beatty left the Senate in 1982 for an unsuccessful congressional campaign that  included a scam to create the appearance of voter registration fraud by Major  R. Owens, his successful opponent.  </P> <P> Beatty was released from prison five years ago after serving a 31-month  sentence on tax-evasion, racketeering and election-fraud charges.  </P></p>

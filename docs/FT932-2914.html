			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (16): Falling prices attract new users - Value-added services / The fax market Today, the fax machine is as much a part of office life as the old Remington typewriter once was. Prices have fallen fast and models are available for less than Pounds 400. This is starting to attract new users who want a machine at home either because they do some of their work there, or because it is a cheaper and more convenient way of communicating with relatives overseas. The Swedish paper and pulp association estimates that fax machines will multiply from 5m worldwide in 1989 to nearly 16m this year and will reach 27m by 1995. A survey published in April by market researchers Gallup and Pitney Bowes Facsimile Systems shows that fax traffic is increasing at an astonishing rate in the UK - a rise of 133 per cent in the number of faxes sent and a 38 per cent rise in the number of documents received by respondents. Meredith Fischer of Pitney Bowes says: 'At these volumes, companies should be taking control of their fax networks and forming specific policies.' She believes there are huge sums to be saved. Companies can save money by: Using plain paper fax machines. These cut costs because they don't require expensive thermal paper. Plain paper is almost half the price - about 1.6 pence a sheet compared with three pence for thermal. In addition, plain paper faxes don't need to be photocopied because they don't fade. Fischer estimates that it costs 60 pence to copy each document including secretarial time and paper. Plain paper fax machines do cost more to buy - anything between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 5,000. But the potential benefits are encouraging a lot of companies to trade up. According to the British Facsimile Industry Consultative Committee (BFICC), about half the fax machines sold in the UK are replacement machines and most of these are plain paper faxes. There are two kinds of plain paper fax. Those which use ink-bubblejet technology (this gives near-laser-quality output) starting at Pounds 1,000 and those which use laser-light-emitting-diode (LED) technology starting at Pounds 1,500. The main players in the ink-bubblejet market are Canon and Panasonic. But most other suppliers, including Sharp, Panasonic, NEC, Canon Matsushita, Ricoh and Toshiba, sell laser or LED plain-paper machines. The market is very competitive and prices are likely to fall further. Buying faster machines. Facsimile machines with transmission speeds of up to 14.4 kilobits per second (kbps) are available from Pounds 1,500. They can provide considerable savings on telephone charges over standard machines which operate at 9.6 or 7.2 kbps. Using a 14.4 kbps fax working to the Group 3 industry standard, a short letter will take six seconds to send as opposed to 20 seconds on the average Group 3 fax. The improvement in speed has been made possible by a new CCITT standard (MMR) for compressing data, which takes away all redundant information. Routing fax traffic to data lines. Faxes normally send information in analogue form (like the human voice). But it is possible to convert Group 3 fax data into a digital format which can then be sent over the company data network. For example, NEC, the Japanese electronics company and fax supplier, sends fax data over its worldwide data network. There is no incremental cost for doing this because the network is already in existence. According to Mr Lester Davis, chairman of BFICC and product manager for telecoms products at NEC: 'One problem in this area is the lack of standards for converting fax signals from analogue to digital. However, the CCITT recently ratified a version of the Group 3 standard - Group 3 bis - which will work over the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN).' Fax machines which support Group 3 bis should start to appear next year. They will be able to send data to similar machines at 64 kilobits a second, cutting transmission costs, or transmit to standard Group 3 faxes at lower speeds. Using advanced features. Top-of-the-range fax machines offer a lot of advanced features, many of which can help to cut costs. For example, some machines have the ability to send non-urgent faxes overnight. Of these, a number allow batch transmission of over-night faxes. They group together all faxes going to the same number and send them at the same time. This can cut costs substantially because the 'handshake' part of the call, in which a fax machine identifies itself to another, only needs to be carried out once. Cutting down on queueing. Many highly-paid executives waste valuable time hanging around at the fax machine waiting to send messages. Mercury has estimated that sending an average of 6,000 faxes a week will cost a company more than Pounds 100,000 a year in staff time alone. Waiting time can be reduced in a number of ways, for example by giving users low-cost desk-top fax machines or by subscribing to third-party services such as BT's Featurefax or Mercury's Surefax, which re-send faxes or fax many destinations for users. Some high-end fax machines also allow users to scan a document into memory, type in the recipient's fax number, and then leave the machine to do the rest. Another way of reducing the fax queue is to equip stand-alone personal computers (PCs) or PC networks with technology which enables them to send documents straight into the fax network. For example, the BBC's news and current affairs department has installed a Xerox Lan-Fax Express 21 (a combination of hardware and software) to connect all 20 of the department's PC network users to a single fax machine. This enables them to create, send, receive and view faxes without having to leave their desks. There are a host of products for computer-fax ranging from plug-in fax cards (which can be cheaper than fax machines), to fax modems and servers. Some can be used to centralise management of faxes and improve cost control. For example, Comwave's centralised fax switch will help Lloyds insurance and reinsurance broker C T Bowring cut fax costs by Pounds 500,000 over five years. Of course, the fax is not always viewed as an overhead. At 'white goods' supplier Seeboard, field service engineers have been given NEC briefcase faxes (which plug into portable phones) so that they can order spare parts in front of the customer or get call-out details without going into the office. The company expects increased levels of efficiency and customer satisfaction. Home users, too, are unlikely to face large fax bills. Their problem may be too few faxes rather than too many. Mr Davis says the industry is working on standards which will simplify the use of database services for domestic fax users. Before long they could be using their Amstrad faxes to call up information from shopping catalogues or book holidays. One day the home fax could be as much a part of everyday life as the electric toaster.</p>

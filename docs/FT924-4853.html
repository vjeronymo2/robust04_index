			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Construction Contracts: Waste water treatment scheme AMEC CIVIL ENGINEERING has won a Pounds 4m contract from Anglian Water to construct diaphragm wall waste water holding tanks, together with gravity sewers, pumping mains and buildings at Cromer, Sheringham and Overstrand on the north Norfolk coast. Sewage discharging through the short sea outfalls is to be intercepted and delivered to a new treatment centre near Cromer. Treated effluent will then be discharged into the North Sea via a new long sea outfall. The company will install a 4,300 cu metre storm waste water holding tank and construct a pumping station on the west promenade at Cromer. The tank will be located at the site of a Victorian shelter at the base of the cliff. A sewer will be laid along the promenade in Cromer from the town centre to the new pumping station and storm tank, to intercept all sewage flows presently discharging onto the beach or the short sea outfall. At Sheringham a 25 metre diameter, 3,076 cu metre storm sewage holding tank will be installed and a pumping station constructed. On completion of the cover slab, a building will be constructed to house pump control equipment, odour control and other facilities. New sewers, generally up to 375mm diameter, will be constructed at Overstrand and will include construction of 1.5 metre diameter and 2.1 metre diameter on-line sewer storage tanks.</p>

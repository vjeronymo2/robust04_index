			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Spring Ram losses at Pounds 36.4m Spring Ram, the kitchens and bathrooms group, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 36.4m for the year ended January 1, against pre-tax profits of Pounds 21.1m. The loss mainly reflected the Pounds 30.2m provisions announced at the time of the interim results, and was in line with the forecast made in January, when the group's new management announced a Pounds 42.2m rights issue. Mr Roger Regan, who took over as chairman last summer and forced the resignation of Mr Bill Rooney, co-founder and chief executive, said the group's main businesses had generated an increased level of sales throughout the year in spite of the recession in the UK housing market. 'We are on the grind of a recovery programme, and we are very pleased with the way it's going,' he said. Turnover rose by 24 per cent from Pounds 193.3m to Pounds 239.5m, with the kitchen division accounting for Pounds 123.9m (Pounds 109.8m). However margins were squeezed in the kitchen division, and operating profits fell from Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 8.3m. This reflected the new management's action to cut stocks and overheads. The bathroom division made an operating loss of Pounds 3.9m on turnover of Pounds 60.1m, compared with a previous loss of Pounds 600,000 on turnover of Pounds 60.6m. Net borrowings at the end of the year were Pounds 24.8m. Mr Regan said that the proceeds from the rights issue, which was 97.4 per cent taken up, had wiped out core borrowing. Losses per share were 11p, compared with earnings last time of 3.6p. The board is proposing a final dividend of 0.1p (0.243p) to give a total of 0.1p (0.346p).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] London, Jan 5 (AFP) -- Croatian Foreign Minister  Mate Granic on Wednesday [5 January] denied assertions by EC  mediator David Owen that regular Croatian troops were stationed  in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but acknowledged the presence of  "volunteers." "There are some volunteers from Croatia,  definitely, but not regular Croatian forces," Granic told BBC  Radio.    Owen, in a Channel 4 Television interview to be aired  Wednesday night, said, "We all know there is as I speak a very  substantial element of the Croatian army in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  very substantial.    "And I must say that I think it's an issue that the world  ought to address more strongly," Owen said. "They addressed it  in terms of the Serbs in the spring of 1992 with very  considerable strength of purpose, but they have to a great  extent ignored it in the last six months as it's built up."    Owen said the EC view was "obviously influenced" by Germany  and "other friends of Croatia like Austria in the United  Nations, Hungary and others, and the United States".    "The general feeling," he said, "has been that it is better  to make representations to (Croatian) President (Franjo) Tudjman  and to criticize and to argue rather than to take action in  terms of sanctions against Croatia."    Croatia has always denied it has regular troops stationed in  Bosnia, although Tudjman on December 30 warned he would  intervene on the side of Bosnian Croats who, he said, faced  "aggression" by the Moslem-dominated Bosnian army.    Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic meanwhile Wednesday  denied the existence of a Bosnian offensive against Croat  enclaves, telling BBC Radio, "The Bosnian Army is on Bosnian  soil, there is no doubt about it. That is not an offensive."</p>

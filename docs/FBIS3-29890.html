			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 22 (YONHAP) -- The ratio of South  Korea's three major overseas markets -- the United States, Japan  and the European Union -- to total exports dropped below 50  percent for the first time last year, the Korea Foreign Trade  Association (KFTA) said on Tuesday.    Exports to China rose to 5 billion U.S. dollars, however,  signaling a shift in export markets from advanced countries to  Asia.    Exports to the United States, Japan and the European Union  reached 39.11 billion dollars last year, or 47.6 percent of  total exports worth 82.23 billion dollars. The ratio was 50.8  percent in 1992. Exports to the three main markets rose 0.5  percent last year, far lower than the total export growth of 7.3  percent.    The three markets' combined share peaked at 70.5 percent in  1987, but the ratio fell to 68.5 percent in 1988, 66.5 percent  in 1989, 62.9 percent in 1990 and 56.6 percent in 1991 mainly  because of the falling competitiveness of Korean products.    Meanwhile, exports to China rose 94.1 percent to 5.15  billion  dollars last year, the first time that shipments to that  neighboring country have topped the 5-billion-dollar mark.  Imports from the country rose 5.5 percent to 3.92 billion  dollars. Two-way trade with the Chinese thus hit 9.08 billion  dollars last year, with China becoming Korea's third largest  trading partner after the United States and Japan.    Exports to Asia, including the Middle East, rose 16.4  percent  to 42.37 billion dollars last year, or 51.5 percent of total  exports.</p>

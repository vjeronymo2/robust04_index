			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vector 21" newscast] </F>   [Excerpts] The Mexican Army today [6 January] launched a  new air assault on some sites in the town of Corralito, where it  has been reported that rebels have taken refuge. Shooting  continues between Mexican Army troops and snipers of the  Zapatist National Liberation Army in Ocosingo. At the same  time, a large number of troops was deployed in the area of  Guadalupe Tepeyac, where heavy clashes are reported.    Today, the Army established a security cordon around combat  zones, preventing both civilians and journalists from entering  in an effort to prevent any incidents. This comes precisely  because of what occurred yesterday when the Army staged a number  of operations and bombings in an area where there were  journalists. It is said the journalists were told that they  were in the area at their own risk, but they nevertheless  remained there. This was explained yesterday by Ramon Mota  Sanchez, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies Defense Committee.  As a result, it has been decided that journalists will not be  permitted to enter combat zones to prevent similar incidents  from occurring.    Meanwhile, there is tense calm in Altamirano and other towns  affected by the violence. Commercial activities are taking  place irregularly and classes are still suspended. [passage  omitted]    The latest official figures on the number of victims in the  confrontations show that 102 people have been killed, an  undetermined number have been wounded, and 34 rebels have been  arrested.

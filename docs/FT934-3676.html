			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Most Names to get less than Pounds 100,000: Lossmakers sceptical of offer from Lloyd's - 'Substantial majority' is needed for acceptance 'A Rubik's cube with a seventh side' was how Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's of London, described yesterday's settlement offer to loss-making Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the insurance market. Lloyd's is offering Pounds 900m to meet claims of more than Pounds 3bn from 17,000 Names organised in 38 action groups. But each Name will receive an individual offer tailored to reflect chances of success of legal actions and other factors. Names on the worst performing syndicates could receive payments of up to 66p in the pound, although the overwhelming majority of the 21,000 Names benefiting from the deal stand to receive less than 40p in the pound. Lloyd's said that more than 100 Names stood to receive between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 750,000, while a further 40 Names could get between Pounds 750,000 and Pounds 1m. The bulk of Names would receive less than Pounds 100,000. Underpinning the complex arithmetic are the conclusions of two working parties set up by Lloyd's in the summer. Sir Michael Kerr, a former Lord Justice of Appeal, headed a legal panel which has examined the legal merits of the action group cases. Sir Jeremy Morse, former chairman of Lloyds Bank, examined the financial resources available for a deal. Sir Michael ranked the cases of Names on 30 syndicates according to their chances of success, evaluating them as strong, medium, weak and hopeless. His assessment favours Names on syndicates participating in so-called 'spiral' or LMX reinsurance, where Lloyd's syndicates and companies reinsured each other's high-level catastrophe exposures. Most of the claims against agents by Names on catastrophe syndicates managed by agencies such as Gooda Walker, Feltrim, Bromley, Rose Thomson Young and Devonshire, are rated as 'strong' by the panel. Sir Michael regarded the legal claims of Names on so-called long-tail syndicates - which specialise in US liability business in which claims can emerge many years after the inception of a policy - less favourably. One exception is his assessment of one of the main claims against Merrett syndicate 418/417, which for the 1983, 1984 and 1985 years are regarded as 'strong'. Further loadings have been introduced reflecting the progress of legal action, membership of action groups and Names' exposure to more than one 'spiral' syndicate. Names who were plaintiffs on writs issued by eight syndicates - Feltrim 540/542 and 847; Gooda Walker (164, 290, 298, 299); Merrett (418/417); and Pulbrook 334 (whose legal cases are most advanced) - stand to receive 20 per cent more than would otherwise be offered. Names who were action group members when claims were submitted to the Kerr panel can get an extra 50 per cent if they agree to the deal. Names who have multiple exposure to 'spiral' and stop loss syndicates receive an extra 10 per cent for each spiral syndicate participation after the first. Lloyd's has introduced an overall ceiling so that no Name will receive more than two-thirds of total losses on the relevant syndicates. Although claims of Pounds 3.15bn were submitted by Names, the legal panel ruled that only Pounds 2.67bn could be assessed as damages, had the cases succeeded in court. After taking into account its weighting of the legal prospects of each claim, the amount of damages expected falls to Pounds 1.58bn. Sir Jeremy's panel identified errors and omissions insurers, which cover agents against legal awards for negligence, as the biggest source of potential funds for the settlement. The exposure of E&amp;O insurers - most of which are Lloyd's syndicates - was estimated at between Pounds 820m and Pounds 1,085m. No details about the contributions of the E&amp;O insurers are contained in the offer document but this is understood to amount to Pounds 400m. Lloyd's agents, who are targeted in the actions, have net assets of Pounds 80m. Agents as a whole have agreed to pay up to Pounds 50m in 'voluntary contributions'. The Lloyd's central fund, which pays claims when Names are unable to meet obligations, will match these contributions with a payment of about Pounds 450m. This amount is not likely to lead to any outflow of funds from Lloyd's, since between Pounds 700m and Pounds 750m of the Pounds 1,100m in the fund is already earmarked to pay claims. It is expected that a payment of Pounds 450m will allow Lloyd's to reduce these allocations accordingly.</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Arts: Last of 'Russian Spring' THE SOUTH Bank's celebration of Russian culture came to its end of Thursday, when Kent Nagano conducted the London Philharmonic in a neglected masterpiece by the greatest of all Russian composers. After all the stylistic excursions of these concerts it was salutary to be returned to the chaste neoclassical beauty of Stravinsky's Persephone, the 1934 'melodrama in three acts' to a text by Andre Gide, especially in such a beautifully prepared account as this, with the tenor Anthony Rolfe Johnson and narrator Anne Fournet. Yet the last week of the series had been dominated by a much less familiar name. Nikolay Roslavets, born in 1881, was the leading avant-garde figure in Soviet music in the 1920s; he had trained at the Moscow Conservatory, followed much the same stylistic course through Rimsky-Korskaov and French impressionism as the slightly younger Stravinsky. During the First World War, however, Roslavets's style suddenly became much more radical; he developed a system of harmonic organisation, and is credited with inventing his own version of 12-note composition quite independently of Schoenberg, whose music he seems not to have heard until 1923. After the 1917 revolution he gladly put his music at the service of the new state, believing, like so many poets and visual artists, that a new social order automatically implied a revolutionary approach to the arts. He was briefly head of a conservatory and edited a music journal, but inevitably in the 1920s he began to fall foul of the Stalinist machine; his music was condemned for its 'bourgeois ideology', and though Roslavets defended himself in polemical style, his music was totally proscribed after 1930, and his name expunged from all Soviet reference books. He died in Moscow in 1944 and his music has remained just a footnote in the histories of 20th-century music. But the centenary of his birth a decade ago renewed interest in his achievement, and under glasnost his rehabilitation has gathered momentum. The 'Russian Spring' series uncovered four pieces: last week Ashkenazy and the Philharmonia brought the Violin Concerto of 1925, with Tatyana Grindenko as soloist; on Wednesday the Arditti Quartet's Soviet programme included the British premieres of Roslavets's Music for string quartet and his Third String Quartet, while Nagano began his concert on Thursday with the first performance in Britain of the unfinished tone poem from 1910, Aux Heures de la nouvelle lune. Such stories deserves to have happy endings, and it would be wonderful to greet Roslavets as a distinctive and significant voice, set to alter our view of Russian music in the 20th century. But while Roslavets's historical significance is undeniable his intrinsic musical worth, on the basis of the works heard in London, seems uncertain. The confident French accents of the tone poem, full of glittering orchestration a la Dukas and Ravel, show the young composer as a prodigious talent who might well have flourished had he followed Stravinsky and Prokofiev into exile during the Revolution. But the technique that Roslavets thrashed out for himself during the years when Russia tore itself apart and writing music must seemed the most irrevelent of occupations, is so contrived that the instinctive early flair appears to have been suffocated. The string quartets are busy with notes yet short on rigour and ideas, while the Violin Concerto, composed in an elaborate 12-note technique at the height of his influence, still reeks of Skryabin and uses repetitive, sequential gestures to over-stretch its thin material and tie itself in structural knots. Yet the re-emergence of a genuine radical voice from the early, untarnished years of the Soviet Union must have strengthened the resolve of the present-day musical radicals. As recently as 1980, it's worth remembering, Edison Denisov and Sofia Gubaydulina were condemned by the chairman of the Soviet Composers' Union. Now, though, visiting Russian orchestras bring Gubaydulina's on tour: on Tuesday the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra included her violin concerto, Offertorium, in the second of its South Bank concerts. Offertorium is the most sustained and impressive of Gubaydulina's works I've heard so far, a fascinating 40-minute contemplation of Bach and Webern that moves in ever wider sweeps until it flows into a final string chant. The solo part was written for Gidon Kremer, who brings to it on disc a flair and intensity that Vladislav Igolinsky just missed in this London premiere. If the future of Russian music is Gubaydulina and Shnitke, as 'Russian Spring' has demonstrated so convincingly, its past remains Prokofiev, Stravinsky and Shostakovich, not Roslavets, however wishfully we might want to rewrite history.</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> DANA POINT;  </P> <P> COACHING, CLOUT CONTRIBUTED TO LLOREDA'S WIN;  </P> <P> CAPISTRANO BEACH ACTIVIST WHO TOOK COUNCIL SEAT WAS GROOMED AND ENCOURAGED BY  COMMUNITY LEADERS AND TWO OTHER INCUMBENTS.  </P> <P> It came as no surprise to the movers and shakers here that political newcomer  Karen Lloreda, a Capistrano Beach homemaker, swept incumbent Ingrid McGuire on  Tuesday from the charter City Council.  </P> <P> Lloreda was, after all, groomed for the job.  </P> <P> Since she announced that she would run in the first City Council election since  Dana Point was incorporated Jan. 1, 1989, Lloreda was coached and encouraged by  other Capistrano Beach community leaders as well as by Mayor Eileen Krause and  Councilman Mike Eggers.  </P> <P> The two incumbents, facing their first challenge since they took office,  counted on Lloreda's clout in her neighborhood as a way to unseat McGuire, whom  Krause described as a "weak link" on the council.  </P> <P> "She (Lloreda) listened to suggestions, and she followed through -- then she  studied," Eggers, a political consultant and chief Orange County aide to U.S.  Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), said Wednesday.  </P> <P> "That was critical," Eggers said, still denying that he, Krause and Lloreda  actively ran on a slate, although the three garnered a slew of local  endorsements and ended far ahead of the other candidates.  </P> <P> Krause, a popular longtime community activist, led the field of seven  candidates, 20.1% of the vote, according to unofficial tallies by the Orange  County registrar of voters office.  </P> <P> Eggers followed close behind, receiving 19.5%.  </P> <P> Lloreda was a close third, garnering 18.7%. Planning Commissioner Harold  Kaufman came in fourth, with 13.1%, while McGuire fell slightly behind him,  with 13%.  </P> <P> Trailing were local optometrist William L. Petersen, who received 9.6% of the  vote, and teacher Thomas B. Moy, who received 5.8%.  </P> <P> Krause and Eggers said the results showed that voters were largely satisfied  with the first City Council.  </P> <P> "It shows that the voters of Dana Point believe that the honeymoon is still  on," Eggers said. "They just wanted to change one of the bridesmaids."  </P> <P> McGuire was unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> Lloreda said that she was not surprised by her victory, since she expected a  high voter turnout from Capistrano Beach, her strongest area of support. She  also reportedly did well in Monarch Bay, where Krause lives.  </P> <P> "I thought the odds were in my favor," she said. "But I didn't dream that the  gap between third and fourth (place) would be so great."  </P> <P> By Wednesday morning Lloreda was in touch with City Manager William Talley to  schedule study sessions over city policies and procedures.  </P> <P> She will take the oath of office June 26 at 6 p.m. in the City Council  Chambers, City Clerk Mary Carlson said.  </P> <P> Once sworn in, Lloreda will be the only elected or appointed Capistrano Beach  representative in the city.  </P> <P> Lloreda said she will forge ahead in fulfilling her campaign promise to sponsor  economic revitalization in the aging Capistrano Beach business district.  </P> <P> Acting on a Sheriff's Department report that showed the business district  leading other sections of the 6.2-square-mile city in drug sales and other  crime, Capistrano Beach residents and business owners sponsored Lloreda as a  representative who will look after their interests.  </P> <P> Lloreda said she will ensure that any future redevelopment project planned for  boosting Capistrano Beach's economic base will also take into account longtime  business owners.  </P> <P> "I think she'll be a great team player," Krause said. "I already know she's a  hard worker."  </P></p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Hanson Pounds 500m issue well received THE Pounds 500m convertible capital bond issue launched yesterday by Hanson, the UK industrial conglomerate, underlines the demand among international investors for equity-linked paper. The deal was by far the biggest sterling convertible bond issue to be launched in the international market and was aimed mainly at continental European institutional investors. Participants reported a positive response from institutional investors. Since the group has a market capitalisation of Pounds 10.5bn (Dollars 18.9bn), or 2.3 per cent of the FT-SE 100 index, exposure to Hanson provides a good proxy for investment in the UK equity market as a whole. The bonds also convert into Hanson American depositary receipts, which may attract US institutions into buying the convertible bonds in the secondary market. The conversion premium of 15 per cent at launch was high by the standards of recent Euroconvertible issues. Analysts suggested that this might have saved Hanson's share price from the 'skid' - investors switching out of the ordinary shares and into the bonds - which has followed other convertible issues. Indeed, speculation that the bond issue might presage further acquisition activity by the company pushed Hanson's share price up initially. The price later fell back and the shares closed down 5p on the day at 220p against a weaker stock market. Although the bonds finally mature in 2006, investors yesterday assessed the issue on the assumption that the paper would be called after five years. Analysts at UK houses commented that the bonds looked slightly expensive, assuming that the five-year call option would be exercised. However, many continental European investors were attracted by the 9 1/2 per cent coupon and regarded the option of conversion into equity as a bonus. Demand from continental Europe supported the issue and the bonds traded above the issue price of par throughout the day. Credit Suisse First Boston, which lead managed the transaction, opted to structure the issue as a bought deal with a syndicate of four banks. CSFB said that the small syndicate was necessary to maintain tight control of the deal. The terms had been fixed before the launch, exposing the underwriting banks to considerable risk. The success of the deal may prompt other UK companies to consider issuing convertible bonds in the international market. However, the size of issues is limited by rules imposed by UK institutional investors, under which existing shareholders must be offered claw-back if the share capital of the issuer is enlarged by more than 5 per cent. Roche Holdings, the Swiss pharmaceuticals giant, said yesterday that its US subsidiary would launch a Dollars 1bn warrant bond issue in the international bond market. Swiss Bank Corporation was said to be lead manager but declined to comment on the issue's timing.</p>

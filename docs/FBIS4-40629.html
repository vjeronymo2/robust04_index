			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andrey Ishchenko: "Uranium Transported in a </F> Passenger Railcar and Stored in a Cool Place -- Details About  the Exposed Affair of the Misappropriation of Uranium-235"]    [Text] St. Petersburg-Moscow -- It was at the Federal  Counterintelligence Service St. Petersburg Directorate that the  details of the abortive sale of 3 kg of highly enriched  Uranium-235 stolen from a plant near Moscow (see NOVAYA  YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA for 9 June) were conveyed to our  correspondent.    It is probably a good thing that Lenya Golubkov had the idea  of making money on shares from the MMM Joint Stock Company.  Otherwise, this extraordinarily henpecked proletarian, in his  search for money to buy boots for his wife and other joys of  family life, might also have been drawn into a venture somewhat  more hazardous to those around him than trading in wallpaper.  The newspapers nowadays are simply bursting with articles  explaining, in the greatest of detail and from the lips of  prosperous people, how best to deceive the state (to obtain fake  licenses, to evade customs duties, or to avoid tax inspections),  and how to pocket a fair sum of money from doing so.    So it is, for instance, that one particular butcher, living  until recently in the city of Pushkin in Leningrad Oblast, after  closely studying the headlines in the central press, decided  that there was no better way to improve his lot than through  uranium. It has to be said that, to an experienced businessman,  the transaction would not have appeared particularly complex --  to judge from the newspapers, it is possible to sell uranium on  virtually any street, while actually getting hold of it is even  simpler. Not for nothing has that distant relative been working  for so many years at that Ministry of Atomic Energy closed  enterprise near Moscow (in the interests of the investigation,  we were asked to name neither the city nor the surnames), and he  is all but treading this actual uranium underfoot....    The month was February. The Moscow region was covered with  snow. Security, it seemed, had also gone into hibernation for  the winter (given, of course, that we proceed on the assumption  that in summertime the vigilance of the courageous armed guards  actually increases). It was on one such frosty evening that the  Moscow relative, without any spying aids (such as a suitcase  with a false bottom, a secret pocket in his clothing, or, if the  worst should come to the worst, simply a pocket) calmly marched  through the entrance to his beloved enterprise, calmly giving a  little wave with a bulging mitten (it was there that, a few  minutes earlier, he had poured a little of the uranium-235,  90-percent enriched). Of course, no chase ensued: The plant  managers only learned of the loss several months later, at the  same time as the world public. However, there is nothing to be  surprised about here -- it is most probable that the manager  placed too much trust in the words of Atomic Energy Minister  Viktor Mikhaylov, who declared at roughly the very same moment  that all fissionable materials at Atomic Energy Ministry  enterprises were monitored in the strictest possible manner and  that, personally, he did not know of a single documented  incidence of "radioactive larceny."    At home, using scales normally employed for weighing  potatoes, our hero weighed up his spoils -- the arrow on the  scales stopped at 3 kg (the primitive instrument ignored the  50-gram makeweight). Then the precious brown powder was  concealed in an ordinary closet prior to the arrival of the  "businessmen" from the northern capital. You have to agree that  the technique for handling radioactive materials typical of some  workers at Atomic Energy Ministry enterprises arouses at the  very least respect for the heroic profession of the "nuclear  scientists" -- for people such as these, even 10 Chernobyls are  nothing to fear!    The butcher and his St. Petersburg friends -- a plumber and  a  man temporarily out of work -- did not delay but came for the  goods on the very next train. They proved themselves somewhat  more skilled: They asked their host for packaging to ensure  safe transportation. However, not all the powder would fit into  the small metal tube proffered (which, if we are honest, is also  a doubtful defense against irradiation), and the remaining grams  were put into an ordinary half-liter can. The commodity was  transported in a regular passenger car on a Moscow-St.  Petersburg train, and the totally unsuspecting passengers would  have been highly surprised, had somebody happened to have a  dosimeter to hand.    When, on arrival in Pushkin, the "merchants" put the uranium  in a refrigerator (so as not to let it spoil?) and set off  around the city markets in search of purchasers, their every  move was already being monitored by the St. Petersburg secret  service (it was impossible to ascertain at what stage precisely  which respectable citizen "grassed" to the Federal  Counterintelligence Service). The counterintelligence agents  did not intent to pounce on them immediately -- it was essential  to establish how many people were mixed up in the uranium deals.  However, the quest for purchasers dragged on without success --  in many ways because, out of ignorance, the butcher and the  plumber were asking exorbitant prices, some five or six times  over the real value per gram of strategic raw material. The  counterintelligence agents could no longer allow these guys to  continue freely roaming the streets of St. Petersburg with  samples of uranium -- this was dangerous, and the time had  finally come to think about the health of the people living next  door to the ill-fated Pushkin apartment with the uranium lying  on a shelf in the refrigerator. Following the operation to  intercept the men carried out by officers from the "Grad"  operative-combat group, the apartment had to be decontaminated.    Despite the fact that the counterintelligence agents have  not  succeeded in identifying the channels through which radioactive  materials are flowing out from Russia to the West, this  operation can be considered a success -- after all, the entire  quantity of uranium, down to the last gram, was returned to the  state. Admittedly, nobody will undertake to guarantee that it  will not "disappear" without trace at another Atomic Energy  Ministry plant -- except, perhaps, a few top officials from the  Ministry for Atomic Energy itself, who according to our  information our preparing another denial for disingenuous  critics. We will report on this at another time.</p>

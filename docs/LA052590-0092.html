			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> TOUCH OF LEVITY GIVES CONCERT A WELCOME LIFT  </P> <P> Humor is probably the least-encountered element in contemporary music. It is  difficult to pinpoint just when humor fell out of fashion, but in the 18th  Century and early 19th Century, respectable composers turned out comic operas  by the dozen. Even in the purely instrumental genres, Mozart's "Musical Joke"  and Haydn's "Surprise" Symphony are but two examples of the playful attitude  towards musical convention.  </P> <P> Now, however, it is no mere coincidence that the interchangeable vernacular  term for contemporary classical music is "serious" music. Just try to imagine  an opera buffa by Alban Berg, Elliott Carter or Pierre Boulez.  </P> <P> Wednesday evening at UC San Diego's Mandeville Auditorium, the contemporary  music ensemble SONOR provided a welcome relief from new music's earnest pall  with Anthony Korf's song cycle "Nothing but Love Songs."  </P> <P> To be sure, SONOR opened its final concert of the season with Michael  Gandolfi's dour, ascetic nonet "Personae" and finished the evening with  Karlheinz Stockhausen's "Kontra-Punkte," the quintessential 1950s icon of  acerbic cerebral pointillism. But Korf's lively opus for soprano and small  chamber orchestra displayed a winning, humorous countenance, from the  instruments' unabashed flirting with pop styles to the vocal soloist's ironic  intoning of seven amatory poems by Thomas Hardy, William Butler Yeats, John  Hollander and Amy Lowell.  </P> <P> The 38-year-old New York composer demonstrated that, with sufficient vision,  consonances can be used playfully and unpredictably to excellent effect.  </P> <P> Soprano Carol Plantamura, who eloquently sang Arnold Schoenberg's "Pierrot  Lunaire" with SONOR earlier this season, savored Korf's witty vocal line with  sophisticated, articulate declamation -- she is the Maria Callas of  Sprechstimme. Guest conductor Keith Humble, who evidently relished the  composer's humor with equal conviction, kept the work's delicate, precise  instrumental textures in pristine alignment.  </P> <P> Drake Mabry's "11.10.83" for solo clarinet proved to be a tour de force that  elicited knowing smiles -- it satirized all those vapid, flashy clarinet  showpieces -- as well as admiration for the soloist's virtuosity. Clarinetist  Michael Richards, for whom the piece was written, had the supple technique and  sang-froid to sail through its athletic jumps and staccato iterations. In the  middle section, he delicately conjured its eerie multiphonics.  </P> <P> "Sum over Histories," a recently completed chamber piece by UCSD graduate  composer John Stevens, reconstructed works of J. S. Bach, Beethoven and Webern  according to Stevens' mathematical formulas. The result was a fragmented  dismembering that stirred in this listener the desire to hear the originals  again, preferably before Stevens' work ground to its conclusion.  </P> <P> New York pianist Aleck Karis brought his authoritative technique to the  keyboard solo in Stockhausen's "Kontra-Punkte." Karis' strong, clear attacks  and wide spectrum of colors enlivened the performance considerably. Resident  conductor Thomas Nee kept the pace taut and the ensemble precisely focused.  </P></p>

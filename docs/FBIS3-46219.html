The Haikou People's Broadcasting Station was founded in 1985  and in the past has carried 14.5 hours of broadcasts daily.  Beginning on 18 January, the station will change from recorded  to direct broadcasting.    The information that we have received indicates that the  economic development in the Haikou areas has made it necessary  for the station to switch to 24-hour direct broadcasting. The  direct broadcasting will place more importance on news reports,  which will be carried 18 times a day, while programs on  comprehensive services will be expanded to strengthen the  station's service nature.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Language training fall behind decline at BPP Shares in BPP, the education and training group, fell yesterday as the company predicted that this year would not be easy for the group. BPP reported pre-tax profits for 1993 down from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 6.3m, in line with the forecast given in a profits warning last November. The shares closed at 225p, down 20p on the day. Slightly improved profits in three of the group's divisions were more than offset by a Pounds 728,000 loss (Pounds 207,000 profit) at Linguarama, the language training business. Mr Richard Price, chairman, said the group continued to do well in areas where exams were being taken, but was under pressure in more discretionary areas, such as language training. He blamed Linguarama's loss on a worsening economic climate almost everywhere in continental Europe. During the year the group withdrew from language training in Japan and Belgium, taking a loss on the disposal of Pounds 219,000 on top of a Pounds 650,000 provision made in 1992. Turnover in the division fell from Pounds 17.5m to Pounds 15.3m. New competition held back the performance of BPP Publishing, where trading profits edged ahead from Pounds 3.29m to Pounds 3.31m on turnover up from Pounds 14.3m to Pounds 14.9m. Profits in the professional training division also edged ahead from Pounds 2.47m to Pounds 2.83m on turnover of Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 12.6m). The main profit generator in the division is accountancy training. Over the past five years the number of chartered accountancy students has fallen from about 17,500 to 11,500, but the number of non-chartered accountancy students is rising steadily. The academic training division, which has four A-Level centres, boosted profits from Pounds 306,000 to Pounds 409,000 on turnover down from Pounds 4.36m to Pounds 4.25m. Earnings per share fell from 14.5p to 13.2p. The group's total turnover edged ahead from Pounds 48.7m to Pounds 49.8m. The board is proposing to lift the final dividend is from 5.3p to 5.8p, taking the total for the year to 8.8p (8p).</p>

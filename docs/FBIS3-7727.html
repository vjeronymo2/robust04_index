			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nevenka Jovicic] </F>   [Text] Judging by everything, it appears that Moscow is  taking the initiative in resolving the strained relations  between Athens and Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM], which will, if it proves as successful as  in the recent Russian action that stopped NATO bombing in  Bosnia, confirm the authority and power of the new Russian  foreign policy.    The announcement of Russian mediation in a dispute in the  south of Balkans will not please the West and NATO in the least.  They are, according to what the weekly TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS  writes today, already rather alarmed by Russia's rapid and  unexpected diplomatic offensive.    Although Greece's official reply to Moscow's proposal to  mediate in resolving the dispute with Skopje has not been made  public here, TO VIMA announces the beginning of a new action by  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who is already supposed  to visit FYROM next week.    This latest move by Moscow in an area of the Balkans in  which  Washington and NATO have shown such an open interest will cause  new worries for the West, political circles here assess. It is  also being pointed out that the worries of the West will be even  greater as this latest Russian diplomatic action confirms the  increasingly closer links between Russia and Greece, which are  drawn together by friendship between peoples, the same religion,  and historic roots.    The West's fears of Russia's growing role have already  resulted in the so-called Partnership for Peace agreement  starting to take the shape of an association of countries based  on exclusively anti-Russian orientation, TO VIMA comments.    Greece itself announces a much more active and aggressive  policy in the Balkans to protect its national interest.  According to Khristos Saliberis, chief of the Greek General  Staff, carried by today's TO VIMA, Greek policy is moving from  the defensive to the offensive, which basically means the  neutralization of aggressive neighbors like Turkey and  protection of Greeks from Epirus to Cyprus.</p>

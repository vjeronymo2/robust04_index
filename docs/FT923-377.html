			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Donations trial ruled out for Kanemaru JAPANESE prosecutors yesterday formally indicted Mr Shin Kanemaru, the power broker of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, for violating a law on political donations, but said he would be summarily fined and not face trial. The prosecutors' decision and their stated intention to halt investigations into other politicians for similar violations have provoked widespread disgust, prompting LDP officials to suggest that a parliamentary committee may be set up to study the scandal. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, head of the Keidanren, the country's main business federation, said an 'extremely large gap' existed between the ethics of politicians and ordinary people. He added: 'We've reached the stage when an immediate overhaul of the political system is essential.' Mr Kanemaru, 78, has admitted receiving Y500m (Pounds 2.4m) from a parcel delivery company, Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, far exceeding the Y1.5m limit set by the Political Funds Control Law. Under that law, he is subject to a maximum fine of Y200,000, and prosecutors said the fine would be imposed without requiring him to face the embarrassment of a trial. Meanwhile Mr Kiyoshi Kaneko, 60, a former provincial governor, will face a trial after being indicted yesterday for having received Y100m from Tokyo Sagawa. He was charged with falsely reporting a donation, a charge carrying a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment or a Y300,000 fine. The contrasting treatment of the two politicians has rekindled public debate over the need for political reform, as has the suggestion that the investigation is over, even though a dozen senior LDP officials are reported to have received Sagawa money. It is generally perceived that Mr Kanemaru received more lenient treatment after negotiations between senior members of his faction and the prosecutors. However, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, yesterday insisted that the prosecutors had been 'impartial'. Doubts over Mr Kanemaru's political future have prompted a power struggle within his faction, the LDP's largest. It appears most faction members want the 'godfather', as he is known, to remain in control, but continued public outcry would diminish his standing and may prompt him to resign before the next election.</p>

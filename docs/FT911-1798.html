			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Turks face tough choices in crusade against inflation and debt TURKISH economic policy is in growing disarray, with the government and the state bureaucracy increasingly deadlocked over how to tackle the twin problems of inflation and public debt. Ministers are being criticised by central bank and Treasury officials concerned by the government's reluctance to curb spending as the country prepares for general elections, which must be held before 1992. Mr Rusdu Saracoglu, the central bank governor, a pivotal figure in Turkey's economic recovery in the 1980s, believes that without a commitment to fiscal restraint the bank cannot announce its 1991 monetary programme. 'The system is under great pressure. In our country short-term advances drawn from the central bank are being used to bridge the budget deficit. This is wrong,' he says. Fiscal policy has long been Turkey's most pressing problem, aggravated by the narrowness of Turkish capital markets and government concern to contain foreign borrowing. In March the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) warned there was now a great temptation to resort to 'money creation which would have serious inflationary consequences'. Central bank lending to the Treasury - in effect printing money to cover the budget - has already exceeded the TL3,500bn (Pounds 530m) ceiling for short-term low interest borrowing, agreed last year. Mr Saracoglu complains that liquidity ratios, which require banks to hold 30 per cent of deposits in Treasury bills, are now being ignored by many institutions. As a result the Treasury is forced increasingly to use central bank credits for budget finance. In this sort of climate it will be hard to rescue the central bank's programme, which by keeping the growth of its own balance sheet below nominal GNP was largely responsible for containing inflation in 1990 to about 50 per cent. 'No central bank in the world can solve inflation if the government has such a big budget deficit,' an Istanbul banker says. Turkish employers enter annual pay talks with the unions later this month. Before that the Soils Products Office has to announce 1991 support prices for grains and other crops. Meanwhile, in Paris in early June, Turkey has to give its annual account of its economy to the OECD. Given such a timetable the economic choices look even more daunting. Mr Mahfi Egilmez, Treasury assistant under-secretary, warns: 'It is too late for short-term ad hoc measures.' The official target for the fiscal deficit was set at 7.5 per cent of GNP. Mr Egilmez says that the central government's deficit alone - which excludes state enterprises - could reach TL30,000bn, compared with the TL20,000bn target. The central bank is calling for a new medium-term austerity programme to control public finances. 'Selling the programme, articulating the policy and convincing the public at large is now essential,' says Mr Saracoglu. Last week President Turgut Ozal warned the unions their current demands could set the country back 10 years. Mr Isin Celebi, the economics minister, announced he would end support for tobacco and grain prices. Though politically difficult, cutting farm subsidies is clearly one immediate option, together with a freeze on civil servants' salaries and a new pricing policy to reduce losses of state enterprises. The politicians' concern is that more far-reaching cuts could damage the electoral chances of the ruling Motherland party (ANAP). Mr Celebi predicts nothing will be decided until after ANAP delegates meet in June, when liberals in the party are expected to challenge Mr Yildirim Akbulut, the prime minister, for the party leadership. However, bankers and foreign economists are worried that without a fuller cabinet shake-up, any new programme will have little credibility.</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Losses at Ramus lead to new chiefs INADEQUATE management control was one of the reasons given for an increase in annual pre-tax losses at Ramus Holdings, the USM-quoted building materials supplier. Other reasons were poor trading conditions and the delay in selling a freehold property. Mr KC Wong has been appointed chief executive and will be supported by a finance director from outside the group. Mr John Ramus, the managing director has left the company immediately. The shares closed down 5p at 18p. The ultimate holding company is Hong Leong Group, the principle subsidiaries of which are registered in Malaysia. On turnover of Pounds 41.5m (Pounds 52.9m) the pre-tax loss increased from Pounds 2.95m to Pounds 4.22m. Exceptional costs of Pounds 677,000 covered closure and rationalisation costs, stock write downs and provisions on a property sale. Losses per share came out at 46.5p (5.1p).</p>

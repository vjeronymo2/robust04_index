			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Innovation in Europe THE FUTURE of the European Community's collaborative research policy, long promoted by Brussels as the key to technological innovation and industrial competitiveness, is in doubt. Germany, Britain and France are baulking at the Ecu13bn in funding proposed for the next five years. If they stand firm, the Council of Ministers may be drawn into political confrontation with the European Parliament. As the EC's biggest paymasters, the three governments are motivated chiefly by financial considerations, while the Parliament's overriding interest is in testing the expanded institutional powers conferred on it by the Maastricht treaty. These circumstances are hardly conducive to constructive debate on what the policy has actually achieved, and whether it merits further support. The evidence is far from conclusive. It is hard to be sure how far joint programmes such as Esprit have yielded commercial results, since they mainly support generic research, not the development of products for market. Most independent observers agree, though, that they have helped increase the flow of knowhow by stimulating contacts between academics and industry across borders. However, the programmes have conspicuously failed to prevent the Community's deficit on high-technology trade from widening further in the past decade; neither have they saved its indigenous computer and semiconductor manufacturers from near-terminal decline. That these products are still made in Europe is due largely to local investment by US and Japanese companies, much of it prompted by EC trade barriers. Wrong targets This dismal record neither invalidates the case for EC research funding nor implies that more cash would have produced a better outcome. The problem is that policy has been directed at the wrong targets. Too much money has been squandered on failed prestige projects such as high-definition television and the Jessi microchip scheme, intended to nurture 'infant industries' and equip European industrial champions to compete on world markets. That has repeated the error of national policies which relied on state-backed investment projects to foster big technological breakthroughs. Insofar as these have produced any usable products, the only buyers have usually been government monopolies, which were often the projects' sponsors in the first place. Rarely have such policies helped companies compete on open markets. More important still, EC policy has failed to remove the biggest constraints to innovation. Research and development has commanded so much attention partly because it is the only element in the innovation process which can be easily identified and acted on by policy. However, it is only a measure of input. Its commercial value depends on how effectively it is converted into industrial output. Japanese techniques That is a task for which companies are uniquely responsible. The rise of Japan's export industries in the past 30 years owes much to their effectiveness in assimilating technology originated abroad. Their ability to do so has relied on highly integrated product development and manufacturing systems which have encouraged company-wide involvement in the innovation process. Though European manufacturers have applied Japanese techniques in their factories, few have yet extended them throughout their business. That is true not just in electronics and information technology. Pharmaceuticals excepted, companies in many other sectors have handicapped innovation efforts by allowing big gulfs to develop between their central research laboratories and production and marketing divisions. The current emphasis in Europe on new management concepts designed to enhance performance by tightening links between corporate disciplines is an encouraging sign that renewed efforts are being made to catch up. EC and national technology policies can help by investing in the science base, encouraging the dissemination of knowhow and raising skill levels. But only by its own efforts can industry ensure these assets are put to productive use.</p>

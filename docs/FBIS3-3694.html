The contract was signed by Sichuan provincial officials and  Tsui Tsin-tong, chairman of the Hong Kong company.    The original Chengdu-Mianyang highway, in one of the most  economically active areas of this southwest China province, has  been a bottleneck in the region's economic growth.    The Hong Kong company will pay for 60 percent of the 1.35  billion yuan (about 155 million U.S. dollars) total cost of the  project and Sichuan the rest.    The express highway is due to be completed in three years  from the day work starts, according to the contract.    Officials said that the Chengdu-Mianyang express highway  will  link up with two other main highways in the region and is  expected to boost the local economy.</p>

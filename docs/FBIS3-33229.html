			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Rafael Caldera met a few minutes ago with  representatives of the Banco Latino Depositors Front, who  delivered a letter to him demanding that the bank not be  dissolved, punishment for those responsible, supervision of  those in charge of the intervention, and a satisfactory solution  for those savings depositors who have yet to be paid. The  Depositors Front has thus requested the urgent intervention of  the president for a prompt solution.    [Begin Caldera recording] I would like to tell you briefly  that the government has not stopped to figure out how much it  will cost to solve the Banco Latino problem but how and when can  we obtain the funds to solve it. [applause] If the coffers  were full and oil receiving a reasonable market price, if we did  not have the terrible fiscal deficit, then undoubtedly the  government would not have hesitated to assign all the needed  funds to solve the problem immediately.    There are paths toward a solution, and the most advantageous  is the one you have suggested. There is the concerned  solidarity of the Legislative Branch, the executive branch, the  various public administration organizations, the private sector,  and public opinion in general to ensure all paths explored will  be truly efficient. We have ruled out the possibility of  sensationalist measures that can have an initial impact but will  fail to lead to a definitive solution.    We agree that we should not consider dissolving the bank,  and  hopefully it will not come up as an option. [applause] We  believe there is a way for the bank to recover, a way for the  bank to establish itself once again on healthy, solid, and  honest grounds, to be able to save not only the small savings  account holders but all depositors who in entrusted their funds  to Banco Latino in good faith.

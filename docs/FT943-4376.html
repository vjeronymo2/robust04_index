			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Public-sector pay bill registers its lowest rise The public-sector pay bill rose just 1 per cent last year, the lowest annual increase since records began in 1954, figures released yesterday in the Central Statistical Office's National Income and Expenditure Blue Book show. While the pay bill increased markedly less than the previous year's rise of 7.5 per cent, it was achieved at the expense of large-scale job cuts. Numbers employed in the public sector fell 327,000 between mid-1992 and mid-1993. The 1 per cent rise last year also disguised an increase in average earnings per head in the public sector of 7 per cent. This suggested that bonuses and other increments are having an increasingly significant impact on overall increases in pay. An analysis of the figures by the Public Finance Foundation of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy showed that last year's increase in the total bill was well within the 1.5 per cent target ceiling set when the government announced its wage policy in November 1992. The combined pay bill for local and central government and public corporations was Pounds 93.55bn last year compared with Pounds 92.64bn in the previous year. The institute notes that the average individual public-sector average pay rise of 7 per cent last year was considerably more than the private-sector rise over the same period of 4.3 per cent. The figures show that while the pay policy was holding back basic pay rises, real earnings were rising to a much greater degree than might have been expected, the institute said. Mr Chris Trinder, research director, said: 'The 1.5 per cent wage settlement policy did not succeed in preventing considerable earnings drift in the public sector.' He added: 'Basic wage rates are becoming less important as a determinant of total earning increases. Perhaps this is why the policy met with so little opposition - because living standards for those who kept their jobs were still being protected.' The figures also showed that average earnings per head in the public sector continued to stay ahead of those in the private sector from the beginning of 1991 to the end of last year. Average public-sector earnings per head were Pounds 17,093 last year compared with Pounds 13,280 in the private sector.</p>

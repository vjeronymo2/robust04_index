			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, May 11 (ATA) -- The vice president of the  Party for Democratic Prosperity [PDP], Mendu Thaci, recently met  in Tetova with CSCE representatives and informed them of the  difficulties his party is facing, sources from Skopje reported  yesterday.    Mr. Thaci informed the CSCE representatives of the grave  situation of the Albanian schools in The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]. "In the 1981 there were 38  Albanian middle schools while now they have been reduced in 5.  Only 2.8 percent of the Skopje University are Albanians while  Albanians make up only 2.4 percent of the police workers. Among  250,000 titles of books at the Skopje Popular Library only 150  are in Albanian language," Mr. Thaci informed the CSCE  representatives.    "Even Albanians make up one third of the total population,  they are considered in the Constitution as an insignificant  minority," Mr. Thaci said adding that "though they were under  discriminating laws they approved the statement for the  independence of Macedonia and recognized both its existence and  that of the Macedonian people."</p>

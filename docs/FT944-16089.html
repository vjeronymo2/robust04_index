			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses forget domestic concerns after US data The US PPI figures, taking Treasuries up by over a point in the New York morning, did their best to wipe domestic concerns off the European agenda yesterday afternoon, writes Our Markets Staff. By and large, they succeeded, but individual bourses and share prices varied the effect. FRANKFURT moved from near-stasis at the close of the official session, with the Dax index up 5.06 at 2,082.63, to elation in the post-bourse where the Ibis-indicated Dax closed 35.40 higher at 2,108.08. Turnover rose from DM7.1bn to DM8bn. Outstanding performance came from stocks depressed or ignored until recently. Allianz, pulled back following its acquisition of three Swiss Re units by fears of a rights issue, which it denied, rose DM99, or 4.4 per cent, to DM2,363 by the post-bourse close. Similarly, Schering parleyed its relief after Tuesday's Biogen news from San Francisco into a further DM48 gain at DM1,008, up DM110 or 12.2 per cent, in three days, while the ever-volatile Metallgesellschaft recovered another DM7 to DM166. The recovery theme extended to Kardstadt, the department store group. Retailers have been depressed this year on the lack of impetus in German consumer spending, said Mr Eckhard Frahm at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, but Karstadt rose DM18 to DM630 on hopes that the ruling conservative/liberal coalition will win Sunday's elections. PARIS was pleased with the US data, which was reflected in a gain on the CAC-40 index of 37.54, or nearly 2 per cent, to 1,955.68. France has attracted strong recommendations this week from both Smith New Court Europe and James Capel. Capel noted that 'at a time when cyclicals are running into some profit-taking, the French market, whose constituents are less exposed to the cycle, has more safe havens'. Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch highlighted the banking sector as having scope for growth, and said that it believed there was a 25 per cent plus upside in many financials on a two year view. Merrill said that it had a preference for CLF and CCF, followed by Paribas and BNP, while it was neutral on Societe Generale, Suez and Bancaire. Financials were strong yesterday with CLF up FFr5.40 to FFr394.30 and CCF up FFr6.30 at FFr223.90. Eurotunnel, one of the market's most volatile stocks, was among the day's biggest losers, off 6 per cent at FFr20.55, after the group said that it would be unable to meet its 1994 business targets. ZURICH came alive after the release of the US data. The SMI index rose 30.6 or 1.2 per cent to 2,593.3, derivatives-related buying helping during the afternoon after the index broke through the 2,580 level. Banks were higher with UBS bearers gaining SFr19 to SFr1,259 as the bank continued to buy its own stock. Credit Suisse rose SFr13 to SFr549, partly as a result of continued switching from UBS. Insurers were strong with Zurich Insurance adding SFr15 to SFr1,205 and Swiss Re putting on SFr16 to SFr730. Among chemicals, Sandoz gained SFr6 to SFr671 and Roche certificates SFr60 to SFr5,940. Speculative activity continued to spur the sector's smaller issues, taking Berner SFr20 higher to SFr1,510. AMSTERDAM went with the rising trend throughout the continent, which left the AEX index 5.01 higher at 407.31. JP Morgan recommended an underweight position on the market on a long-term view, mainly because of the high exposure of companies to the US, where some 30 per cent of profits are derived. 'The only offset would be if it was thought a rise in short-term rates could lead to a sharp rise in the US dollar, historically positive for the market,' the broker said. MILAN reversed early falls, in line with other bourses, as investors brought forward account-end position-squaring ahead of today's general strike which, it was feared, could close many banks. The Comit index registered a 9.36 fall to 630.32, reflecting early weakness as political and budgetary concerns continued to cast shadows. However, the real-time Mibtel index picked up from a low of 9,983 to finish 107, or 1.1 per cent ahead, at 10,220. Kleinwort Benson said that although political instability was becoming increasingly structural, it was not yet in anyone's interests for the government to fall. In view of this and the strong underlying fundamentals, the market was likely to rebound in coming weeks. Pirelli was L45 higher at L2,280 on short covering and Olivetti rose L30 to L1,927. MADRID, an underperformer this year, out did other bourses in the extent of yesterday's recovery with the general index up 7.43, or 2.5 per cent, at 303.18. Dealers noted a very strong performance from the banking sector, not only on the US data but also on the market's anticipation that Spain's own CPI figures today will be similarly well received. STOCKHOLM was broadly higher in heavy trading with much of its 1.9 per cent advance coming during the second half of the session. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 26.90 to 1,452.10. Attention again focused on Ericsson Bs which closed SKr4.5 higher at SKr422, for a four day rise of 8.2 per cent in response to the strong interim earnings report from Motorola.

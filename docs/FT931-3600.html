			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Boost for Lib-Lab pact advocates ADVOCATES of an electoral pact between Labour and the Liberal Democrats received a boost yesterday when an opinion poll revealed that together the opposition parties would sweep the country, Ivo Dawnay writes. The Gallup findings, taken from a sample of 1,034 voters in the first week of February, showed 58 per cent would support a new Lib-Lab pact while just 26 per cent would vote Conservative. The result is certain to be brushed aside by the Labour leadership, which dismissed a call from the party's candidate in Newbury, Berkshire, at the last general election to allow the Liberal Democrats a free run in the coming by-election. Mr John Smith, the party leader, has always argued that Labour must win elections outright. Furthermore, Labour's relations with the Liberal Democrats have been more than usually strained recently because of Mr Paddy Ashdown's decision in November to back the government in the so-called Maastricht paving debate - won by the Conservatives by just four votes. Mr Alan Clark, the former defence minister, has confirmed that Newbury Conservatives have rejected him as their candidate for the by-election. He has not been included on the shortlist of 18.</p>

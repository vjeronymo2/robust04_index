			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Boreyko: ``Top Secret: Black Coats </F> against the Black Sea'']    [Text] In the 1950's, the battleship Novorossiysk sank in a  Crimea harbor; 2,000 sailors went down. The year 1974 marked the  end of a cruiser of the Krest class which burned down in the  North Sea; 450 sailors were lost. In April 1987 a small  rocket-armed boat blew up; 39 sailors died. Tragedies on Soviet  Navy ships were a common occurrence. In the old days, the truth  was simply covered up. The large destroyer Otvazhnyy sank on 30  August 1974 in the Black Sea, near Sevastopol. Ammunition stores  blew up and fire kept rescue ships from coming close. According  to some information, hundreds of sailors perished.    Some time in the 1970's, a Soviet diesel boat also went  down.  The helicopter carrier Moskva caught fire several times. First  time in 1971-72, then in 1989. In 1969, it hit itself with its  own torpedo; thank God, it failed to explode. In the winter of  1991, the engine on board the large destroyer Admiral Zakharov  blew up near Vladivostok. The fire burned for 31 hours. Overall,  from 1945 to 1989, some 200 serious accidents took place in the  Soviet Navy.    While the destruction of navy boats was often the result of  general negligence, unreliability of Soviet military technology  and simple accidents, the dumping of ammunition into the sea  occurred deliberately and maliciously--against the people and  against nature.    Until 1989, the USSR Ministry of Defense had a secret order  which permitted the dumping of ammunition into the sea. From  February to May 1956, chemical weapons were transported from  Obozerskaya Station in Arkhangelsk Oblast to Severodvinsk. They  were unloaded and dumped in the White Sea. A year later, similar  weapons were dumped around Spitsbergen. In 1960-61, from Saratov  Oblast to Pechenega came trainloads of bombs weighing 100  kilograms, 250 kilograms and 500 kilograms, of the 1939 vintage.  The bombs contained mustard gas, lysite and zarine. Later, using  Murmansk merchant marine vessels leased by the USSR Ministry of  Defense, those chemical weapons were sunk in the vicinity of  Novaya Semlya. Altogether, 183 trainloads of chemical weapons  were shipped out of Pechenega.    During the past 40 years, metal casings have rusted through.  Chemical weapons, like the genie from the fairy tale, got out of  the bottle. The star fish were first to feel it. At the Cape of  Dvina alone, 6 million of them were washed up. Then came the  turn of the humans. According to data provided by Correspondent  Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences A.Yablokov, advisor to  President B.Yeltsin on environmental issues, mortality around  Arkhangelsk has risen since 1991 by 10 percent.    At the bottom of the Baltic Sea lie between 100,000 tons and  300,000 tons of poisonous compounds, mainly zarine and mustard  gas. The Navy began sinking containers and weapons in the late  1940's, and continued until 1965. It was done mainly in the  vicinity of the Kristianse island and 56 miles south-west of the  town of Liepaja, at the depth of just a few dozen meters, in the  area of 780 square kilometers.    One shot of mustard gas diluted in 50 cubic meters of salt  water is capable of killing a horse. Specialists predict that  if, God forbid, the gas seeps out of the rusted casings and  shells, the total amount would be sufficient to kill the Baltic  Sea four times over. Danger threatens the 30 million people who  live along the shores of the Baltic. The deadline for the  weapons is drawing near: only 10 years remain. The number of  victims is already growing. Some 100 Danish fishermen became  disabled after catching old chemical shells in their nets. The  same happened to fishermen from Klaipeda. Who will be the next  victim? The sea often washes pieces of yellow phosphorus onto  the shore. God forbid you pick one up, mistaking it for amber.    Soviet strategists did not neglect other seas, either,  namely  the Barents and Karsk seas. Orders were issued to dump there  nuclear waste from nuclear-powered submarines. Containers with  liquid and solid nuclear wastes were transported on the same  Murmansk Merchant Marine vessels and dumped into the sea; as  they did not sink, they where blasted with assault rifles.  Somewhere here is the final resting place of the expired engine  from the nuclear-powered ice breaker Lenin.    According to Greenpeace, in the vicinity of Novaya Zemlya  lie  tens of thousands of containers with radioactive materials; the  Soviet Northern Fleet annually dumped into the sea 10,000 cubic  meters of liquid and 200,000 cubic meters of solid wastes in  different stages of nuclear decay. In the Karsk Sea, 13 to 20  Soviet nuclear reactors have been dumped, some still containing  nuclear fuel. Total radioactive pollution of the northern seas  by the Soviet Union reaches 2.2-3.2 million curie, which is  between 2 and 4 times higher than the level of harm caused to  the Atlantic by Western countries.    In May 1941, Soviet sailors dumped mustard gas, which was no  longer needed at military bases, into the Sea of Japan, not far  from Vladivostok, at the depth of only 1 kilometer.    On 9 October 1990 the Tsezar Kunikov was loaded at the port  of the Kamish-Burunskiy iron ore complex in Kerch with unused  ammunition. On orders from the technical administration of the  Black Sea Fleet, it was transported to the ship from one of the  military warehouses in Kerch. The environmental protection  agency wanted to intervene, but it was rebuffed. The cargo was  dumped in the Black Sea at the depth of 2 kilometers; according  to some data, it has been done more than once.    What has been done cannot be undone, says ancient  philosopher  Theognides. But what could be done is find out what had been  dumped, punish the guilty, forbid such actions in the future and  raise the weapons from the bottom of the sea and discharge them.  But the leadership of the former UkSSR State Committee on the  Environment (V.Filonenko, chairman; I.Lyakh, first deputy; and  V.Cherednychenko, head of the water resources protection  department) took no steps in that direction. Only an  investigative commission was set up, without informing either  the government or the press. A report was sent to Moscow, to the  USSR State Committee on the Environment, to Deputy Director  V.Kostrin, numbered 11-S and dated 26 February 1991. But there,  another reorganization was underway at the time and no answer  came to Kiev. (Former Admiral Kasatonov, commander of the Black  Sea Fleet, later officially admitted that weapons of a certain  type were dumped into the Black Sea, quadrant 72-73, without the  sanction of environmental protection authorities.)    Highly placed protectors of the environment in Ukraine  calmed  down. They kept their well-paid positions. For example, Lyakh  was not only a deputy minister but also chief state inspector  for environmental protection issues.    According to the Sevastopol newspaper OSTROV KRYM, in June  1942, on orders of Commander F.Oktyabrskyy, ``poisonous  compounds of military use''--mainly mustard gas--were dumped by  Soviet sailors in the Black Sea, around Kazachya Bukhta, at the  depth of up to 50 meters.    The terrible genie is buried at the bottom of the Black Sea.  In the Baltic and the White Sea it will come out in 10 years.  How long will it be for Ukraine?  <H5>  How One Admiral Scared Three Ministers </H5>   One day Podgornyy visited a submarine from the Northern  Fleet  and wrote down in the log: ``I was here. Very impressive.  Nikolay Podgornyy.'' But he would have been even more impressed  if he had stopped by the main base of the Black Sea Fleet.    Sevastopol harbor. Some 7,000 cubic meters of polluted water  and 10 tons of oil flowed into it every 24 hours. Estimate  damage: R328,000 at the prices of the time.    In the mid-1980s, there were 10 major oil spills. They cost  R211,000. In 1990 the damage rose to R1 million. Pollution in  the Sevastopol harbor surpasses the acceptable level by 30 to  100 times. In June 1988, it was 2,000 times above normal. Add to  this some 10 military boats and submarines, half-sunken and  rusting there.    Fleet fuel base at Inkerman. Who ever said that there are  shortages of oil in Ukraine? There is a veritable source here, a  magic lake the size of Independence Square in Kiev. And there is  even more under ground.    Where did it come from? At first, the Navy blamed the  Romans,  who supposedly stored the Greek fire here during the Second  Punic War. Then they put the blame on the Nazis. But the truth  is different. In the 1970s, some fool thought of storing oil in  abandoned mine shafts: an inexpensive and practical solution.  Apparently, he was even decorated for his ingenuity. But in time  the shafts developed cracks and the oil seeped into the sea.    And there is more. A proposal is being discussed to turn the  Sevastopol harbor into a terminal for shipping oil to foreign  money bags. Not only the harbor, but Lake Donuzlav, may be  polluted with oil.    The base at Inkerman has been poisoning the sea since 1904.  Especially strongly from the mid-1950's. But environmental  protection authorities discovered this only in the mid-1980's.  Incidentally, the famous Central Committee and USSR Council of  Ministers Resolution No. 42, dated 16 January 1976, ``On  Measures to Prevent Pollution of the Black and Azov Seas'' died  in infancy.    26 March 1976. The Navy supply ship Vasiliy  Golovin, upon leaving Artbukhta, secretly dumped sewerage. This  was noticed by some tourists who reported the incident to the  State Inspection for the Protection of the Black Sea. The  environmentalists confirmed: 24 kilos was dumped, and damages  amounted to R5,000. But they were not allowed onto the military  ship; the Navy itself wrote a report declaring the the Vasiliy  Golovin caused no harm to the sea.    Early 1992. The beautiful cruiser Moskva spilled  fuel into the sea. Fortunately, it did not form a film but  spilled as a wave. But, once again, no one was allowed to  investigate: the excuse of secrecy never failed. Meanwhile, the  military prosecutor's office was asleep. Its full official name  was the Military Prosecutor's Office of the Black Sea Fleet:  they would not be sticking their necks out.    Yu. Shcherbak, the former minister of environmental  protection of Ukraine, kept sending angry cables to the  commander of the Black Sea, but the old salt did not even blink.    The state spent considerable sums to equip Navy ships with  special containers for refuse, but the mighty Black Sea Fleet  has virtually no ships to collect them. Ships the world over  transfer their left-over fuel to special collection boats, but  the admirals have few of them, as well.    Soviet military boats, unlike Western ones, have no  environmental protection equipment and dump all their garbage  into the sea. While they often drive their sailors to exhaustion  by making them scrub the decks until they shine, mates, captains  and admirals at the same time successfully turn the Black Sea  into a cesspool.    The Sevastopol Navy Plant named after Sergo Ordzhonikidze,  the Iron Commissar, quietly dumped sulfuric acid into the  Chernaya river.    The navy wharf in Nikolaev, Plant imeni 61 Communards, was  building the flagship Komsomolets Ukrainy, the pride of the  Navy. The ship was not finished, but the Ingul river was  polluted with paint, diesel and oil.    The well-known resort Kuyalnik is harmed by the navy  installation in the village of Krasnosilka. The same happens in  Yevpatoria, Kerch, Feodosia, Balaklava, Khersones, Ismail and  Nikolaev, in short, everywhere where the Navy has a presence.    In the late 1980's, spurred on by perestroyka, two  ministers--D.Protsenko, the head of the UkSSR State  Environmental Protection Committee, and V.Tkach, the UkSSR  minister of water resources--entered into a mild confrontation  with Admiral Khronopulo, the commander of the Black Sea Fleet.  Please be so kind to forgive us, respected comrade admiral, for  disturbing you in your important work, but could you reduce just  a little the dumping of oil into the sea? Khronopulo paid them  no attention; on the contrary, he apparently ordered his  assistants to telephone Kiev and to cut the ministers down to  size. What does it matter, nature, if we are protecting the  sacred borders of our Motherland? The ministers held their  tongues.    But soon Dina Yosipivna Protsenko was caught up in the  Golsiyskyy forest scandal and was replaced by Viktor Lazarovych  Fidonenko, a man who had risen through the ranks of the  republic's agricultural industry sector. A new broom sweeps in a  new way, and the fresh minister, who had not yet suffered his  share of hard knocks, decided to set things straight on the  Black Sea. He sent one petition to Sevastopol, then another. He  also ordered his services to start catching old salts on the  spot, and fining them. This was the response he received from  the admiral:    Since 1989, the Special Inspection for the Protection of the  Black Sea, which is currently under your management, has started  to make claims and conduct investigations of the fuel base of  the Fleet for the purpose of extracting damages for the  pollution of the Sevastopol harbor with oil products.    This year, the fuel base has already received three claims  totaling R85,800, of which two were reviewed by the state  arbitrage commission of the Crimea Oblast (for R9,300), and one  by the state arbitrage commission of the UkSSR (for R76,500).    In September came yet another claim for the sum of R168,600;  another, for R250,000, is being prepared even though the special  reserve at the fuel base bears no responsibility for the  pollution of the sea with oil products and has experienced no  accidental spills...    Taking everything stated above into consideration, I request  that you, as the head of the UkSSR State Environmental  Protection Committee, take all objective circumstances into  account and order the Special Inspection for the Protection of  the Black Sea to DESIST from submitting complaints and suits  against the fuel base of the Fleet...    Systematic extortion of large monetary sums from the Fleet  for the alleged violations of water protection laws, which were  not, objectively, the result of the Fleet's activity,  catastrophically reduces the Fleet's ability to contribute to  the repair and construction of capital water protection  structures.    Please inform me of your decision.    Admiral M.Khronopulo, member of the Central Committee of the  Communist Party of Ukraine.    That was exactly how he signed it, member of the Central  Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, without any  ``respectfully yours.'' The hint was clear.    To poison the life of the environmental protection minister  further, he also complained to the Council of Ministers, to  Anatoliy Sergeevich Statinov. Viktor Lazarovych Filonenko bit  his tongue and began to fear Khronopulo, shifting his efforts to  the strengthening of friendly ties with foreign countries.    Incidentally, under the new minister of the Environmental  Ministry Yuriy Mykolayovych Shcherbak, the position responsible  for the protection of the sea disappeared. Out of sight, as the  saying goes.    As for Khronopulo, he began to ignore the environment  altogether. Of the R5.2 million of capital investment funds  allocated in 1990 to the Black Sea Fleet, he did not give a  kopek for the environment.    He postponed the construction of treatment plants in many  harbors to the period to the year 2005. At least in the past  they used to control oil spills from aircraft, but now this  practice was discontinued. And at Foros and other supersecret  resorts such overflights were never allowed.    Khronopulo has since retired, and has become a business  leader. Hold the flag high, Admiral.    March 13, 1991. In the Black Sea, at 44.08  northern latitude and 34.37 eastern longitude a heavy oil spill  is discovered. Apparently, it was another destoyer that got  washed. But while flights are coordinated with the military and  the papers signed, the spill moves into the resort area, which  are under special security protection and where  environmentalists are not allowed within a rifle shot.    Today, with the excuse of an ``unhealthy political situation  surrounding the Fleet,'' ships have become completely off limits  to environmental inspections; Sevastopol captains have now been  given a unique opportunity to paint the Black Sea an oil-black  color.    In the early days of the Russian Navy, legendary Admiral  Sinyavin issued a strict order forbidding the pollution of the  Don with refuse and sewerage. He understood that defense cannot  be the used as an excuse for spoiling the environment. His  modern heirs on the Black Sea, while constantly talking about  building up the glorious traditions of the Russian Navy, in  reality act differently.  <H5>  Dolphins as Torpedoes </H5>   The No.7 bus goes to Khersones, to Kazachya Bukhta. There,  at  the outskirts of Sevastopol, a supersecret Navy installation is  located, a dolphin aquarium. It opened in 1966. No money was  spared: a villa was built and imported equipment was installed.    The installation had two goals: two teach military science  to  dolphins and to entertain the powers that be. The Fleet  commander had his private yacht and dacha here. Next door was  the Central Committee's resort Foros. Brezhnev and Ustinov came  regularly, with their kids, friends and grandchildren, to admire  the dolphins. Very exotic.    The military goal presented greater difficulties. Dolphins  were drafted into military service by certain fishing boats  which received the sanction of local fishing inspections. Their  catching methods were barbaric, causing great losses. Sometimes  up to 80 percent of the catch was lost.    At the Sevastopol aquarium, some 50 dolphins, beluga whales  and sea lions began guarding navy bases and anchorages against  enemy commandos, clearing sea lanes of mines, searching and  lifting weapons from the bottom of the sea, destroying ships and  commandos and repairing river dams. The imperialist tricks had  to be guarded against not only on the ground and in the air, but  under water, as well.    The idea was as follows. Special buoys would be installed  along the perimeter of the base. A dolphin would swim to it,  press a button, get a fish and continue on. If it noticed enemy  divers, it would shoot at them with an explosive packet and get  away. An explosion--and the enemy commandos are no more. And  what about the dolphin?    The idea was barbarically stupid. What if the dolphin gets  ill or confused and blows up its own boat. Or shoots a wrong  diver? Each action provokes counteraction. Offensive weapons  produce defensive weapons. The enemy, suspecting a possible  attack from dolphins, seals, sea lions, the Loch Ness monster or  any other creature with a tail, may simply poison the given  section of the sea. Intelligent and kind dolphins, which have  been registered in the Red Book, and their friends would perish.  But the admirals do not care. The goal has been set, the task  has determined, the funds have been allocated. Let us go  fishing, to catch more dolphins.    According to our information, bases where sea animals used  to  carry out their military service, or where they may continue to  serve today, are spread throughout the former USSR: in the Far  East, in Murmansk Oblast and in the town of Dalniye Zelentsy,  where apparently experiments on seals were conducted.    It is sad that the evolution of our admirals' conscience  lags  behind the development of technology and the progress of reason.  The Americans have long given up on Navy dolphins. But not we.</p>

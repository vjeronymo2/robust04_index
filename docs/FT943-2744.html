			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hornby cuts losses slightly to Pounds 0.73m Hornby Group, the USM-quoted maker of toys and model products, reduced pre-tax losses slightly from Pounds 791,000 to Pounds 733,000 in the first half of 1994. Turnover rose from Pounds 8.12m to Pounds 8.54m with demand for both Scalextric and Hornby Railways ahead. Mr Malcolm Thomas, the chairman, said there were signs of a recovery in consumer spending, albeit slow, but the all-important Christmas trading period was difficult to predict. The Clever Cook toy oven was proving popular and the Gladiator range, based on the television programme, continued to sell well, he said. Losses per share were 5.4p (5.9p).</p>

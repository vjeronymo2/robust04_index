			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: BAe set the standard for winning defence contracts Sir, Your article 'BAe shareholders weigh up old guard's power' (February 14), is not alone in dwelling on the need 'to wean' the 'operating chiefs' of the British Aerospace defence business 'from their old cost plus ways'. As one who held senior positions for a number of years in that business may I set the record straight. It was the former Hawker Siddeley Aviation and British Aircraft Corporation that were combined through nationalisation in the late 1970s to form British Aerospace. In the early 1970s Hawker Siddeley management had launched the Hawk fighter trainer aircraft having won the project through competitive tender run by the Ministry of Defence. The Hawk contract was fixed price, covering both the development of the aircraft and the supply of the first production batches. Meanwhile, the management of BAC had entered the Anglo-French Jaguar and tri-national Tornado collaborative aircraft programmes at a time when collaboration was both unproven and considered in certain circles to be doomed to failure. Those policies and programmes predated British Aerospace but laid the foundations for the successes of the company throughout the 1980s and up to the present day. The defence management team not only delivered these products to our Royal Air Force but leveraged off of the programmes to win a series of highly successful export orders, none of which was cost plus. The UK defence equipment industry, including GEC Marconi, would not be in the position it is today had the British Aerospace defence team not won those orders. Whatever the causes of BAe's problems of recent years, management of its defence business is not one of them. The management team has comparable, if not more, experience in successful management of substantial fixed price contracts than any other major UK company.

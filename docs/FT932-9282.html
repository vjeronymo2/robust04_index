			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Yes or no, it's still war Whichever way it goes, the Danish referendum next Tuesday will leave Britain's Conservatives where they are now: at each others' throats. This thought will not disturb the sleep of many Danish voters. Their task is to decide whether their own country should adhere to the Maastricht Treaty. They are blessedly free of concern for the internal politics of the governing party in another country. The presence of Lord Tebbit and other Tory Europhobes on the streets of Copenhagen is an indicator of the strength of feeling in Britain, not Denmark. The three or four avowedly anti-Maastricht candidates who stood in last week's Newbury by-election were obliterated, wiped off the map, consigned to the hall of comic fame with the Monster Raving Loony 30 Year party. No wonder their like have fled across the water to try their passion on a Nordic electorate. They might as well have stayed at home. From what can be gathered at a distance, the Tory irreconcilables are only slightly more welcome in Denmark than would be, say, a gang of soccer hooligans straight out of Liverpool. We should, however, be charitable to the Tebbit bovver boys. They add hilarity to what might otherwise be suffocatingly dull proceedings. In British political terms there are only two possible outcomes to Tuesday's vote. Let us take the least likely first. A second Danish 'no' would stagger Europe, but it would not restore peace to the British Conservative party, at least not for long. The bill to ratify Maastricht would be withdrawn from the House of Commons on the ground that the Danes had exercised a decisive veto. Legally speaking, that would be correct. The politics of such an upset would be more complicated. There might be a short flurry of excitement, and some talk of Mr John Major's narrow escape, but that would soon pass. Far from being off any hook, the prime minister would stand amid the ruins of his European dream. Sooner or later France and Germany would announce the construction of a European union without Denmark, probably running parallel to but outside the edifice built on the Treaty of Rome. This might be based on the core of the Schengen group - the Benelux countries, plus France and Germany. It could soon attract up to 11 members if Britain stayed in the game, or 10 if it did not. That stark choice - to be or not to be one of the potential 11 - would rekindle the Conservative civil war and keep it going for years. Now try the opposite route. Reports from Copenhagen suggest that it is likely that the Danes will vote 'yes' on Tuesday. In the short run that could have an even more incendiary effect on the Conservatives. The third reading of the British bill would be eased through the Commons on Thursday, courtesy of Labour. The party of Mr John Smith, that unwavering defender of the European Community, plans to demonstrate its clear-headed and courageous adherence to European unity by abstaining. The effect will be to maximise and expose the rebellion among Conservatives. The subsequent passage of the bill through the upper house will doubtless be marked by fiery speeches from Lord Tebbit and Lady Thatcher. Once signed by the Queen it will be challenged in the high court on technical grounds. That should keep the Conservatives quarrelling among themselves through the summer, but the unlovely prospect does not end there. The second stage of the process leading to European monetary union formally starts on January 1 1994. The move to a single currency comes later. The work due in 1994-95 is merely preparatory to the real thing. It should be harmless, but if the present mood persists, the slightest hint of Britain's return to the exchange rate mechanism, or adherence to a European central bank, or anything else of the sort would deepen and widen the split in the Conservative party. It is important to be clear about the nature of the schism. Among back-benchers the hard-core Europhobes are as small in number as they are loud in voice. They are counterbalanced by a rather larger but relatively silent group of federalist Eurocentrics. These factions compete for middle-of the road Tory opinion. The government's post-Maastricht strategy is to win over all save the anti-European fanatics by stressing its role in tabling British proposals for the next intergovernmental conference on European union. That conference is due in 1996, shortly before or shortly after the next general election. Most of us have been too distracted by the general disarray in the government to pay full attention to its argument. Yet even this week it has been backed by a flurry of supportive words. On Monday the Conservative Group for Europe published The Positive Europe by a Europhile MP, Mr Ian Taylor. Mr Taylor, who has long served as parliamentary private secretary to Mr William Waldegrave, is perhaps a trifle over-enthusiastic. 'We are committed to the goal of economic and monetary union,' he writes, 'so let us come up with a way of getting there rather than implying that the Maastricht timetable will not work.' A further pamphlet of the 'John Major wuz right' sort emerged yesterday, this time from the Society of Conservative Lawyers. Its authors* stick closely to the government's line on the Maastricht Treaty. 'If a pup has been sold to the Danish people,' they argue, 'it was sold to them by the 'No' camp in the first Danish referendum.' Mr Douglas Hurd has also been doing his best. The EC, the foreign secretary told the Scottish Conservative party yesterday, 'is one of the foremost political achievements of the 20th century.' Nevertheless it apparently needs British guidance to be further improved, for Mr Hurd produced the familiar list of government proposals: enlargement to a community of 16 in 1995 and 20 five years later; more inter-governmental agreements, with different groups of countries assembling themselves for each deal; an emphasis on subsidiarity; a more accountable commission. It was a stout defence of Mr Major's treaty, unmarred by any indication of when Britain might return to the exchange rate mechanism. It is the best that Downing Street can do, but it might not be good enough to unite the Conservative party. *Pounds 3 from the Secretary, 21b Denbigh Gardens, Richmond, Surrey TW10 6EN</p>

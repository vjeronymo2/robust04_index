			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Ali Salim al-Bid, "president of the </F> Democratic Republic of Yemen," in Hadhramout, by Nichole  Tannuri, in London, on 7 June -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Tannuri] What is the truth  behind the Iraqi and Sudanese military assistance to north Yemen?    [Al-Bid] I believe that there is an attempt to reenact the  Gulf crisis in the Arabian Peninsula. There was an attempt to  let this crisis drag on after it had been contained in order to  drown the region in tension and instability. Some states have  clearly declared their stand. We hope they will not go too far  in dragging the area into more instability and destruction.    [Tannuri] Do you need military support and do you get any  such support from abroad?    [Al-Bid] Any man who fights needs certain capabilities. We  are defending ourselves with what we have. We will make every  possible sacrifice to defend ourselves at any price. We taught  the retreating invaders unforgettable lessons. They realized  that in the areas they tried to invade and in courageous Aden.  [passage omitted]    [Tannuri] Do you expect Arab and foreign states to recognize  your republic or does that recognition depend on the United  Nations?    [Al-Bid] We believe that charity begins at home. Our people  in Arab and Muslim states come first. I believe that the world  now knows what is happening in Yemen -- there is a conflict and  a cause. The proclamation of the Democratic Republic of Yemen  was based on principles I believe will be approved and backed by  many Arab, Muslim, and world states.    [Tannuri] Analysts believe that the south sought secession  when it turned out that most oil reserves were in the southern  parts of the country.    [Al-Bid] We knew about the oil before unity. We had  sufficient information. But oil never dissuaded us from seeking  unity. The oil is not new. What hindered the march toward  unity was the emergence of another venture that conflicted with  unity, whether Yemeni or collective Arab democratic unity. On  the one hand, there is an alliance between the mentality of the  military and the al- Ahmar [reference to Parliamentary Speaker  Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar] family gang and on the other there is  the fundamentalists who want to take the Arab nation to the  middle ages. We in Yemen and many parts of the Arab homeland  want to enter the 21st century with the entire world.    A last word. I hope the crisis that befell the Yemeni people  will stop at is current level. It is the Yemeni people and not  the advocates of war who are losing. I hope the United Nations  and international legitimacy will live up to their  responsibility to restrict that arrogant mentality by which  Sanaa rulers seek to force their will on the people. They are  bombarding areas of Aden indiscriminately and are trying to  destroy the economy and its foundations. The latest crime they  committed was shelling Aden's oil refinery twice. They are  still trying to do that. I hope reason will triumph. I also  hope capable states will succeed in putting an end to this. We  made contacts with all parties concerned. I believe they are  capable of ending this tragedy. What is taking place on the  ground must be monitored. Our task right now is to put an end  to the catastrophe by first observing a cease-fire and then  discussing future issues.    [Tannuri] Thank you.</p>

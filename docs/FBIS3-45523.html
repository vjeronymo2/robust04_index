			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Commentary" by XINHUA correspondent Zhang Jinsheng (1728 </F> 6930 0524): "1994 is a Crucial Year for China's Reform"]    [Text] Beijing, 2 Jan (XINHUA) -- China's reform of its  economic system will face many climaxes in 1994. It will be a  crucial year for China to comprehensively promote the economic  reform system and to make major breakthroughs in this regard.  If we consider reform in the 1980's mainly as dismantling the  old system -- or "demolishing old houses" -- then the main task  in the next-phase of reform will be establishing a new system,  or "constructing new buildings." Our current reform has begun  to deepen, shifting our focus from single items to comprehensive  and coordinated projects. We have shifted our attention to  establishing totally new economic relations in an all-round  manner rather than focusing on obtaining benefits from  relatively independent reform measures. Deepened reform dictates  that we have to wage arduous struggles to overcome tough  problems.    What are the major reform tasks facing us in 1994? According  to the State Economic Restructuring Commission, after a long  period of deliberation, study, and estimation, China will deepen  reform in various fields in 1994 and will make breakthroughs in  this regard. A series of reform programs includes macroeconomic  reform in taxation, finance, investment, the foreign trade  system, the enterprise system, social security, the housing  system, the public servant system, the system of salaries for  administrative organs and institutions, and prices. There are  two important points in the many reform tasks: 1) Proceeding  from changing operating mechanisms in state enterprises, we  should strive to renovate the enterprise system, and should  actively explore and seek effective ways to establish a modern  enterprise system. 2) We should accelerate reform in taxation,  finance, and the planning and investment systems, and we should  make key progress in formulating macro-regulatory and  controlling devices which are compatible with the requirements  of a market economy. While focusing our efforts on these two  main points, we should also make concerted efforts and speed up  the establishment of a market system with essential-factor  markets as the main form; we should expand and intensify reform  in the social security and housing system; we should accelerate  the pace of reform in the management of foreign trade and  foreign exchanges; and we should actively deepen rural reform.    By accomplishing these arduous reform missions, we aim to  fulfill the following three objectives:    -- We aim to establish a modern enterprise system whereby  the  requirements of a market economy are fulfilled, property rights  are specified, rights and duties are defined, government and  enterprises are separated, and scientific administrative methods  are enforced.    -- While specifically developing essential-factor markets,  we  aim to enhance a unified, open, competitive, and orderly market  system.    -- We aim to explore and establish positive and effective  state macroregulatory and controlling systems and policies, and  to formulate a set of statistical indicators for the national  economy and a system of laws and regulations so as to regulate  the total social demand and supply to remain basically balanced,  and to optimize the economic structure in an effort to guide the  national economy to progress in a sustained, rapid, and healthy  manner.    To accomplish these reform missions and fulfill the  formulated reform objectives, experts from various sectors held  that we must persistently implement the reform strategies in an  all-round and coordinated manner. We should not only carry out  reform as a coordinating component of the entire comprehensive  design, but should also consider the arrangement of every reform  measure in conjunction with the overall picture. China's reform  has entered a phase where we should tackle formidable problems.  Therefore, while implementing the strategies in an all-round  and coordinated manner, we should also seize opportunities in  reform and make major breakthroughs in various crucial links.  We should make special efforts to carry out certain reforms  which have crucial effects on transforming old systems into new  ones, which have a relatively major impact on the overall  situation, and which have certain adequate conditions.  Additionally, we should strive to make greater efforts in this  regard so as to achieve some breakthroughs. We should create  conditions for those reforms which lack adequate conditions  temporarily, and should actively enhance these conditions.  Otherwise we will most probably miss the strategic moment and  unnecessarily extend the transitional period of establishing a  new economic system, thereby eventually increasing the risks and  costs for reform. Responsible comrades of the State Economic  Restructuring Commission sharply pointed out that extensive  reform in 1994 is a complex and arduous systematic project. The  reform will be deep and extensive, involving the readjustment of  powers and interests in various sectors. To accomplish these  reform missions, on the one hand we should have confidence in a  definite victory and should be determined and unwavering so as  to be definitely victorious at the first fight. On the other  hand, we should also be adequately prepared psychologically for  probable difficulties, should uphold scientific designs, should  carefully conduct operations, and should promptly summarize  experiences so as to avoid major mistakes.    While analyzing favorable conditions for reforming the  economic system in 1994, economists held that, first, the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has further  specified the direction and objectives of reform; theories on  reform have been continually improved. Consequently, a  favorable political environment has been formed. Second, after  15 years of reform and opening up, China has accumulated  abundant reform experience which enables hundreds of millions of  people to conscientiously join in the great course of reform.  Reform has become more acceptable in people's concepts,  resulting in a more favorable social environment and receptive  public opinion. A gradual rise in the people's living standards  and their strong urge to seek new systems and new issues have  strengthened their enduring capacity for reform, thereby  resulting in a relatively favorable psychological reception.  After undergoing economic construction for several years and  rapid economic progress for the past two consecutive years,  China has considerably increased its comprehensive national  strength and has accumulated a certain level of material goods.  A strong domestic demand for investments and a steady but  rising demand for consumer goods have provided a relatively  strong "driving force for internal demand" for reform. All  these factors have contributed to a conducive economic  environment.    We are in a new historic era of reform. The establishment of  a socialist market economy, an unprecedented great event in the  history of mankind, requires that we properly perform this task  with unprecedented courage. That is why we said the year 1994  will be a glorious year for China's reform and opening up, and  will also be a year for China to make more leaps and bounds in  its economy.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Observer: Unappetising John Major ended his epic trip to South Africa with a private visit to a safari park yesterday, predictably insisting that any resemblance between him and a dodo was a ghastly mistake: 'I am not an endangered species,' he piped, a remark surely destined to find its home in the quote books alongside 'never had it so good' and 'there is no alternative'. Norma Major did her bit for wildlife, too, courtesy of knife and fork. She lunched at a well-known Johannesburg restaurant which specialises in traditional dishes such as crocodile, worms and boiled ox-tripe - not that she tucked into that sort of stuff. 'She was really nice but we didn't think she'd like them,' the proprietor remarked realistically.</p>

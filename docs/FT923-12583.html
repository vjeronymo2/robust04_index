			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Letter: Location of ECB less relevant than who wins the markets Sir, David Marsh's discussion of the battle over the site of the ECB ('No place for bank to call home', July 14) provides an excellent summary of the tale of four (or more) cities but it is clear that he also feels that the subject is given more attention than it really deserves. May I suggest that the real competition among Europe's cities is not for the ECB but for the markets themselves - a far more important prize. Does the location of the ECB affect the location of markets? The answer is probably not: indeed, if there is any correlation between the presence of a reputable central authority and extensive markets it stems from the role of that authority as supervisor and regulator, not as monetary controller. Hence London has developed well supervised markets over the years and its future strength depends upon restoring that reputation after recent problems. Equally, Frankfurt has been well behind in market development; hence the finance ministry's efforts to enhance Finanzplatz Deutschland while the Bundesbank has no supervisory role. At present it is undecided as to whether the ECB will play a supervisory role, so that its relevance to markets may be even less than that of many existing central banks. More important, over time the location of the ECB will become even less relevant as the very location of markets becomes more diffuse as markets increasingly switch from physical trading places to computer and telephone networks. Each city in Europe is likely to see the level of market trading increase as cities are able to link with each other; it is not a matter of the markets being in one place or another. The ECB, likewise, will in effect be located in all centres through the constituent central banks. Of course, just how many operating powers remain with each central bank remains to be seen; hence London's tactic of trying to be the operating arm a la New York Fed, if the ECB, as a policy making body, is located elsewhere. Meanwhile, in Edinburgh I suggest that the EC take the logical step of recognising that it is far too early to be siting an institution with an uncertain role and leave central bankers to continue their research, through the new European Monetary Institute, in Basle. By the time the ECB comes along, that central bankers' haven may well be located in the Community - if anyone still thinks location matters that much.

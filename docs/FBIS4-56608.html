			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In a surprising interpretation of the case  involving the finding of an arsenal in Buenos Aires Province's  delta region, President Carlos Menem yesterday admitted that his  life could have been in danger because he sometimes spends  weekends on an island owned by Mario Falak, a friend of his, not  far from where the arsenal was found. [passage omitted]    The government has minimized the possibility of an  ultra-rightist terrorist organization from the very beginning.    The police have only charged Alejandro Suchsdorf, owner of  the premises where the arsenal was found. Also involved in the  case was Marcelo Schetino, driver and guard of Military  Household Chief General Jorge Rearte.    Rearte is in charge of Menem's security. He said Schetino's  record is unblemished. The justice department could not indict  Schetino in this case and released him. Schetino, however, was  arrested again when Susana Louzao accused him of having  kidnapped her four years ago.    Menem said Schetino "confessed -- or at least suggested --  that the resources were part of the painted faced [carapintada]  cause." He added: "The police are investigating" whether this  individual is connected in any way with "those responsible for  blowing up the Israeli Embassy."    "When the arsenal was discovered and I said that perhaps the  carapintada rebels were involved, the people almost lynched me.  We must thoroughly investigate because the arsenal was  discovered on a stream that leads to a house of Mario Falak, a  friend of mine," Menem said. [passage omitted]    The president told Radio America reporters that you can  travel to the delta zone "by helicopter or boat," adding that  "he (Sucksdorf) had missiles that could blow up a helicopter or  a boat -- or even the president."

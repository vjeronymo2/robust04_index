			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: AGM told HTV makes good start to year Mr Louis Sherwood, chairman of HTV, told shareholders at the annual meeting yesterday that the year had started very well for the ITV broadcaster to Wales and the west of Eng-land. In the five months to the end of May airtime sales revenue rose by more than 10 per cent, against 7.5 per cent growth for ITV as a whole. Its share of total ITV revenue had now risen to more than 6.1 per cent compared with 5.9 per cent. Mr Sherwood was still taking a cautious view of the full year but said: 'I must reiterate that we are feeling very positive about every aspect of our business.' He also called for a new broadcasting act to deal with the anomalies of the 1990 legislation. At the meeting the company spelled out the progress made since the alliance was announced with Flextech and its parent organisation, United Artists European Holdings, which in turn is part of Tele-Communications of the US. A Pounds 2m contract for 20 months has already been signed to provide facilities and operational management for Wire TV, the UK cable television channel. Programme development contracts have been signed with both the US and European Discovery channels and there is the possibility of a number of high-volume programme supply agreements.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anastasiya Naryshkina under the ``Extra!'' </F> rubric: ``Face to Face With Cholera and Plague''; first three  paragraphs are boxed boldface SEGODNYA introduction]    [Text] As of 14 August, there were two persons with a  diagnosis of cholera in Moscow hospitals. This was reported to  Interfax in Moscow's main medical administration. One of the  patients is a vagrant who is in satisfactory condition at the  moment. The second patient is a female medical worker infected  by him. Physicians assess her condition as ``average severity  without signs of worsening.''    In addition to these two patients, ambulance teams and  internal affairs authorities have sent 10 persons who had been  in contact with the patients to Moscow infectious disease  hospitals.    As administration workers confirm, the threat of a  cholera epidemic for Moscow is no rarity. Each year, patients  infected in other countries are present in the city. In all  cases, medical personal have succeeded in localizing the focus  and avoiding any consequences for the city.  <H5>  The ``Osoboopasniki'' </H5>   ``Cholera,'' said Tamara Ivanovna with enthusiasm, ``is so  beautiful!'' and stepped away from the microscope. Tamara  Ivanovna heads the laboratory of highly dangerous infections in  the Moscow City Center of the Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight  [Note: ``highly dangerous'' is the English equivalent of  osoboopasnyy, which is the word from which  osoboopasniki (persons working with highly dangerous  diseases) is derived]. Working under her are several women who  are not very young. Their sphere of activity is plague, cholera,  tularemia, anthrax, and other scourges of mankind. The scourges,  it is true, sit quietly in Petri dishes (more is smeared on  saucers) fixed to the bottom by something yellow. After handling  the dishes, you rub your hands carefully with pure alcohol,  however. In critical cases, when it is necessary to process  entire sacks of infected rodents, the women dress in complete  antiplague suits: rubber overshoes, long gowns with ties instead  of buttons, gloves, masks, and goggles.    In the laboratory there is silence (most of the people are  not on leave) and remarkable cleanliness. The latter is due to  the efforts of the sole elderly female medical orderly. There  should be six on staff, but there are is only half the  physicians and laboratory workers needed (3 and 3 instead of 6  and 6). And all of them clean their own offices and valuable  laboratory.    At one time, the laboratory was a privileged place.  Associates received a 20 percent raise their second year of work  here, a 30 percent raise their third year, and a 40 percent  raise in subsequent years. For this reason, it was mostly women  who had to keep their relatives who became ``osoboopasniki.''  And it is just such women who work here now, even though the  privileges have long since become only a memory: They only  received their salaries for May and June (20,000-30,000 rubles  each) in July.  <H5>  A Strike as a Means of Easing the Soul </H5>   I saw Tamara Ivanovna for the first time in the reception  room of Moscow's chief public health physician.    ``This is the third time I have come,'' she complained to  the  secretary. ``I wait and wait and I leave. One hundred thousand  indeed, it's a joke!''    It is being demanded that T.I. pay 100,000 for a minor  repair  in the laboratory. For both her and the chief physician, this is  big money that they simply do not have. And how! Only 8 of the  55 million rubles needed for major repair of the Moscow  Sanitary-Epidemiological Station has been allocated, and of the  37 million rubles needed for equipment, they only gave 1.4.  T.I., feeling sorry for the chief physician like a woman,  dragged out the moment of signing the paper with an enormous  figure -- 100,000. Since April, the Moscow City  Sanitary-Epidemiological Station has not paid for its  electricity -- there is no money. From time to time, the Moscow  Regional Power Administration phones the chief physician and  threatens to cut off the electricity. ``You might get  cracking!'' answers chief physician Filatov. For now, the Moscow  Regional Power Administration is putting itself in his position,  but who knows what will happen from one month to the next. ``And  indeed I cannot stop. I cannot tell the mother of a child who  became ill in the Pioneer camp that I have no gasoline to go to  him.''    Because of a lack of money, 10 district  sanitary-epidemiological stations and the Moscow city center  nearly went on strike. In any event, they convened a strike  committee, organized a meeting, and invited a person from the  ``higher-ranking body'', i.e., the Russian Federation State  Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, to it. The  guest heard in silence that the sanitary-epidemiological station  laboratory assistant in the Southern district earns 8,000 a  month, that each day he can only buy a loaf of bread and carton  of milk, that that costs 6,000, and that for his 8,000 the  laboratory assistant performs up to 500 diptheria analyses daily.    They say there was a deathly silence in the room and a  resounding shout on the platform.    Almost no one seriously intended to strike, however. Chief  physician Filatov told me this even before the strike committee  meeting. Moreover, one of the district sanitary-epidemiological  stations that stopped operating was threatened with general  discharge. The most interesting thing is that the threat worked  -- evidently, the one who wanted to leave had already left.    In 2 years, the sanitary-epidemiological station system has  shriveled by half: Only 42 percent of its schedule-stipulated  staff now work in it. The epidemiologists have found jobs at  rayon polyclinics, where they earn twice as much.    Would it be difficult to create the sanitary-epidemiological  station system anew? Filatov, an epidemiologist by education,  thinks, ``I only felt like a specialist 5 years after beginning  to work. That is, beyond all the papers and figures, I see the  cause of this epidemiologic situation or that.''  <H5>  Laboratory Life </H5>   Tamara Ivanovna did not speak at the meeting. I spoke with  her several days later. ``Across from us are a produce center  and a rubbish heap located so that, from our window, I can see  when and what they throw out...At first, I let it pass, but then  I watched. It was as if something appeared on the table near my  associates. They cut up a rotten cucumber and ate it, and they  brought it to their children, if only for some vitamins. And I  closed my eyes...And they invited me, ``Take some Tamara  Ivanovna.'' I could not take it from them''.    ``We must earn money somehow. One instance of this is  enough,'' I said carefully, ``we must introduce paid services.''    ``Yes, in many sanitary-epidemiological station laboratories  (let us say in those where they perform AIDS tests) it is  possible to perform contract jobs and receive a total of  100,000-200,000 each.''    ``But we are the osoboopasniki. How can I take money from  someone because he is suspected of having tularemia? The Moscow  hospitals that have reached agreements with the Moscow Municipal  Sanitary-Epidemiological Station pay 700 rubles per analysis, of  which the laboratory receives 25 percent. But in the past few  years, despite this ``very ridiculous price,'' the hospitals  have been trying to get by without this ``luxury'' and have cut  the number of patients screened to a tenth.''    ``In one quarter the laboratory earned 10,000 rubles for  such  analyses.''    ``And finally,'' says T.I., ``I let all this money go on  ``charity'' dinners. The little girls buy bread and preserves.  We have a kitchen here...''    The ``little girls'' are actually not very fortunate women  who have sick husbands or parents and who sweep for themselves  and others. One of them, a mother of two small children, asks  T.I. for leave and collects and sells bottles. T.I. permits it  even though she generally does not forgive even a minute's  tardiness or early departure: ``We must not slack off, we are  osoboopasniki.'' But she hardly needs to tell her small group of  people. Judge for yourself.    A man who just flew into Moscow yesterday turned up at the  hospital with a suspicion of cholera. If the ``osoboopasniki''  give a positive answer, the operations section of the  sanitary-epidemiological station (also, moreover, women who are  not even between 30 and 40 years of age but increasingly of  retirement age) will seek out all persons who came into contact  with the patient in Moscow and all those who flew in the same  aircraft with it, no matter where in the former Union they may  be. A round-the-clock watch will be established, and infinite  analyses will begin.    ``They simply forget that they have families and children --  indeed, this is cholera! In the morning, after a sleepless  night, after having seen that the others can't manage, these  women voluntarily remain for a second day. And sometimes I ask  everything of them. They are simple irreplaceable people.''    They are truly downright irreplaceable. In any case, no one  is dying to be an ``osoboopasnik.'' I well understand those who  after having called in response to one of the advertisements  Tamara Ivanovna has taped up (``Urgent Need for Physicians,  Laboratory Assistants, Medical Orderlies''), quickly excuse  themselves and hang up after hearing that they must deal with  those things that are most repulsive to women -- strange  diseases, mice, and the smallest of salaries. ``To not smell the  smell of decaying mice, burn the cotton wadding, but vomit  anyway. Imagine, there stand dozens of deliveries with hidden  rodents, and in every little carcass the heart, liver, lymph  nodes, and bone marrow must be found. One must be a very healthy  person to perform such work.'' T.I. also began as a laboratory  assistant.    ``I have always said: When my nerves are at their breaking  point, I will return to the laboratory. I would very much like  to leave management and work there with the rank and file. But  there is no one left besides me. As soon as I earned my pension,  I went to Shestopalov (the former chief physician) with my  notice, and he said to me, ``You what?! We are rebuilding the  laboratory...''    ``And now it has been rebuilt -- and it is a pity to quit:  this laboratory is beautiful. And the office! My former office  was not a separate office. They were all in one room...But there  is a great deal of work, and it is always like being on a powder  keg. And it is very difficult to hold a collective in hand.''    ``How are you able to do it?''    ``Truly, the conscientiousness of my workers helps. And  then,  my strength is some sort of authority. I can win. I tell them:  ``We are comrades not self-seekers, not businessmen but medical  workers.''</p>

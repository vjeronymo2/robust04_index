The ASC said yesterday that Mr Goward, at present involved in bankruptcy proceedings, had received a summons to appear in court on April 11. Mr Goward was charged with making a statement likely to induce the purchase of Westmex shares, it added. The ASC alleges he made a statement in writing on Westmex letterhead. . . 'which he ought reasonably to have known was false or misleading in a material particular'.</p>

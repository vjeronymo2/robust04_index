			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Former OCP chief may appeal MR Jean-Pierre Duche, the former president of Office Commercial Pharmaceutique, France's largest medicines wholesaler, is considering appealing against the conduct of the annual meeting last Friday when he was ousted from office. Mr Duche, who was voted out of office during a six-hour meeting, had supported a FFr2.12bn (Dollars 378.6m) friendly takeover by Gehe, Germany's largest wholesaler. Mr Duche has been replaced by Mr Pierre Bourely. Mr Bourely, whose family owns 15 per cent of the OCP, has opposed the Gehe offer and is attempting to put together a French counter-bid. The departure of Mr Duche will allow Mr Bourely to declare the German bid hostile. He claims the FFr800 a share offer is too low. During Friday's turbulent meeting, a number of shareholders were disqualified for not registering their votes in time. In addition, the Bourely family had undertaken not to present a motion for the removal of Mr Duche. Fidelity, the US investment group which owns 9.79 per cent of OCP, decided not to abstain at the last moment and voted against Mr Duche. In the key vote, Mr Duche gained 861,000 votes, while there were 1,064,000 against him. Mr Duche, OCP's president for 15 years, continues to be a member of the boards of two holding companies, SGP and Eurosante. These control OCP France Repartition and OCP Europe, two OCP subsidiaries responsible for 90 per cent of its FFr33bn turnover. Meanwhile, Mr Bourely, together with Paribas, the Paris-based merchant bank, has until the middle of April to put together a counter-bid for OCP. The consortium is attempting to raise between FFr1.5bn and FFr2.5bn.</p>

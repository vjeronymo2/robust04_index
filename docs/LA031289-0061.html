			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Nearly 200 chanting and singing anti-abortion demonstrators, part of a  nationwide coalition known as Operation Rescue, were arrested outside  California abortion clinics in Oakland, Fresno and Chico. About 100 people were  seized in Fresno, with more than 80 arrested at the Feminist Women's Health  Center in Chico and seven arrests were reported at the Oakland clinic. There  were also demonstrations at two Sacramento abortion clinics but no arrests were  reported. Police also arrested about 150 members of Operation Rescue in  Pittsburgh, Pa., and 125 in Milwaukee for blocking entrances to abortion  clinics. Protests reportedly were building toward major nationwide  anti-abortion demonstrations planned for Easter weekend, with Los Angeles a key  target.  </P></p>

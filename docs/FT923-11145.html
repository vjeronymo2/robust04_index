			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / People: Swanson finds a home at Tay John Swanson, who was forced to resign as chairman and chief executive of Barratt Developments 12 months ago, is back building houses. He has been appointed managing director operations of Tay Homes, the Leeds-based housebuilder which seems to be weathering the recession better than many of its rivals. There is a certain irony about Swanson's arrival at Tay Homes. Not only is the company in a much healthier condition than Barratt, but its two founders  -chairman Trevor Spencer and chief executive Norman Stubbs - started Tay after Barratt took over their old company, Bracken Construction, in the early 1970s. 'Trevor and I were against the takeover,' says the 50-year-old Stubbs. So they decided to set up on their own when Barratt took over. They still own 27 per cent of Tay which went public in 1983. Although the 1,000 houses a year that Tay builds is small by comparison with Barratt's 5,000, Tay has avoided paying too dearly for land. Swanson, 45, was ousted from the Barratt boardroom last year following a Pounds 106m loss, most of which resulted from the need to write down the value of the company's land bank. Stubbs says that Swanson was a 'victim of circumstances'. He had kept in contact over the years and took him on as a consultant after he left Barratt. 'We needed some more help and John was the ideal chap,' says Stubbs. Swanson will be in charge of day-to-day operations and, in particular, will be concerned with the development of the subsidiary companies in Glasgow, Leeds, Cheshire, Leighton Buzzard and Plymouth. The arrival of Swanson means that Stubbs, and the 60-year-old Spencer, will be able to spend more time formulating group policy.</p>

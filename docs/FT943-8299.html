			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / US warns over UN role in Bosnia The US expects the British and French governments to come under increasing domestic pressure to withdraw their peacekeeping troops from Bosnia, if the embargo on supplying arms to Bosnia is lifted this year. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, made clear that removing the embargo had long been the logical consequence of failure to reach a peace agreement. 'It will be time to ring up the sums,' he said. He implied that this would include questioning the viability of the UN peacekeeping presence in Bosnia, if fighting were to escalate with a resupplying of the Bosnian army. The thrust of his comments on Bosnia suggests that the US will no longer be sympathetic to the case most forcefully expressed in the past by the UK government - that maintaining the UN peacekeeping presence was essential to humanitarian operations. However, western diplomats in Washington noted that the UK government has also said that anything that changes the impartial role played by the 3,500 British troops could lead to withdrawal. France might be more ready to pull out its roughly 4,000-strong contingent but the UK had been 'prepared to do another winter' unless there were multilateral agreement to withdraw the peacekeeping force. The US administration's Bosnia policy is now constrained by a deal done with the Senate last week. This gives the Bosnian Serbs until October 15 to sign the territorial agreement proposed by the five-nation 'contact group', failing which Mr Clinton is committed to ask the UN Security Council to approve a multilateral end to the embargo by October 31. If that proves unsuccessful, an amendment sponsored by Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, requires the president to lift the embargo unilaterally by November 15. This buys the administration time but imposes deadlines which Mr Clinton may not easily escape, given congressional sentiment. Mr Christopher emphasised the value of the co-operation achieved this year on Bosnia by the US, Britain, France and Russia. He and the president prefer a multilateral lifting of the embargo so as to preserve solidarity and not to have called into question UN embargoes on Iraq, Libya and Haiti.</p>

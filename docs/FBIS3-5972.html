			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Mar 10, (ANTARA) -- President Suharto  reiterated here on Thursday that he will remain in the  presidential office until the end of his tenure in 1998. "I will  remain in office until 1998. I must not step down on the way.  Only after I deliver my accountability (before the people's  congress) will I step down," He was quoted by the Indonesian  Ulemas Council (MUI) Chairman Hasan Basri as saying.    Hasan Basri together with Azhar Bashir, chairman of the  Islamic Organisation Muhammadiyah and Ilyas Rukiat of the  Islamic Propagation Council (DDI), met with the president to  discuss problem on how to determine the first day of the Arabic  Shawal month, 1414 Hegira. Basri said that the president  reiterated the remarks in response to the concern of Moslems in  the country that he will step down before his tenure of  presidential office is completed in 1998.    Moslems in Indonesia raised concern over the matter  following  the remarks of a US author, Donald Wilson, who said in Jakarta  recently that Suharto knew well when he steps down. Wilson's  remarks provoked speculations that President Suharto will step  down before his term of office is completed, the MUI chairman  said. "Please do not try to engineer unclear things," the  president was quoted by Hasan Basri as saying.    The president said that the People's Consultative Assembly  (MPR) will find the correct new president in the future. "It is  illogical if the MPR cannot elect a new president among the 180  million," the president told the Ulemas.    On the occasion the president expressed hope that Ulemas  would reach a common consensus on the first day of Shawal, 1414  Hegira. He asked the Ulemas to make their best in order that  Moslems in the country can celebrate and say their 'id al-fitr  prayers on the same day. In the past years, there had been  differing views among the Ulemas on the first day of Shawal that  Moslems celebrated it not on the same day.</p>

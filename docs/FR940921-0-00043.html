			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA response to comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Agency agrees that, while current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gaseous-fueled vehicle technology is generally capable of meeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the emission standards contained in today's rule, work remains in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some cases to meet the durability requirements. While the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that some current gaseous-fueled engine technologies are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capable of demonstrating the required emissions durability, it does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not believe this is the case with some of the newest technologies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being developed. Given that each engine family must demonstrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> durability during the new vehicle certification process, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that not providing adequate leadtime may hinder the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further development of new gaseous-fueled vehicle technology in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> short term, which is contrary to the stated intent of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, today's requirements for new vehicles and engines will take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect with the 1997 model year as requested by some commenters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers will have the option to comply with these provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to the 1997 model year if they choose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency does not believe that this amount of leadtime will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be a problem from an environmental standpoint for two reasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, the volume of new gaseous-fueled vehicles produced prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 1997 model year is not expected to be that large, given the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relatively young nature of the new gaseous-fueled vehicle market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the Agency expects that any new vehicle or engine family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which might be sold in any significant volume prior to the 1997  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> model year would have demonstrated adequate durability. Since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is much incentive for early compliance in the form of CAFE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits and the emissions banking and trading program, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would expect the manufacturers of these vehicles to certify them in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to take advantage of these credits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the Agency does not believe that it is required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide four years leadtime for new gaseous-fueled heavy-duty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine standards because these standards are being promulgated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the general authority of section 202(a)(1). However, as will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be discussed in the section on CO and crankcase emissions, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency has elected to provide four years of leadtime in the case of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crankcase emission controls. For further discussion of the four  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year leadtime issue please consult the summary and analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments document in the docket. Finally, manufacturers have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option of complying with these requirements prior to their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date (including certification retroactive to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning of the 1994 model year) and can include such certified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines in the averaging, banking and trading program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Standards for HC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. NMHC vs. THC Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of the proposal: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Since natural gas is primarily methane,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> natural gas-fueled vehicles (NGV) tend to have fairly high levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of methane emissions in their exhaust HC. Due to the difficulty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current catalyst formulations have in oxidizing methane, it is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently feasible for NGVs to meet the same THC standards that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other vehicles meet. Thus, only NMHC standards were proposed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGVs, with the Agency deferring any action on THC standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGVs until such time as the necessary methane control technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be developed. LPG fuel, however, contains no methane, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhaust methane levels associated with LPG vehicles tend to be much  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closer to those from petroleum-fueled vehicles. Thus, all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable THC and NMHC standards were proposed for LPG vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of the comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Agency's decision to defer action on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> THC standards for NGVs received very broad support. Only the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers of Emission Controls Association (MECA) disagreed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with this approach. MECA contended that without some form of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology-forcing THC standard for NGVs, most work on methane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control technology would likely stop. MECA also pointed out that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency has, in the past, used technology-forcing standards as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impetus for the development of new emission control technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters suggested that the approach of exempting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGVs from THC standards should be applied to LPG vehicles as well,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> citing a potential unfair advantage for NGVs if LPG vehicles were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to meet THC standards. Additionally, the LP Gas Clean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fuels Coalition stated that LPG vehicles have substantially higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels of methane emissions than their petroleum-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> counterparts, and thus should also be exempt from meeting the THC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. The Coalition, however, did not submit any data in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support of this claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA response to the comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Agency continues to believe that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action on the THC standards for NGVs should be deferred. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency continues to be concerned that compliance with the THC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard currently in place for other fuels is infeasible for NGVs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Agency has received data suggesting that the THC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards are technically achievable for NGVs, no data has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted concerning the cost of refining and implementing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary technology on a commercial level. Cost is a component of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasibility, and without cost information the Agency cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclude that compliance with the THC standards is feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, technical issues remain to be resolved. The data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggesting that THC standards are technically achievable was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited to vehicles operating at a stoichiometric fuel/air ratio,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and operation under other conditions ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  lean burn) remains an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue. Additionally, the durability of methane-specific catalysts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remains an unknown.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, for the reasons explained in the proposal, EPA does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe it can establish a technology-forcing standard. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continues to believe that the amount of lead-time required for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate technology development still cannot be readily determined,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the durability of a methane catalyst formulation has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been established. EPA does not agree that the absence of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology-forcing standard would bring work on methane control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology to a stop. The engine manufacturing industry has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated that its research will continue based on the belief that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> THC standards will be imposed in the future. Also, as noted in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal, EPA believes that strong growth in the NGV market in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> near-term is important to provide resources for technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development. Of course, EPA will continue to monitor work on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methane catalyst development. If information becomes available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishing the technology's feasibility (including cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information), EPA will consider adopting THC standards for NGVs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, if future events further demonstrate the need for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology-forcing standard, EPA will further consider this option  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As was stated in the NPRM, the Agency believes it most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to, wherever possible, apply the same standards to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative-fueled vehicles that apply to their petroleum-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> counterparts. In the case of NGVs there are circumstances, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed above, which justify deviating from this basic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> philosophy. However, the Agency has seen no emissions data which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would suggest that a similar set of circumstances exists for LPG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles. Thus, LPG vehicles will be required to meet the same THC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards as currently apply to other vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

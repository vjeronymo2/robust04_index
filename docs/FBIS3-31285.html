			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by J.B.L.: "Solidarity Should Join In; </F> Negotiations With Trade Unions on Social Guarantees"]    [Text] The government positively assesses the  readiness by the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union  "Solidarity" to conduct talks, declared in a letter from the  trade union's chairman, Marian Krzaklewski, to Prime Minister  Waldemar Pawlak, Deputy Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz  said during Saturday's [12 February] session by the presidia of  the Council of Ministers Economic Committee [KERM] and of the  Council of Ministers Sociopolitical Committee [KSPRM].    According to Cimoszewicz, it would be best if Solidarity  joined the negotiations which are already taking place with the  other trade union centers. The negotiations will continue  regardless of whether Solidarity decides to participate in them  since there are many partners for the talks, and they are  sufficiently responsible partners, too. Yet, the presence of  Solidarity "would be a very good thing to happen," Cimoszewicz  stressed.    Labor Minister Leszek Miller said the government is  interested in meeting Solidarity postulates, but it is the  parliament and not the government that decides on the rate of  legislative proceedings; therefore the postulate to have a batch  of laws on enterprises enacted by 15 March should not be  addressed to the government (which is interested in speeding up  the proceedings within the framework of ordinary legislative  measures).    According to chiefs of six working groups in which the  negotiations with the trade unions are going on currently  regarding citizens' social guarantees, it is possible to reach  concrete agreements within the next few weeks, among others  regarding family benefits and housing supplements. For  instance, the idea of withholding family benefits from people  with high incomes is being debated, as well as the idea of  linking the amount of the benefit with the number of children  and income levels.    The presidia of KERM and of KSPRM said the negotiations are  difficult, but they relate to issues which are strictly of  merit, among them the fundamentals of social policies and also  social protections. According to Deputy Prime Minister  Cimoszewicz, the government had submitted specific proposals and  it is waiting now for reasonable responses; the government is  also determined to undertake measures that will facilitate a  speedy coming to agreement.    The participants of the negotiations are to receive a draft  of the socioeconomic program for the years 1994-97, which was  prepared by the Central Planning Administration.</p>

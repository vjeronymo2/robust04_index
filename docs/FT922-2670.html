			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Amber Day downgrades forecast - Two directors to leave board as group reports trading levels below expectations AMBER DAY, the discount retailer, yesterday combined a profits warning with news of the resignation of the group's finance director and only non-executive director, both within a year of joining the group. The shares closed 4p lower at 58p. However, the shares - which reached 129p last November - had already fallen 5p to 62p on Friday, ahead of a press report on Sunday which forecast the profits downgrade and boardroom departures. Amber Day said yesterday the board had committed itself to splitting the roles of Mr Philip Green, the group's controversial chairman and chief executive. Last year the group more than trebled pre-tax profits to Pounds 10.1m, thanks mainly to its acquisition in 1990 of the What Everyone Wants discount chain, operating in Scotland and the north of England. The official statement said trading for the second half of the current year, to August 2, had not come up to budget and full-year profits would be below stockbrokers' current expectations. Analysts yesterday accordingly reduced their forecasts from Pounds 14m-Pounds 15m to about Pounds 12m. While gross margins had increased, the group said sales levels had suffered from the sluggish retail environment and unusually poor weather conditions in Scotland this spring. Profits would suffer from a decline in sales on a like-for-like basis and non-recurring costs of about Pounds 500,000. However, the group remained confident of the underlying strength of the core discount retailing business and strong cash flow. It, therefore, intended to recommend a final dividend for the year of 3.1p (2.4p) per share, an increase of 14.8 per cent. Mr Graham Coles, who joined the group as finance director last June, is leaving to become finance director of First Leisure, the hotels and leisure operator. Amber Day said it was currently interviewing a short list of prospective candidates to succeed Mr Coles, who would remain until after his successor was appointed. Also announced was the departure of Mr Leslie Warman, a former director of Lloyds Merchant Bank, who joined as the group's only non-executive last July. The board said it was actively seeking a replacement. Amber Day's shares have suffered from bear raids and a personalised whispering campaign against Mr Green. Analysts said that, although the combination of yesterday's announcements was unfortunate, they did not in themselves seem to reveal any fundamental weakness in the group's business. However, they added that sentiment in the shares was unlikely to recover until Mr Green had demonstrated he could work - probably as chief executive  -alongside someone with a solid track record in the City. Mr Green was not available for comment yesterday. People, Page 18</p>

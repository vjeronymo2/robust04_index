			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Bass's profits rise of 16.5% to Pounds 501m falls short of expectations BASS, the brewing, hotels and leisure group, fell short of market expectations yesterday in spite of a 16.5 per cent increase in full-year pre-tax profits to Pounds 501m. Shares fell 15p to close at 585p as Mr Ian Prosser, chairman, said he expected no improvement in tough trading conditions before late summer next year. 'There are signs that the American economy may be moving in the right direction but . . . we have seen false signals in this respect in the past two years,' he said. 'In the UK, we do not see any such signs.' Market sentiment was further depressed by evidence of damage inflicted by the UK recession and the government-enforced disposal of pubs. A property revaluation has led to a write-down of Pounds 496m, 13 per cent of total property value and about half of the surplus recorded in the 1989 revaluation. The sale of 1,213 pubs during the year contributed to a 24.5 per cent decline in pub operating profits but Bass recouped the lost beer volumes with gains in the free pub trade and take-home market. Earnings per share for the year to September 30 grew 8.3 per cent to 39.6p; a final dividend of 13.65p raises the total payment to 18.9p, an increase of 6.2 per cent. The accounts include exceptional charges of Pounds 75m for rationalisation and reorganisation costs in the brewing and pub divisions; and an extraordinary credit of Pounds 91m mainly from surpluses on pub disposals. Group operating profit declined 1.5 per cent to Pounds 612.1m (from Pounds 622.7m) on turnover reduced from Pounds 4.38bn to Pounds 4.31bn. Profit contribution from brewing operations rose 13.5 per cent to Pounds 210m on turnover of Pounds 1.59bn, 3.2 per cent ahead. Volume sales to the free pub trade grew 9.8 per cent; sales to the take-home trade rose 5.2 per cent. Overall, volumes declined 1.7 per cent against a market fall of 2.9 per cent and market share increased marginally. Pub retailing profits were Pounds 57m lower at Pounds 174m after the disposal programme, which accounted for about Pounds 40m of the reduction. Capital expenditure on refurbishment and information systems totalled Pounds 110m. Holiday Inn hotels achieved a 12.4 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 116m.

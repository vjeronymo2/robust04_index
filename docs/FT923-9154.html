			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling/D-Mark hits new low STERLING yesterday dipped to its lowest level against the D-Mark since Britain joined the European exchange rate mechanism, as traders grew increasingly disenchanted with the prospects for the UK economy, writes James Blitz. In early London trading, the D-Mark firmed against most European currencies as dealers feared the results of another opinion poll on how the French will vote in their referendum on the Maastricht treaty on September 20. As it turned out, the poll showed a slight majority in favour of ratifying the treaty, with 56 per cent saying they would vote 'yes' and 44 per cent saying they would vote 'no'. But the result proved too inconclusive for most dealers, and the German currency drifted further upwards. The pound was the worst hit, dropping to a low of DM2.8247 and finishing a pfennig down on the day at DM2.8250. Traders said there had been a spate of heavy corporate selling of sterling in recent days. Underlying this was deepening gloom about the UK economy, including more bad news about the state of the UK housing market. The Nationwide Building Society's recent survey showing that house prices had fallen on average by 0.6 per cent in July is one of several indicators making sterling investors more bearish. The UK currency's slide may be halted in forthcoming days for several reasons. First, the pound is at its lower limits against both the Portuguese escudo and the Spanish peseta in the ERM. In the last two days, the Bank of Portugal has bought sterling to keep the pound within its limits, slowing down its descent against the D-Mark. Traders have also reported that the Bank of England is lightly intervening in the market to keep the pound above its lows. Friday's US non-farm payroll figure for July may also ease tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism. Analysts believe that this should show a big rise in US employment, by around 100,000, firming the dollar towards DM1.50. This, in turn, would weaken the D-Mark in intra-European Monetary System trading, making sterling's position more comfortable. Yesterday, dollar/D-Mark trading was confined to narrow ranges as the market awaits Friday's jobs figure. The US currency closed fractionally up on the day in London at DM1.4760. In New York it ended higher at DM1.4815. The D-Mark finished at FFr3.3800 in Europe after a previous FFr3.3780 and at L756.5, up from L755.9. One analyst suggested that Italy's reduction in its discount rate earlier this week may prove to be premature. 'If the government's budget measures are not implemented and the coalition has more difficulties, the cut may have to be reversed,' he said.</p>

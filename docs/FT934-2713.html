			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / How To Spend It: Small but perfectly formed Orford and Swan is a small British company which concentrates on making a few products to exceptionally high standards. It makes silk scarves in pure silk jacquard crepe-de-chine or in luscious twill. Photographed left is the gloriously rich Medallion in black and dark red. Then there are shoes such as those also in the photograph left which are made from the same richly patterned pure silk jacquard as the scarf. They are perfect for indoor evening wear, they look particularly good when teamed with black. There are also waistcoats, bow-ties and braces for chaps. There are, of course, much grander, more established names in the world of must-have scarves but Swan and Orford seems to be establishing a very English niche, all of its own. The best selection of shoes and scarves can be seen at Space NK, Thomas Neals, 41 Earlham Street, London WC2 and at Fortnum &amp; Mason, Piccadilly, London W1. The shoes are about Pounds 125 a pair and the scarves about Pounds 145 each. The cashmere silk shawls are a real luxury at about Pounds 325 and can be found at Harrods while Liberty of Regent Street and Sogo of Piccadilly sell the scarves and waistcoats (Pounds 252 each). For a small full-colour brochure which shows the full range and for further stockists, telephone 071-433-3436.</p>

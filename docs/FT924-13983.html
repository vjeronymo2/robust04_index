			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Rover revives MG sports car marque ROVER, the British Aerospace volume car subsidiary, today formally launches its MG RV8, a redesigned and more powerful variant of the MGB sports car last produced in 1980, claiming that it already has 'hundreds' of orders. The RV8 was initially in-tended to be sold in the UK only. But Rover said yesterday that, because of the level of inquiries both from continental Europe and Japan, where Rover's Mini has already be-come a 'cult' car, that it was considering re-engineering the car for export. Company executives say the Pounds 26,500 RV8 has been developed to mark the 30th anniversary of the MGB, more than 500,000 of which were built. The MGB production plant at Abingdon, Oxfordshire, closed in 1980 with the loss of more than 1,000 jobs when the marque was killed off by former British Leyland chairman Sir Michael Edwardes. The new model is also intended to resurrect the MG name in public awareness, as the precursor to the probable resumption of large-scale production of sports cars from the mid 1990s. Rover has refused to confirm details of its model programmes for the middle of this decade, however, it is widely believed to have finalised specification and production plans for a small sports car that could be in production within three years of financial approval being given. Production of only 15 RV8s a week is planned and deliveries will not start until early next year. The cars will be assembled at Rover's Cowley plant, which has had more than Pounds 130m spent on flexible production systems and manufactures the Rover 800, Maestro, Montego and yet-to-be-launched Synchro model. The RV8 has a new outer body shape from the MGB, but its main body structure is almost identical to that of the old car. It will be produced using partly original tooling - some of it rescued from dumps after the Abingdon plant was dismantled. The bodyshells are produced by British Motor Heritage, a subsidiary of Rover Group set up four years ago to supply remanufactured MGB bodies to the enthusiast aftermarket. The MG name remains extremely valuable to Rover, particularly in North America. The US was once the largest market for MGs, and the name is one of the few in the former British Leyland stable that appears not to have been affected by the ignominious withdrawal from North America first of Rover and then Rover's Sterling subsidiary in the 1980s as a result of declining sales and a poor reputation for quality. Currently, only Range Rovers are sold in the region.</p>

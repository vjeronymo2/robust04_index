			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Travel: Sensual delights in a palace of illusions - Susan Moore enjoys a night-time stroll amid the fountains and flowers of Cordoba's magical Moorish mosque CORDOBA'S Moorish mosque is a wonder of the world - especially wondrous in its deceit. It is the original Tardis, though its delapidated exterior passes for a warehouse rather than police box. Outside, in the sunshine, parties of school-children shriek like starlings. But take one step into the chill and gloomy silence and you encounter the edge of a forest of towering stone trees, from which spring branches of double arches banded pink and white. Everywhere you turn there are endless undulations of pink and white. Its grove of purloined columns are Roman, Visigoth, Byzantine and Moorish, of marble, jasper, breccia, porphyry and granite. This Islamic structure tells almost the entire story of western architecture - not least since, after the reconquest, its heart was ripped out and replaced by a Catholic cathedral. The glittering mosaics of the mihrab, which remains the mosque's true holy of holies, seem like stained glass windows patterned with Persian carpets. Once the mosque opened on to the orangery. In this cobbled patio the live trees - probably originally date palms, echoing the columns within - sit in a series of circular beds linked like beads on a string by narrow irrigation channels. Any excess precious water could run like quicksilver from one bead to another. It does not take long in Cordoba or Granada to realise that water is the supreme delicacy of Moorish Spain. It is a building material as effective as brick or stone, and with it the Moors realised their genius for combining architecture and horticulture. Murmuring, cooling fountains are the sensualist's delight. Water-filled stone lotus flowers lie close to the ground to be appreciated from the thick pile of carpets placed in the shade of orange trees or in the cooler loggia. Moorish gardens are infinitely subtle. That is why the celebrated restored gardens of the Generalife, higher up the Alhambra hill, come as such a shock. The noise] It is a relative Niagra, with inauthentic and energetic jets of water playing into the large pool of the Patio de la Acequia, high kicking in unison like Hollywood dancing girls. On Tuesdays and Thursdays during the season, the Alhambra palace and gardens are open from 10pm to midnight. A night visit is surreal and haunting. Passing through the oblique entrance to the Moorish Lion Court is like approaching a party. You cannot see a soul, but as you enter the hum of chatter becomes a roar. Drinkless guests weave their way through the colonnades or cluster in groups; policemen lurk in the shadows. The art is to wait like a hawk and pounce on the perfect moment, the lull between gaggles of French and Spanish. The Alhambra demands solitude and silence. At that moment the great Court of the Myrtles is completely still. The low central pool is a smooth, dark sheet of water ingeniously fed to the brim and therefore a perfect mirror to the arcades of ornate filligree plasterwork, the gleaming tiles and the indigo sky. The burbling fountain is just audible; myrtle scent hangs in the air. Meandering on, the palace becomes ever more magical - but exaggerated and distorted. Nuances are lost in the dramatic chiaroscuro. Arcades are doubled in height by their reflections. A Banksea rose transforms a 30 ft Cypress tree into a giant in yellow flamenco frills. The town below is a sea of twinkling lights, with the disembodied noises of playing children, barking dogs and hooting cars rising eerily upwards. As we dawdled our way out through the imposing circular arcaded courtyard of Charles V's palace, the exasperated guards finally lost their patience and switched off all the lights. For a minute we stood in the centre of this immense bullring-cum-coliseum, alone, dwarfed and silent in the moonlight. It might have been Italy - or a stage set by de Chirico - but for the bull's heads in the frieze of the colonnade. The palace of Charles V is arguably the finest Renaissance palace in Spain, but how odd its rusticated bulk looks. It seems an aberration, an historical hiccup. Andalucia is magnificently raw, emotive, defiant. Classicism is far less at home there than the astounding local versions of the Baroque. There is nothing in the world to prepare you for the 'Churrigueresque' sacristy of the Cartuja, or Carthusian monastery, at Granada - not least the rest of the monastery complex. In extreme contrast is the vast and austere 16th century refectory, lined with paintings illustrating harrowing scenes of the persecutions suffered by the Order in Reformation England. The sacristy, which sets St Bruno in an altarpiece of marbled marzipan, seems a tour-de-force of the confectioner's art. Exuberant over-wrought stucco work ripples and oozes and looks less like plaster than piped icing. It may be excessive, but in spirit it seems to belong: an 18th century descendant of the richly detailed ornamental stucco of the Alhambra.

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Recruitment: Reconciling commitment and flexibility - How can companies maintain employee loyalty when they can no longer promise a job for life? The Confederation of British Industry is taking a long-term view of recruitment prospects over the next 10 years in what promises to become a much more deregulated and flexible labour market. This - it believes - will involve a reappraisal of how to motivate employees to be committed at work but also adaptable enough to embrace change even if it means accepting redundancy. Stable employment policies are becoming increasingly difficult to maintain in companies of all kinds because of competitive pressures. Employers may want to treat their employees sensitively as human assets to be nurtured but they are under pressure to regard them also as a factor of production. But the tensions that this creates between a desire for commitment in the workplace and the need for flexibility can pose a problem. Is it possible for employers to recruit workers in the labour market who are both loyal to the company but take an understanding view if they lose their job as the result of working in a competitive environment? It is this fundamental issue that is concerning the CBI. Clearly a delicate balance has to be struck between the dual demands of the company: to promote loyalty among its employees but also have the power to respond to increasingly uncertain business pressures. Mr Robbie Gilbert, the CBI's employee affairs director, explained to a recent conference on employment prospects at Warwick University School of Industrial and Business Studies: 'More than ever employers will be looking for a workforce that can deliver higher productivity, work more efficiently, give reliable and customer-oriented service, be innovative and accept the need for continuous personal development and improvement.' However, he also admitted that the CBI's employment affairs committee believed it was going to become 'increasingly difficult' for companies to maintain the long-term commitment of employees. The CBI is uncertain whether loyalty in the company is an outdated concept and if the future employment relationship is moving 'towards specific contracts for a specified job within a specified period'. 'The dilemma for employers is that whilst they want loyalty, certainly from their core employees, they are often seen to be less than loyal to those who work for them,' Gilbert said. 'Employers want to be able to face those who work for them with new challenges but sometimes to close the door with them on the outside.' Undoubtedly a less loyal workforce could prove much harder for a company to motivate. Structural reorganisation inside companies is also likely to weaken employee commitment. Removing layers of management bureaucracy in companies has introduced less hierarchical, flatter organisations. As a result employers will find it more difficult to ensure job satisfaction and motivation as most promotions now tend to go in a lateral direction. 'There will also be less demarcation between manager and managed at all levels and a lessening both of status and the power that comes with being privy to information. The entire concept of management may grow more fluid,' said Gilbert. As a result companies are going to adopt a much more focused approach in their employment policies. The CBI is keen for employers to promote recruitment packages that cater for the specific needs of each employee. Employers will have to tailor their needs to what Mr Gilbert calls 'a growing diversity in the labour supply'. This will mean, in particular, encouraging women with children to return to work. This group is expected to fill most of the jobs to be created by 2000. 'Working patterns will need to be more flexible and realistic, tying in to company as well as individual needs,' argued Gilbert. This will require a more consistent removal of workplace barriers that discriminate against gender and age. Management needs to concern itself with family issues and individual expectations. The CBI believes that employers will have to spend more time assessing employee attitudes to work and leisure and managing those attitudes to fit in with the objectives of the business. Employers may have to sell the concept that employment with them is not for life but for a limited, often contractual period. This raises, the CBI believes, a new concept of employability. No employer can promise a job for life but it is possible for companies to work with individuals in helping them to develop their talents so they can have the best opportunity to develop a portfolio of skills and expertise for use elsewhere in the labour market. A number of City of London companies are already pursuing that policy, such as Legal and General, the insurance group. Some participants at the Warwick conference suggested that employers might find this the best method of reconciling flexibility with commitment. Trust and loyalty ought to be possible even when a worker has limited job prospects with one particular employer. As Gilbert explained: 'In future a measure of the good employer is not necessarily one who pays the highest rate but who keeps workers' skills, and hence their employability, up to date.' He also believes that companies will have to become more candid about explaining to new employees the demands of flexibility facing them. Gilbert talks of 'building productive relationships on knowledge, realism and frankness'. Not nearly enough British companies have the foresight to pursue such a policy. They tend to take a short-sighted view of their own recruitment needs. But this is mainly because many employers are forced to respond to immediate pressures rather than to manage innovation. The government's Investors in People scheme may help to mitigate that tendency as it provides a nationally recognised quality standard to help train and develop employees throughout their working life as well as ensuring organisations invest effectively in skills training. The CBI also believes that companies must develop new ways of attracting, retaining and motivating their employees over the next 10 years. This will mean giving them more responsibility and authority. It also recognises that employees will be better educated, more self-confident and independent than before. Last week the Department of Employment published a glossy guide to employee involvement entitled The Competitive Edge. It stresses that 'successful employee involvement depends on mutual trust'. It talks of changing the culture of companies through recognising what David Hunt, employment secretary, called the 'new realisation of the common interest of management and employees in securing business growth'. The genuine tensions between flexibility and commitment may yet be reconciled in the workplace, at least in the more innovative companies who can look beyond their immediate needs to recognise employee development is as much in their corporate interests as those who work for them.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APPLE EMPLOYEE FIRED FOR LEAKING INFORMATION  </P> <P> Apple Computer, which fired a programmer for leaking information, has served  notice that there will be "sanctions" against any employee who breaches its  security.  </P> <P> David Ramsey, 33, author of Apple's MacPaint 2.0 program, said he was fired  Thursday for using the CompuServe electronic bulletin board to disclose  information.  </P> <P> Chris Escher said Monday that Apple has "a commitment to open communication and  that environment is based on trust.  </P> <P> "All employees have sensitive material in their hands every day, and we expect  them to act with good judgment regarding that information. Implicit in that  environment is an agreement that there must be limits and sanctions on people  who break that trust."  </P> <P> Ramsey said he did not know that the information put out by CompuServe was  "confidential." He said he believed that it had already been discussed by Apple  Chairman John Sculley.  </P> <P> Ramsey began working at Apple two years ago.  </P></p>

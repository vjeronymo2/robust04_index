			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbeans press for EC banana regime CARIBBEAN BANANA exporters have no preference for either a quota-based or a tariff-based banana import regime in the Europe Community - as long as the EC stands by obligations to them under the Lome Convention, according to Mr John Compton, prime minister of St Lucia. His comments come at a time of mounting pressure to put an EC-wide banana regime in place ahead of the creation of the European single market on January 1, 1993. Commission proposals for a quota-based system have attracted criticism because of their complexity, and the scope they provide for abuse. Amid claims that the EC has not adequately explored tariff-based options, the current proposals are intended to insulate Lome promises to protect the livelihoods of Caribbean islanders against unfettered multinational competition. Many Caribbean islands - including St Lucia  - are heavily dependent on banana exports, and fear political upheavals if EC market access is undermined. There are also fears that a breakthrough in the long-stalled Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation - which aim to replace quota arrangements with tariffs in all areas of international trade - would make any quota-based regime unacceptable to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based world trade watchdog. At the end of a diplomatic tour of Europe embracing Germany, Ireland and the UK and intended to get EC member states to reaffirm their treaty commitments under the Lome Convention, Mr Compton said tariffs or quotas were a matter of 'mechanics'. 'Whether proposals for future banana trade are tariff-based, or quota-based, we will examine them to see whether they discharge Europe's obligations under Lome', he said. Mr Compton was concerned that EC member states opposed to quotas would prolong discussions. Successive Lome agreements have assured the small economies of the Caribbean access to the EC for their banana exports 'on terms and conditions no less favourable than those enjoyed in the past'. Grown by smallholders in difficult farming terrain, comparatively expensive Caribbean bananas have been able to maintain a 20 per cent share of the EC market of 3.3m tonnes by virtue of quotas from former colonial powers like the UK and France.</p>

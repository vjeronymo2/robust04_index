			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: SE probe as Drew issues warning DREW Scientific, the maker of medical diagnostic kits, yesterday issued a profits warning less than six months after coming to the market, and days after a sharp fall in the share price. The announcement that there would be a pre-tax loss of Pounds 850,000 in the six months to September 30 was timed to coincide with the close of the stock market. Drew said that for the last three months it has been unable to ship the only product it produces, a kit that helps doctors monitor the management of diabetes. Mr Trevor Barker, chairman, has asked the Stock Exchange to investigate recent trading in the share price. 'I want to know why there was a leak,' Mr Barker said. He said that while Drew had known since July about the problem with valves it buys for its kits in the US, it could not quantify the extent of the problem and had not made an announcement. Advisers at Credit Lyonnais Laing, said the directors should have been aware that there was a danger of a false market in their shares once shipment of the only product was suspended. Mr Barker said the company had wanted to wait until it could announce that shipment had been resumed. Drew was floated in May at 105p and the shares jumped to 150p valuing the company at about Pounds 40m. Directors took about Pounds 3m in cash from the sale of shares, with Mr Drew, still one of the largest shareholders, taking Pounds 1.3m. Since then the share price fell to 105p before last Friday when it dropped another 20p. It closed yesterday unchanged at 80p before the announcement Mr Barker said that since the float the company had met problems. 'None of this was known when we issued the prospectus,' he said. Mr Andrew Kenney, research and development director, said the 'working hypothesis' was that 'the mistake we may have made is not saying anything publicly since the flotation.' At the time of launch, Drew did not make a profits forecast. But based on assumptions about the number of kits that would be shipped, brokers were steered towards a pre-tax profit figure for the year of about Pounds 2m. Drew also said yesterday that the US Food and Drug Adminstration had approved a new G15 diagnostic kit which should enjoy larger sales. The profits warning will be particularly embarrassing for Close Brothers, which brought the company to the market in a placing, and its advisers.</p>

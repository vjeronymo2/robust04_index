			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / French move on political funding France looks set to ban corporate contributions to political parties after Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said last night he had overcome his 'hesitations' about such a sweeping move to clean up French politics. He said he would put to the National Assembly a four-point plan to stop companies bankrolling political parties, to reduce the ceiling on spending in next year's presidential election by 30 per cent, to introduce an audit of politicians' personal wealth, and to improve fairness and transparency in the award of public contracts. Mr Balladur acknowledged that he had initially hesitated about a total ban on corporate campaign contributions, out of concern that this would put political parties into the hands of the state, which since 1990 has financed a portion of their activities. But he had previously suggested a three-year experimental freeze on companies giving to political campaigns. Mr Balladur, who has lost three ministers to corruption charges in recent months, cannot afford to appear lax on this issue in the run-up to the presidential election. The National Assembly is to start debating reform on Friday, with its conservative majority now clearly, like its Socialist and Communist opposition, in favour of separating business and politics.</p>

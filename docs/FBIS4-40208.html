			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statements by Belarusian National Bank Chairman Stanislaw </F> Antonavich Bahdankevich in response to questions submitted by  NARODNAYA GAZETA readers; place and date not given: "I Am Ready  To Cooperate With any Movements and Parties That Will Be Able To  Implement the Program of Economic Reforms"]    [Excerpts] [A. V. Potyko] You travel abroad often, and I  believe, not as tourist. Did you acquire any experience during  your travels which could be of use for our Republic? What is  your attitude toward IMF activities and its proposals regarding  the resolution of our financial problems?    [Bahdankevich] I have often been abroad as Belarusian  representative to the IMF and the World Bank for Reconstruction  and Development [as published]. The IMF allots a considerable  degree of technical aid to the Republic. It aids our banking  system, primarily by teaching the basics of market economy to  our personnel. As for the European Bank, our relations are most  productive. This bank has already issued four lines of credit  on very favorable conditions for us. We are conducting  negotiations on some 20 investment projects and we have  principally agreed on opening a credit line for small and  medium-sized businesses.    [Samusev] It seems to me that the independence of the  National Bank cannot be compared to that of any central bank in  Europe. Your bank is forced to execute such measures which lead  to increases in inflation and other negative consequences.  Should you not reconsider the status of our National Bank?    [Bahdankevich] Not only the Belarusian National Bank but  also  other central banks are experiencing certain pressure from both  their governments and national business circles in terms of  issuing loans.    In our state, increases in inflation are primarily explained  not by the issuing of credits but rather by a lack of market  levers regulating the economy under situations whereby the state  has refused to directly manage it. Of course, the independence  of the National Bank should be encouraged. However, the key  point is not in the juridical independence of the bank but in  the stalling of reforms. [passage omitted]    [Zhuk] Kebich blames the nonimplementation of the monetary  union with Russia on Bahdankevich. Who is correct?    [Bahdankevich] The National Bank has never opposed the  preservation and strengthening of economic integration with the  Russian Federation. We favor such a union, which is based on  equal rights and does not destroy our independence. We do not  agree that a foreign state -- even a friendly one -- should  begin to formulate our economic policy. We oppose the transfer  of the National Bank -- with its assets and liabilities -- to  the ownership of another state; the approval of the Belarusian  budget and the amount of its deficit by the Russian Duma; the  recalculation of our banks' and enterprises' funds on the basis  of an unprofitable-for-us exchange rate. [passage omitted]    [Nalivayko] What about the unification of the Belarusian and  Russian monetary systems? Proceeding from the words of our  prime minister, I can understand that if not today, then, at  least, tomorrow, the Russian ruble will become our legal  currency. However, you told NARODNAYA GAZETA that there is  virtually no agreement at all. I trust more in your  professionalism. The second question is whether Russia has set  similar -- with its domestic market -- prices for energy  resources for Belarus?    [Bahdankevich] Many factories and businesses in Belarus can  work normally only when they have foreign markets for raw  materials and can sell their products overseas -- primarily, in  Russia and Ukraine. The preservation and extension of markets  is always a positive rather than a negative factor. We kept  this in mind when we planned to establish an equal banking union  between two sovereign states based on a common currency.  However, I think that the monetary merger -- one based on  conditions which violate our Constitution and contradict our  economic and political interests -- should not be implemented.  Instead of the monetary merger, it is possible to sign an  agreement on bilateral payments with Russia. I would like to  emphasize that in early June, the Russian side sent an official  proposal and a draft agreement -- regarding measures to provide  for the mutual convertibility of our national currencies aimed  at establishing a monetary union based on their national  currencies -- to V. F. Kebich. This testifies to the fact that  the Russian Government also has no illusions as far as the  monetary merger -- based on inadmissible and contradictory  conditions for the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus -- is  concerned.    The Russian side has not even lifted customs duties and  taxes, while we lifted them back in April. All the statements  made by our government do not correspond to reality, to say the  least. The Russian Government has already drawn up a draft  agreement regarding customs duties and taxes. Proceeding from  this document, these duties and taxes will be lifted beginning  on the day it is signed. I believe that this agreement will be  signed in the next few weeks. At the moment, our Republic is  experiencing huge losses.    [Lisitskiy] I think that it is the Cabinet of Ministers,  headed by Kebich, which has ruined our economy. However, Kebich  blames the National Bank for this. What is wrong with your bank?    [Bahdankevich] The National Bank opposes injections of  "noncovered" money into our economy. This leads to increases in  inflation and prices, to decreases in the exchange rate of our  ruble. To cover the money, the government should pursue a  rational price policy. Currently, one liter of milk in a shop  costs 180 rubles [R] while it costs R1,860 to produce. This  difference is covered from the state budget. This money is mine  and yours. We believe that the government should issue  subsidies not to producers, but to consumers to enable them to  buy milk or bread. It is the price that makes the economy  function. This is the key contradiction between the National  Bank and the government, which wishes -- how can I put this --  to lay the blame on someone else. [passage omitted]    [Samalyuk] Would the economic situation in Belarus become  stable if a national currency were introduced? Who has a real  chance of becoming president of Belarus?    [Bahdankevich] Currently, I would not make any  recommendations as to changes in the National Bank payment notes  for a national currency. To stabilize the economy, it is  necessary to promptly reconstruct it. This means, first of all,  setting conditions for competition, capital investment, cutting  the budget deficit and number of uncovered loans. In my  opinion, a decrease in the inflation rate and stabilization of  the economy -- merely on the basis of a tough monetary policy  along with the introduction of a national currency -- are  impossible.    I hold out hope that the Belarusian people did not lose  their  common sense. They will elect a president who will attract the  best creative forces to the leadership of the state and will  count not on Western or Eastern tips, but on the diligence and  creative potential of its own people. [passage omitted]    [Petrov] Kebich met with intelligentsia in Nesvizh. He spoke  unfavorably of the "chief banker." Why? Is this because  Bahdankevich does not want to issue loans to the agricultural  sector or because he opposes the monetary merger with Russia in  the form the prime minister signed it? Kebich said if the  National Bank does not issue a loan to the government, the  government will then take credits in dollars from abroad and  give them to agricultural workers. Who will pay back those  dollars? Kebich or the people? Why were two people -- one from  the Supreme Soviet and another from the Cabinet of Ministers --  included on the National Bank board? Does this mean that  Bahdankevich has to resign?    [Bahdankevich] Mildly speaking, Mr. Kebich lied in Nesvizh.  This year, the National Bank did not grant credits to businesses  or the government at a 210-percent, or even higher, interest  rate. We earmarked R1 trillion in credits -- with a yearly  interest rate of 6.5 percent -- for the sowing campaign through  the budget. In addition, we extended credits for advance  payments for state procurement of agricultural products with a  yearly interest rate of 20 percent, for investments -- 60  percent; for production requirements -- 100 percent.    As for the refusal to grant regular credits to the  agricultural sector, the truth is that our Republic has created  conditions for setting a constant breakaway gap between  procurement prices for agricultural products and prices on  industrial products for the agricultural sector. The more milk,  grain, or meat a kolkhoz or sovkhoz produces, the more  unprofitable it is. By not restricting prices on industrial  products for the agricultural sector and simultaneously  restricting procurement prices -- given the lack of funds to  cover the breakaway gap in prices -- we push agricultural  producers toward bankruptcy. The government sees salvation if  the National Bank issues free and blank credits. However, this  is the path to nowhere -- to a dead end.    The National Bank has repeatedly recommended that the  government cover the carrying costs by setting prices and  issuing credits to agricultural businesses only for seasonal  work and stock provisions. This year, 97.2 percent of National  Bank assets were injected into the agricultural-industrial  complex [APK]. We expected the government to at least adopt the  necessary measures. However, it has done nothing.    Any nonexperts -- industrial or agricultural sector workers  -- realize that in addition to the APK, industry, transport,  trade, and other sectors of economy also require state credits.  A continuous imbalance in supporting only one sector will only  intensify our problems. Prime Minister Kebich should render  support to the agricultural sector, however, he should not do  this by means of such highly unprofessional moves.    As for the introduction of the Supreme Soviet and the  Cabinet  of Ministers' representatives in our bank, this was done  according to changes introduced to the Law on the National Bank.  I am not going to resign in the immediate future. Not because  I care for the chair and a high salary. Were I a chairman of a  commercial bank, my salary would have been at least twice as  high as my actual salary from the state. [passage omitted]    [Tolkachev] How much time, do you think, will be required to  stabilize the economy once the economic reforms are implemented?  What will cover and support the national currency? Western  credits or land mortgages? Anything else? How do you view  Kebich's desire to join the Russian Federation?    [Bahdankevich] I believe that at least to minimally  stabilize  the economy -- that is, to reduce the inflation rate to a level  of less than 10 percent per month, to stabilize the exchange  rate of the Belarusian ruble -- we require between six and eight  months. After this issue is resolved, we will need between two  and three years to profoundly reconstruct the economy, to stop  the drop in production, and ensure a gradual increase in  economic productivity.    As for the introduction of our national currency, the  national wealth -- at first, Belarus-produced products, goods  and services, given the tough budget and credit policy -- will  guarantee its stability.    [Bahdankevich] I would not comment on Vyachaslaw  Frantsevich's position, however, I do favor the preservation of  Belarus' complete political sovereignty and close economic  integration with the CIS states and our Western neighbors.  [passage omitted].    [Bakun] Why did you, Stanislaw Antonavich, not clarify your  position -- regarding the union with Russia -- earlier? Why  only now? Also, I'd like to know which presidential candidate  you will vote for?    [Bahdankevich] According to our verbal agreement with  Chernomyrdin, it was decided that the final draft of the  agreement could be changed after the consultations. However,  you know that Russia did not accept any changes and even  toughened its position. Therefore, I not only had to publicly  express my opinion but to write a letter -- which contained my  principal disagreement with the merger on such conditions -- to  the Supreme Soviet.... I will vote for Stanislaw Shushkevich.  [passage omitted]    [Kholod] Do you have a program regarding the stabilization  of  our "hare" outside of the ruble zone?    [Bahdankevich] Yes. We have recently discussed key trends in  the money and credit policy for 1994. This program has already  been adopted.    [Kholod] However, the government is pushing the Republic  toward the money merger. At the same time, you have adopted a  program of measures aimed at stabilizing the national currency  outside the ruble zone. Why is there no single opinion on the  issue?    [Bahdankevich] Currently, the agreement with Russia is  virtually not effective. The expectation that it would begin  functioning leads to big losses due to chaos in calculations.  The point is that the Russian ruble was balanced and accounted  on par with the Belarusian ruble. We virtually decreased our  assets by 10 times.... [passage omitted]    [Burmako] What do you, an expert, think about the economic  concept of the Belarusian Popular Front? Will you cooperate  with them if they come to power?    [Bahdankevich] I am ready to cooperate with any parties and  movements that will be able to implement a program of market  reforms.</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: CS First Boston completes reorganisation CS First Boston, the New York-based global investment bank, confirmed it had completed a year-long process of integrating the management of its main business lines into product, rather than geographic, groupings. The moves are regarded by industry analysts as an attempt by the bank to improve co-ordination between the operations. Under the new system, Mr Archibald Cox, chief executive of the bank's US operations, will be responsible for CSFB's equities business; Mr Allen Wheat and Mr Robert Diamond, two senior executives, will take charge of the fixed income business; and Mr Cox and Mr David Mulford, chief executive of the bank's European unit, will be responsible for investment banking. The task of managing CSFB's administrative, information systems and finance operations has been handed to Mr Ruedi Stalder, chief financial officer. The management of CSFB was organised around three separate regional units of the bank - the US-based First Boston, the London-based Credit Suisse First Boston, and the Tokyo-based CS First Boston Pacific. The integration of the main businesses under product lines follows the welding of the bank's foreign exchange and derivatives operations into globally-oriented units. Poor relations among the different units of CSFB are believed to have contributed to the bank's relatively poor recent performance. In 1992, at a time when most Wall Street investment banks and securities houses were posting record profits, CSFB reported a 19 per cent decline in net income to Dollars 175m. A spokesman for CSFB, which has been hit recently by a series of staff defections amid grumblings over year-end bonuses, denied that the changes represented a significant restructuring of the bank. He said: 'It's not a reorganisation of the firm. It's a global integration of our major business lines.' Although the global integration of CSFB's businesses has not involved a name-change for the organisation, sources at the bank revealed that management had been discussing combining all the different units under one name.</p>

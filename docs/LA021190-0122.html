			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CESAREAN FIGURES ON HOSPITAL TRANSFERS  </P> <P> I was very interested to read the article about birthing centers gaining in  popularity. I believe, however, the comments that 20% of all women develop  complications, thus leading to a transfer and Cesarean section, are misleading.  </P> <P> In a study on the safety of birthing centers (Dec. 28, the New England Journal  of Medicine) the total transfer rate was 15.8%, but the total Cesarean rate was  only 4.4%.  </P> <P> The use of unnecessary interventions and misused technology caused  complications leading to a Cesarean section for the birth of my first child.  When pregnant a second time, I traveled over an hour to give birth naturally  with no interventions. In the United States, the Cesarean rate can reach higher  than 35% in some hospitals. Perhaps this trend toward out-of-hospital births  can reduce Cesareans to a normal and acceptable rate.  </P> <P> VICKY ORTEGA  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano  </P></p>

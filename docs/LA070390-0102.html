			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNIVERSAL TO BUY 18-SCREEN THEATER COMPLEX;  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT: THE STUDIO HAS AGREED TO PAY AILING CINEPLEX ODEON $45 MILLION  FOR THE FACILITY, WHICH OVERLOOKS ITS BACK LOT.  </P> <P> Universal Studios has agreed to buy the luxurious, 18-screen Universal City  Cinemas complex from the debt-ridden Cineplex Odeon Corp. for $45 million, the  exhibitor announced Monday.  </P> <P> The state-of-the-art facility, which sits on a hill overlooking the  MCA/Universal headquarters and the popular Universal Studios tour, would be  acquired by Universal by Sept. 26 under the terms of the deal.  </P> <P> Cineplex Odeon would continue to manage the theater complex through its  subsidiary, Plitt Theatres Inc. Proceeds from the sale would go to reduce the  debt load of the Toronto-based exhibitor, which has been actively selling off  theaters in an effort to regain its financial footing.  </P> <P> "This transaction reflects Cineplex Odeon's previously stated intention to  reduce debt, while protecting our strategic position in major markets," company  President and Chief Executive Allen Karp said in a prepared statement. "Our  continuing management of Universal City Cinemas preserves . . . our strong  participation in the Los Angeles market."  </P> <P> Cineplex Odeon continues to operate several theaters in the Los Angeles area,  including the Cineplex in the Beverly Center, the Cineplex Odeon Broadway  Cinemas in Santa Monica, the Century Plaza Cinemas, the Fairfax Cinema, the  Marina/Marketplace Cinema, the Odeon Cinema in Westwood and the Cineplex Odeon  Showcase on La Brea Avenue near Melrose Avenue.  </P> <P> MCA Inc., Universal's parent company, owns a 50% stake in Cineplex Odeon.  MCA/Universal executives declined comment on the sale Monday. But Los Angeles  securities analyst Jeffrey Logsdon of Crowell Weedon &amp; Co. called the  purchase a wise move. Logsdon said MCA/Universal can use the 6,000-seat  complex, which features multicolored marble tiles, marble pillars, a grand  staircase and 47-foot-high ceilings, as a showcase for its films.  </P> <P> "Within some kind of reasonable financial parameters it makes great sense for  MCA/Universal to own the theaters on their lot," Logsdon said. "It's part of  the attraction of Universal City, and it's a way to highlight what are  inarguably some of the better screens in the marketplace with their own  product. Plus, it's another way to take advantage of their competitors. When  you own the theaters, you don't have to play everyone else's movies."  </P> <P> MCA/Universal also appears to be getting a good deal in the purchase of the  complex. When Cineplex founder and former chairman Garth H. Drabinsky tried to  take the company private last year, MCA and another major investor considered  buying the Universal City Cinemas for $57 million.  </P> <P> In some ways, the glamorous complex remains a reflection of Drabinsky, whose  lavish spending habits left the company on the brink of economic ruin and  eventually cost him his job. Drabinsky repeatedly clashed with MCA and the  wealthy Bronfman family of Canada, another major partner, before his ouster.  </P> <P> The sale of Universal City Cinemas would leave Cineplex Odeon with 1,530  screens in 390 locations in the United States and Canada. The company, which  carries about $530 million in long-term debt, recently announced that two of  its major shareholders, MCA and the Bronfmans' Claridge Investments, might be  asked to put up $50 million each to help pay off long-terms debts if the  company cannot comply with its bankers' requirements to sell off $200 million  in assets by year-end.  </P> <P> Logsdon speculated that MCA/Universal's purchase of the theater complex might  be a way of helping to pay down Cineplex Odeon's debt without having to make  the $50-million payment.  </P> <P> Universal City Cinemas was built in 1988 at a cost of $16.5 million. Cineplex  Odeon is entitled to consider competing offers for the theater complex for the  next 60 days under the agreement, and MCA/Universal has the option of matching  a competing offer or leasing its land to a new theater tenant. The sale of the  complex is also subject to governmental review.  </P></p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / US firm over lifting sanctions on Iraq The US last night took a firm stand against lifting the embargo against Iraq even as Baghdad sought improved relations with its Arab neighbours and boasted of co-operating with the United Nations, writes Michael Littlejohns, UN Correspondent, in New York. As the Security Council conducted its periodic review of sanctions Ms Madeleine Albright, the US ambassador, asserted that this 'limited co-operation' was sporadic, selective and opportunist. She said Baghdad was trying only to escape sanctions while ignoring other requirements imposed by the Council. The US was convinced that what co-operation had been seen would cease once Iraq was enabled to sell oil. While Baghdad still had not revealed fully its mass destruction weapons programme, it was already contacting former suppliers or middle-men to purchase new armaments. Although France, Russia and some third world states are eager to have the Council acknowledge that Iraq has made progress towards implementing Council resolutions, Ms Albright said it was premature to discuss either the terms or the timing of modifying sanctions. Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraqi deputy prime minister, who is in New York, has accused some states - implicitly the US and Britain - of obstructing an easing of the embargo. Both countries have veto powers.</p>

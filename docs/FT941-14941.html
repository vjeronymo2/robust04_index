			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / People: Change of chairman at Ashley James White yesterday strongly rebutted the notion that he has been forced out of his post as chairman of the Ashley Group, which manufactures window blinds, despite the announcement that he will be making way for Hamish Grossart after the next board meeting on February 7. Grossart - described as 'an excellent fellow' by White - is chairman of EFT, Quality Care Homes and Scottish Highland Hotels. It is understood that Grossart had been in discussion with the board of Ashley Group for some weeks before the announced board changes. White, 56, will remain on the board of the Ashley Group until the end of February. Tony Orton and Peter Maydon, who serve as non-executive directors, will also retire then. The Ashley Group currently has some Pounds 19m of outstanding debt, and it has yet to settle legal problems relating to the sale of Digsa, the Spanish food retailing chain it first bought in 1988 and which it sold in May 1993. 'There has been no quarrel,' says White. Despite rumours to the contrary, he ascribed his departure from the board as the culmination of a process 'that goes back 15 months', involving the relocation of the company's HQ to Glasgow. He says: 'Despite being Scottish by origin I have spent 33 years in the south, and the company needs on-the-spot management.' White, a former chairman of Bunzl, is also a non-executive director of Lucas Industries. Bill Macdonald becomes managing director and Robert McNeil deputy chairman with immediate effect, and John Langlands finance director with effect from February 14.</p>

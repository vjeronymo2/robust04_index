			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Crisis talks as Independent's sales slide THE BOARD of Newspaper Publishing, publisher of The Independent and the Independent on Sunday, meets today amid a growing sense of crisis over falling sales and financial uncertainty. Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the founder of The Independent, will offer his resignation to other directors as chief executive to concentrate on developing the papers and his role as editor. There is also likely to be a debate over a controversial business plan which will be submitted to the meeting. The plan suggests raising Pounds 1.5m for each newspaper - a great deal less than was widely expected. This will have to pay for the introduction of colour printing, the launching of new sections and promotion of the titles. There are fears that the sum may be inadequate to meet the intensified competition expected in the autumn from The Times and from a re-launched Observer, now owned by The Guardian. More money could however be raised in the autumn. The two main shareholders of Newspaper Publishing, El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy, who own 18 per cent each, have made it clear they are prepared to invest substantial sums and take their stakes up to 25 per cent each through a rights issue. They are likely to be unhappy about what is being proposed although both groups are still supportive of Newspaper Publishing. The Pounds 3m proposed in the new business plan could be largely raised through borrowings and cost-cutting, thus leaving the present shareholding structure intact. This would leave control still in the hands of Mr Whittam Smith. Although sales of general broadsheet newspapers have been falling over the past few months the Newspaper Publishing titles have been particularly badly hit and their circulations have dropped month after month. Between March and June the circulation of The Independent fell from 354,178 to 338,823. In April 1992 the circulation stood at 389,523. The Independent on Sunday, which in October 1992 had a circulation of 425,803, had dropped to 387,511 in March and 376,859 by June. A number of senior staff believe that urgent action is now needed to avoid a growing crisis and question whether Pounds 3m could possibly be enough to turn round the fortunes of the newspaper group. Some staff are now even questioning whether Newspaper Publishing can be viable as a stand-alone company. Most of its rivals are part of larger groups. In the year to September 1992 Newspaper Publishing made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 28,000 compared to a loss of Pounds 10m in 1991. Staff believe that the group is now trading at a loss - as much as Pounds 2m a year.</p>

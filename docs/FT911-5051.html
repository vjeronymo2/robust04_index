			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Labour steps up attack on Conservative discord: Local Elections LABOUR WENT on the offensive in the local election campaigns yesterday, repeating its accusations of Tory discord and dithering. The attack, which precedes publication today of Labour's updated policy document, came as Tory officials condemned as 'character assassination' a BBC television programme delving into Mr John Major's past. Yesterday's Panorama raised questions on the prime minister's sensitivity about his schooling, and the technical validity of his election for the first time as a councillor in south London. Tory unhappiness about the programme's concentration on Mr Major's personality rather than his policies follows a Sunday interview which was said to have 'frustrated' the prime minister because of its focus on a narrow range of issues. Mr John Cunningham, Labour's campaign co-ordinator, claimed that the Tories' disarray had led them to cancel local election press conferences, silencing even Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman. Tory central office said that no press conferences had been cancelled because none had been planned for this week. 'When we have something to say, we'll say it.' The green paper on the replacement for the poll tax is most likely to be published next week, but could still come on Thursday, after cabinet approval. The cabinet committee dealing with it is due to meet today in what could be a long discussion on the details of the draft. The preference for a property tax based on a two-adult household, with discounts for single-person households, has been substantially agreed and will be spelt out firmly. Today's launch of 'Labour's better way for the 1990s', will not include further details of the party's plans to replace the poll tax, re-stated at last week's launch of the local election campaigns, but will update and expand from last year's policy document areas such as the economy and foreign affairs. Labour's document was yesterday approved without substantial changes by the party's national executive committee. In his introduction to the document, Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, describes Britain as a country with great potential 'being pushed into decline' after 12 years of Tory rule. He claims that while the Tories have no way of governing other than repeating their mistakes, Labour would provide government which is 'accountable, not arrogant; enabling, not meddling'. The Liberal Democrats will today give detailed figures for their local income tax.</p>

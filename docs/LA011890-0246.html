			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BLIND SKIER'S BLINDNESS QUESTIONED BY OFFICIALS  </P> <P> A blind skier whose championship performance inspired admiration and donations  has been suspended from a ski program for the disabled by officials who suspect  that she is partially sighted.  </P> <P> Julie Wallace, 25, of Flint insists the suspicions are unfounded and has  threatened legal action against the ski officials. She said she has medical  proof that she is totally blind and has leukemia and a brain tumor.  </P> <P> "She is so phenomenally better than anybody I have dealt with that that causes  some immediate concern," said Jack Benedict, director of the U.S. Disabled Ski  Team.  </P> <P> The Grand County Sheriff's Department in Hot Sulphur Springs, Colo., is  investigating whether Wallace misrepresented herself to raise money from  sponsors, Lt. Tom Nixon said.  </P> <P> Paul diBello, program director at the National Sports Center for the Disabled  at Winter Park Resorts in Colorado, said today that the district attorney's  office and FBI are investigating, though neither agency would confirm that.  </P> <P> If Wallace is found to have misrepresented her disability, she won't be allowed  to compete in next month's international disabled ski championships and the  medals she has won will be taken away, diBello said.  </P> <P> Wallace has received contributions from several Flint-area sponsors, a  spokeswoman there said.  </P> <P> Wallace predicted that the suspension will be lifted as soon as she supplies  the team with additional evidence of her medical condition, although she said  she is unsure that she wants to remain in the program. She said she will demand  a public apology.  </P> <P> "They had no right suspending me," she said.  </P> <P> She said they first confronted her with their suspicions Jan. 2. "They  proceeded to tell me I didn't have cancer, I wasn't blind," Wallace said. "They  said, 'You can't be part of this team if you're not blind.' "  </P> <P> DiBello said today that he has not yet received any medical proof from Wallace  and that she will have to go through "a very, very stringent test" to verify  her lack of vision.  </P> <P> Wallace began training in Colorado last summer after winning two gold medals  during the U.S. Assn. of Blind Athletes national championships.  </P> <P> She appeared to be a strong candidate to compete in the international  championships to be held at Winter Park next month, officials said.  </P></p>

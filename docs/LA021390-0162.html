			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOUGLAS GIVEN UNDISPUTED TITLE  </P> <P> James (Buster) Douglas became undisputed heavyweight champion today, three days  after knocking out Mike Tyson, amid reports that a Tyson-Douglas rematch is set  for June 18 in Atlantic City.  </P> <P> Douglas, who knocked Tyson out in the 10th round early Sunday in Tokyo,  received recognition from the World Boxing Assn. The World Boxing Council  recognized his victory Monday night, after Tyson's promoter-adviser, Don King,  dropped his protest.  </P> <P> The International Boxing Federation already had recognized Douglas.  </P> <P> "I never asked anybody to change the decision," King said Monday night in his  first comments since the knockout of Tyson. "We just want a first shot at a  rematch."  </P> <P> There may be a hitch, though. Evander Holyfield, who had a contract to fight  Tyson on June 18 if Tyson was heavyweight champion, still is the No. 1  contender of the WBC, WBA and IBF. A Douglas-Holyfield fight, therefore, may be  mandated.  </P> <P> King and Tyson were scheduled to hold a news conference late this afternoon in  New York.  </P> <P> In the meantime, billionaire Donald J. Trump told the New York Times: "We made  the deal a little while ago" to host a Tyson-Douglas rematch.  </P> <P> Gary Selesner, vice president of operations at Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino,  told The Press of Atlantic City that the casino owned by Trump will host the  rematch.  </P> <P> Selesner was not immediately available to comment.  </P> <P> However, Dan Duva, who promotes Holyfield, said: "Right now, everything is in  the talking stages, and negotiations are going on, but nothing is firm. The  only thing firm is that Evander Holyfield is the mandatory challenger for  Buster Douglas."  </P> <P> Duva said he had been conducting negotiations with King about several  possibilities, "and that is one of them, but nothing has been agreed upon, and  I told Gary Selesner that this morning"  </P> <P> James Binns, legal counsel for the WBA, told the Associated Press this morning:  "The WBA has declared Buster Douglas the champion. It's just upon reflection  that this is the right decision. There are no conditions regarding a title  defense."  </P> <P> Binns said the decision was made after consulting this morning with WBA  President Gilberto Mendoza, who was still in Japan.  </P> <P> "I'll meet with him tomorrow (Wednesday), and after that we may conduct a press  conference," Binns said.  </P> <P> WBC President Jose Sulaiman said his organization was not withholding title  recognition of Douglas, as he had indicated earlier.  </P> <P> Sulaiman said Monday night he was misunderstood in his comments about the  possibility of not recognizing Douglas, and, in fact, his organization is  unanimous in its belief that Douglas should be crowned.  </P> <P> "I contacted the members of the executive council of the WBC in the five  continents, and they demand our group officially announce Buster Douglas as  champion of the world of the heavyweight division," Sulaiman said.  </P> <P> Douglas said today a rematch would be fine with him.  </P> <P> "I would be more than willing to fight Mike Tyson," he said on ABC-TV's "Good  Morning America," adding: "I did it once. I'll do it again."  </P></p>

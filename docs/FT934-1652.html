			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 27m purchase by Manders Manders, the Wolverhampton-based paints, inks and property group, has acquired the printing inks and graphics supplies business of Croda International for about Pounds 26.7m cash. Manders' shares climbed 14p to 350p. Mr John Farmer, Manders finance director, said that the acquisition would push borrowings up to Pounds 50m. Manders is paying about Pounds 16m for the net assets plus goodwill of Pounds 10.7m. Manders said the acquisition would complement its existing coatings and inks business. Mr Farmer said that the purchase would increase turnover in the coatings side from Pounds 50m a year to between Pounds 80m and Pounds 85m. Most of the increase would derive from continental Europe, especially the Netherlands. The operations bought are also located in the UK, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand and Zimbabwe. Manders said it would benefit from the spread of the businesses bought because many European customers now wanted to standardise supply relationships across borders. In 1992, the bought businesses made operating profits of Pounds 2m (Pounds 1.7m) on sales of Pounds 30m (Pounds 29.6m). Net operating assets were valued at Pounds 12.4m at December 31 1992. In September Mr Roger Akers, Manders chief executive, said that the Mander Centre, the group's shopping centre valued in December 1991 at Pounds 57.5m, was being marketed in response to 'unsolicited approaches'. Mr Farmer said a short list of interested parties had been prepared. Sale details would be put to shareholders 'within eight to 10 weeks'. He suggested that the group would want to reduce borrowings with part of the proceeds.</p>

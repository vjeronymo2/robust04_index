			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Observer: Unsung hero It is hard to imagine a fund manager as a heroic figure, but Robert Cottrell, who used to pen this column, has fingered one in his book on The End of Hong Kong. John Greenwood, chief economist of the GT fund management group, gets a special mention in dispatches for his sterling work during a particularly nasty run on the Hong Kong dollar 10 years ago. Local shops had begun posting signs that they would accept only US dollars and nobody had much of a clue how to solve the crisis. No one, that is, apart from Greenwood who had published a paper on 'How to rescue the Hong Kong dollar', which he had circulated to economists such as Milton Friedman and Alan Walters. One Saturday afternoon, at the height of the crisis, he was invited to the Hong Kong monetary affairs department to discuss his plan. Greenwood came away thinking that he hadn't convinced the officials of his case. However, a few days later, HK followed his advice, pegged its exchange rate, and the HK government won all the credit. 'For my money Greenwood deserved a knighthood,' says Cottrell, who is already researching his next tome, a biography of President Mitterrand.</p>

			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TIJUANA INMATES AGREE TO END HUNGER STRIKE;  </P> <P> JUSTICE: THE MOVE COMES AFTER MEXICAN OFFICIALS PROMISE TO INVESTIGATE CLAIMS  OF ABUSES BY FEDERAL POLICE.  </P> <P> Most participants in an almost two-month hunger strike at the Baja California  state penitentiary in Tijuana have suspended their protest and begun to eat  after Mexican authorities vowed to investigate their allegations of torture and  other improprieties by Mexican federal police.  </P> <P> The 30 inmates who have agreed to suspend their strike contend that they were  wrongly jailed by federal authorities, mostly on drug charges -- a common  allegation in Mexico. Nationwide, there have been widespread allegations that  federal police have resorted to torture, murder and other unlawful means in an  effort to make arrests and demonstrate Mexico's commitment to combating  narcotics trafficking.  </P> <P> Many of the federal prisoners participating in the strike contend that they  were beaten into signing false confessions, purportedly spelling out their  involvement in international drug trafficking networks.  </P> <P> A separate group of about 15 Tijuana prisoners seeking early parole after being  convicted for a variety of crimes is continuing the hunger strike this week,  although prison officials said that some or all are expected to be released  within days.  </P> <P> As many as 70 prisoners were participating in the strike at one point, although  the total number had declined to 45 last weekend, strikers said. Most have  refused food for seven weeks, strikers say, but some joined in later and have  participated for shorter durations. There are about 2,500 inmates at the  prison, which was built for 600 prisoners.  </P> <P> The strikers, who based their protest in and around a two-story gazebo amid the  crowded grounds of the prison complex, say they have only been taking liquids,  including honey. A number have been treated at the prison clinic and one  ex-striker is in grave condition at a Tijuana hospital, with internal wounds  allegedly inflicted in a police beating.  </P> <P> Among those expressing support for the strikers' cause have been several  prominent human rights activists and Tijuana Mayor Carlos Montejo Favela, who  even staged a symbolic hunger strike aimed at demonstrating his sympathy for  the prisoners' complaints.  </P> <P> Mexican officials have denied any abuse by federal police, contending that  inmates who say they were wrongly accused have the option of submitting  evidence of abuse to judges. The inmates contend that Mexican federal judges  are as corrupt as the federal police and are disinclined to listen to tales of  official wrongdoing.  </P> <P> The decision to suspend the strike and resume eating was made this past  weekend, after a government human rights official vowed that officials would  review the 30 disputed cases, said Valentin Tapia Aguilar, the leader of the  strikers. The human rights official, who met with the strikers at the  penitentiary, is a member of a national commission set up earlier this year by  Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who created the body in response  to complaints of abuse by federal police.  </P> <P> The strikers agreed to give government officials until next Tuesday to complete  their inquiry.  </P> <P> The strikers also have asked for a broader review of the cases of 763  non-striking inmates, most of whom were charged with drug trafficking, Tapia  said. They have expressed the hope that their strike could become a national  movement, leading to vast reforms of the Mexican criminal justice system.  </P></p>

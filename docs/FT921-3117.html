			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Management: The French disconnection - Chairmen of state-owned companies face an uncertain spring and summer in Paris as their contracts run out Many of France's top managers are bracing themselves for a spectacular game of musical chairs, umpired by the government. The game will open in the spring and summer and trickle on to December, as the chairmen of some 45 state-owned companies reach the end of their three-year terms. At stake is the senior management of such international heavyweights as the car-maker Renault, Bull, the computer group, Thomson, the electronics company, the chemicals group Rhone-Poulenc and aluminium producer Pechiney, among others. Preparations are already under way. Over the next month or two, the small circle of senior civil servants and cabinet ministers responsible will draw up the list of those they think should stay, move to another state company, or make way for new players. The final decisions rest with President Francois Mitterrand, perhaps not the ideal umpire for this game given his well-known lack of interest in industrial matters. All this might seem out of kilter with the increasingly competitive markets in which these companies compete. Yet it is only the most startling example of the public administration's role in who runs corporate France. Its influence is almost as strong, though not explicit, in who gets the top jobs in the private sector. Here the decisions are made through the complex networks of public administration elite, allied for life by their common education at the same prestigious civil service colleges, or grandes ecoles. Many senior French executives openly criticise the influence of the state and its institutions in the top jobs, a reflection of the more liberal mood in French boardrooms in recent years, as well as the pressure from talented executives who did not happen to go to the right schools and colleges. The extent to which the state bias in French management might be at a disadvantage against foreign competitors is analysed in detail in a recent comparison* of the method of selection of the chairmen of the top 200 French and German companies. It was carried out by Michel Bauer and Benedicte Bertin-Mourot of the CNRS state research centre, for leading headhunters Heidrich and Struggles. The study says that France's public service stars are better equipped to play at corporate 'monopoly' than to be professional entrepreneurs. They also tend to be hierarchically remote from their staff and have less experience of their companies and industries than their German counterparts. 'For companies seeking economic efficiency in a competitive environment, the French model looks like . . . a real handicap,' it concludes. The study shows that just over 44 per cent of France's top managers come from a predominantly state background, whether it be a grande ecole, ministerial cabinet, grands corps - an institutionalised civil service clan  -or political friendship. This is six times the level in Germany, where a background in industry is the dominant factor for nearly two-thirds of top managers. The weight of the grande ecoles alone is impressive: the three top schools produce more than half of France's top managers, yet the gilded trio - Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the Polytechnique and the HEC business school - produce only 800 graduates annually, a tiny sample from which to draw so much of the business elite. The study does not doubt that the grandes ecoles are good at producing stars, but it points out that German companies by definition choose their top people from a wider field and so have a better chance of finding exceptional managers. In Germany, no college domof the top managers have doctorates, equally split between law, economics and sciences. German companies are praised for favouring managers who have risen through the business after an industrial apprenticeship, are matey with their colleagues and know their industries. Senior German executives know they have a chance of getting to the top if they do their jobs well, a healthy system. But their French counterparts' knowledge that the top job will probably go to an outsider parachuted in from the public administration is a serious drag on motivation. This has a knock-on effect all the way along the hierarchical chain, it says. On the whole, French public sector job allocations have in recent years been made more on the players' management merits than was the case a decade ago. Few would criticise the professionalism of such as Alain Gomez at Thomson, Francis Mer at steel maker Usinor Sacilor, Jean Gandois at Pechiney, or Loik Le Floch-Prigent at Elf Aquitaine. Yet it is not unknown for political patronage to have some influence and this is an especially dicey factor to predict today, when the Socialist government is in serious trouble. It is no surprise that many public sector chairmen privately detest the three-year term rule, on the grounds that they hardly have time to get used to the job before the next reshuffle. This, they complain, is no recipe for inspired management at a time when their markets are dominated by decisions made in the US, Germany or Japan, rather than in Paris. Moreover, several state companies have recently picked up powerful foreign partners, who find the French system odd. So it is that Pehr Gyllenhammar, chairman of Swedish car-maker Volvo, is proving one of the main sources of pressure for state-owned companies' boards, rather than the government, to choose chairmen. He argues that Volvo, as owner of 15 per cent of Renault since 1990, deserves a say in the choice of successor to Raymond Levy after he retires as Renault chairman in May. An interesting row could be in the making here. A similar situation could be imagined at Bull, where NEC, the Japanese electronics company, became a small minority shareholder last year, and which is just about to sell another stake to IBM. The French government, cautiously open to change, is reflecting on limited reforms, like extending chairmen's contracts from three to five years, increasing worker consultation and inviting more professionals to replace the public worthies on state company boards. The current chairmen's mandate is 'too short in relation to what is going on in the rest of the world,' admits Dominique Strauss-Kahn, industry minister. One of the many other revealing comparisons in the Heidrich and Struggles study shows that 36 per cent of the chairmen of France's top 200 companies were catapulted straight into the job with no previous experience of the company, as against 16 per cent in Germany. Moreover, 32 per cent of Germany's top managers worked their way up from junior executive jobs, as against just 7 per cent for France's top managers. Of course, there are bound to be exceptions - and French management methods are changing fast. The point is that French management is still more different than many people think. * 'Les 200' en France et en Allemagne - deux modeles contrastes de detection-selection-formation de dirigeants de grandes entreprises.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 9 KYODO -- A private secretary of the  late former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka and a former publisher  of an economic information magazine mishandled investment of a  60 million yen fund of Prime Minister Morihiro hosokawa, sources  close to Hosokawa said Saturday [9 April].    Hosokawa on Friday abruptly announced he would step down,  saying "new suspicions" that investment of some of his personal  funds may have been unlawful.    The sources said Masatoshi Miyama, Hosokawa's former  financial secretary, entrusted the publisher with the investment  of 60 million yen with intermediation of Tanaka's former  secretary.    The secretary denied his involvement in the financial  transactions in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. The  publisher could not be reached for comment.    According to the sources, around 1981 Miyama asked Tanaka's  former secretary, an acquaintance of Miyama, for advice on  investing funds and Tanaka's secretary introduced the publisher  to Miyama.    At that time, Hosokawa was a House of Councillors member in  Tanaka's faction in the Liberal Democratic Party. The next  year, with Tanaka's backing, Hosokawa successfully ran in the  Kumamoto gubernatorial race.    The publisher was an investment consultant and was engaged  in  an illegal money-lending business, the sources said.    At first, the publisher was entrusted with more than 1  million yen and was later entrusted with the 60 million yen,  part of the money Hosokawa raised through sale of land inherited  in 1982, they said.    In 1991, when Miyama quit Hosokawa's office, he reportedly  told the office that the investment of the 60 million yen was  not a success and that only 10 million yen worth of shares were  left.    Hosokawa received some 202 million yen in 1982 as his  portion  of the sale of an estate in Suginami ward in Tokyo after he and  two of his relatives inherited the estate following the death of  their grandmother Chiyoko Konoe in September 1980.    After paying inheritance taxes and lending 64 million yen of  the money to one of his political fund-raising organizations,  Hosokawa entrusted the remaining 60 million yen to Miyama, the  sources said.    The opposition camp has demanded Miyama be summoned before  the Diet to testify on Hosokawa's finances. The premier has  repeatedly rejected the call.    Hosokawa told a news conference Friday that "from 1981 and  for several years, my office let a certain person use the fund,  and he gained personal profit from it. That person is an old  personal friend of mine."    "He specifically requested that money be entrusted to him,  because he would manage it for profit. But there were some  problems in the process of the management of that particular  fund."    He declined, however, to elaborate further on the specifics  of the new suspicions, saying an investigation by his political  office was still underway.</p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  BUILDER WINES, DINES WOULD-BE NEIGHBORS  </P> <P> Woodland Hills builder Jack Spound invited a whole neighborhood to a fancy  hotel dinner to line up backing for his controversial $150-million office  project at the edge of Warner Center. It is the subject of a crucial Los  Angeles Planning Commission hearing next week.  </P> <P> Spound asked all 850 members of the Woodland Hills Chamber of Commerce to stop  by the hotel for cocktails and hors d'oeuvres and to talk about supporting him  at the hearing. But foes of the proposed development criticized his  hospitality.  </P> <P> Spound said the Wednesday night dinner was a way of rewarding neighboring  residents of the Warner Hills condominium development who have backed his  "Warner Ridge" project, which he hopes to build in partnership with Johnson Wax  Development Corp. The condominium dwellers were treated to cocktails and a  dinner of veal with wild mushroom sauce and filet of salmon in the grand  ballroom of the Warner Center Marriott hotel. About 60 people were expected; 34  showed up.  </P> <P> "I don't consider it ethical," said Robert Gross, a vice president of the  Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization, whose neighborhood was not invited to  the dinner. "The wining and dining of selected local residents shows this  developer will stop at nothing to achieve his goal."  </P></p>

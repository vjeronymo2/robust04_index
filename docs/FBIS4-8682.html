			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Slovak President Michal Kovac with </F> unidentified correspondents and moderater after the first  meeting of Central European presidents at Litomysl Castle --  live]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Moderator] Floor to the  spokesman of Slovak President Kovac.    [Unidentified spokesman] A Slovak Television editor will ask  President Kovac a question.    [Correspondent, in Slovak] Much has been written about  Slovakia regarding relations between Slovakia and Hungary in the  context of Central European countries. From the outside these  relations might indeed appear rather dramatic, but the reality  is a little different. What, in your view, is the outlook for  the new coalition government being able to solve this problem?  I have in mind the resolution of Slovak-Hungarian relations.    [Kovac] As you know, questions of a general nature were  raised during the discussions so far. This does not mean,  however, that in this group of states we would underestimate  questions related to the minorities. As far as relations  between the Republic of Hungary and the Republic of Slovakia are  concerned, after the passage of some time, I am able to say  better times are in the offing. At the same time, it transpires  that the issue of national minorities, or perhaps the debate --  or rather the insufficient debate -- between the Hungarian and  Slovak Republics on this issue has made it possible to  exaggerate and dramatize the existing problem.    I firmly believe that given our efforts aimed at becoming  incorporated into the European integration, the issue of  national minorities in the Central European region will not be  an issue presenting a problem, and that we will manage to  successfully resolve it among ourselves, and that by doing so we  will, at the same time, demonstrate that we are capable of a  partnership coexistence in the Central European region. We will  thus secure for ourselves some kind of a passport for entering  the European integration. [passage omitted]    [Moderator] A question for President Kovac from an editor of  the Bratislava-based PRACA daily.    [Correspondent] [passage omitted] Foreign commentaries voice  views casting doubt on Slovakia's intention to integrate into  European economic, democratic, or security structures. As if by  chance, Slovakia is being left out regarding the Central  European Initiative. Do you think that there is any  justification for doing this?    [Kovac] On the whole I am not convinced that responsible  West  European state officials are intentionally leaving Slovakia out  as one of the possible candidates for West European integration.  [passage omitted]    The other thing is that the Slovakia's internal policy might  have provoked a certain lack of confidence as to whether the  political situation in the Slovak Republic was sufficiently  stable, whether political entities and governments linked to  them were a reliable guarantor of what was being declared. I  used every occasion, also when speaking with the gentlemen  present here, to stress that the internal instability caused by  the lack of a clear picture of individual political entities is  one thing, while the stability of the pluralistic system which  has been adopted and the Slovak Republic's foreign policy trends  are a different matter.    Following certain changes that have taken place, this issue  has now been clarified. I believe that all doubts will  disappear and that our partners will show trust in us and an  understanding of certain problems we have so far suffered, being  a new state. [passage omitted]</p>

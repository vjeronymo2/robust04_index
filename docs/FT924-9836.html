			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Ukraine may turn to six new N-reactors UKRAINE might bring six new nuclear reactors into operation as a partial solution to the Slav republic's mounting energy crisis and to combat dependence on increasingly expensive Russian oil. Mr Hryhory Hotovchets, the minister responsible for the Chernobyl clean up, said yesterday that although the Chernobyl nuclear power station will be closed down on schedule next year, six new reactors could be brought on line. A moratorium on the construction of the six unfinished reactors was declared by parliament just last year. 'Ukraine cannot manage without nuclear power, any more than many other countries,' said Mr Hotovchets. Ukraine's 14 operating nuclear reactors already provide up to 40 per cent of the country's energy supply.</p>

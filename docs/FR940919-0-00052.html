The required treatment standards for these wastes must be met before they are land disposed. EPA is also requiring ignitable characteristic wastes with a high total organic carbon (TOC) content and toxic characteristic pesticide wastes, that are being disposed in Class I nonhazardous waste injection wells, to either be injected into a well that is subject to a no-migration determination, or be treated by the designated LDR treatment method. Promulgation of these treatment standards for the newly identified and listed wastes and promulgation of the dilution prohibitions for high TOC ignitables and pesticides fulfills requirements of a proposed consent decree between EPA and the Environmental Defense Fund, and a settlement agreement between EPA, the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council, and a number of environmental groups including the Natural Resources Defense Council. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is also making a major improvement in the Land Disposal Restrictions program in order to simplify and provide consistency in the requirements. EPA is establishing a single set of requirements, referred to as universal treatment standards, that apply to most hazardous wastes. EPA is also simplifying the Land Disposal Restrictions program by reducing paperwork for the regulated community, and improving guidance to make compliance easier. EPA is also publishing clarifying guidance regarding treatability variances, which largely restates previous Agency statements. Finally, EPA is modifying the hazardous waste recycling regulations which will allow streamlined regulatory decisions to be made regarding the regulation of certain types of recycling activities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->  Effective date: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The final rule is effective on December 19, 1994.

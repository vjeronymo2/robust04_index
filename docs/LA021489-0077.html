			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A HELPING HAND;  </P> <P> L.A.'S TRAFFIC TRAINEES  </P> <P> The winter class of '89 is learning how to write parking citations, get  abandoned vehicles off the streets of Los Angeles and direct traffic. Above  all, says city parking administrator Robert Yates, traffic officer trainees are  being impressed "with the image they present to the public and the importance  of their roles in making sure we have traffic mobility."  </P> <P> The trainees -- who will work for the city's Department of Transportation, not  as sworn police officers -- spend two weeks studying city parking law, radio  communication, driving techniques and how to deal with motorists. They spend  another week in the streets learning traffic control. Each new traffic officer  is on six months' probation under the tutelage of a veteran.  </P></p>

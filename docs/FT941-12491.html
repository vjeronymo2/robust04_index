			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Markets: Lonrho keeps them guessing - The Bottom Line 'He has done everything we could reasonably have expected of him. But Lonrho is still a long way from being a mainstream investment for us because we still know so little about him.' These comments about Lonrho's joint chief executive, Dieter Bock, were made by the head of a substantial UK investment institution earlier this week after Lonrho published its first annual results since Bock joined the company early in 1993. His mission has been to make Lonrho - which, for 30 years, has been the vehicle of Tiny Rowland - into a more normal company. For all his skirmishes with Rowland over the past few months, Bock is not feeling too unhappy about progress. After all, he is sitting on an unrealised profit of more than Pounds 70m on his 18.8 per cent Lonrho shareholding. The share price rise, from a low of 59p in October 1992 to 155p yesterday, stems from some genuine changes at the company. The balance sheet has been strengthened by the sale of businesses and assets for Pounds 322m, reducing the ratio of net debt to equity from 57 per cent to 31 per cent. A complicated corporate structure has been simplified by focusing the company on four core divisions: mining, hotels, agriculture and general trading. Further dealings with Libya - in the form of a joint venture to finance a film about the Lockerbie bombing - have been halted. Finally, Bock has ended Rowland's domination of the board. First, he secured the appointment of three non-executive directors, the company's first for 20 years. Then, only a few days ago, he persuaded four long-serving executive directors - all of them above the normal retirement age at most other companies and all close supporters of Rowland - to step down. Even the expensive legal battle against the Fayed brothers over their 1985 purchase of House of Fraser, which cost Lonrho up to Pounds 5m in 1993 alone, has been ended following a highly theatrical reconciliation between Rowland and his long-standing adversaries. Further progress could be slower in coming, though. The company is still much less transparent than most because so many of its important businesses are in Africa (generating 90 per cent of profit from continuing operations last year) and depend to an indeterminable extent on Rowland's relationship with local rulers. Nor is Bock's strategy entirely clear. The general trade division is a catch-all, giving no clue to further asset disposals or future acquisitions. Lonrho's recent share price rises have been dictated to a large extent by estimates of net asset value which, including the company's 45 per cent shareholding in Ashanti Goldfields at market price, is probably in excess of 180p per share. But Bock has yet to demonstrate that he can increase revenues and profit margins: the return on assets from continuing operations was an unremarkable 6 per cent after tax last year. Even if profits from these continuing operations were to rise by 50 per cent to around Pounds 120m before tax this year, the shares would still be trading on a price/earnings ratio of more than 20, which is hardly cheap given the uncertainties. The balance sheet will be strengthened further in the coming months, however, by the stock market flotation of Ashanti. There is also a chance - given any resurgence in US inflationary pressures - that commodity companies such as Lonrho with its vast gold, platinum, coal and food interests could return to stock market fashion. The next stage in Bock's 'normalisation' campaign is to persuade investment institutions to end their near-boycott of the shares (they own around a third of the equity, a low proportion). One big institution has started recently to accumulate shares; but the choice of a new chairman to replace Rene Leclezio who is retiring, will be crucial in determing if other investors do the same. The institutions want someone with a background in international business whom they respect and who will have the time to visit all Lonrho's dispersed businesses. As one fund manager said: 'We want someone to kick the tyres.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanandaj (Kurdistan Prov.), May 12, IRNA -- The  situation in the northeastern Iraqi city of Sulaimaniya is  chaotic, sources close to the Islamic Movement of Iraqi  Kurdistan reported here today.    They added that sporadic clashes continue in northern Iraq  among the Kurdish groups.    They said that on Wednesday at Dyana and Rawndouz the  Kurdish  Hizbullah revolutionary forces led by Sheikh Adham Barzani have  regained control of Ziweh and Barziweh from the Patriotic Union  of Kurdistan (PUK).    The Islamic Movement of Iraqi Kurdistan said its forces  attacked Khormal, Rouzeh Biareh and Towaila in response to  recent aggressions of the Jalal Talebani led PUK.

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (13): Fun facts for all fanatics THE GUINNESS UK DATA BOOK Guinness Publishing, Pounds 9.99, 192 pages VITAL SIGNS - THE TRENDS THAT ARE SHAPING OUR FUTURE Earthscan Publications, Pounds 9.95, 144 pages BENJAMIN DISRAELI (or was it Mark Twain) is reputed to have observed: 'There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics.' But these two books attempt to dispel such cynicism. The Guinness UK Data Book is a notebook-sized reference source which will have instant appeal for trivia addicts, researchers and others fascinated by the minutiae of life in Britain in the 1990s. It is packed with 'essential facts and figures' which are intended to surprise as well as inform, and covers everything from geography and religion to sport and social trends. Fortunately it also comes with a reasonable index. For example, it is possible to discover that almost 30 gallons of water a day are used by each person in a household; that 63.4 per cent of the population are Anglicans but only 4 per cent practise their faith; and that the National Trust topped the list of charities with Pounds 55.73m in voluntary income in 1990. In contrast, Vital Signs is a reference book with a strong ecological message. Produced by Lester Brown, president of the Washington-based Worldwatch Institute, an independent research organisation, with researchers Christopher Flavin and Hal Kane, the book focuses on issues such as: what is happening to the world's fish catch? Third World debt, military expenditure and CFC production. Part one of the paperback describes 36 trends on double-paged spreads of text, data and graphs which part two contains short essays on important trends for which no historical or global data exists. Among its revelations: world bicycle production now outpaces car production three to one; 80 per cent of the world's 9,000 bird species are in decline, and world fertiliser use has dropped for an unprecedented two years in a row. It has a list of contents, but no index. Nevertheless it is well set out and easy to read and should appeal to a wide audience.</p>

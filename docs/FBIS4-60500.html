			<p>BFN     [Text] Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on agricultural  trade arrangements between Israel and the autonomy have begun at  Tel Aviv's Carlton Hotel.    Israel's delegation is headed by Agriculture Ministry  Director General Yehonatan Bashi, and the Palestinian delegation  is led by Khalid al-Qidrah, a PLO leader in the Gaza Strip, who  recently arrived from Tunis. The talks are aimed at working out  procedures for agricultural trade between Israel and the  autonomy and measures to make ascertain the quality of the  agricultural produce entering Israel. There is special concern  about the use of pesticides and the health of the animals in the  autonomy. Our correspondent notes that even before the talks  started it was decided that mutual agricultural trade will take  place only if the standards used in Israel are upheld in the  autonomy. Our correspondent recalls that under the autonomy  agreement, the borders will be opened to free passage of  agricultural produce, except for five sectors, in which  temporary quotas have been introduced. These are: tomatoes,  potatoes, cucumbers, eggs, and spring chickens. There is no  doubt that hoof-and-mouth disease, which has recently been  uncovered in Jericho, and ways to prevent it from spreading,  will undoubtedly come up in the talks.</p>

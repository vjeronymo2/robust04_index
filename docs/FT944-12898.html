			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Eggar supports Europe Britain outside the European Union would be 'just an irrelevance', Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, warned in the Commons yesterday in dismissing suggestions that withdrawal was a viable option. He did not dispute assertions by Labour MPs that his words were principally aimed at Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, who recently branded as 'simplistic' those who argue that such a course is unthinkable. Mr Stuart Bell, a Labour industry spokesman, said that although Mr Lamont's name had not been mentioned he was the 'ghost at the feast'. Mr Eggar cited Britain's success in attracting inward investment - which amounted to Pounds 200bn in 1991 and is excelled only by the US - as evidence of the benefits stemming from being 'at the heart of Europe'. He said the government's success in excluding Britain from the European Union's social chapter meant there were no barriers to flexible working hours. Mr Eggar denied that the discretionary grants available to industry through regional selective assistance were under threat because of criticism from Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, in his earlier role as chief secretary to the Treasury. Mr Bell claimed that Mr Eggar had underlined the extent of the Tory splits over Europe: extending from Mr Lamont and other Euro-sceptics on the back benches, to Mr Portillo in the cabinet. Labour would 'sign-up' to the full social chapter, said Mr Bell, denying that inward investment would then decline.</p>

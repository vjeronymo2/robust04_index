			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 14 January -- Two deputy chairmen of the  upper chamber of parliament were elected today at a session of  the Federation Council of the Russian Federal Assembly. They  were Ramazan Abdulatipov, first deputy minister for  nationalities affairs and regional policy, and Valeryan  Viktorov, chairman of the Chuvash republic Council of Ministers.    A third deputy speaker was not elected because neither of  the  two nominees for this post -- Petr Romanov, general director of  the "Yenisey" association, and Aleksandr Kovalev, head of the  administration of Voronezh Oblast -- succeeded in acquiring the  required majority of votes. As proposed by Federation Council  Chairman Viktor Shumeyko, the elections for the third deputy  were held over until the next meeting of the chamber.    The Federation Council is now debating the question of  forming parliamentary committees. Work is proceeding in a calm  and businesslike manner.</p>

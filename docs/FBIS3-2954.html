Wang Jue, an economics professor at the Beijing-based Party  School of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, said  that in instituting a modern enterprise system, major state  enterprises will have multiple principal holders of their  property rights, instead of just one principal holder, that is,  the state.    The change is vital to the success of enterprise  restructuring, said Wang, who is attending the current session  of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference.    Under a planned economy, a state enterprise operated as a  subsidiary of a government administrative department, without  the status of a legal entity, he said. [sentence as received]    According to Wang, in fact, the transformation of their  operational mechanism by state enterprises means turning state  property into the property of a legal entity.    "The state will sever its administrative ties with  enterprises by permitting legal entities to invest in  enterprises. Only in this way can we increase enterprises'  competitiveness," he said.    The government may either entrust investment companies to  operate state-owned property or lease such property to these  companies, he said.    These companies will become legal entities entrusted by the  state to make sure that state-owned property will not be  infringed and will increase in value, he explained.    The economist also stressed the importance of separating the  ownership of the investor (the state) from that of a legal  entity (an enterprise).    Under given conditions, the ownership of the investor takes  the form of holding the stock right by the investor, he said.    That means that as a shareholder, the investor should have  the right to receive returns from its assets and to participate  in making policy decisions and choosing managers, he explained.    As a result, the investor will become a shareholder of the  enterprise, represent the people or perform the duties of a  property owner on behalf of the state, he said.    "Therefore, state enterprises will not change their nature,  but will change their managerial and operational methods only,"  he noted.    Only thus is it possible to create necessary conditions for  the establishment of a modern enterprise system, he said.    It is very difficult for major state enterprises to solve  such problems as unemployment resulting from the transformation  of their operational mechanism, he said.    According to Wang Jue, the solution to such problems lies in  taking comprehensive measures by both the government and society.    First of all, the state should assist a number of key  enterprises in expanding their capacity and providing more jobs.    Second, the state should earmark funds to help retirees,  veteran workers and the disabled solve their problems in their  livelihood.    "In my opinion, the money should not be given to  individuals,  but should be used to invest in joint-stock companies so as to  draw dividends," he said.    Third, it is necessary to encourage some workers to shift to  the service sector.    The economist also emphasized the need to establish more  foundations and various other organizations to alleviate the  burden of state enterprises in running social welfare.    "I am sure that with the implementation of these  supplementary reform measures, major state-owned enterprises  will certainly be able to operate efficiently," he said.</p>

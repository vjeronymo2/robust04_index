			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME urged to tighten its rules after Chilean losses A call for the London Metal Exchange to introduce more stringent rules was made last night by Mr Juan Villarzu, president of Codelco, the state-owned Chilean copper group that last year lost about USDollars 200m on metals trading. Using the LME's annual dinner to launch his appeal, Mr Villarzu expressed particular concern about the exchange's system of 'carries at historical prices'. He said: 'Had you the opportunity to examine the trading contracts which Codelco entered into during 1993, you would have been amazed at the number of transactions whose prices had no direct relationship with the market prices ruling at the date and time of the transaction.' He suggested that the LME's most valuable asset - its credibility - was possibly being jeopardised by 'the abuse of certain practices which came to our attention while examining our last year's futures trading'. Mr Villarzu also called for producers and consumers to be given a bigger share in the running of the LME. Replying immediately, Mr Raj Bagri, the LME chairman, said that if any member had misused the historical price carries system 'we will not hesitate to take appropriate action'. However, market users could not be absolved from their responsibilities. 'Failure of controls, supervision or systems at their end will not be an acceptable excuse for aiding and abetting any misuse of our markets by their staff or management,' he declared. Mr Bagri pointed out that the breakneck speed at which derivatives and futures trading had taken root and spread across the full spectrum of financial and commodity markets 'has in many instances left managements far behind in having in place adequate, effective and timely supervisory measures to monitor and control risks'. Nevertheless, the LME hoped to have in place by early next year measures 'to limit any perceived dangers of historical price carries'. Mr Bagri said where heavy losses had been suffered from its derivative and futures trading, the LME had responded constructively to requests for co-operation from any properly constituted organisation investigating those losses.</p>

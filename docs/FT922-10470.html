			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Papers battle for black readers THE circulation battle among newspapers aimed at Britain's black population will be heightened with today's launch of The Weekly Journal, the first broadsheet newspaper targeted at the growing young black middle class, with a potential readership of 1.1m. Black readers are already served by at least four other papers. The 10-year-old tabloid weekly The Voice has a circulation of 47,000, double that of the Caribbean Times, its nearest rival. Black Briton claims weekly sales of 20,000. The Weekly Gleaner, owned by Gleaner Group of Jamaica, and first published in the UK in 1951, has a circulation of 15,000. Most of these papers rely on the public sector for the bulk of their advertising. The Weekly Journal is owned by Voice Communications, publishers of The Voice, which is being challenged by Black Briton, a middle-market tabloid launched last August by a former assistant editor of The Voice. The Voice reacted to the launch of Black Briton with a hastily arranged reorganisation, new features and an advertising campaign. Reporters say they were threatened with legal action if they left The Voice and joined Black Briton within a year. Former staff members who had agreed to join Black Briton - and in some cases had started work on it - were lured back with greatly enhanced financial packages. Critics say The Weekly Journal was devised as a spoiler. With a print run of 40,000, it is aimed at young, educated, upwardly mobile blacks in the ABC1 socio-economic groups. Under its main title, a strapline says 'For today's Black Briton'. Mr Diran Adebayo, a former journalist on The Voice who left the paper last year and now works for the BBC, said the new title 'was conceived as a spoiler. The only strong reason for its launch is to counter Black Briton.' Mr Val McCalla, chairman of Voice Communications, said: 'The launch of Black Briton did act as a catalyst for the launch of the new paper. It became clear after Black Briton's launch that it was not satisfying the market. 'There is a gap in the market for a more authoritative, reliable and informative broadsheet from a black viewpoint such as The Journal. Black Briton is not right for that market. It is just trying to replicate The Voice.' Mr Joseph Harker, publisher and editor of Black Briton, said of Mr McCalla's new venture: 'I think he's on a loser and I'd advise him to put his money elsewhere.' The new paper is launched against a background of the continuing recession in advertising. Nevertheless, Mr McCalla says he is prepared to support The Weekly Journal for 'as long as it takes to make it a success'. Mr Werbayne McIntyre, a partner at WM&amp;P, a black advertising and marketing consultancy, said: 'Judging by the advertising in Black Briton, if it doesn't increase its advertising revenue, it is difficult to see how it will sustain itself.' Mr McIntyre believes that there is a place for a paper such as The Weekly Journal and says that it should survive, especially if it can attract display advertising from the private sector.</p>

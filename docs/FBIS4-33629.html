			<p>BFN     [Text] The provisional government would like to keep its  distance from the legislators who appointed it. Do not impose  your work pace on us. We are in a special situation, involved  in a struggle, which was lost in advance, stated Minister of the  Interior and National Defense Willio Nouailles, who was invited  to appear on 6 June by a group of senators. He said he wished  the senators would give the government time to act as needed at  this juncture. Edner Jean filed a report:    [Begin recording] [Jean] The first case discussed by the  office of Senator Sansaricq was security, including cliches  about corpses being devoured by pigs after having been murdered  by armed civilians. Romel Manigat, president of the Interior and  National Defense Commission, asked Minister Willio Nouailles  about the executions committed by political and paramilitary  formations as well as the overly brutal interventions by the  agents of order, who are in some cases known to all. Another  question raised by the commission was the measures the  provisional government intends to take to force awareness of  their responsibility on those who need it, in view of  guaranteeing national sovereignty, which is being threatened.    Regarding the boat people, the provisional government has  just reactivated the decree repressing clandestine trips. Is  this a test to make Washington yield, asked Romel Manigat, whose  election has been contested. What are the duties of the Armed  Forces in this case, he also asked.    Regarding 1994 elections, the Interior and National Defense  Commission considers that the provisional government is already  late with its electoral agenda. Some arrangements should have  been made before parliament reopened to proceed to an immediate  start of the electoral process, according to the Senate led by  Bernard Sansaricq. To all these questions, the minister of the  interior responds that it is not a question of opening a box and  coming out with a ready-made solution. Do not tell us what to  do, just let us do it, he exclaimed. The minister of the  interior of the ad hoc government further warned those  legislators against any attempts to influence Judge Emile  Jonassaint's policy. May each one work in the fields that he  knows, he maintained. Moreover, Willio Nouailles added, and I  quote: You have forced us into the ring, but please, let us act,  let us have our own experiences. He offered a good political  mathematics lesson to those legislators in terms of equations  and tangents:    [Nouailles] It is necessary to make an equation, with at  least eight unknowns. It is necessary to calculate intensities.  It is necessary to make charts of variables. It is necessary to  draw some curves. You want a muscular policy, an epidermic  policy, a pocket policy. I indeed notice this haste, this great  haste. Your president is a patriarch of 82 years. The pace that  you impose on him is the kind that can break his neck. Haste is  a bad adviser in this type of ruse. In any case, after eight  years of drift, I would not want to see you impose on the  provisional government the burden, all the weight, the entire  cross of this huge, [word indistinct], tragedy. You must  understand that this ad hoc government that you have formed  finds itself [word indistinct] on a creation mission.    [Jean] Willio Nouailles thus demands more time to pursue his  creative work. The government intends to create new democratic  structures in the country and to take all the time necessary to  prepare for future elections. Willio Nouailles stated before the  Senate led by Bernard Sansaricq that the government is an ad hoc  government, set up by an ad hoc senate for the national  safeguard. The minister of the interior reminded them that the  Senate was split in two and that the government did not have the  recognition of the Chamber of Deputies.    Regarding the threats of foreign intervention, the minister  of the interior and national defense said history honors us to  fight the whole world. He added, however, one can be Dessalines  or Capois La-Mort, but Vertieres is no longer possible in 1994.  To the office led by Bernard Sansaricq, the minister of the  interior and national defense exclaimed in these terms, quote:  You have entrusted me with a battle that was lost in advance.  Unquote. And so as not to leave room for the enemy, Willio  Nouailles thinks he can still use the arm of dialectic.    [Nouailles] For a small country like Haiti, its struggle is  dialectic, a philosophical struggle, a conceptualist struggle, a  struggle at the level of methodology, at the analysis level. It  is not a struggle in either open or closed fields. Even a  guerrilla war is now impossible.    [Jean] In general, Willio Nouailles pleaded at length for  the  undertaking of power by the middle classes. In this respect, he  praised the exploits of Dumarsais Estime and Francois Duvalier.  Modern history makes the middle class accountable for politics  in Haiti. He criticized the traditional bourgeoisie for having,  according to him, formed a parallel government for the purpose  of ruining the efforts of the provisional government. He was  here referring to the ad interim Prime Minister Robert Malval.  The minister of the interior and national defense further  pointed out that it is up to the Army to determine the social  class qualified to take power in Haiti. [end recording]</p>

According to statistics, Tibet approved 41 co-operation  projects with other parts of China and overseas countries and  regions last year, introducing more than 100 million yuan (about  11.5 million U.S. dollars) in contractual investment.    Officials said that the projects are mainly in the sectors  of  communications, transportation, light industry, textiles,  machinery, electronics, commerce and trade.    Last year, Tibet also received a total of 40 million U.S.  dollars in loans from the United Nations, foreign governments  and civilian organizations for some 30 of its development  projects.    The autonomous region's foreign trade hit a record 100  million U.S. dollars-worth in 1993.    The officials said that Tibet has in recent years set up a  group of showcase enterprises in coastal areas, such as Hainan  Province and Tianjin and Shenzhen cities, in a bid to get aboard  the country's bandwagon of economic take-off.    The region has meanwhile launched a campaign to open up and  expand economic and trade relations with neighboring countries.  It has promulgated a set of policies to attract and regulate  foreign investment.    Starting in 1992, investors from Hong Kong, the United  States, Japan, Germany, Nepal and Malaysia have flocked to this  once- neglected but promising region in southwest China.    The officials said that some of the projects have gone into  production and begun showing profits, while others are still  under construction.    They said that more than 20 of China's provinces,  municipalities and autonomous regions have established economic  ties with Tibet, pouring in more than 100 million yuan (about  11.5 million U.S. dollars) every year. In addition, they have  set up economic entities in Tibet.    Experts say that the ever-increasing ties between Tibet and  the rest of the country as well as the outside world has in part  eased a decades-long fund shortage and introduced technology,  management and information, which, in turn, have pumped vigor  into the Tibetan economy.</p>

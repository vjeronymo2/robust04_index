			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Further redundancies expected at Swan Hunter MORE REDUNDANCIES are expected to be announced today at Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder. News of three-figure job losses is likely this morning when receivers Price Waterhouse meet union leaders. Since Swans went into receivership on May 13, following its failure to win a crucial helicopter carrier order from the Ministry of Defence, it has shed almost 750 jobs, reducing its workforce to 1,700. More cuts are expected partly because three weeks ago the company lost a Pounds 50m Oman patrol boat order to French rival Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie. Union sources said 100 Swans jobs depended on the order. In addition, one of the three Type 23 navy frigates which are Swans' only current work is due for completion in a month. Unions and local MPs fighting to save Swans say that the loss of key staff and the break-up of teams of workers will make it less attractive to prospective buyers. But it is understood that potential bidders, keen to avoid large redundancy bills, are waiting for further job cuts. Mr Tommy Brennan, Tyne chairman of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, said: 'They're playing a waiting game.' Swans, he said, was now near the minimum 'critical mass' needed to maintain it as a shipbuilder. Yesterday the CSEU and Labour MPs and MEPs set out their case to the European Commission for Swan Hunter to become eligible for intervention funding by redesignation as a mixed yard. Intervention funding, from which UK warship yards are barred gives access to a 9 per cent subsidy on merchant shipbuilding orders.</p>

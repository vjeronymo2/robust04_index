			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Japan 'regrets' fisheries deal JAPAN has expressed its regret about an agreement between Russia and South Korea for South Korea to fish in waters near the Russian-held Kurile Islands which are claimed by Japan, Stefan Wagstyl reports from Tokyo. The islands, which lie off the northern coast of Japan, were seized by the Soviet Union at the end of the Second World War and have since been the subject of a territorial dispute. Tokyo hopes the end of the Cold War could lead to serious negotiations with Moscow over the islands. But Russian leaders have yet to go beyond expressing wishes for a peaceful settlement of the dispute.</p>

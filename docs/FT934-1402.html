			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Books: Fantasist of great rigour THE ROAD TO SAN GIOVANNI by Italo Calvino, translated by Tim Parks Jonathan Cape Pounds 12.99, 150 pages If in adult life you are going to become a writer, San Remo on the Italian Riviera seems to be as good a place to be brought up in as any other. This posthumous book reveals how well it served Italo Calvino (1923-1985) as a playground for childhood and adolescence. It makes one ask whether San Remo's role as a holiday resort, as a fun place, accounts for some of the fantastic invention, the ludic element taken to extremes, that is so ubiquitous a feature of Calvino's fiction. Up to now San Remo has been little more than an entry in Calvino's curriculum vitae, along with the fact that he was actually born in Cuba of Italian parents, both of whom were scientists, while always regarding San Remo as his 'real' birthplace. His experience during the second world war as a partisan in the Italian Resistance in the surrounding countryside is reflected in his early work. After the war when Calvino was still in his early twenties he graduated at the University of Turin with a thesis on Conrad and then began a career in publishing combined with writing. Calvino's creative talent was recognised by Cesare Pavese who promoted his work, and with the publication of tales like Il visconte dimezzato (The Cloven Viscount) in 1952, Calvino's reputation as someone who could sustain a far-fetched fantasy with the logical rigour of a mathematician was secure. Comparisons with Lewis Carroll as well as Borges abounded. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, thanks to sensitive translators like Archibald Coloquhon and William Weaver, Calvino's work acquired a considerable following in the UK and the US. In trying to explain the nature of his fiction to English-speaking readers, Calvino once made the interesting linguistic point that: 'There are two different words in English, novel and romance, for what in Italian is always called a romanzo'. It is romance given the surface gloss of realism that is his favourite form. The writer in our tradition to whom Calvino felt especially close was RL Stevenson. The 'Cloven Viscount' is a medieval version of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. But now with the publication of these short pieces composed at various times as The Road to San Giovanni, we have a direct attempt on his part to reconstruct the world of his childhood in the manner of Proust. If as a novelist Calvino occupies a frontier between fantasy and reality, he reveals in the title-piece that the family house where he was raised also looked two ways. It 'was situated, in an area once known as 'French Point', on the last slopes at the foot of San Pietro Hill, as though at the border between two continents'. Below was the town with the seafront and harbour offering escapism; above were the hills and the land cultivated by his father, a botanist and a farmer. When the hobnail-booted Calvino senior ascended the rugged path to his fields he had the air of a man entering his kingdom. The boy Italo would toil along after him, already conscious that his domain lay not among the mountain flora whose names he could never remember, but down below, oriented on such landmarks as the cupola of the Prince Amadeus Municipal Theatre. The immemorial estrangement between father and son is seen in this essay through landscape and townscape. It is complemented by the next one - 'A Cinema-Goer's Autobiography' - where the writer describes how he did manage through constant truancy to inhabit his own chosen space peopled by the stars of pre-war Hollywood. This was before the days of Technicolor and the monochrome effect enhanced the magic. It all came to a stop in 1938 when Mussolini banned American films. But by then the cinema had fulfilled its function of confirming him in his commitment to the imagination as a way of life. He was to return to the cinema as an adult during its post-war renaissance in Italy, and he honours his debt to Fellini as a source of inspiration. Before that there was the war and Calvino dredges up some painful 'Memories of A Battle' when in retreating from a village in the Maritime-Pre-Alps one of his comrades was killed. Then in 'La Poubelle Agreee' the scene switches to post-war Paris where Calvino now a successful man of letters is living with his wife. His contribution to the domestic equilibrium is to empty the rubbish every day into la poubelle agreee: it is left untranslated because it defies an accurate rendering - 'the pleasing or approved rubbish-bin' - the point being that no rubbish will be collected unless it is deposited in such a poubelle. The regulation sets in train a meditation on western civilisation in which garbage disposal (including the junking of early drafts of literary work) is seen as its essential ritual. Finally 'From the Opaque' carries this Calvinoesque exploiting of a master-metaphor into the realm of the cosmos where shadow and sunlight are presented as over-riding all other conditions of being. The translation of this poetic piece must have presented Tim Parks with his greatest problems; but the whole book reads most elegantly; it represents a series of charming footnotes to the work of a major modern writer.</p>

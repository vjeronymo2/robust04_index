			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BREAKFAST, BERGEN AND 'BULL'  </P> <P> "Breakfast at Tiffany's" with Audrey Hepburn was a successful movie in 1961,  but these days the meal can be had for the high bid at a celebrity auction.  </P> <P> For the right price, a buyer can enjoy breakfast with Hepburn at the tony  Manhattan store.  </P> <P> All proceeds will benefit the Manhattan Center for the Living, a nonprofit  group that assists people with life-threatening illnesses.  </P> <P> "They very sweetly contacted me and asked if I would help," Hepburn said this  week of the auction. "It was so easy to accept. I don't have to do anything but  come up here and have breakfast."  </P> <P> The event is billed as a "Celebrity Fantasy Auction," and other big names are  joining Hepburn. Bidders can also buy lunch with actress Candice Bergen, drinks  with NBC anchorman Tom Brokaw or a night at Shea Stadium with Susan Sarandon  and Tim Robbins, co-stars of the baseball film "Bull Durham."  </P> <P> The auction will take place March 4 at the Manhattan Center for the Living.  </P></p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Fashion: The global wardrobe in the office - Paris There is only one absolutely essential accessory to wear to the office in Paris, and no self-respecting French businessman, or woman, would dream of being seen without it. It is, of course, the strip of red silk sewn into your lapel which tells the world that your contribution to French culture, politics or industry has been deemed important enough for the government to award a legion d'honneur. Red silk aside, the only sartorial rule for the French executive is spruceness; scuffed shoes and dowdy suits simply will not do. An intense interest in clothes might still be seen as frivolous in the corporate corridors of London or New York, but in Paris it is a sign of self-respect. But though the general standard of dress may be smarter for French men, it is also less formal, with snappier styles and brighter colours. Even a bastion of the establishment like Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, livens up his suits with pink shirts and red socks. The younger generation plump for Giorgio Armani linens or for Commes des Garcons' less outre looks. The female equivalent to Mr Balladur is Simone Veil, the social affairs minister, who is rarely without one of her perfectly preserved Chanel suits. Whatever her age, the professional Parisienne will almost certainly sport a pair of flat Prada pumps - so practical for those purposeful prowls along the corridors of power - and one of Hermes business-like Birkin bags, anything big enough to carry her A4 files.</p>

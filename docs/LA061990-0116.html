			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP SEEKS BAN ON A COMMON CHEMICAL  </P> <P> An environmental group called on the Bush Administration Monday to participate  in an international effort to phase out a commonly used chemical that is  depleting the ozone layer.  </P> <P> The Natural Resources Defense Council also urged consumers to avoid buying 141  products, ranging from artists' varnishes to hornet-killing sprays, that  contain the chemical 1,1,1-trichloroethane.  </P> <P> Chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, have been singled out as the most potent  ozone-destroying substances. But the council said 1,1,1, as it is known for  short, is responsible for a large share of ozone depletion because it is  produced in such large quantities.  </P> <P> About 724 million pounds of 1,1,1 were produced in 1988 by DOW Chemical, PPG  Industries, and Vulcan Chemical, according to the NRDC.  </P> <P> The group said 90% of the chemical is used in industrial solvents. Consumer  goods that contain it include Scotchgard fabric protectors manufactured by  Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing of St. Paul, Minn.  </P> <P> "For most applications, there are alternative products on the market that serve  the same purpose" both in industry and individual homes, the NRDC said.  </P> <P> Representatives of 70 nations will open a 10-day meeting in London on Wednesday  to consider revisions to an international agreement that freezes production and  consumption of CFCs at their 1986 level. The pact, known as the Montreal  Protocol, also calls for a 50% reduction in CFCs by 1998.  </P> <P> "The most difficult decisions remaining relate to 1,1,1-trichloroethane," said  David D. Doniger, director of the NRDC's ozone protection project. He said  options under consideration range from a 25% rollback to a complete phase-out  in the next 10 years.  </P></p>

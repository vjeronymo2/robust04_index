			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTH HOLLYWOOD BASEBALL COACH HIRED  </P> <P> Marty Biegel, a 67-year-old retired teacher from the L. A. Unified School  District, has been hired to coach the North Hollywood High baseball team, the  school announced Monday.  </P> <P> Biegel replaces Brian York, who resigned before the 1989 season after breaking  an ankle. Fred Grimes, the school's football coach, directed the team to a 3-17  record in York's absence.  </P> <P> When he retired from Fairfax High in 1983, Biegel left a 28-year teaching  career that included 17 years as a coach.  </P> <P> He started as coach of the B basketball team in 1966 and moved to the varsity  in 1969, where he stayed through '75. After two seasons as an assistant at Cal  State Los Angeles, he returned to the Fairfax program in 1979 for two more  seasons.  </P> <P> He also worked as the junior varsity baseball coach at Fairfax for six years,  the last two in the '82-83 seasons.  </P> <P> Biegel played baseball at the University of Colorado in 1942 before serving in  World War II.  </P> <P> He is a 1951 graduate of Hunter College in New York City and readily points out  that he is "67 and a half." He cited his desire to work with the players as the  reason for resuming his coaching career.  </P> <P> "There are a bunch of kids waiting for someone who cares. . . . I can help some  kids who didn't do well last year," he said.  </P> <P> Neil Stone, an assistant principal at North Hollywood who coached with Biegel  at Fairfax, said Biegel will bring enthusiasm to the Husky athletics program.  </P> <P> "He's a feisty guy and is extremely competitive. He'll bring a breath of fresh  air to the department," he said.  </P> <P> The school also hired Mike Rauseo to serve as a walk-on assistant to Biegel.  </P></p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / China taking fast lane to economic reform: The first party conference since Tiananmen Square opens next week NEXT Monday the 1,991 Communist Party officials who govern China's 1.2bn people gather in Beijing for the party's five-yearly conference. They will elect 20 men and women who will have day-to-day responsibility for China's development over the next five years. This is the first meeting of the party since June 4, 1989, when the People's Liberation Army suppressed pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, leaving hundreds, perhaps thousands, dead and China's international image in tatters. Yet, as the delegates assemble in the Great Hall of the People, located on that square, they can be forgiven for feeling a little smug. Three years after the blood letting in Tiananmen, life has returned to a semblance of normality and the economy is growing rapidly. Foreigners, whose governments shunned China's leaders, are scrambling over themselves to invest; tourists are returning in droves. Internationally, China has regained much of what was lost in the immediate aftermath of Tiananmen. Most sanctions have been lifted; this year alone diplomatic relations have been opened with Israel, a host of central Asian republics, and, most recently, South Korea. Later this month Emperor Akihito of Japan will pay a state visit. The collapse of the Soviet Union last year, however, looms large over next week's congress, the 14th in the party's 71-year history. It left China standing exposed as the last communist state of any consequence. The nation's leaders, secluded behind the high walls of Zhongnanhai, Beijing's Kremlin, were reduced to a state of shock. Deng Xiaoping, the 88-year-old senior leader, seized the moment. The lessons he was quick to learn from the Soviet Union's demise were distilled in an internal party document circulated after his tour of southern China in January. Deng said economic reform had to be pursued vigorously and living standards raised if the Communist Party was to retain power; at the same time social and political controls had to be strengthened. In short, Deng gave a ringing endorsement to perestroika without glasnost. Few analysts hold out any hope that the congress will initiate any political reforms; it is expected to focus on the economy and its further deregulation. The results of the past 13 years of reform, as Deng has pointed out, have astonished the world. China's economy has more than doubled in size. On current trends it will double again by the end of the century. Last year real gross domestic product grew by 7 per cent. This year, after three years of self-imposed restraint, it may well rise by more than 10 per cent. Moreover, the congress is expected to endorse plans for the rapid modernisation of the economy. This may well be translated into a target of 9 per cent or 10 per cent annual growth for the rest of the decade. During the first half of 1992, China's annual growth rate was more than 12 per cent. Industrial production rose by 18 per cent a year; consumer spending was up 14 per cent. The rapid growth in the economy was, however, fuelling inflation and harming the balance of payments. By the middle of this year China's inflation rate was rising by 5 percentage points a year. The national figures, however, disguise inflationary pressures in the cities, where politically they matter most. Challenges to the central government's authority have traditionally been most strong in the cities at times of high inflation. For the first half of the year, prices were rising in the big cities at more than 15 per cent a year. Since June they have been growing at up to 20 per cent. This year's acceleration in the inflation rate has raised fears that China may be experiencing another of its 'boom-bust' economic cycles. The last 'bust' was in 1988/89 when credit was virtually halted and growth dropped sharply. The extent to which the inflation reflects excess of demand and/or structural supply rigidities in the economy - as it did in 1988 - or the effects of price reform is difficult to determine. Already this year China has lifted price controls on 648 types of industrial commodities, from high quality steel to glass and some machinery parts, leaving 89 subject to control. As rapid growth took off this year, imports began to rise and the surplus on China's trade account of the balance of payments began to contract. In the first six months of this year, China's trade surplus was running at an annual rate of Dollars 5bn, compared with Dollars 8bn in 1991 and Dollars 8.7bn in 1990. On current trends, China could have a trade deficit in 1993. The prospect of a trade deficit should not, in theory, give rise to concern. For a developing country like China, a current account deficit can be desirable if imports go to improving the nation's infrastructure and not to satisfying consumer desires. Moreover, with foreign reserves of more than Dollars 40bn, such a deficit should be manageable. There is, however, anecdotal evidence that part of the import bill is going towards satisfying consumer needs. In Hong Kong, Mercedes Benz cars are disappearing from the streets at the rate of three a day to be smuggled by high speed boats to China. In spite of the successes of the past 13 years, however, the legacy of central planning and Mao's penchant for massive industrial complexes - the Chinese version of 'Stalinist giantism' - weighs heavily on the economy. State industry, a third of which could be profitable, still accounts for more than 50 per cent of China's industrial output. This industry - which in 1980 accounted for around 75 per cent of industrial output - is growing painfully slowly and is dependent for its survival on subsidies. Over the six years to 1991 the industrial output of state industries grew by about 7.5 per cent a year. This compares with 50 per cent growth a year for private and foreign-funded companies and about 18 per cent a year for collectively-owned companies - enterprises run at the village or township level and outside the control of the central government. But instead of dealing with state industry - much of which in a rational economy would be shut down - there are signs that the government has simply shifted the burden of subsidies from the budget to the banking system, or, equally worrying, has been powerless to stop the banks from lending. Investment by state companies in fixed assets by mid-year was growing at an annual rate of more than 35 per cent, fuelled by loans by state banks which totalled Yuan125.6bn (Pounds 13bn) - more than twice the planned level of advances of Yn60bn. This investment has led to higher output, but how much of it found its way to market is moot. By the end of June stockpiles of unsold goods produced by state companies stood at Yn139bn, 23 per cent higher than at the beginning of the year. The behaviour of the banking system also underlines one of the central weakness of reform: China has few levers of macro-economic management. This is the consequence of an unprecedented decentralisation of economic decision-making without any strengthening of central government macro-economic controls. Beijing has done little to develop a proper banking system and monetary policy: interest rates are virtually meaningless and quantitative controls on credit have weakened in the face of pressures provincial leaders put on bank managers to lend to local industry. On his tour of southern China earlier this year, Deng enunciated a set of ideas which are expected to be enshrined by next week's congress. The most important is that of the 'socialist market economy'. This gives theoretical justification to many of the changes planned, especially in the area of state industry and the further deregulation of prices. The congress is expected to redefine state industry from being 'state-run' to 'state-owned'. . This will pave the way for a separation of ownership from management. Managers will become 'independent' from their controlling ministry; managers will be given complete control over business policy, including remuneration and the hiring, firing and promotion of employees. Significantly, the party will permit company insolvencies. China will also press ahead with share ownership and the development of capital markets; it may also encourage the development of large scale industrial groups. Since the mid-1980s many foreign economists involved in advising China have been suggesting ways for it to reform the state sector. The creation of profit-seeking, rather than output-oriented, enterprise groups is one idea that gained widespread support and it is a model that may be endorsed by the congress. Price reform is also expected to be embraced. With the economy growing strongly and incomes rising, it is thought that now is the best time to push ahead with reform of prices. These are some of the areas which China's leaders are expected to attack. But crucially in a country like China were the person is as important as the policy, the composition of the leadership will determine the vigour with which the plans are enacted. Next week, reformists may get their policies accepted on paper, but unless they emerge dominant from the congress they may find them very difficult to carry out.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OWNERS UNVEIL REVENUE-SHARING PLAN;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: TEAM OFFICIALS ALSO SCHEDULE A MEETING FOR FEB. 9 TO CONSIDER SPRING  TRAINING LOCKOUT.  </P> <P> With baseball's owners scheduled to meet Feb. 9 to decide on a spring training  lockout, their Player Relations Committee presented an outline of its  revenue-sharing concept to representatives of the Major League Players Assn.  during collective-bargaining talks Wednesday in New York.  </P> <P> Aimed at eliminating arbitration for players with zero to six years of service  and protecting clubs in smaller markets, the revenue-sharing plan calls for all  salaries of players in the zero-to-six category to be shared equally by the 26  clubs and for those salaries to be determined by performance statistics.  </P> <P> The union was aware of that basic framework but had also been interested in  learning how the committee would define revenue and how much of that revenue  would be shared with the players on a salary basis.  </P> <P> While neither side would confirm it, the PRC plan apparently calls for 48% of  the owners' gate and media (TV-radio) income to be shared with the players on a  salary basis.  </P> <P> "They are excluding concessions, parking, licensing and a number of other  income sources," Don Fehr, the union's executive director, said by phone at the  end of Wednesday's meeting.  </P> <P> "What they are talking about sharing is substantially less than their entire  revenues, no matter how you define it."  </P> <P> And his reaction?  </P> <P> Fehr said he was reluctant to make a premature evaluation and response but that  the union opposed any pay-for-performance system that did not account for a  variety of intangibles, and would not turn back the clock by giving away  already-held bargaining rights such as arbitration.  </P> <P> He reiterated that the union would accept the status quo, providing the new  agreement contained assurances against collusion and improvements in pension  and minimum salary, which the union is attempting to raise from $68,000 to  $100,000.  </P> <P> Thus, if there is a spring training lockout it will stem from the resolve of  the owners to overhaul a system that is expected to produce an average salary  in excess of $500,000 this year.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the PRC instructed the clubs to put their spring training plans on  hold until the owners meet in Chicago on Feb. 9, six days before camps are  scheduled to open.  </P> <P> Charles O'Connor, acting head of the PRC, said Wednesday that the union has  known for a year that the owners want an agreement before spring training. The  aim, he said, is to avoid the pressures of a mid-season stoppage, by which time  the players would have collected more than half their 1990 salaries while the  clubs would still have 80% of their TV revenue -- stemming from postseason  games -- at stake.  </P> <P> "I don't know if we can cross all the t's and dot all the i's or even find all  the t's and i's by Feb. 9," he said, "but surely we can reach an agreement that  a change in direction is needed and then fill in the blanks during the season."  </P> <P> Fehr said he was not surprised by the PRC memorandum because there has been  speculation about a lockout.  </P> <P> He said the imposition of a deadline was unfortunate in that it compounded a  difficult process.  </P> <P> "They took months to put together this radical proposal that we get for the  first time today, and they're asking us to absorb it and reach an agreement  within weeks.  </P> <P> "I think it's unlikely it can be done that fast and that it would be terribly  tragic to stage a lockout simply if there is no agreement on Feb. 15.  </P> <P> "If their objective is to test the players, then they'll test them, and nothing  I can say will prevent it, but I would suggest that it won't get them  anywhere."  </P> <P> The next bargaining session isn't scheduled until Jan. 24. The clock is  ticking. Fehr reflected and said of the owners: "We'll see if they're simply  following a script or legitimately bargaining. It's too early to tell."  </P></p>

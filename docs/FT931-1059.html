			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Italy warned on disrupting single market THE European Commission yesterday warned Italy not to disrupt the barrier-free internal European market by unilaterally imposing quotas on parallel imports of shoes, ceramics and silks from other EC member states. Mr Claudio Vitalone, Italian trade minister, has written to Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, seeking to restrict the entry of goods made in state trading countries such as China, Vietnam and North Korea which are re-exported to Italy from Britain, the Netherlands and Germany. If Italy wanted to enforce such quotas it would almost certainly have to reimpose border checks on goods from other EC member states. The problem arises because EC ministers have so far failed to agree plans to scrap or harmonise national quotas on non-EC imports. A spokesman for Sir Leon said the letter promised liberalisation of hundreds of quantitative curbs on products from other non-EC countries. The Commission would welcome the lifting of restraints, but warned Italy to stick to EC rules if it wanted to establish new quotas. But any attempt to establish internal EC quotas using Article 115 of the EC treaty would be 'completely against the single market'. Italy is reserving the right to use Article 115, even though the lifting of barriers on January 1 should have made it obsolete. 'It would amount to the re-erection of national borders, exactly what the single market tries to avoid.' Sir Leon has opened legal proceedings against Britain, the Netherlands and Germany for unilaterally abolishing or extending national quotas on goods from state trading countries. But he believes parallel imports are a natural and desirable part of the single market. The Commission is examining Britain's response to its request for more information on its quotas, and is awaiting replies from the Germans and Dutch.</p>

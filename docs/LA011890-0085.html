			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SICK WHALE IS RESPONDING TO EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT  </P> <P> Knootka, an 8,500-pound killer whale suffering from a rare fungal infection, is  slowly responding to treatment with an experimental drug usually used on  humans, Sea World officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Last month, Knootka, one of Sea World's two adult killer whales, became the  first whale ever to receive itraconazole, an experimental drug that is approved  for human use in Europe. Today, after about five weeks of treatment, her  appetite has returned, a lesion on her tongue has disappeared and she appears  to have more energy than before, Sea World veterinarian Jim McBain said.  </P> <P> "She's definitely an improved animal," he said. "She appears not to be  deteriorating. She obviously has the will to carry on."  </P> <P> In addition, McBain said, Knootka's high percentage of body fat has made her  unexpectedly well-suited for treatment with itraconazole. McBain had consulted  with physicians who had used the drug on human patients, so he knew that the  drug had an affinity for fat cells. But it had not occurred to McBain that  Knootka's blubber would make her an ideal patient.  </P> <P> "Physicians remark that you virtually never treat a human being with a systemic  infection who is fat," McBain said. "By the time they come in for treatment,  they're compromised and worn down. But we have a patient that's far different  than that -- she's got a lot of fat."  </P> <P> By absorbing itraconazole in her fat cells, Knootka has been able to store the  drug internally -- so much so, in fact, that McBain halted her daily treatments  about three weeks ago.  </P> <P> "She is still getting medication, but not from us," he explained, comparing  Knootka's way of storing the drug to a time-release capsule. "She appears to  have stored enough in her blubber that, ever since we've stopped giving it, it  has been slowly released into her blood stream."  </P> <P> McBain said Knootka's survival was cause for celebration, but said he is  cautious in his optimism.  </P> <P> "We've got a long ways to go, and we feel her prognosis is still definitely  guarded. We all know that she can still go any time, and we couldn't stop  that," he said. "But we've gone farther than we thought we might have already.  A month has passed, and she's still here. If we were losing the battle, she  wouldn't be."  </P></p>

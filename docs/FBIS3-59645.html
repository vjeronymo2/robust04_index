In the area of atomic energy,  Japan and Russia will cooperate in research on the peaceful use  of the excess plutonium generated with the dismantling of  nuclear weapons, a security measure system, etc. In space  science and technology, the aim is to set up new joint research  projects using large-scale test facilities and the excellent  data that Russia has accumulated from global observations and  manned space activities. The idea is to further advance science  and technology cooperation between Japan and Russia that makes  the best use of Japan's technological strength and knowledge.    In the field of atomic energy, Japan and Russia signed an  agreement relating to the abolition of nuclear weapons. It is a  plan for cooperation in four areas: 1) research on the storage  and peaceful use of the nuclear substances resulting from the  dismantling of nuclear weapons; 2) assistance in the application  of IAEA security measures to former Soviet-bloc nations without  nuclear weapons; 3) countermeasures against environmental  pollution, such as the disposal of radioactive wastes in the  ocean; and 4) countermeasures against missile liquid fuel  dumping.    The other agreement on space cooperation included  cooperation  such as 1) researcher and engineer exchange, 2) information  exchange, and 3) joint research in the area of space probing and  utilization for peaceful purposes.    Only the space cooperation agreement has a time limit; it is  valid for five years.</p>

After two years in Thailand, the company, which handles the  merchandise licensing and marketing of Disney consumer products,  found piracy one of the worst barriers to the growth of the  company and its licensees.    "We have worked closely with our lawyers and detectives to  trace the sources and manufacturers of these pirated products.  Our licensees also inform us immediately when they see fake  Walt Disney consumer goods," she said.    "Sometimes, we sent letters of warnings, telling them to  stop  such unfair practices. But this system does not work  efficiently here. Sometimes we asked police to arrest them and  seize the fake goods. But most serious sentence is to fine them  thousands of baht for malpractice. And we usually see them  selling the copied products again on the next day, perhaps at a  different place."    To ensure its licensees of protection, the company plans to  take more serious action against pirates. As the country's  copyright law has been improved, the company will begin by  asking the police to arrest the manufacturers and sellers of the  counterfeit products while the issuance of wamings will be  reduced.    "Licensees would be very happy to be strongly protected  because they have paid a huge sum for the licence to produce  copyrighted products," she said.    She noted that some people who used to produce unlicensed  Disney products approached the company, asking to be a licensee.  The company very much welcomes them because it means that their  product quality will be improved and there will be less piracy.    Strong protection is the most important duty for Disney  Consumer Products. When the company was formed in late 1991, it  handled only about 10 licensees. Malathip calls them the  "grandpa generation" because they are the pioneers in Thailand.  Now, the company has approximately 60 licensees in the country.    The company saw dramatic growth in revenue during the  1991/92  fiscal year of around 200 per cent and has continued to enjoy  remarkable revenue growth in 1992/93 at 160 per cent.    With rapid growth, the company is looking forward to  expanding its marketing department. When the company was  established two years ago, there was only Malathip and her  secretary. Now the office has a staff of about ten. To cope  with the growing business, the company will have to recruit more  employees. It expects to have more than 20 in 1994.    Everybody in the company has to work hard because the second  most important duty is to provide full support to the licensees.  The company works continuously to come up with new promotional  campaigns to help its licensees.    "We enjoy ourselves very much creating new promotional  campaigns. Campaigns allow our licensees to work together to  promote their products." [passage omitted]    "We are here to make our licensees' lives easier. They can  go ahead with their development plans without worrying because  we will provide them full support and protection." [passage  omitted]</p>

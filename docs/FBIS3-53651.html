			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin was today asked for  clarifications about Deputy Defense Minister Gur's announcement,  made on behalf of Rabin, regarding a referendum on the Golan  Heights issue. Our correspondent Arye Schorr reports:    [Begin recording] [Schorr] The prime minister was asked  today for his opinion regarding reservations expressed by Labor  figures regarding a referendum and their preference for  elections after an agreement with Syria is finalized. Mr. Rabin  explained at length his decision -- taken following  consultations with several of the ministers -- namely that if a  peace agreement with Syria calls for a significant withdrawal,  he will opt for a referendum. Mr. Rabin said that a significant  withdrawal could involve the removal of settlements, and on this  issue he would like to hear what the public has to say:    [Rabin] I am convinced that if and when we reach a draft  peace agreement between Syria and Israel -- and this will demand  a painful price from us, perhaps even more painful than the  Israeli public expects -- if and when this happens, and if we  want to be completely honest....    [Schorr, interrupting] Rabin went on to say that we must ask  the public whether it is willing to pay the price. The prime  minister, answering a question, said that at this point -- and  the emphasis was on this point -- there is no need for a proper  government decision on the issue of referendum. He emphasized  that there is no need to adopt new decisions. It is too early  to draft a law in this issue in the Knesset:    [Rabin] I believe that there will be a government majority  for this. In any case we will need to draft a law in the  Knesset, but there is no point in doing so now, because at this  stage we have nothing concrete to submit to the public. We will  do so when and if there is something to present to the public.    On the Palestinian track we are not dealing with a  territorial concession; there is no danger for uprooting  settlements there. The government has received a clear and  unequivocal mandate in this sphere. We expressed a willingness  for territorial compromise on the Golan Heights, but nothing  beyond this.    [Schorr] Today Rabin gave his first public reaction to the  position adopted by al-Asad in the Geneva summit. He said this  is not the time to hand out compliments:    [Rabin] I am not going to hand out grades to anybody.  Although I expected more, for the purposes of continuing the  negotiations I am willing to settle for what was publicly said  and with what we were briefed on, although not publicly said.    [Schorr] Mr. Rabin hinted that there are elements in  al-Asad's position which were not expressed in his speech, but  about which the Americans briefed Israel. This is the next  issue on the public and media agenda: What was really said in  the private meeting between Clinton and al-Asad. [end recording]    To sum up: At this stage there is nothing to submit to the  public for a referendum, because we have still not reached the  stage of territorial concessions and uprooting settlements.  This was what the prime minister said today at Jerusalem's King  David Hotel.</p>

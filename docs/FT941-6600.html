			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Midland bounces back to Pounds 844m Midland Bank, the UK high street banking arm of HSBC Holdings, quadrupled pre-tax profits to Pounds 844m last year, against Pounds 204m in 1992 in spite of weak demand for loans and a decline in fees and commissions obtained through branches. Operating profits before provisions for bad debts rose to Pounds 1.4bn, against Pounds 795m, thanks to strong income from treasury and capital markets trading. Sir Brian Pearse, who is about to retire as chief executive, said the UK retail bank 'continues to operate under very difficult and trying circumstances in a market that is over-supplied'. The bad debt charge against lending in the UK fell by Pounds 118m to Pounds 447m, but this was offset by a Pounds 37m charge for loans to less developed countries, and a Pounds 50m general provision against future corporate failures. The worst bad debt experience was in overseas commercial banking - mainly France and Germany - where the charge rose by Pounds 108m to Pounds 131m. Sir Brian said that complaints in the UK fell by 40 per cent last year after efforts to consult customers. Adjustments to charges for personal customers had included abolishing some fees. First Direct, Midland's telephone banking subsidiary, increased its customer base to more than 500,000 accounts by the end of the year. However, it only achieved a trading profit in December. Sir Brian said that First Direct had not achieved the same level of cross-selling financial products, such as mortgages, as in the branches. Midland paid a dividend of Pounds 403m to HSBC from net profits of Pounds 646m. Retained profit of Pounds 243m, against Pounds 102m, boosted the ratio of core capital to assets weighted by risk to 6.5 per cent, against 5.7 per cent. The bank said that its Midland Personal Financial Services arm had undertaken about 7,000 transfers of personal pensions. It had reviewed the cases and made a 'precautionary provision' against possible compensation. Total assets rose to Pounds 76bn, against Pounds 71bn, in spite of a fall in loans and advances to Pounds 38.6bn, against Pounds 42.5bn. Holdings of debt securities surged from Pounds 5.8bn to Pounds 13bn.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATINOS FIGHT FOR RECOGNITION;  </P> <P> VETERANS: SAN GABRIEL VALLEY MEN ARE RAISING FUNDS TO BUILD A MEMORIAL THAT  WILL COMMEMORATE THEIR WARTIME SERVICE.  </P> <P> Silviano Madrigal has no beef with the Army. When he got out of the service in  1952, in fact, Madrigal thought the Army had probably given him the best eight  years, nine months and 27 days of his life. "It was one of the better homes I  had," he says.  </P> <P> No, the worst part of being a young Latino in era of lacerating intolerance  came long before the Army, says Madrigal, 61, a brawny man with a gravelly  laugh and arms like battering rams.  </P> <P> There was the segregated school system in La Puente, which relegated Latino  kids like "Sil" Madrigal, the son of farm workers, to the "slow" school.  (Absolutely true, says Hacienda La Puente Unified School District  Superintendent James Johnson. The all-minority Central Elementary School stayed  open in La Puente until 1945.)  </P> <P> There was Madrigal's sudden separation at 16 from the city's public school  system, thanks to a La Puente High School administrator.  </P> <P> "One day he just called me into the office and sent me out to pick lemons,"  says Madrigal, an instructor for Veterans in Community Service, a federally  funded manpower program, who still lives in La Puente. "He said, 'That's what  you're going to be -- a lemon picker,' and he threw me out."  </P> <P> And there was the sorry spectacle of the 1942 "zoot suit" riots, with mobs of  white servicemen, spurred on by hatemongers and biased media reports, traveling  to East Los Angeles to beat up young Latino pachucos. Some of the zoot suiters  were themselves GIs on leave.  </P> <P> Madrigal, a proud zoot suiter himself in those days ("shark skins, English tie,  Adams hat and triple-sole brogues," he says, describing his outfit), laughs at  the memory of it. "We hurt some of those sailors from the Midwest," he says.  </P> <P> And then Madrigal went to war.  </P> <P> Young Latino men often have had to make a major leap of faith before they  fought for their country. Called on to defend what many perceived as a  far-from-perfect nation, the vast majority signed up. They may have paused a  moment, Madrigal and other Latino veterans say, but then they leaped with  alacrity.  </P> <P> "I don't remember any Hispanics who didn't want to go and do their duty for  their country," says Madrigal, who was awarded three Bronze Stars for valor in  World War II and the Silver Star for heroism in Korea.  </P> <P> In fact, Latino servicemen's contributions often were greater than those of any  other group, say representatives of Latino veterans groups, who have begun  raising funds for a Latino Veterans Memorial. One-fifth of the Latinos who  served in Vietnam were killed in action, for example. One in three was wounded.  On a per-capita basis, more Medals of Honor have been awarded to Latinos -- 37  of them -- than to any other minority group.  </P> <P> Latino veterans may gloss over injustices they feel they have suffered in the  United States. But the lack of acknowledgment of Latino war sacrifices is an  indignity that many of them are not prepared to accept.  </P> <P> "Sure, the government is saying now that Hispanics were there," says Gonzalez,  head of the Assn. of Hispanic Vietnam Era Veterans, citing President Bush's  acknowledgment on Veterans Day that one-quarter of the names of casualties  listed on a Texas Vietnam Veterans Memorial were Latino.  </P> <P> But the message isn't getting to the most important audience -- elementary and  high school students of Latino heritage, says Gonzalez, a salesman for an El  Monte printing company. "What we usually get is recognition in election  campaign speeches and on holidays," he says, "but it's not filtering down to  the level we'd like to see."  </P> <P> The planned memorial -- complete with the names of more than 20,000 Latino  servicemen who have died in American wars since World War II -- will serve as a  focus for educational programs, says Gonzalez, whose group is leading the  efforts to raise about $300,000 for the project. It's expected to be unveiled  in about two years at a San Gabriel Valley location that Gonzalez said he could  not reveal.  </P> <P> In many ways, this is a do-it-yourself project, those who are involved say.  "We've always had to initiate things like this," says Ruben Treviso, a member  of American GI Forum and public affairs director for Veterans In Community  Service, based in Whittier. "We're not bitter. We're just going to build our  own memorial."  </P> <P> Put a group of Latino veterans together and the conversation seems to flow  inevitably from battle stories to fallen friends to the gnawing issue of  recognition.  </P> <P> "Look at all the John Wayne movies," says Gonzalez. "Very few Hispanics. Once  in a while, they dressed up Anthony Quinn or Cesar Romero as a soldier." Recent  movies about the Vietnam War, such as "Platoon" and "Full Metal Jacket," have  not been much better because they acknowledged Latino soldiers only in passing,  he says.  </P> <P> This is a bitter pill for those who grew up in Latino communities during the  1960s and 1970s, says Treviso, who is from East Los Angeles. "All we saw in  those days were hearses pulling into people's driveways," says Treviso, the  holder of three Bronze Stars and a Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry from the South  Vietnamese government. "All the kids we grew up with were coming home in  coffins."  </P> <P> The recognition issue can be highly personal for Latino veterans in the San  Gabriel Valley. War service has become a pivotal life experience for many.  </P> <P> Art Cisneros, a Hacienda Heights resident who is deputy director of Veterans In  Community Sarvice, remembers an East Los Angeles neighbor from his World War  II-era childhood. "I was only about 12, and Alfonso Esparza used to come home  from Camp Pendleton," says Cisneros, a Korean War-era Air Force veteran. "I  used to go over to his house, watch him polishing his boots, try on his hat. He  died in Guadalcanal when I was 14. I remember the misery his family went  through."  </P> <P> For Madrigal, who grew up in crushing poverty, the military provided escape,  self-esteem and, ultimately, disappointment.  </P> <P> He still relishes telling stories about his days in the Army. "Hey, suddenly I  had sheets most of the time," Madrigal recalls. "I didn't have to try and buy  surplus boots at the (Civilian Conservation Corps) camp. For the first time in  my life, I was wearing underwear."  </P> <P> An exuberant, brawling young man, Madrigal fought for respect in his 9th  Infantry Division unit, he says. "I'd look for the meanest, toughest guy  around, and we'd have to tangle so I could establish my credentials," says  Madrigal, who fought briefly as an Army welterweight contender.  </P> <P> He came home to California briefly as a civilian after World War II. "I said to  myself, 'I must be nuts,' " he says. "I'd been living high on the hog over in  Europe, staying in plush hotels. I was somebody over there." So he signed up  again, just in time for Korea.  </P> <P> But the Korean War soured him on the military, he says. "There was no  commitment to that war," he says. "We had just beaten the two best armies in  the world. Why were these guys kicking the hell out of us?"  </P> <P> In 1952, Madrigal was discharged and began raising a family. When his two sons  were old enough for military service, Madrigal advised them against signing up.  "I told them I didn't want them getting involved in these penny-ante political  situations (with the U.S. military)," he says.  </P> <P> Madrigal still tends to look at things from the worldly perspective of the  frontline trenches. "We always caught the brunt of it," he says of the Latino  servicemen. "We were always called upon to do our bit. But I don't think the  government ever did its bit. The Latinos got shoved aside. That's always been  my feeling."  </P></p>

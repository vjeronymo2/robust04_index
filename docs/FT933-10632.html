			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Cadbury to tempt China with chocolate CADBURY Schweppes is to bring chocolate pandas to the children of China as part of a Pounds 20m project to establish the group as a leading provider of confectionery to the People's Republic. China's growing free market culture has convinced several western manufacturers that Chinese children will be as susceptible to sweet things as those elsewhere. Coca-Cola, which has 13 bottling plants in China, earlier this year said it was investing a further Dollars 150m (Pounds 101m) in the country. Cadbury says that the 1.2bn Chinese consumed only 11,000 tonnes of chocolate in 1991. In the same year, Britons consumed 507,000 tonnes. Cadbury's taste tests in China had convinced it that the 20 local and imported brands available represented a mere nibble at the market's potential. The UK-based group has set up a joint venture partnership with the Beijing General Corporation for Agriculture, Industry and Commerce (Baic) to build a manufacturing plant near the Chinese capital. Cadbury will have a 75 per cent stake and management control over the venture. The plant will begin production in 1995 with an initial annual capacity of about 5,000 tonnes. Baic, which is linked to the Chinese agriculture ministry, controls Beijing's milk supply and dairy processing facilities. Before local production begins, chocolate will be imported from the UK and Australia, where the group already sells chocolate pandas. Other products on sale will be Cadbury's Dairy Milk, Hazelnut, Roast Almond, Chocolate Eclairs and Cadbury Drinking Chocolate. All products sold in China will carry the Cadbury name in both English and Mandarin. A phonetic translation of Cadbury into its Mandarin equivalent, Ji Bai Li, means 'luck plus hundreds of benefits'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Salvadoran Supreme Electoral Tribunal, </F> TSE, magistrates, headed by TSE President Luis Arturo Zaldivar,  with unidentified reporters at the Presidente Hotel in San  Salvador -- live]    [Text] [Zaldivar] [Words indistinct] this call from the  Salvadoran Supreme Electoral Tribunal to inform you of a  resolution we issued today at 1300, which we believe is very  important for the electoral process that will culminate on 20  March. The resolution reads as follows:    After studying the case of Arcatao, San Jose de las Flores,  San Isidro Labrador, and Nueva Trinidad Municipalities, all in  Chalatenango Department, and for what the TSE believes are  extenuating circumstances in those places, we resolve:    That the 20 March elections in those municipalities be held  simultaneously in the departmental capital of Chalatenango as  well as in the respective municipalities.    The TSE will be in charge of transporting the members of the  Voting Table Boards and the party poll representatives with the  support of Salvadoran Air Force helicopters.    Once the voting is over in those municipalities, the ballot  boxes and other electoral documents, as well as the members of  the Voting Table Boards and party poll representatives, will be  transferred by the same means to the departmental capital. Once  there, they will proceed, according to the law, to open the  ballot boxes, count votes, and issue the closing and vote count  certificate, which should include the election results in the  respective municipalities and in the departmental capital and  which should be signed by all members of the Voting Table Boards.    The security and the personal and moral safety of the  members  of the Voting Table Boards, party poll representatives, and Air  Force crew members who will transport the personnel and  electoral documents, as well as the safety of the helicopters,  will be the responsibility of the mission of UN Observers for El  Salvador, Onusal.  For notification:    This is the TSE resolution issued this afternoon in an  effort  to find a satisfactory solution according to Salvadoran law. We  are sure we have found a solution within the legal framework by  establishing voting procedures that take the requirements and  conditions in those places into consideration but which also  respect our laws. That is the announcement we wanted to make.  We urge you to inform the Salvadoran and international public.    [Reporter] It was said that conditions were not right for  holding elections in those municipalities. What has changed?    [Zaldivar] The solution says that extenuating circumstances  persist. It is clear in the resolution.    [Reporter] What factors made you change your mind?    [Zaldivar] We have not changed anything. We have maintained  the participation of voters residing in the departmental capital  and the integration of the Voting Table Boards in the  departmental capital for each of those municipalities. This has  not changed. We are also giving facilities to those sectors who  protested saying that they live in those places. Well, those  who live in Arcatao will vote there; and voters from Arcatao who  live in the departmental capital of Chalatenango will vote in  Chalatenango.    As I said, the resolution is intended to provide facilities  so all voters legally registered in the Electoral Registry and  who have a voter registration card can vote wherever they are.    [Reporter] What extenuating circumstances [words indistinct]  for the next government?    [Zaldivar] No. I can mention two extenuating circumstances  -- as stated in the TSE's initial resolution -- for the transfer  of the members of the Voting Table Board from the municipalities  to the departmental capital. The Municipal Councils of those  four municipalities are not handling their official business in  their respective municipalities but in the departmental capital.  They have not been able to return. It has not been possible to  install the municipal electoral boards in those municipalities  and their activities are being handled in the departmental  capital. We have received notes from those municipal electoral  boards saying that they are in exile.    [Reporter] What kind of controls will there be to prevent  people from voting twice, as some will be voting in the  departmental capital and others in the municipalities? [Words  indistinct] to control that possibility?    [Zaldivar] There will be controls throughout the country.  Our voting system uses indelible ink, which ensures that each  person can vote only once, not only in this case but throughout  the country. Immediately after a person votes, his finger will  be stained with indelible ink. Should he try to vote at another  voting table, the first thing he will be asked to do is to show  his hands to make sure that his finger is not stained with  indelible ink.    [Reporter] In general terms, how are preparations for  tomorrow proceeding at the national level? Some irregularities  have been reported with the electoral register [words  indistinct] total number of voters?    [Zaldivar] Magistrate Colindres will answer that question.    [Colindres] As far as I know, complaints have been received  from San Antonio de los Ranchos and Las Vueltas involving the  electoral list. What happened? Certain citizens -- to be more  precise, a little over 16,000 citizens -- requested voter  registration cards and said they wanted to vote in a given  municipality. After they received their voter registration  card, they decided they wanted to vote in another municipality.  When the TSE realized that these people had received their  voter registration cards and then asked to vote elsewhere, it  excluded them from the list of the place where they had received  their voter registration card and then issued them another voter  registration card so they could vote in the other municipality.  Otherwise, these persons would end up with a voter registration  card for the first place and one for the new place.  Consequently, to guarantee....[pauses] As soon as a new voter  registration card is issued, the previous one is eliminated.  That is what happened with the 16,000 citizens who decided to  change their polling place.    [Reporter] Dr. Zaldivar, refugee liaison boards claim you  have blocked the work for which they were elected because you do  not want to accredit them to supervise the implementation of  [words indistinct] the country's elections?    [Zaldivar] The Pollwatchers Board members were sworn in on  26 May 1993 and have been accredited and working within the TSE  since then. The Pollwatchers Board is made up of a  representative and an alternate for each of the legally  registered political parties. I do not know what they mean when  they say they have not been accredited.    [Reporter] Commander Gerson Martinez said you did not want  to accredit the alternate members so they could work.    [Zaldivar] They were accredited. I do not know what kind of  accreditation they have in mind. They are working....[pauses] I  personally swore in Gerson Martinez -- all of them -- on 26 May,  so I do not know what accreditation they have in mind.    [Reporter] Dr. Zaldivar, there were some complaints from  Jutiapa, Cabanas Department. Apparently some of the ballots did  not include the MNR [National Revolutionary Movement] flag. Do  you know about that?    [Zaldivar] No, we know nothing about it.    [Reporter] Dr. Zaldivar [words indistinct] at the last  minute concerning different polling places in the country.  People in [name indistinct] municipality complain that the  logistics failed there because they have yet to receive what the  TSE promised them.    [Zaldivar] What municipal voting board?    [Reporter] There are reports from the representatives of  the...    [Zaldivar, interrupting] No, I mean what department.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Zaldivar] What was their complaint, please?    [Reporter] They complain about logistics problems. They  have yet to receive the material they were promised and they  lack the human resources to handle tomorrow's elections.    [Zaldivar] No, quite the contrary. The president and two  members of the electoral board in San Salvador visited us at  noon today. They came to report something we had learned of  only minutes earlier, through the electoral project's management  office. They said the Francisco Menendez National Institute had  not been opened, and the electoral material could not be brought  in. I immediately contacted the appropriate official, meaning  the education minister, and the pertinent orders were given. We  were surprised to learn that a polling place....[pauses] an  education center that was publicly mentioned in this week's  newspapers as one of the Education Ministry facilities requested  by the TSE was not open.    The Education Ministry publicly listed the education centers  that would be used as polling places, and the Francisco Menendez  National Institute was among them. Consequently, the minister  issued the necessary orders and the facilities were opened  minutes later. All the material has been delivered and is ready  for tomorrow at 0600, when the Pollwatchers Board will be  installed so voting can begin at 0700.    [Reporter] Dr. Zaldivar, what will happen in the case of  Jutiapa Municipality, for example, where apparently the MNR flag  does not appear on the ballots for municipal councilmen? Will  Article 325 of the electoral code be implemented to suspend the  voting process? That is, if this is true, since the reports we  have are unofficial.    [Zaldivar] First of all, I cannot answer because we have no  official or unofficial report on the incident. We knew nothing  about this situation until now. Any case that may arise will be  analyzed based on the legal provisions, and it will also be  settled based on the same legal provisions.    [Reporter] Dr. Zaldivar, this morning Dr. Zamora reported a  series of irregularities concerning the electoral material  [words indistinct] will be used tomorrow. He also spoke about  transportation for the voters. Have you solved the  irregularities [words indistinct] meeting this morning?    [Zaldivar] Yes. The truth is that we did not discuss any  irregularities. The most important topic of discussion was the  Chalatenango municipalities. We could hardly refer to events  that have not happened yet. For us, facts are only what is  officially known and confirmed.    [Reporter] Do you think the measures taken in Chalatenango  contribute to reconciliation or polarization? Also, is there a  formal agreement among all the parties? Did your people consult  all of the parties, including the FMLN, for this effort?    [Zaldivar] The code very specifically states that the  determination of extenuating circumstances and their subsequent  resolution are the exclusive responsibility of the TSE.  Nevertheless, this tribunal has consulted the political parties  when it has made decisions about the elections. One example is  electoral procedure. Although the code empowers us to establish  procedures for these elections, we have consulted the political  parties. They have even signed records of these consultations  expressing their acceptance of the election procedure. The same  is true of other activities, which, although our authority is  exclusive, we shared with the political parties.    [Reporter] I also asked you if you think these measures  contribute to reconciliation or polarization in these  municipalities.    [Zaldivar] We are convinced that this contributes to  reconciliation because we are allowing voters to cast their  votes in their areas of residence. In addition, voters who have  reason not to return to their municipalities can cast their  votes where they feel safer. I think both groups will feel  safer.    [Reporter] How many voter registration cards must still be  distributed?    [Zaldivar] I would like to clarify that there is nothing  left  to distribute because the deadline expired at 0000 on 17 March.  We distributed 825,000 voter registration cards, which exceeds  our goals.    [Reporter] How soon does the TSE expect to have the  (?election figures?)    [Zaldivar] Well, as soon as possible. This is not a definite  time, of course, but we expect to have results by 2200. We do  not expect to announce final results by that time. We hope to  be able to announce any wide margins in the vote count.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Zaldivar] There are 2,722,000 registered voters. I have  said  that 825,000 voter registration cards have been issued as part  of the registration drive.    [Reporter] How many cards have been issued in the country?    [Zaldivar] A total of 2,600,000 persons have their cards.  The  figure I gave previously is the number of cards issued in the  past few months. This figure, plus the cards that had already  been issued, means that 2.6 million Salvadorans will cast their  votes.    [Reporter] The opposition parties tried to introduce a  proposal whereby 60,000 youths who turn 20 would be permitted to  vote. What happened to that legislation?    [Zaldivar] You said it. They tried to introduce a proposal.  The current law does not permit that.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Zaldivar] Let us not confuse things. The code does not say  the blind cannot vote.    [Reporter] How could they?    [Zaldivar] We do not have a special procedure in the code or  in Salvadoran electoral law to make it possible for the blind to  vote. Guatemala has incorporated the Braille system onto the  ballot so the blind can vote. In El Salvador, however, the  blind are very smart. It is not necessary to mark a flag. You  can even fold the blank ballot and put it into the ballot box.  If he can make a mark, he can also do this. Their teachers  could have instructed them on the approximate location of the  blind person's party flag. In addition, they can be aided by a  seeing person both in arriving at the Voting Table Board and  also going into the voting booth, where he can make his mark by  himself. Then his seeing companion will accompany him to the  ballot box where he will cast his vote. It is perfectly  possible for a blind person to vote.    [Reporter] Mr. President, what is the total number of voting  tables for tomorrow's elections?    [Zaldivar] There are 6,981 tables.    [Reporter] What did you talk about with [words indistinct]?  Did it have anything to do with the municipalities?    [Zaldivar] No. They came to request information. The  secretary was preparing the final draft of the resolution as  they arrived, so there is no relationship.</p>

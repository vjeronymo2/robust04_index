Report on Deaths During Development of Market  Relations"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] In 1993 the landmark of 1,404  crimes involving the violent death of various categories of  Muscovites and visitors to the capital was reached. And this --  as the reader has probably already managed to calculate -- is a  52.7-percent increase in the number of premeditated murders in  just one year.    However, if the figure 1,404 is enough to make you reel in  horror, then prepare yourself, there is worse to come. Yuriy  Fedoseyev also has aggravated assaults leading to death in store  for you -- 983 last year. And if you add the corpses that are  not found straightaway and are not entirely, to be blunt, fresh  and intact, the militia's math virtually brings us to the figure  of 3,000, which means that around 8.2 people are now murdered  every day in the hero city of Moscow. [passage omitted]    There is every indication that it is not only the militia  that is learning, but also the people whom they are hunting  down. I don't know about rope barriers, but, according to Yuriy  Fedoseyev, the Moscow criminal world is now equipped with  high-quality sniper rifles, assault rifles, grenade launchers,  and TNT, which is apparently gradually coming into fashion. It  has begun to be considered fashionable in the city to blow up a  victim at his home, preferably at around 0400-0500 hours. The  capital's defenders of law and order have already dubbed this  the "have-a-nice-day" approach.    The niceness of the day is complicated for the Moscow  Criminal Investigations Department by the fact that  radio-controlled detonators have appeared in the city. The art  of murdering your fellow man without leaving a trace, without  witnesses, and an obvious motive has become near-perfect of  late. In 1993 the Moscow Criminal Investigations Department  cleared up only 48.2 percent of the crimes involving  premeditated murder. [passage omitted]</p>

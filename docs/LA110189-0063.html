			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOTEL BEING RENOVATED FOR SENIORS BURNS UP  </P> <P> More than 150 firefighters battled a four-alarm blaze that lighted the pre-dawn  sky in downtown San Diego Tuesday and destroyed the unoccupied New Palace  Hotel, the Fire Department reported.  </P> <P> The fire prompted the evacuation of 43 residents of a nearby building.  </P> <P> The New Palace was being renovated for senior housing. It is owned by the San  Diego Kind Corp., a nonprofit organization headed by Mavourneen O'Connor, twin  sister of Mayor Maureen O'Connor.  </P> <P> Firefighters responding to a call at the 400 block of Elm Street at 1:55 a.m.  found the three-story structure engulfed in flames, San Diego Fire Department  spokesman Larry Stewart said. The fire ripped through the 100-room structure,  leaving a wobbly concrete shell that was deemed unsafe Tuesday afternoon and  scheduled for demolition.  </P> <P> "The amount of damage requires complete demolition, and we'll take a little bit  apart at a time to see what happened," said Jeff Carle, captain of the Metro  Arson Strike Team. It might take several days to determine the cause of the  fire, he said.  </P> <P> Surveying the damage from atop a fire engine's ladder suspended over the  smoldering structure, Carle said the interior of the charred building would be  off limits -- even to fire investigators -- until a demolition crew removes  unstable debris.  </P> <P> "Nobody is going in until I know this thing is not going to come down on my  head," he said.  </P> <P> Upon arriving, firefighters evacuated eight transients from the burning  structure. The transients were unhurt, but two firefighters were injured  battling the blaze. They were treated at area hospitals and released.  </P> <P> Firefighters also evacuated neighboring Central Manor, a board-and-care home,  and hosed its roof. Although it is only a few feet from the hotel, Central  Manor was undamaged, Stewart said, and residents were permitted to return  Tuesday morning.  </P> <P> The fire was contained within three hours.  </P> <P> Mavourneen O'Connor, reached by phone Tuesday afternoon, said the fire posed a  serious setback to the renovation.  </P> <P> The project, partly funded by the state Department of Housing, was targeted for  completion in September, 1990, O'Connor said. She was unable to estimate when  work would resume on the senior center or when it will be completed.  </P> <P> O'Connor, grateful that most of the hotel's tapestries and furniture had been  removed for refurbishing, said she is determined to complete the project.  </P> <P> "We're certainly going to give it an Irish try," she said.  </P></p>

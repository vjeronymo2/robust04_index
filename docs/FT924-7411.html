			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Modest rise in high-street sales peters out A MODEST improvement in high-street sales petered out last month as uncertainty about the economy continued to undermine consumer confidence. A Confederation of British Industry survey shows that high-street sales slipped back last month after September's modest rise in spite of a reduction in base rates to 8 per cent shortly before last month's survey was conducted. Furthermore, the results did not reflect the latest cut in base rates to 7 per cent. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said that cut should encourage more consumers. The survey, which covered 15,000 retailers between October 19 and November 4, showed that off-licences, shoe shops, book shops and stationers were among the worst hit sectors in October. Mr Whittaker said: 'The economic climate remains uncertain though retailers expect that sales in November will be broadly unchanged on a year ago.' Newsagents and hardware shops moved against the trend, reporting moderately improved sales. Since June official figures have shown a gradual improvement in the annual growth rate of retail sales. Economists believe, however, that rising unemployment will continue to hinder consumer demand as people remain worried about losing their jobs. Official retail sales figures for last month, due out tomorrow, are forecast to show a small fall compared with September and a small increase on October last year. The CBI survey showed a fall in sales for wholesalers and motor traders. Wholesalers reported that sales volumes were sharply down on a year ago following a year-on-year increase in September. Motor traders said business last month had fallen significantly below last year's levels. 'Sales of parts and accessories declined moderately while vehicle sales fell sharply,' Mr Whittaker said. 'This bleak picture is expected to continue in November with volumes falling well below last year's levels.' Details of the survey of the retail sector include: Food and drink. Sales by grocers grew sharply in the year to October following three months of flat sales. Food retailers expect sales to improve on an annual basis this month, but the outlook for off-licences remains bleak. Clothing and footwear. Sales for clothes and shoe shops fell compared with a year ago after sharp sales growth in September. Shoe sales were at their worst levels since April. Footwear and clothing retailers report that stocks remain too high relative to expected sales and both are forecasting further year-on-year falls. Chemists. Sales continued to rise against the trend of the recession. After a setback in September sales volumes increased sharply last month compared with a year ago. But sales remain poor for the time of year. Furniture and carpets. Sales fell in October compared with a year before after strong improvements in August and September. The decline probably reflects the fall in house moves following the return in August of stamp duty on house purchases. Sales are expected to fall again this month. Durable household goods. Retailers reported sales unchanged on a year ago and expect a small increase this month.</p>

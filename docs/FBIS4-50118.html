			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article from the "Beijing political situation" column by </F> Jen Hui-wen (0117 1979 2429): "The High-Level CPC Leadership  Stresses the Need To Stabilize the Situation Again"]    [Text] In my 22 April column, I pointed out that, in order  to maintain the "sustained, rapid, and healthy" development of  the national economy, the CPC has once again stressed the need  to correctly handle the relationship between reform,  development, and stability this year. In early April it also  stressed the importance of giving top priority to putting  "stability before everything else" for several years. This  indicates that the authorities are more concerned about  stability than reform and development. This feeling has been  proved by the authorities' recent circular, which again stresses  the importance of stability.    An informed source in Beijing revealed that the CPC had  recently issued a circular to provincial-level party and  government leaders on strengthening party leadership,  implementing reform measures, and consolidating stability.    The circular asks localities to resolutely implement all  reform measures that have been ratified by the central  authorities and to promptly exchange information with the  central authorities and warns them not proceed with work in  their own way.  <H5>  The CPC Issues a Circular on Stability </H5>   The circular demands that the newly introduced reform  measures not be permitted to affect the four major issues of the  people, specifically, their food, clothing, housing, and  transportation. All reform measures which could cause a decline  in the people's standard of living or affect social stability  should be postponed or suspended.    The circular demands that provincial-level party and  government leaders should go to the enterprises, factories,  mines, rural areas, schools, and other grass-roots units to  propagate policies and familiarize themselves with the  situation. In this way they will do their work in a  down-to-earth manner.    The circular urges leading cadres to practice cleanliness  and  self-discipline and guard against corruption. For this reason,  they should consciously accept mass supervision.    Some people in political circles in Beijing pointed out  that,  in April, the authorities stressed the importance of putting  stability before everything else. They subsequently issued this  circular on stabilizing the situation. More or less this  indicates their concerns about the localities' insubordination  and their ignorance of the importance of putting stability above  everything else. In late April, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, as  acting premier, held a telephone conference for provincial-level  leaders. He said, "If the new reform measures which damage the  masses' interests and social stability are not promptly  corrected, the principal leaders in the localities will be held  responsible for the consequences; they will be transferred or  receive disciplinary action on the merits of each case." Thus  it can be seen that the authorities are worried about social  stability and the stability of the political situation.  <H5>  The Meaning of Deng Xiaoping's Theory on "Stability" </H5>   The informed source said that the CPC's concept of  "stability" stems from Deng Xiaoping's theory on "stability."    In the last few years, particularly since the 4 June  incident  in 1989, Deng Xiaoping has paid special attention to the  stability of Chinese society and its political situation. He  cherishes the hope that China "will create the image of  stability and unity for the country and the world." First, this  has been drawn from historical experience. He has said,  "Foreigners must be made to see that China is stable; if China  is in a mess and divided, what hope will it have? Imperialists  bullied us in the past, and wasn't this because we were not  united?" Second, this has been drawn from practical lessons.  He said that today some countries are suffering endless turmoil  and war; this fact has provided China with negative lessons  indicating that progress is impossible amid turmoil and that  only stability can bring about development. Now "China is in a  period which particularly necessitates the concentration of  efforts on economic development." "To bring about the four  modernizations and get rid of poverty and backwardness, China  needs a political situation of stability and unity and must  proceed with its construction in an organized and orderly  manner. Disturbance makes it impossible for us to carry out our  construction with peace of mind." "If there are demonstrations  today and tomorrow, we cannot concentrate on construction. If  disturbances, instability, and disorder occur, foreign capital  will stop coming to China. We are exercising strict control in  this respect, this will not affect foreign investment; on the  contrary, foreign investors will feel at ease."    The stability and unity stressed by Deng Xiaoping covers two  aspects. Stability is stressed from the angle of the entire  society and sometimes is called tranquility. In this respect,  Deng Xiaoping thinks it necessary to issue the signal that  "China cannot afford confusion" and the slogan that "stability  must be put before everything else"; "everything which runs  counter to or obstructs our socialist road must be removed, and  all factors which may lead to confusion or turmoil in China must  be removed." Unity refers to the unity at the policymaking and  leadership strata or the core of the central leadership. It is  Deng Xiaoping's opinion that the "most important thing is to  have a united leadership core." "As long as there are no  problems with this link, China will remain as stable as Tai  Shan. No country in the world will belittle us and more and  more investors will come to China." "As long as the leading  group is united and persists in an open policy, decades of  stable development will bring about fundamental changes in  China."    In accordance with Deng Xiaoping's theory on creating a  stable situation to concentrate on economic development, this  year--the first year for implementing the "50 provisions"  decided by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee on establishing the socialist market economic  structure--the CPC has stressed again the importance of putting  stability before everything else.  <H5>  Zhu Rongji's Painstaking Efforts To Hold On-Site Meetings </H5> for Handling Official Business    This informed source went on to say that, although the  high-level CPC leadership has stressed time and again the  importance of stability, they also understand that stability can  be basically maintained only when the economy develops.    For the purpose of economic development, the authorities  recently made a special effort to urge leading cadres to go to  the forefront to resolve problems. It is out of the same  consideration that the circular asks leading cadres to go to the  grass roots. In this respect, Zhu Rongji has set a good example  for others to follow.    After the conclusion of the Second Session of the Eighth  National People's Congress in late March, Zhu Rongji led 10  people in charge of the relevant ministries and commissions  under the State Council in going to Heilongjiang Province for  on-site meetings to resolve difficulties in economic disposition  and problems in large and medium state enterprises (including  military industrial enterprises). After learning about some  staff members' and workers' complaints and disturbances which  resulted because some enterprises had suspended or stopped their  production, Zhu Rongji, authorized by General Secretary Jiang  Zemin and Premier Li Peng, solemnly announced on 17 April the  dismissal of Sun Weiben as Heilongjiang Provincial Party  Committee secretary and the transfer of Liaoning Provincial  Governor Qiu Qifeng as his replacement. This shows Zhu Rongji's  resoluteness in handling key issues.    After holding on-site meetings to resolve problems in  Heilongjiang Province, Zhu Rongji, at the above-mentioned  telephone conference in late April, once again stressed the  importance of leading cadres going to the grass roots. He said,  "Sitting in an office reading documents and drinking tea will  not help solve any problem. On the contrary, this might result  in unrealistic measures or the proposition of tasks which  currently cannot be performed at all and might even ruin the  effort to deepen reform or affect the people's lives."    If Zhu Rongji's practice of on-site meetings can be  popularized, we believe this will be useful to economic  development and social stability. But how many communists would  be willing to do such a "foolish thing" today?!</p>

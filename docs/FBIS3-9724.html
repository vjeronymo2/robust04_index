He said this immediately after  he learnt that Czech President had ordered the cessation of  criminal proceedings for defamation of the president of the  republic. [passage omitted]    "I fundamentally disagree with the cessation of criminal  proceedings for the opinion expressed in evaluation of Vaclav  Havel's political activities after November 17, 1989 (the day  when the anti-communist "velvet" revolution began in  Czechoslovakia)," Cibulka told CTK.    "Unlike communist criminals, StB [communist-era secret  police] officers, judges, prosecutors, prison guards, and  exponents of communist nomenclatura, who still remain unpunished  and rule firmly over us, there is nothing I could be blamed  for," Cibulka stressed.    He added he wanted to use the trial to "accuse the  communist-velvet oligarchy, headed by Vaclav Havel, of covering  numerous crimes," noting that "those covering criminals are  criminals themselves."</p>

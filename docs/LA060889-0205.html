			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KY. SCHOOL SYSTEM REVAMP ORDERED;  </P> <P> RULING FINDS EDUCATION SPENDING GAP UNCONSTITUTIONAL  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court ruled today that Kentucky's school system is  unconstitutional because of the spending gap between rich and poor districts,  and it ordered the Legislature to produce a new setup.  </P> <P> The court, ruling 5 to 1 with a seventh justice partly concurring and partly  dissenting, gave the Legislature until the end of its 1990 session to come up  with a system to even out spending.  </P> <P> "We do not direct the General Assembly to raise taxes. It is their decision how  best to achieve efficiency," the court said.  </P> <P> However, the court said the Legislature -- in what would be a major departure  -- must make local tax rates uniform.  </P> <P> A frequent criticism is that poor districts often make only token efforts to  help themselves, with minimal tax rates and lax enforcement of collections.  </P> <P> The ruling was prompted by a lawsuit filed in 1985 by 66 "property-poor"  districts. The suit alleged that the school finance system, which depends on  property taxes, is not fair in a state where wealth varies widely, from the  Appalachian coal fields in eastern Kentucky to the affluent Cincinnati suburbs.  </P> <P> A judge agreed in 1988 that the Legislature had failed to meet its obligation  under the Kentucky Constitution to establish an equitable system of public, or  common, schools in terms of either spending or quality.  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court largely upheld the judge's finding, ruling "This  obligation cannot be shifted to local counties and local school districts."  </P> <P> Gov. Wallace Wilkinson lauded the ruling. "We have the opportunity to rebuild,  to redefine education in Kentucky. And if we fail, we will have failed  ourselves, our fellow Kentuckians and particularly our children," he said.  </P> <P> Schools Supt. John Brock said today was "the happiest day of my professional  life."  </P> <P> "Today the court has propelled us from the 19th Century to the 21st," he said.  </P></p>

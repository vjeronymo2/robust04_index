			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (1): Going gets even tougher - As car and truck makers seek ways to shore up their sagging profitability, the components industry is experiencing painful shock waves / Assessment of the prospects for manufacturers facing up to an era of restructuring THE competitive screw is being tightened remorselessly on the world's automotive components suppliers, as car and truck makers seek urgently for ways to shore up their sagging profitability. With bought-in components usually accounting for at least 50 per cent of the costs of a car - Ford purchases alone totalled nearly Dollars 53bn in 1990 - it is little coincidence that the vehicle assemblers look first to squeeze their suppliers, when the going gets tough. The resulting shock waves that pass through the automotive components industry are being felt most painfully by the army of suppliers to General Motors, the world's largest vehicle maker, who are still trying to come to terms with the latest convulsions in Detroit, as GM seeks to staunch its record losses. GM is looking to global components sourcing as one of its main routes to short-term financial recovery. Ominously for suppliers Mr Robert Stempel, GM's hard-pressed chairman, warned recently that the group would 'use the global purchasing power of GM to reduce material costs and accelerate the return of our North American operations to profitability. We need to leverage the worldwide volume of GM to buy our material and components at best prices.' GM, the wounded elephant of the world auto industry, which last year suffered a massive Dollars 4.5bn deficit, the largest annual loss ever recorded by a US company, is finally being forced to take radical actions to put its house in order. Mr Stempel says GM is 'aggressively pursuing' five key business strategies to try to bring its sprawling North American auto operations back into profit. These include: instituting global sourcing, accelerating the implementation of lean production, significantly reducing the number of GM vehicle platforms (the basic underbodies that spawn a range of cars) with greater use of common components between vehicle lines, cutting back North American manufacturing capacity, and putting into effect an aggressive new product programme. Some of these strategies will take time to show through in the profit and loss account, but the reduction of the purchasing bill can bear immediate fruit. In recent weeks GM has established a worldwide purchasing organisation, headed by one of the key executives from its successful European operations, Mr Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. Mr Lopez, GM vice-president in charge of worldwide purchasing with effect from May 1, has also become a member of both of GM's North American and European strategy boards. He has already stunned the US component industry by indicating, at a meeting last month with top executives of 600 suppliers and 200 GM purchasing managers, that existing GM contracts are open to new bids. It is thought that GM could be seeking more than the 7 per cent price cuts over three years it had already begun to demand last year. The carrot Mr Lopez is dangling is the opportunity to sell products to GM worldwide under long-term contracts. According to Mr Stempel long-term contracts, some for the life of a new model, would provide suppliers with the necessary volume to support their capital investments to reduce costs and improve quality. 'We're going to concentrate on suppliers who meet our cost and quality standards.' The pressures on GM are being felt by all vehicle makers, and the crucial relationship between the vehicle producers and their suppliers is being fundamentally transformed. The leading vehicle makers are creating global operations, forcing the component producers to match this international expansion if they wish to maintain their central supplier roles. At the same time they are off-setting research and development spending by globally sourcing their component requirements, increasingly in the form of built-up systems. The vehicle makers are using larger purchasing volumes - sometimes in alliances as in the case of Renault of France and Volvo of Sweden - in order to push down supply costs. Renault and Volvo announced late last month far-reaching steps to achieve a genuine joint purchasing strategy 'to control costs by reducing purchasing prices' with the aim of bringing the proportion of the two groups' total purchases from joint outside suppliers to 80 per cent from only 15 per cent today. The vehicle makers are also drastically cutting the number of their suppliers to simplify their purchasing relationships and to delegate more responsibilities to their main so-called first tier suppliers. Ford has reduced its worldwide supplier base by more than half from 1980 levels and intends to reduce it by an additional third by 1995. Ford of Europe has cut the number of its suppliers by 15 per cent to 900 since 1988 and plans to shrink the total to 600 by 1995. In response, the component manufacturers are being forced into an era of drastic restructuring. The market leaders are seeking to establish a presence in all the principal vehicle- producing regions of the world with global representation in terms of production plants. According to Mr Noel Goutard, chairman and chief executive of Valeo, the leading French auto components maker, 'We must migrate with our European clients eastwards to countries such as Russia and China, and we must accompany the Japanese in their incursion into the west, Europe and the US, as well as build up our presence in Japan.' The component makers are having to concentrate their R &amp; D resources to establish a competitive edge in principal technologies, while also gaining the necessary scale of production volumes to be able to compete on price and to ensure financial survival. It is a high risk business. 'Our fate as components and systems suppliers depends on the capacity to survive of each of our customers. In the merciless war being waged in the automotive industry, there are winners and losers,' says Mr Goutard. 'When the losers fall, their suppliers frequently stand to suffer heavy losses and the big investments made to serve the customer are reduced to ashes.' Leading component suppliers are taking on a considerably enhanced role as the vehicle makers seek to delegate more component and systems research and development work to the supply industry. According to Mr Goutard, suppliers are 'no longer just producers of parts for vehicle manufacturers. We have become providers of services including the development of products and systems with a high advanced research content. We supply manufacturers with logistics and we finance their inventory.' He maintains that the financial pressures on the supplier sector have greatly increased. 'Our customers make us finance inventory, developments, heavy R &amp; D resources, tooling.' Longer-term partnerships are emerging linking the vehicle producers with favoured suppliers. Replacing the old adversarial relationships is not always proving easy, however, and a wide credibility gap often yawns between industry rhetoric and practice. 'Purchasing policies still vary enormously from one manufacturer to another,' says Mr Goutard. The era of global expansion by the Japanese vehicle makers has set fresh challenges raising the vehicle manufacturers' requirements in terms of price, quality and delivery. The spread of Japanese vehicle production plants to North America and now to Europe has also heralded an unprecedented level of direct involvement by the vehicle producers in their suppliers' operations and businesses. The vehicle makers take it for granted that they will share directly and immediately in efficiency and productivity gains made by their suppliers. Increasingly they are sending in their own advisory teams to work directly in suppliers' plants. The expansion of the Japanese presence is also creating a new wave of trade conflicts, most importantly between the US and Japan. This year Washington and Detroit have joined forces to an unprecedented degree - highlighted by the acrimonious visit by President Bush to Tokyo earlier this year accompanied by a business delegation including all the chairmen of the big three US vehicle makers, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. The US initiative has brought fresh promises from the Japanese motor industry to buy more US components both for use in Japan and in the Japanese car plants in North America, but the recent concessions will scarcely dent the chronic US automotive trade deficit with Japan. Within North America, the US administration is using customs regulations on local content to try to force Japanese vehicle makers to use more locally-produced components - Honda's Canadian car production is the test case - while a barrage of protective trade legislation has been proposed in Congress aimed at limiting Japanese market share and vehicle production in the US and at cutting the trade deficit. To date, Japanese component makers have followed the Japanese vehicle makers more into North America than into Europe, but the established North American and European component suppliers must capture new business from the incoming Japanese transplant operations, if they are to succeed and supplement sometimes shrinking business with their traditional customers. According to ELM, the US automotive analysts, Japanese automakers produced 1.62m cars, 295,000 light trucks, 321,000 transmissions and 735,000 engines in the US and Canada in 1991. 'Each of these figures is expected to increase substantially over the next five years. In 1991, 18 per cent of the cars built in North America were built in assembly plants owned or controlled by Japanese automakers.' ELM claims that the number of Japanese parts suppliers with plants in North America supplying the Japanese automakers' North American assembly plants rose from 220 in 1990 to 276 in 1992. At the same time, the number of US companies supplying these same Japanese automakers in North America rose from 309 in 1990 to 372 by early 1992. Auto components companies face, too, a difficult challenge from changing technologies and must move quickly to adapt to the shift to electronics, the move to lighter weight materials, and the impact of government regulations requiring alternative fuel vehicles, and setting much tougher exhaust emissions and safety standards. Almost all principal components are being transformed through the introduction of electronics. It is a daunting challenge for the component suppliers. According to Mr Harold Poling, chairman and chief executive of Ford, one of the most pressing objectives for the vehicle makers is to bring new products to the market faster. 'We intend to reduce product development time by 25 per cent, and our suppliers will play a key role in meeting this goal. 'We will need supplier partners who can commit early in the product development cycle, work with us to better integrate design and manufacturing requirements and be full-time, full-service participants in the process of bringing a car or truck to market.'</p>

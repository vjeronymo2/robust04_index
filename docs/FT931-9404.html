			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Outdoors: How I mastered a monster - Fishing THE epic account of the epic battle is a staple of fishing literature. These descriptions are commonly variations on a standard theme: 'The rod bucked like a wild horse in my hands . . . the reel screamed/shrieked/howled . . . the fish leaped skyward, lit by the sun, like a bar of silver . . . the huge tail lashed the water into foam . . . a final desperate bid for freedom . . . ' This kind of thing becomes wearisome. The trouble is that, while the outcome and the incidentals vary, one struggle with a big fish is pretty much like another. The fish pulls. The angler pulls. The fish dashes around. The angler dashes after it. One side or the other wins. If the angler loses, he swears. I would not deny that the fighting of the fish is an integral, thrilling part of the sport. It stirs deep responses within us, and is the necessary prelude to the glow of triumph or the bleakness of despair. But the purest, most intense excitement precedes the fight, before the angler does anything much beyond watching and waiting. It is the moment of the take. And I would further suggest that, in its highest form, it must engage the visual rather than just the tactile sense. This is not to disparage the heart-stopping moment at which the salmon or trout grabs the fly. But more often than not, this is merely felt, not seen. It may be that, at that moment, you are concentrating hard on your fishing. But you may, equally well, be ruminating on the excesses of the gutter press or the wisdom of privatising the railways. Contrast this with the responsibilities of the dry fly man addressing a trout which is on the feed. He must cast, spot his fly, chart its progress towards his quarry, and then, as the surface is broken and it vanishes, be ready. If his mind wanders, he is lost. It is a sure bet that the moment he starts pondering the issue of the female priesthood the fish will rise and he will miss it. But I sometimes feel that fishing with the humble float offers an even purer pleasure. Pleasing in appearance, even more pleasing in disappearance is how one writer expressed the joy of float fishing with exquisite pungency. Its glory lies in the variations in the manner of that disappearance. The float may tremble awhile, then move off with steady purpose before slanting into the depths. It may do no more than dip. It may stir almost imperceptibly, then glide away. It may bob for minutes, before being pulled under. Or it may be jerked from sight without warning. The fisherman waits and watches, shaking under the strain of powerful emotions. These reflections came to me recently, as my favourite crimson-topped pike float circled the backwater. It was a glorious day to be out, with a clean breeze dispelling the internal fog bequeathed by seasonal piggishness. The river, as if content to have turned most of the surrounding countryside into a lake for the previous two months, had retreated within its banks for the time being. But it was still running high and the backwater was the only spot tranquil enough for my float. Using an elderly carp rod and an antique centrepin reel, I lobbed float and sprat towards the willow tree on the far side. They had travelled no more than a couple of yards when the float stopped, vibrated for a second as if conducting an electric current, and shot under. I could see the crimson tip beneath the water, whizzing towards the willow, and I struck. The rod bucked, the reel whined. No, after what I have said already, I had better leave that bit out. Suffice it to say that after a stern contest, I netted a magnificent small-headed, fat-bodied female pike; gawped at it; thrust it into a keepnet; and ran off to the house to find witnesses. Plastered in mud, dripping with pike slime and reeking of sprats, I hurtled upstairs in search of the infinitely indulgent couple who let me have the run of the place. 'I have caught a monster,' I bawled. 'You have got to come and look at it.' They humoured me and came, and - I hope and believe - were properly impressed by the creature's size and beauty. I slipped it back alive into the weirpool and, with a flick of its tail, it went off to resume terrorising the lesser species. One does not fish on after such a triumph, so I went home, singing. The pike weighed 23 lb and was, by half a pound, the biggest fish I have ever caught.</p>

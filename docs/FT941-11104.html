			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Books: A pioneer of passion - A new biography of Thomas Hardy HARDY by Martin Seymour-Smith Bloomsbury Pounds 25, 886 pages In the summer of 1856, Thomas Hardy watched the hanging of Martha Brown, a hawker's wife who had killed her husband in a jealous fit. 'I remember what a fine figure she showed against the sky as she hung in the misty rain, and how the tight black silk gown set off her shape as she wheeled half round and back,' Hardy wrote. He was just 16, and all his life sex and death were to remain inextricably linked in his mind. Courting his first wife Emma, he saw her standing by a garden gate as if against a cross, and had a premonition that in marriage he would crucify her. Decades later, in his masterpiece Tess of the d'Urbervilles, his most popular and poetic heroine is hanged for stabbing her lover. His blood drip drip drips through the floor into the room below as did that of a soldier who committed suicide in a Dartmoor inn shortly before Hardy began the novel. How does the poetic imagination work? What sparks the creative impulse? Modest, formal, reserved, Hardy never looked like the author of his sensual melodramatic fictions. Henry James sneered at him as 'the good little Thomas Hardy,' and his own Life, written in the third person as if by his wife and published after his death, is a model of discretion. Previous biographers have marked impotence and a sense of social inferiority as keynotes to his character. Here we have a new picture of Hardy as an energetic, passionate pioneer who revolutionised Victorian literature, introducing psychological exactitude to poetry and sexual expression into novels for the first time. There are flaws in this biography, but Seymour-Smith's relation of the life to the work is illuminating. Hardy was born in 1840 to a domineering mother of peasant origins, but literary aspirations (she gave him Dryden for his eighth birthday). He became the village school ma'am's pet, and loved the 'thrilling frou-frou of her four gray silk flounces' - the start of a lifelong romance with femininity. Behind all his work was his famous roving eye; he would fall in love with fleeting images - a woman on a steamer, a girl on horseback - and transform them into richly detailed characters. Seymour-Smith makes a good case for his wife Emma, the powerful and difficult first Mrs Hardy, as stimulating muse rather than the crazy harridan of legend. She is the heroine of early novels such as A Pair of Blue Eyes, and subject of over 100 poems written the year she died. 'It is difficult,' Hardy wrote in Far from the Madding Crowd, 'for a woman to define her feelings in language which is chiefly made by men to express theirs.' Few male writers have treated women more sensitively; behind Hardy's tenderness is some of Emma's voice and mind. In 1885 the couple settled at Max Gate, their hideous gloomy home in Dorchester; his secretary called the house 'the solidification in brick of Hardy's . . . mood of helplessness and the ugliness in life.' While Hardy needed to live at the heart of his fictional Wessex - his Casterbridge is Dorchester - Emma hated parochial Dorset. Childlessness drove the pair further apart, and Seymour-Smith suggests that the wife sale which opens The Mayor of Casterbridge reflects Hardy's sense that he had sacrificed his wife to his literary ambition. 'Not to be born is best,' Hardy said. His great late novels are bleak, cruel but seething with forbidden sexuality. On both scores, he clashed with the establishment. An early review complained that Tess, story of a dairymaid's doomed love affairs, had 'no gleam of sunshine anywhere, except for some hours spent with cows'. Jude the Obscure (1896) was billed as Jude the Obscene; one reader burnt the book and posted the ashes to the author. Hardy lived until 1928, but gave up writing novels. Seymour-Smith is eloquent on Hardy as a writer ahead of his time, who paid a price for outraging his public. It is a fair view, but too trenchantly held. Firstly, the price was not so severe - Tess, despite or because of the critics, was a scandalous 1890s bestseller which made Hardy very rich. Secondly, and more seriously, Seymour-Smith writes as though Hardy is still attacked on all fronts, and he explodes every few pages into venomous tirades against contemporaries, recent biographers, academics who treat Hardy as a 'misguided peasant'. This is absurd. Hardy does not need defending. Why drown a portrait of the man in a deluge of aggression and justification? Seymour-Smith is a fine literary critic, but his book is unbalanced, long-winded, unscholarly and unedited: no footnotes, shoddy index, Emma still snipingly alive at the end of the chapter called Emma's Death. And it is wildly speculative: 'Unlike other biographers, I believe Florence Dugdale and Tom were lovers . . . they became so at Strafford House at the time of her first visit there. I do not think, however, that at Strafford House it went as far as full intercourse. That would first have happened in April 1910 . . .' Hardy ended life writing poetry, reluctantly married (to his mistress Florence) for a second time, famous but retiring. Virginia Woolf, in an anecdote not told here, recalled making the pilgrimage to Max Gate and finding Hardy silent on matters literary. 'I could only ask him which of his books he would have chosen if, like me, he had to choose one to read in a train. I had taken The Mayor of Casterbridge. There was a pause and then 'Did it hold your interest'?' he asked. In a few lines, Woolf gives a snapshot of Hardy the man which Seymour-Smith does not achieve in 900 pages.</p>

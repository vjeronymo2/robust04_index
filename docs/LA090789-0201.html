			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FRANK ADMITS HE CANCELED LOVER'S PARKING TICKETS  </P> <P> Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) said today that he used his congressional immunity  to write off delinquent parking tickets for a personal aide who also was a male  prostitute, but only when the assistant was on official business for him.  </P> <P> Frank said the aide, Stephen L. Gobie, had used his car while on official  business and had access to the car when he was away.  </P> <P> "There are some occasions when tickets were issued even though the car was  being used on official business," Frank said in a statement. "I did ask that  such tickets be waived" by writing to the House sergeant-at-arms, he said.  </P> <P> Frank's statement elaborated on comments he made in an interview published in  today's editions of the Washington Times.  </P> <P> The lawmaker branded as "lies" Gobie's assertion to the paper that Frank had  knowingly intervened to waive tickets the aide received while using Frank's car  to keep appointments for illicit sex.  </P> <P> Gobie, who contends that he operated an escort service using Frank's car and  Capitol Hill apartment, told the newspaper he used the car to transport  prostitutes and even to have sex.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DEFENSE STANDS TALL FOR WESTLAKE  </P> <P> The book on Westlake High was simple.  </P> <P> The Warriors chewed up more yardage than all the cattle in Texas. And they gave  it up just as freely.  </P> <P> On Friday night, however, Westlake put all of its beef on the defensive line  and stood firm during an impressive fourth-quarter goal-line stand that  preserved a 21-14 Marmonte League victory over Camarillo.  </P> <P> The Warriors (5-0, 2-0 in league play) were clinging to a seven-point lead with  less than seven minutes left when the Scorpions (2-3, 1-1) moved the ball to  the Westlake one-yard line.  </P> <P> On second and goal, the Warriors stopped running back Tag Johnson up the  middle. Then they stifled quarterback Corey Tucker, setting up fourth and goal.  </P> <P> It was Tucker again. And again, he was stopped dead in his tracks.  </P> <P> "We should have put it in," Camarillo Coach Carl Thompson said. "If you can't  put it in from there you don't deserve to win."  </P> <P> Still, the underdog Scorpions were in the game all the way. The teams entered  the second half tied, 14-14.  </P> <P> The Warriors scored what proved to be the winning touchdown midway through the  third quarter when quarterback Todd Preston connected with Erik Holcomb for a  49-yard scoring pass.  </P> <P> Preston completed 16 of 29 attempts for 239 yards and two touchdowns. He also  hit Seamus Gibbons for a three-yard touchdown pass in the first quarter.  </P> <P> But Preston also threw a pass that was intercepted by Tucker, setting up the  showdown at the goal line.  </P> <P> Westlake's Reuben Allen, who had gained 604 yards in the Warriors' four  previous games, was limited to 94 in 24 carries. It was the first time this  season that he had been held to less than 100 yards. He did, however, score  Westlake's second touchdown, a 22-yard run in the second quarter.  </P> <P> Before the game, a porous Westlake defense had been concerned about stopping  Camarillo's wishbone attack, and the Scorpions had to prove that they could  stop the wide-open passing of the Warriors. Westlake got the upper hand,  though, outgaining Camarillo, 326-175.  </P> <P> Westlake took a 6-0 lead on its first drive when Preston connected with Gibbons  for a touchdown pass. Preston's point-after kick was blocked at the line.  </P> <P> The Scorpions took their only lead on their next possession. The 72-yard drive  was capped by Fahali Campbell's one-yard scoring run.  </P> <P> After Allen's run and a two-point conversion had given the Warriors a 14-7  lead, Camarillo marched 68 yards, Mike Madsen scoring on a 39-yard run.  </P></p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Reforming Japan THE DEREGULATION package proposed yesterday by the new government in Tokyo is the clearest sign yet that the reformist ambitions of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, stretch beyond the political system into the character of Japan's economy. Even though Japan has fiercely competitive markets in international industries such as cars and electronics, many largely domestic areas such as retailing and distribution are encrusted by regulations. These accumulated during the Liberal Democratic Party's 38-year reign, which ended in July, as it offered small businesses, retailers and farmers protection from competition in return for their votes. The myriad hurdles put in the way of a new shop opening, for instance, make it difficult for new entrants to set up in business, whether they are foreign or Japanese. As a result, competition is constrained and prices stay higher than they need be. The international ramifications go further. Japan's trade surplus is a reflection of its high savings rate. A sustained shift towards consumption to reduce savings, and so the trade surplus, will require a relaxation of planning laws to make it easier for retailers to build shops and consumers to buy houses, for which they will buy goods. Japanese consumption is severely constrained by limits on housing development imposed by regulations to protect farmers. Sceptics will caution that the Hosokawa coalition will face fierce opposition from the bureaucracy and business lobbies which could break it apart. Indeed, there are already signs of serious dissension over whether the government's mandate extends to thoroughgoing economic reform or is confined to enacting changes in the political system. Japan stands to benefit most if Mr Hosokawa is bold: his tentative step towards deregulation is a hint of how much a reformist government could achieve with several years in power, backed by powerful constituencies in favour of liberalisation, not least urban consumers. The Bank of Japan and Ministry of Finance support deregulation as a means of heading off US pressure for further stimulus to boost the still sluggish economy and cut the trade surplus. The truth is there is still room and need for a further cut in interest rates and a tax-cutting package this autumn. But the promise of deregulation also suggests a change of approach is needed on the part of Japan's partners, in particular the Clinton administration. It has sought to justify its call for managed trade agreements with Tokyo on the grounds that efforts to open up markets are rebuffed by bureaucratic resistance and political inertia. The US is now dealing with a government which is prepared to deregulate in the name of competition and the consumer. The Hosokawa government represents a chance for Japan to break with the past, and should be embraced by the Clinton administration as such.</p>

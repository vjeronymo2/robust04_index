			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Serb fighters enter Bosanski Brod SERB FIGHTERS yesterday entered Bosanski Brod, the last important town in the Posavina region held by Croats and Moslems in north Bosnia, Reuter reports from Belgrade. This brings them within a stone's throw of Croatia. By taking Bosanski Brod, the Serbs have won complete control of the area and have consolidated a corridor linking Serbia to Krajina in the west, a region they captured in the war with Croatia last year. Serbian television also reported that the refinery in the town had been taken and Croat forces routed. The first shots of the Bosnian war were fired in Bosanski Brod last March in a shoot-out between local police and rebel Serbs.</p>

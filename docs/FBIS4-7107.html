			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 27 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The leader  of the Mongolian Democratic Association (MDA) T. Elbegdorj held  a press conference concerning the results of the completed  yesterday in the capital of Mongolia political hunger strike.  The action which lasted from 13 April to 25 pursued the purpose  of resignation of the present premier and his team. About 41  people altogether were taking part in the hunger strike  representing a number of democratic public organizations.    The main reason for such a immense pressure on the part of  the opposition lies in the corruptiveness of the highest  echelons of power as is being proclaimed by the democratic  forces and disability of the government to cope with its own  programme and the social economic problems as well.    Answering the direct question by a correspondent about  whether it should be considered as a defeat the fact that though  the action is ceased whereas the prime minister is preserving  his post T. Elbegdorj said that the struggle for the resignation  of the government is facing a new stage acquiring new forms.  Parallel with this he criticized the president saying that the  position of the president and his environment was unclear and  equivocal.    During the course of the action the public of the country  had  been provided with the possibilities to have the true notion  formed concerning the incumbent government which has not any  more moral and ethical rights to guide the country. The  government is steeped in the corruption and we sure that we  would be supported widely by the public stressed the leader of  the MDA in conclusion.</p>

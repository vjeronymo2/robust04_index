			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Aris R. Ilagan] </F>   [Text] Top officials of the Philippine Army have ordered  the deactivation of two infantry battalions in Bicol and Davao  del Sur to streamline the military organization.    This is aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness  of Army troopers both in combat and non-combat missions, Lt.  Gen. Romulo F. Yap, Army chief, said.    He ordered the disbandment of the 49th Infantry Battalion  based in Barangay [Village] Bacolod, Una, Sorsogon, and the 37th  Infantry Battalion in Sitio [Village District] Cogon, Barangay  Tuban, Sta. [Santa] Cruz, Davao del Sur.    Yap said the deactivation of the two battalions, each with  about 300 troopers takes effect on 1 July.    With the deactivation of the two battalions, only 76 remain  engaged in counterinsurgency, ecological preservation, and  support operations to police forces in neutralizing organized  criminal organizations.    The Army chief said 20 percent of the battalion's personnel  who were undertaking administrative jobs in their headquarters  unit can be reassigned to other battalions as part of the  regular forces.    "While we lessen the manpower involved in administrative  jobs  in every headquarters, unit we increase the regular troopers  engaged in combat missions," Yap said.    When Yap assumed command of the Philippine Army last April,  he urged the implementation of the total quality management  (TQM) approach aimed at maximizing the efficiency of every unit  despite the constraints in material resources to achieve the  command's objectives.    Army authorities, who refused to be identified, said more  battalions will be deactivated, as part of the military's  streamlining efforts.</p>

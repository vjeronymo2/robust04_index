			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Co-op Bank aided by lower bad debt provisions A combination of lower provisions for bad and doubtful debts and higher operating income helped Co-operative Bank to a 37 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the year to late July. As well as announcing the interim results, the bank sought to underline its commitment to service for customers by launching a guarantee in five areas of service where it will pay Pounds 10 compensation each time it fails to meet the standards it has set itself. Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 11.05m (Pounds 8.07m), while provisions fell by 15 per cent to Pounds 16.68m (Pounds 19.53m). Mr Terry Thomas, managing director, said he expected provisions to fall further though the scale of reductions would depend on economic improvement. He said that while Monday's 0.5 percentage point rise in the base rate would make balances held by the bank worth more, it would not give an opportunity to widen interest margins. He predicted continuing pressure on margins, suggesting that they might fall a further 0.1 percentage point in the second half of the year. Despite the lower net interest margin of 4.5 per cent (4.8 per cent), net interest increased to Pounds 71.8m (Pounds 69.4m) partly as a result of higher retail loans and deposits. Non-interest income which includes commission from Visa, the card payment system, rose by Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 52.5m. Expenses rose by 5 per cent to Pounds 96.4m (Pounds 91.9m), reflecting particularly an increase in costs from losing and relocating staff as a result of the bank's re-organisation. The bank is expanding the number of its automated banking kiosks from 16 to 30 by the end of the year, but does not expect to open any more branches. Mr Thomas also said that the bank's five guaranteed service standards for its 2m personal customers covered areas such as dealing correctly with standing orders and direct debits, and swift decisions on overdrafts or personal loans. It amounted, he said to a challenge to the other banks to offer similar guarantees. The bank estimates there will be significantly fewer than 40,000 errors a year. He dismissed the promise made by Midland Bank of Pounds 10 compensation for each error made in transferring a customer's current account from another bank as a 'nine days' wonder'.</p>

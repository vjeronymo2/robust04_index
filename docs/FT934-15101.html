			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (1): Exports are ray of hope in bleak year - The effects of recession are likely to be felt well into 1995 in Italy. There is, however, one exceptionally bright spot. Export orders for Italian goods have surged, riding on the back of a devalued lira and well-contained wage costs INDUSTRY has suffered most from the current recession in Italy and 1994 promises to be another bleak year. The balance sheets of flagship private sector groups such as Fiat are heavily in the red and even the myriad small and medium-sized companies have been squeezed. The Turin-based automotive group has been obliged to carry out a huge recapitalisation and form a core of friendly shareholders to remain a player in the cut-throat competition of the international car business. Olivetti, the computers and office equipment group, is struggling to recoup its elan amid losses. And of the large companies, only Pirelli has begun to turn round after returning to its core business of tyres and cables. Life has been even harder among the state industrial groups as major surgery gets under way to close uneconomic plant, offset heavy financial charges and prune excess labour against a background of ambitious, but as yet unfulfilled, privatisation plans. Emblematic is the fate of Ilva, the state steel group. Itself the product of three changes of identity since the seventies, it is now due to be split into two and lose a quarter of its workforce to adapt to European overcapacity. Everywhere the three-year-old decline in production and the formal onset of recession in mid-1992 has left a trail of jobless. The trades unions estimate that almost 250,000 jobs have been lost in industry this year. This rhythm of redundancies shows no sign of slowing. As a result, unemployment, and the destabilising effects of labour unrest, have moved to the top of the Ciampi government's agenda. There is, however, one exceptionally bright spot. Export orders for Italian goods have surged, riding on the back of a devalued lira and well-contained wage costs. In the first half of 1993, exports were up 20 per cent in value. The increase was particularly impressive outside the EC, rising 30 per cent against the same period in 1992. The export performance has provided a vital supply of oxygen to most industries this year when domestic demand has dropped more sharply than at any time since the first oil shock of the seventies. Overall demand could fall as much 3 per cent this year. However, economists at Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation, are convinced the basis is being laid for an export-led recovery next year. They point out that inflation continues to come down - last month it was running at an annualised 4 per cent - and should be well below projections of 3.5 per cent for 1994. In these circumstances, if the fall in domestic demand stabilises and the export trend continues, the economy will return to growth of around 1.5 per cent in 1994. This year, growth is expected to be negative: minus 0.3 per cent. Nevertheless, the effects of recession are likely to be felt well into 1995 even if a recovery begins in the first half of 1994. The domestic climate remains one of relatively high interest rates and austerity as the government tackles public spending. The 1994 budget, now before parliament, proposes to reduce the heavy fiscal pressure by 1 percentage point but offers few corporate tax concessions. If anything, loopholes are being closed on devices used as tax breaks. Public spending cuts, to reduce the budget deficit to 8.7 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), will be felt by those parts of industry that have traditionally fed off public works contracts. The corruption scandals have already led to temporary freezes on numerous contracts, notably for roads and municipal projects. However, the budget squeeze and the effect of the corruption scandals can be mitigated by better administration of the funds available. Infrastructure contracts in particular have been hugely inflated to accommodate illicit pay-offs. As a result, Italy faces the challenges of closer European integration with roads, railways, ports and airports below the standards of its main partners. The government is anxious to make an early start on the L36,000bn (Pounds 14.9bn) plan to introduce a high-speed train network, beginning either with a Rome-Naples connection or the Turin-Milan-Venice link. Industrialists are the first to recognise that public works projects are but a palliative. Their two main demands are an end to the rigidities in the labour market and a further fall in interest rates. In July, Confindustria, the unions and the government signed an historic tripartite agreement which abolished the long-standing principle of indexed wages and established that future pay increases be linked to productivity. The union sacrificed wages to protect jobs on the understanding that their two partners would make a determined effort to boost spending on research and development (R&amp;D), high technology sectors and job training. The industrialists for their part viewed the agreement as a first step towards a more flexible labour market. They want temporary job contracts, easier hire-and-fire regulations, special wages for trainees and an end to the national minimum wage. Mr Antonio Maccanico, deputy prime minister and the Ciampi government's chief trouble shooter, believes common ground can be found. Temporary employment is likely to be introduced, disguised under the name of 'solidarity contracts', and another cosmetic formula will probably be found to disguise the growing practical difference between wages in the north and south of the country. The second leg to the industrialists' demand - lowering interest rates to the European norm - will not be easy because of the behaviour of the banks. Italian banks retain spreads of up to 5 per cent. These high margins are needed to offset heavy bad loan provisions that have accumulated in the past two years and worse could be in the pipeline. The collapse of the Ferruzzi-Montedison group, Italy's second-largest private concern, with outstanding debts of L31,000bn, has underlined the risks. Meanwhile, bank operating costs are high due to inefficiencies and overstaffing. Thus at the very moment when Italian industry most needs interest rates to drop by at least another three percentage points, the banks cannot easily oblige. A proper alignment of interest rates is unlikely to occur until the financial system is modernised through much talked-of privatisation. The state still controls two thirds of the banking and financial system. If the industrialists' complaints are justified, they too can be taken to task on a number of fronts. Investment remains too rooted in Italy; more investment should follow export success on the ground. Too little attention continues to be devoted to developing international alliances and too often attempts at such alliances have been mishandled. As a result, Italy possesses the smallest number of multinational companies among its main trading partners. Another aspect of this 'provincialism' is the continued family control of so many businesses. Although such control provides the great advantage of flexibility, it also inhibits financial transparency and limits the introduction of modern management techniques. The state-controlled industrial groups also suffer from lack of transparency, but in their case it is combined with overly rigid management structures. Happily, Prof Romano Prodi at IRI, the state holding company, and Mr Franco Bernabe, at ENI, the state oil concern, have begun to apply a fresh broom. The drying-up of state hand-outs and the need to privatise has left little alternative. The Ciampi government has promised to speed up privatisation. But the complexities of large-scale sell-offs in industry and banking will inevitably spread the divestiture over at least the next three years. A hint of the problems ahead has been provided by the saga of Efim, the state industrial holding placed in liquidation in July 1992 with debts of L18,000bn. Winding up Efim has been marked by changes of policy and a poor understanding of the sensitivities of the international financial community  -while only one large company, SIV, the glassmaker, has been sold off.</p>

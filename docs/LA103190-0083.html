			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT&amp;T GIVING CONSUMERS ACCESS TO TRANSLATOR SERVICE  </P> <P> American Telephone &amp; Telegraph on Tuesday extended to consumers its  worldwide telephone interpretation service that gives callers 24-hour-a-day  access to translators in about 140 languages.  </P> <P> The service is designed to help non-English-speaking immigrants in the United  States, Americans traveling abroad and Americans needing translation services  for foreign or domestic calls.  </P> <P> The program is an expansion of AT&amp;T Language Line Services, an operation  that provides translations to help institutions communicate with callers who do  not speak English. That service was started in February for businesses, public  utilities, institutions and providers of emergency services such as fire and  police departments but has not been offered to consumers until now.  </P> <P> "We're responding to requests to make this available to those outside our  subscription base service for institutions," said Jeff Munks, director of  marketing and sales for Language Line Services. "This addresses a very real  need. People have been eternally frustrated because of a lack of a service like  this."  </P> <P> Munks said hundreds of translators have been retained, some on the staff at the  Language Line Services headquarters in Monterey, Calif., and some on a contract  basis. The service costs $3.50 for each minute and can be billed to major  credit cards, the company said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- Federal President Richard von Weizsaecker  has praised President Yeltsin's willingness to carry out reforms  and his personal courage. In a prerelease of the speech that he  made at lunch, von Weizsaecker spoke in favor of merging German  and Russian interests, which would also benefit both countries'  neighbors. In connection with German unity, the Russian people  have not only shown generosity, but also confidence in a common  future of both nations.    "The pictures of August 1991, when you risked your life  resisting force and speaking out for free human rights, have  become historic documents and will serve as a model for future  generations, showing what initiative and the convictions of an  individual can achieve," Weizsaecker told Yeltsin.  German-Russian relations today are no longer a game of changing  alliances to realize national or dynastic interests at the  expense of third parties. Today's task is conducting a new  policy.    In spite of its vast area, reaching into Asia, Russia will  remain a determining and enriching part of Europe in cultural,  historical, and economic terms. "For me it is one of the  miracles of history that the suffering that Hitler inflicted on  Russia could not destroy the deep inner relationship between the  Germans and the Russians," the president said. Both back then  and today, the Russian people have shown great human strength  and historic power. "Russia is a great nation," Weizsaecker  said.</p>

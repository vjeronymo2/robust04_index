			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN;  </P> <P> WITHOUT A WORD, MUSEUM WILL MIX MUSIC AND FILM  </P> <P> If imitation is one of the choicer modes of flattery, then the San Diego  Symphony should feel duly flattered. The popularity of its 2-year-old  "Nickelodeon" series, which has brought a number of classic silent films to  life with period orchestral accompaniment, has encouraged the La Jolla Museum  of Contemporary Art to experiment with a similar format.  </P> <P> Saturday night at Sherwood Auditorium, the museum will present Buster Keaton's  1926 silent film, "The General," accompanied by the San Diego Cine-phonic  theater orchestra under the baton of Eric Beheim. "Cops," a shorter film also  by Keaton, will accompany "The General." If this fare is a hit with the La  Jolla cinema audience -- the museum sponsors about 70 evenings of films every  year -- the museum's resident film curator, Gregory Kahn, has two more silent  films waiting in the wings.  </P> <P> "I've attended all the 'Nickelodeon' performances at Symphony Hall," Kahn said.  "I think the advantage of the museum's presentation is that the setting is more  intimate. The audience will actually be able to see the players, and the size  of orchestra is more authentic to what audiences would have found in San Diego  theaters such as the Spreckels and the Fox in the 1920s."  </P> <P> Kahn explained that the museum decided to place the musicians on stage just to  the right of the screen, rather than below the screen in a pit. Sherwood  Auditorium does not have a pit, of course, but, for some chamber opera  performances given there, the front rows of audience seating have been removed  to accommodate such placement.  </P> <P> According to Kahn, "The General" is one of the best films of the genre.  </P> <P> "Every decade, 'Sight and Sound,' the British film industry quarterly, runs a  list of the 10 best films," Kahn said. " 'The General' is consistently on that  list. Made at the apex of Keaton's film career, 'The General' is not only his  most successful film, but the one done on the biggest budget. It was shot on  location (rather than on studio lots), and they blew up real railway bridges  when the story called for it. Also, Keaton did all of his own stunt work."  </P> <P> Beheim is a local musician who plays in the pit for touring musicals and has  conducted the Seaport Village Band on occasion. A few years ago, he started  playing silent films with friends as an amusement.  </P> <P> "I've collected silent films since I was a college student in the 1960s,"  Beheim said, "and, in 1981, I acquired a private collection of some 1,800  silent film accompaniments."  </P> <P> Although Beheim said there is no extant musical score to "The General," he owns  an authentic orchestra cue sheet sent out by the studio to accompany the film.  </P> <P> "The cue sheet gives indications such as 'mood music number 5' or 'mysterioso  number 3.' Some of the more specific musical indications I've changed, however.  For example, a 1920s jazz piece 'Alabama Bound' would not be recognized or have  any meaning to an audience today. And, especially since it's not a Civil  War-era song, I've replaced it with period songs such as 'Marching Through  Georgia,' 'Dixie' and 'Rally 'Round the Flag'."  </P> <P> Beheim's 12-piece orchestra includes five strings and six winds, as well as a  drummer and sound-effects man. The latter is responsible for musical noises  such as train whistles, cannon shots and train wrecks.  </P> <P> "It's all done live," Beheim said. "We don't use any recorded sound effects."  </P> <P> Wish you were here: For the La Jolla Symphony's season-opening concert Sept.  23, music director Thomas Nee had lined up noted classical guitarists Pepe and  Celin Romero. Last week, the brothers canceled their appearance because of a  scheduling conflict. While guitarists Randy Pile and Alex Dunn, both proteges  of Pepe Romero, will still perform on the all-Rodrigo program, two of the  larger Rodrigo concertos had to be dropped from the program. In place of  "Concierto Para una Fiesta" and "Concierto Andaluz," Nee's orchestra will play  one of the few Rodrigo works without guitars, the "Suite Soleriana."  </P> <P> The king of instruments: The University of San Diego will dedicate a new pipe  organ at 8 p.m. Friday in Founders Chapel. Organist Robert Thompson will play  the dedicatory recital on the single keyboard, mechanical-action instrument  constructed by Missouri organ builder Martin Ott. The new instrument, placed in  the front of the chapel, will complement the larger pipe organ in the chapel's  rear gallery.  </P> <P> Thompson's program will include two works commissioned for the event,  Variations on "Sine Nomine" by Chicago composer Richard Proulx and "Trompe  l'Orielle" by UC San Diego composer Randall Giles. Because the Giles piece  requires both of the chapel's organs, USD music director Father Nicolas Reveles  will assist Thompson. Accompanied by the USD String Octet, Reveles will perform  Handel's Organ Concerto in B-flat, Op. 4, No. 6. Thompson is director of music  at All Souls' Episcopal Church, Point Loma, and is a former faculty member of  St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minn.  </P> <P> Theme and variations: The downtown San Diego Public Library will open its fall  chamber music series tonight with a recital by pianist Edith Orloff. . . .  Choral singers have one last chance to audition for the upcoming season of the  La Jolla Symphony Chorus. Director David Chase will be taking his charges on a  two-week tour of Poland and the Soviet Union next spring; interested singers  should contact Peter Jorgensen at 481-1582 this week to schedule an audition. .  . . St. Paul's Episcopal Cathedral will inaugurate a series of noon-hour  recitals Wednesday with a performance by the UC San Diego Woodwind Quintet.  </P></p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / HMSO may face legal action on copyright Legal publishers may take legal action against HMSO, the stationery office, after talks broke down over material covered by crown copyright. The Professional Publishers Permissions Group which comprises all the main legal publishers complains that since HMSO was given executive agency status in 1988 it has adopted a more restrictive approach to licensing of crown copyright. The group says that HMSO's new stance amounts to an abuse of its monopoly position as supplier of crown and parliamentary copyright material and threatens the future viability of their businesses. The publishers add value to basic legislative texts, such as statutes and regulations, by collating relevant materials on related topics, providing commentary and notes and updating the materials. They are concerned over HMSO's refusal to license them to reproduce some crown copyright material, such as the Police and Criminal Evidence Act codes, the Highway Code and other departmental guidance notes. They are also concerned that HMSO has begun to enter the value-added market, exploiting its exclusive rights over source materials. HMSO has entered into joint ventures with electronic publishers but is preventing the publishers from reproducing acts and statutory instruments in electronic form by demanding royalties at full commercial rates. At the moment statutory material can be reproduced in value-added book form without HMSO's permission and without the payment of any royalty. Mr David Millett, a director of legal publisher Butterworths, said: 'Effectively what they are doing is locking us out of the market.' The publishers have been negotiating with HMSO for more than three years on guidelines for the terms on which HMSO will license crown copyright material. Those negotiations had now broken down, he said. The publishers have written to Mr David Davis, public services minister, but Mr Millet said that if he declined to intervene they would have little alternative but to take legal action. Mr Millett added that the UK was the only country in the western world which still enforced copyright over legislative source materials. All other countries treated such material as being in the public domain. Mr Peter Macdonald of HMSO denied that negotiations had broken down. He said that at the publishers' request HMSO had been working on a group licence rather than individual licences for reproducing crown copyright material. Details of the group licence scheme had now been finalised and would be put to the publishers after an HMSO board meeting on Thursday. He accepted however that HMSO was not prepared to license some materials, such as the Highway Code which HMSO sells itself, having added value to the raw material. He also confirmed HMSO's intention to charge publishers full commercial royalties for reproducing statutory material in electronic form.</p>

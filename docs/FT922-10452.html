			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (18): Strained resources - The Philippines THE Philippines has scarce resources for infrastructure development and these are under strain because of urgent need for rehabilitation of facilities damaged by natural disasters and for installation of new ones to meet the demands of a growing economy. Although foreign assistance continues, the government has found it difficult to raise local counterpart financing. Many planned projects are still to be completed or started. Private investment is being sought through build-operate-transfer schemes in some sectors, notably power generation, but response has been modest. In transport, many projects now receiving priority are those originally planned for 1991. The administration of President Corazon Aquino has not shown the enthusiasm of previous governments for building roads and bridges. However, flyovers sprouting in Metro Manila should improve the movement of goods and people in the metropolis from the middle of 1992. The Philippines, because it is an archipelago of 7,100 islands, requires an extensive ports system. The Philippine Ports Authority is refurbishing the Manila port and eight others. A grains terminal and a bulk cargo terminal are due to be offered to private companies under build-operate-transfer schemes. This will ease congestion plaguing Manila South Harbour, the country's central port for international cargo. In power generation, a World Bank study has forecast that new power plants with a combined capacity of 3,700MW are required before 1999 to meet growing demand, particularly from industry. The state-run National Power Corporation, until recently the sole electricity producer, has been unable to provide adequate supply, resulting in crippling power outages. Last month, more than 1,500 companies in Metro Manila had to suspend operations for 10 days because of power supply shortfalls. Power cuts will contribute to price increases until supply is stabilised. The World Bank estimated that necessary additional capacity will cost Dollars 7.5bn, of which more than 70 per cent will have to be financed from abroad. In communications, the government plans to treble by 2010 the number of telephone lines, now standing at only 1.6 lines per 100 people. The programme is estimated to require investment of some Dollars 8.4bn. Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT), which accounts for 94 per cent of all telephones, has a programme to install 296,400 lines in Metro Manila and 147,960 lines in the provinces. New competitors include Digital Telecommunications, owned 40 per cent by Cable and Wireless, and Philippine Global Communications. However, they are confined mainly to areas not served by PLDT and have to make interconnection arrangements with PLDT for toll calls.</p>

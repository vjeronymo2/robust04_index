			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Services are focused on the family as a whole; service providers work with families as partners in identifying and meeting individual and family needs; family strengths are identified, enhanced, respected, and mobilized to help families solve the problems which compromise their functioning and well-being.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Services promote the healthy development of children and youth, promote permanency for all children, and help prepare youth emancipating from the foster care system for self-sufficiency and independent living.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Services may focus on intervention, protection, treatment, or other services to meet the needs of the family and the best interests of the individual who may be placed in out-of-home care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Services are flexible, coordinated, and accessible to families and individuals, often delivered in the home or the community, and are delivered in a manner that is respectful of and builds on the strengths of community and cultural groups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Services are organized as a continuum, designed to achieve measurable outcomes, and are linked to a wide variety of supports and services outside the child and family services system (e.g., housing, substance abuse treatment, mental health, health, education, and job training, child care, informal support networks) which can be crucial to meeting families' and children's needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Many child and family services are community-based and involve community organizations and residents (including parents) in their design and delivery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Services are intensive enough to meet family needs and keep children safe. The level of intensity and duration of services needed to achieve these goals may vary greatly between preventive (family support) and crisis intervention services (family preservation), based on the changing needs of children and families at various times in their lives. A family or an individual does not need to be in crisis in order to receive services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.

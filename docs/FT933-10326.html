			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Floods turn fury south of St Louis THWARTED by St Louis's 11-mile concrete flood wall, the Mississippi turned on areas south of the city yesterday, Reuter reports from Missouri. Engineers were forced to break a levee to ease the pressure of the river or divert it. The Army Corps of Engineers was keeping a close eye on the town of Prairie du Rocher, Illinois, where a section of a levee was leavened to try to divert floodwaters. Crews on a barge used a crane to scoop gravel off the top of a 400-foot long section of the Fort Chartres levee to offer a path for floodwaters. The hope is that flows over farmland parallel to the Mississippi from levee breaks to the north will either flow back into the river at that spot or at least slow down. St Louis's flood wall, designed to withstand a 52-foot crest, held firm against the Mississippi which crested there on Sunday at 49.4 feet. Thousands of people were still out of their homes in a residential area in south St Louis after a forced evacuation on Monday amid fears of an explosion from leaking propane tanks floating on floodwaters. More than 9,000 residents in a one-mile radius of the 51 tanks have been evacuated since the capsules loosened from their moorings on Friday. But as the water receded, 48 of the tanks resettled into their concrete cradles.</p>

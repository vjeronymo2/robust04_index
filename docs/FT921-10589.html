			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Currency and gold reserves fall Dollars 336m THE UNDERLYING level of Britain's gold and foreign currency reserves fell by Dollars 336m in January, indicating some intervention by the Bank of England to support sterling over the month, Emma Tucker writes. Most City economists expected a Dollars 150m fall. Remaining reserves were a healthy Dollars 44.6bn at the end of the month, compared with Dollars 44.1bn at the end of December. The underlying figure, which is net of borrowings and payments, is a rough indicator of the level of intervention by the Bank in foreign currency markets in supporting the pound. Sterling came under pressure early last month amid fears it would dip below its effective floor in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. The currency's weakness gave rise to speculation that the Bank would have to intervene heavily to support it and that the government would be forced to raise interest rates. The Treasury figures show, however, that Bank intervention was limited even during the tough trading period.</p>

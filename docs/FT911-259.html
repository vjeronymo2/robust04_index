			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Observer: All or nothing How easily great schemes can gang a-gley, especially when they're hatched by the notoriously mother-tongue- bound British. In discussions with the rest of Europe about economic and monetary union, UK officials thought they'd hit on a wonderful idea for inching towards agreement on a European central bank while keeping in British hands a goodly portion of the country's gold and foreign currency reserves. Under existing plans for union the UK's reserves would end up, along with those of the other EC nations, in the coffers of the new central bank instead of being locked away at the Bank of England. Such a state of affairs would enrage Tory right-wingers, and make it harder for the govern- ment to win parliament's backing for even a modest show of UK support for Emu. The officials' wheeze was to agree to the transfer of 'reserves' from Britain to the new bank, but without specifying how much. The plan foundered when the British side realised that the wording would have to be translated into French - which insists on nouns having an indefinite or definite article. Use of the prefix des, meaning 'some', rather than the all-encompassing les, would have immediately given the game away.</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MONUMENT STATUS FOR ENCINO SITE REQUESTED;  </P> <P> 'LOST VILLAGE': A SLOW-GROWTH ACTIVIST'S EFFORTS TO HAVE THE VENTURA BOULEVARD  LOCATION NAMED AN ARCHEOLOGICAL LANDMARK ARE CRITICIZED AS TACTICS TO STALL  DEVELOPMENT.  </P> <P> In the continued hope that an ancient Indian village might thwart construction  of additional modern office buildings on Ventura Boulevard, a slow-growth  activist has applied to the city Cultural Heritage Commission seeking monument  status for a major archeological find uncovered six years ago.  </P> <P> Gerald A. Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino, contends that more of the  "Lost Village of Encino" must lie beneath two nearby redevelopment sites near  the intersection of Ventura and Balboa boulevards. Although the presence of  more remains has yet to be confirmed, Silver has rallied American Indian  leaders and archeologists to his campaign to delay construction until  archeological surveys are conducted.  </P> <P> "I don't know what Mr. Silver's motives are, but even if we suppose his  interest is in stopping another construction project, in this case, I believe  he's correct," Mark Raab, director of the Center for Public Archeology at Cal  State Northridge, said Thursday.  </P> <P> "There's every indication a lot of archeology is in the ground for several  blocks around," Raab continued. "And when construction is proposed in that  area, it really would be a very good idea to do some archeological testing  prior to undertaking any construction."  </P> <P> The Lost Village request is scheduled for review by the Cultural Heritage  Commission next Wednesday. If the commission accepts the nomination, it will  have 60 days to visit the site and recommend to the City Council whether the  Lost Village deserves monument status, said commission spokeswoman Nancy  Fernandez.  </P> <P> The so-called "Lost Village," uncovered in 1984 at a cost of $1.7 million,  included more than 1 million artifacts and the bones of about a dozen Indians  found beneath a construction site on the southeast corner of the intersection.  Experts such as Raab and archeologist Nancy Whitney-Desautels of Huntington  Beach, who excavated the site, believe it to be the remains of a large Indian  village described in the journals of Spanish explorers who arrived in the San  Fernando Valley in 1769. It was dubbed the Lost Village because modern  archeologists searched for its remains for years without success.  </P> <P> "An archeological site of that kind is probably found once a generation," Raab  said.  </P> <P> At least two other archeological sites in the city have been designated as  historic-cultural monuments, said Fernandez, one in the Ferndale section of  Griffith Park and another in Marina del Rey. The "monument" designation, which  can apply to an area as well as a building, would enable the Cultural Heritage  Commission to screen requests for building permits.  </P> <P> On another front of the Lost Village battle, Silver and supporters are  scheduled to testify Tuesday before the city's Building and Safety Commission.  There, they will argue that archeological surveys be required before  construction is permitted on the north side of Ventura Boulevard, across the  street from the Lost Village dig, on which an office building has since been  erected.  </P> <P> Silver's group is appealing findings by the Building and Safety Department that  neither of two office buildings proposed between Balboa Boulevard and La Maida  Street need environmental impact reports or preliminary archeological surveys.  </P> <P> A proposed 48,000-square-foot office building off La Maida Street will be  addressed Tuesday. A hearing on the second project has yet to be scheduled.  </P> <P> One of the developers affected by Silver's efforts, Gardena-based builder Jerry  Katell, on Thursday called Silver's application to the Cultural Heritage  Commission "just another ploy to stop any development projects that he can."  </P> <P> But Katell, who is planning a three-story, 140,000-square-foot office building  off Balboa Boulevard, said he has decided to hire archeologists on his own to  conduct a preliminary archeological review, largely to prevent construction  delays later.  </P> <P> "We've already dug a number of exploratory holes on the property and found  nothing," Katell said. "So we don't expect to find anything, and this would  sort of settle it forever."  </P></p>

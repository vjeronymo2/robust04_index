			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: ATLANTA FIRM ACQUIRES PRACTICAL PERIPHERALS  </P> <P> Practical Peripherals of Westlake Village was acquired by Hayes Microcomputer  Products of Atlanta for an undisclosed amount. Both companies produce modems,  which are used in transmitting computer data.  </P> <P> As a result of the acquisition, the companies settled a lawsuit in which Hayes  had claimed that Practical infringed on a Hayes modem patent. Practical had  asserted that the patent was invalid.  </P> <P> Michael Seedman, Practical's chief executive, predicted that Practical's sales  for the year that will end Aug. 31 would be $20 million. Hayes would not  disclose the Georgia company's sales. Practical's management will remain  intact, said Seedman and Hayes President Dennis C. Hayes.  </P></p>

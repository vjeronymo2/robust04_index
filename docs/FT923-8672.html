			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Flying with Ashdown to stronghold of Bosnia's Serbs: Laura Silber dons her flak jacket for a helicopter journey in the wake of the British politician BOSNIAN Serb soldiers flying in a helicopter from Belgrade to their stronghold of Pale, east of the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, yesterday faced the choice of transporting supplies of blood plasma, or a party of journalists. Influenced, perhaps by the need to improve their image, they chose the latter. We took off in a Russian military helicopter from Belgrade's military heliport in the wake of another helicopter carrying Mr Paddy Ashdown, the leader of Britain's Liberal Democrats, who is visiting Bosnia this week to inspect the Serb-controlled detention centres in northern Bosnia. Mr Ashdown, who last week criticised the British government's slow response to the crisis in the former Yugoslav republic, was invited by Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, to visit any detention camps. There were 13 journalists in my helicopter - the overspill from Mr Ashdown's aircraft - and a three-man crew. The pilots were obviously professionals trained in the Yugoslav federal army. They said that they were from Serbia. After flying for some time, we stopped to refuel somewhere in a mountain clearing in south-western Serbia. There was an efficient ground crew operating from a huge cement camouflaged bunker. Our route was to take us over Serbia and up to Pale, Mr Karadzic's stronghold, 10km east of the republic's capital of Sarajevo. We climbed into the helicopter and were told to put on flak jackets just in case. There has been heavy fighting in eastern Bosnia between Serbs and Moslems and there are still pockets of Moslem resistance, particularly the town of Gorazde. Gorazde, a Moslem town, has in fact been besieged by Serb irregulars for the past three months. UN-backed aid convoys have already failed to get through to relieve the city and deliver badly needed medicine and food supplies. We nearly brushed tops of trees and appeared to graze against the side of the mountain. The pilot swooped above electric wire cables and immediately descended. We crossed the river Drina, which marks the frontier between Serbia and Bosnia, the helicopter hugging the field, bringing damaged and bombed-out houses into view. When we arrived at Pale, Mr Karadzic told me: 'We are ready to show the whole world that we have nothing to hide in the camps.' He said that yesterday morning near Dobrinja, a suburb of Sarajevo which has been bombarded and besieged by Serb irregulars for the past five months, he had freed 10 Moslem prisoners. He said that nine had been sick, and one had promised not to fight against Serbia again. Today our journey to the camps with Mr Ashdown continues - at first by helicopter to Bjelina, in the north-east of Bosnia, and then by road west to Banja Luka, a Serb stronghold in northern Bosnia. Earlier, Mr Ashdown had talks in a Belgrade hotel with Mr Dobrica Cosic, the president of the so-called Yugoslav Federation, PA reports. Mr Ashdown said he told Mr Cosic the International Committee of the Red Cross could not run detention camps but having permanent ICRC monitors there would be useful. The Liberal Democrat leader is due to return to London on Wednesday.</p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FICTION IN BRIEF: COUNT D'ORGEL'S BALL BY RAYMOND RADIGUET TRANSLATED BY  ANNAPAOLA CANCOGNI (ERIDANOS PRESS: $20; 174 PP.)  </P> <P> Raymond Radiguet produced two novels and a collection of poems before his death  in 1923 at the age of 20, having already established acquaintance with some of  the leading artists working in Paris at the time. He writes with the arrogance  of a young man who knows himself to be extraordinary, a stance that would be  repellent if the result were not so absolutely exquisite. He flippantly titled  his collection of verse "Devoirs de vacances" -- freely translated, "What I Did  on My Summer Vacation." His first novel, "The Devil in the Flesh," describes an  affair between a young man and an older woman whose husband has gone to war.  </P> <P> His second novel appears here in a new translation that captures the deceptive  simplicity of Radiguet's style. "Count d'Orgel's Ball" sets up a love triangle  in the rarefied atmosphere of post-World War I French high society. A young  man, Francois de Seryeuse, becomes attracted to Mahaut, the beautiful Creole  wife of the Count d'Orgel. She flirts with him and allows herself to become  entangled. The intrigue is carried on over teas, at the theater, in drawing  rooms. Radiguet spins the erotic tension of the affair out to an extraordinary  degree, never letting it break or subside.  </P> <P> Radiguet's interest is in the minute schemings and deceptions one practices in  the pursuit of a forbidden lover. "The unconscious ploys of a pure soul are  often stranger than vice's wiles," Radiguet writes at the beginning of his  story. Francois' innocence makes him all the more dangerous: "Aware of having  shown himself unworthy of Mahaut, he did his best to appear all the more  amiable. No strategy would have advanced him quite as much." The twists and  turns of plot come as Francois, Mahaut and her husband deny, then realize, then  suppress again what they know to be happening.  </P> <P> It is an absolutely innocent story in the sense that the affair is never  consummated. Although it lacks the cold-blooded calculation of "Les Liaisons  Dangereuses," the tale yet contains a distinct undercurrent of decadence that  comes from the willing self-deception and manipulation in all three characters.  All the participants can persuade themselves of the innocence of their actions.  </P> <P> The book includes a foreword by Jean Cocteau (with whom Radiguet had, in the  words of the book jacket, "a rather turbulent relationship") and a Radiguet  short story published here for the first time. The author apparently hated the  story, but Cocteau gave permission for it to be published, explaining: "Maybe  the detestable mannerism of these lines will give greater relief to the purity  of the 'Count d'Orgel's Ball.' " It certainly does that.  </P></p>

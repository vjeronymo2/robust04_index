			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Books: How we lost the peace - Zara Steiner discusses why Chamberlain was wrong CHAMBERLAIN AND APPEASEMENT: BRITISH POLICY AND THE COMING OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR by RAC Parker Macmillans Pounds 35, 388 pages THIS VIGOROUS and vividly written attack on Neville Chamberlain's appeasement policies by an Oxford don is sure to set the cat among the pigeons. Ignoring the historical battleground littered with so many corpses, RAC Parker goes back to the manuscript sources to raise and answer fundamental questions. Against the currently benign interpretations of appeasement, Parker argues that other choices could have been made that might have deterred or stopped Hitler before war broke out. From the opening chapter, with its entertaining and shrewd pen portrait of Chamberlain to the telling indictment of his post-Munich policies, this book centres on a figure who by virtue of ability, hard work and determination must be seen as one of the strongest prime ministers in our century. Chamberlain's self-confidence, like his prestige, was of Thatcher-like proportions. His cabinet colleagues waited on his judgments. 'When I am silent,' he reported, 'everyone else is also.' Thanks to over 1,200 weekly letters to his two sisters, Parker is able to round out an assessment of Chamberlains's motives and actions based on a wide reading in the official records and private papers of the period. Chamberlains's motives were of the highest. He passionately hoped to avoid war and the policies he advocated were dedicated to this end. He thought Hitler could be persuaded by finding solutions to his grievances to limit his aims, renounce aggression and abandon German rearmament. Chamberlain was convinced that Hitler, or at least the German people, would see that Britain and Germany could co-exist peacefully as prosperous and great nations. Appeasement was not a policy of 'peace at any price'. Whatever his faith in concession and conciliation, Chamberlain did not skimp on the measures thought necessary for the defence of Britain. Nor was he willing to yield to Hitler a position in Europe that would threaten British independence or security. Parker accepts that appeasement was a perfectly rational and reasonable policy that until Godesberg commanded general support. His real indictment of the prime minister begins with Munich when he insists Chamberlain became the victim of his own self-confidence and obstinacy. In the months that followed, the prime minister remained convinced that his policies were actually succeeding. Persuasion continued to have priority over coercion despite mounting pressure for an anti-Hitler coalition. The prime minister remained cool towards the idea of a close Anglo-French alliance in 1938. He opposed and then delayed negotiations with the Soviet Union which he regarded as unnecessary and dangerous. He would not consider restructurings of the cabinet that would have signalled the government's determination to stand up to Hitler. In the summer of 1939, he resorted to private and unofficial channels to keep open possibilities for peace which he knew ran against the popular current. Parker does not ignore the pre-Chamberlainite roots of appeasement. The treatment of such complex questions as reparations and disarmament is concise and to the point. The diplomatic crises of the early 1930s are analysed in sufficient depth to make intelligible the claim that appeasement was a sensible, moral and even courageous policy. Nor are the many constraints within which Chamberlain and his ministers had to operate left unexplored. Parker is particularly good on the financial and industrial background to re-armament and gives full weight to the political calculations that were such an important factor in the prime minister's pursuit of peace. But he sharply contests the revisionist view that foreign policy was determined by a realistic assessment of economic and military weakness and by public opinion. It was foreign policy that dictated the scale of rearmament and not the other way round. If Chamberlain had so wished, moreover, he could have rallied opinion behind and anti-German front in 1938. He chose not to do so. The option he preferred and privately pursued lost all official and popular backing during 1939. Again against prevailing historical winds, Parker argues that there was an acceptable alternative to appeasement. Chamberlain might have gone for armaments and allies, 'the language of the mailed fist'. There existed in 1938-39 a divided but far from negligible opposition to his policies. Chamberlain took that opposition seriously enough to keep both Eden and Churchill out of the cabinet. The latter was not easily ignored. He was already a massive public figure identified with opposition to Hitler and the advocacy of the 'grand alliance.' Chamberlain could not take him into the cabinet if there was to be any hope of reviving the 'Munich spirit'. As it was. after March 1939 even this powerful prime minister had to adopt publicly at least much of the opposition's programme. It was too little and too late. Chamberlain's view of Hitler and expectations of the German people's resistance to war was fatally flawed. His policies, and Parker provides abundant evidence, were wildly over-ambitious and ultimately disastrous. He never had the influence over Hitler he claimed. It was well beyond Britain's capacity, in my view, to establish an acceptable balance of power in Europe by itself. I am more sceptical than Parker that given Hitler's goals and pathologies, any alternative to war was possible. Even had Stalin been convinced to join the Anglo-French pact, would this have done more than postponed a European war that Hitler's policies made inevitable? This is not to argue that Chamberlain's policies were right but to suggest that no other course of action could have prevented the catastrophe. You will want to read this book. It is intelligently provocative. Parker writes with clarity, concision, and conviction. The scholarly apparatus is impressive without being overwhelming. It forces one to look again at Neville Chamberlains's premiership and to reconsider the real issues involved in the ongoing debate about appeasement, a controversy that has neither lost its historical importance nor its contemporary relevance.</p>

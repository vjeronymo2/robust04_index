			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POST OFFICES TO GET TELLER MACHINES  </P> <P> The Postal Service, which ended half a century of banking in 1966, will soon  begin providing automated teller machines in post office lobbies.  </P> <P> Assistant Postmaster General Gordon C. Morison will explain the plan to a  convention of community bankers this weekend, postal officials said.  </P> <P> The program has been tested in Seattle since November, 1988.  </P> <P> The plan calls for local banks across the country to locate the cash-dispensing  machines in post office lobbies. Banks will be selected by competitive bidding  for the right to place their machines, officials said.  </P> <P> About 6 million people visit postal lobbies daily and the presence of banking  machines there should provide a one-stop location to do business, postal  officials anticipate.  </P> <P> However, they declined to speculate on the income that the program would  generate for the Postal Service, saying it will take time for people to get  used to having the banking machines available at post offices.  </P></p>

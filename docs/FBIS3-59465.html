			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jan Sopoci: "The Phenomenon of Meciar and </F> Slovakia"]    [Text] I have no idea how historians will evaluate our  first post-November years and the first year of the independent  Slovak Republic with the passage of time, but I am convinced  that in doing so they will have to devote most of their time and  attention to explaining the place and role of Vladimir Meciar in  the political and the other life of posttotalitarian Slovak  society. It is already clear today that this most prominent  political personality of the first years of post-November  Slovakia has influenced the developmental direction of our  country at least until the end of the millennium in a decisive  manner, irrespective of the future fate of V. Meciar, as well as  the Slovak Republic.    In contrast to ourselves, who are Meciar's contemporaries,  the historians of future decades will have an easier task  because they will already have the results of his political  activities to benefit (or to the detriment of) Slovakia and its  inhabitants before them, and, moreover, in contrast to  ourselves, they will be able to approach the evaluation of V.  Meciar's activities more objectively and with less partiality  than is the case today. That is because we, the contemporaries  of Meciar, can be divided either into his unreserved friends,  allies, or followers or into crystal-clear opponents or even  enemies. The fact that today it is difficult to find people in  Slovakia who take a different, say, neutral, position with  respect to this politician, is symptomatic. The "Meciar  phenomenon" has brought about a situation in which a  (diminishing) part of the population feels that he is the  personification of everything that is good, positive, whereas  the other portion of the population, on the contrary, tends to  view him as the personification of everything evil, negative,  which is a phenomenon that can be connected with the personality  of the politician.    Foreign political scientists and publicists virtually  consider V. Meciar to be one of the charismatic, authoritarian  politicians who have emerged in the postcommunist countries of  Europe during the first years following the demise of the  totalitarian regimes and who will, after a time, be replaced by  a different type of politician (in the event these countries  undergo democratic development), representing other methods of  engaging in politics and governing in the country. The necessity  for the departure of such politicians from the political life is  justified on the basis of their inability to secure political  stability, democracy, and economic prosperity in the countries  that they govern, or rather that they previously governed.  However, foreign political scientists point out that such  politicians are generally not willing to recognize their  failures and depart on their own on that basis, which generally  still further complicates the situation in their countries and  which, as shown by the Georgian experiences, for example, can  even lead to a catastrophe.    I hope that Slovakia is not threatened with such a  development, but the fact that many foreign observers already  categorize Slovakia among the internally unstabilized East  European countries with hard-to-predict developments is an  alarming fact. At the same time, however, it is also the logical  culmination of our development thus far, mostly of the fact that  Slovakia has hitherto not proven able to come to terms with the  consequences of its previous "historical traumatizations,"  irrespective of whether these included the Magyarization,  Czechoslovakism, populism, or Stalinist socialism. Even for that  reason we must deal with the "Meciar phenomenon" today.</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Newspaper rescue in jeopardy The rescue of the New York Post could be in jeopardy in the wake of a legal victory by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against a company controlled by Mr Steve Hoffenberg, the newspaper's prospective buyer, Alan Friedman reports. Towers Financial, Mr Hoffenberg's debt collection and factoring business, has consented to the SEC's demand for control over the company. It has also consented to the appointment of a trustee and to limits on expenditures as requested in a lawsuit by the SEC. The SEC alleged that Mr Hoffenberg's company had fraudulently sold Dollars 215m (Pounds 151.4m) of notes and overstated its assets by more than double. Towers Financial was described by the SEC as insolvent. The newspaper takeover may be jeopardised because the SEC consent agreement limits the funds that Mr Hoffenberg may spend.</p>

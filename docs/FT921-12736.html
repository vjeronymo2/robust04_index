			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Struggle against ignorance and a lack of interest - Promoting non-academic studies WHAT is an NVQ? Or a BTEC? Most people in Britain have not the faintest idea. Such ignorance sums up the country's training weakness, which Mr John Major made a robust attempt to combat yesterday. Asked recently by Gallup pollsters: 'Have you heard of national vocational qualifications?' 61 per cent replied 'no'. Of those, more than half said: 'No, and I'm not interested.' Among semi-skilled and unskilled workers - those for whom vocational qualifications are primarily designed - the proportion saying 'no' rose to three quarters, with 50 per cent of the unskilled uninterested. True, almost half of those questioned believed that better training would improve their performance at work - a marked improvement on previous surveys. Marrying belief to remedy, though, has defied British policymakers for a generation. Measured by initiatives, the government scores highly. In 1986 it established the National Council for Vocational Qualifications (NCVQ) to streamline the plethora of existing qualifications and to accredit NVQs (as they were named) for all levels of the workforce. The council expects to complete the task by next year, working closely with the three main providers of vocational courses, the Business and Technician Education Council, City and Guilds and the Royal Society of Arts. Last May came the government's white paper on education and training, presaging most of the items announced by Mr Major yesterday. In particular, it heralded 'general national vocational qualifications'  - intended as full-time, vocationally oriented alternatives to A-levels to be taken in schools and colleges - and 'advanced' diplomas  - to be awarded to those with three A-levels or the vocational equivalent and intended to constitute the minimum higher-education entry standard. According to Mr Major, vocational qualifications deserve parity of esteem with their GCSE and A-level counterparts - and, once they have gained it, will generate a training revolution in Britain. His optimism is shared by Sir Bryan Nicholson, chairman of the Post Office, who also chairs the council. Sir Bryan wants to see 1m people with NVQs by 1995 (a tenfold increase on the present level), and boasts that by the end of this year the council will have the framework in place. 'Thereafter, it will be a sweeping-up exercise and painting the Forth Bridge,' he says. The 1m target is ambitious. It cannot be achieved solely through training young people, under government-funded schemes such as Youth Training, but will rely on schools and training in the workplace. Only a handful of schools has been persuaded to offer NVQs, and only a small cadre of companies accounts for most of today's 100,000 people with NVQs. Boots the Chemist, Safeway, Rover Group, B&amp;Q and WH Smith are prominent among them. Boots is one of the most enthusiastic, after extensive piloting. Boardroom scepticism remains widespread, however. One personnel director of a large group declared himself not particularly concerned to promote NVQs because he saw them as akin to other government-led initiatives - destined to die when the next bright idea was launched. He also thought a Labour government might abolish them - which Labour has always denied. Other companies are wary. Asda, one of the largest food retailers in the UK, is reviewing its participation in the scheme and may abandon it in favour of an internal accreditation system, blaming the cost and inflexibility. NVQs also have a long march ahead if they are to 'academic' courses. The council's emphasis on testing competence in the workplace, rather than setting examinations to be assessed externally, has limitations. The Business and Technician Education Council (BTEC) first diploma in business and finance, which claims parity of esteem with GCSE, comprises such competence tests as these: file 20 consecutive documents correctly; retrieve 20 items from a filing system correctly; correctly answer 10 incoming and outgoing telephone calls; take three oral messages accurately - hardly a highway to university. According to Mr Sig Prais, of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, much recent reform is 'purely cosmetic'. He says: 'We are still a long way from the Continental idea of skill training - which involves taking an examination course at college, externally assessed, combined with practical experience at work.' The council's mission is 'to provide the world's most effective national framework of vocational qualifications'. A more modest goal of adapting to British conditions the best on offer in Germany, France and the Netherlands might be more appropriate.</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISS MANNERS: A STORY -- YOU SUPPLY THE MORAL  </P> <P> Seldom does retribution for a violation of etiquette come so swiftly. Miss  Manners cannot resist telling you a story with a severe moral (although she  will try to resist telling it gleefully):  </P> <P> An old-fashioned lady was giving one of her old-fashioned dinner parties.  </P> <P> Being of the old school, she had assembled her guest list not only for  conversational compatibility, but so that the table would be surrounded by  neatly alternating ladies and gentlemen. But on the day of the dinner, one of  the guests called to say that she couldn't make it, but would stop in afterward  for coffee.  </P> <P> Not able to make it? As the hostess well knew, the only excuse for canceling  out of a dinner party is sudden death. Lingering death won't do.  </P> <P> This guest didn't sound dead at all. Her health was confirmed by the cheerful  tone in which she explained that she had been invited to a fancy dinner given  by someone quite important, and that she believed it would be useful to her  career to go. She added that the gentleman with whom she lived -- and who had  been invited -- would keep the original engagement, as he was not included in  the later invitation.  </P> <P> Now the hostess was so old-fashioned that she had no trouble whatsoever with  unmarried couples living together -- she believed that this aspect of their  life was none of her business. But to have someone frankly confess canceling a  dinner date because a more advantageous opportunity arose shocked her into near  immobility.  </P> <P> She was strict enough, however, not to consider social catastrophe to be an  excuse for letting down her guests. They could have survived without a full  table, but this lady, the sort of perfectionist who measured the distance  between place settings when setting the table, believed it her duty to fill in  all the blanks.  </P> <P> "Extra lady, extra lady," she thought desperately. "Whom do I know well enough  to ask such a favor?" (She knew, of course, that while it is a compliment to a  guest to issue an invitation at the proper time, it is an intimate favor to ask  someone to come at the last minute. Proper reciprocation is not only a  subsequent invitation, made far in advance, but the silent acknowledgement that  the hostess must make every effort to be available for last-minute duty at that  person's parties.) And then she thought of someone perfect -- someone who would  not only even out the dinner table but grace it with beauty and wit.  </P> <P> Indeed, that is what happened. And the party was a success. Even the gentleman  who had been left behind, while his lady had moved up to something grander,  seemed to be enjoying himself.  </P> <P> In fact, he especially seemed to be enjoying himself. When the lady with whom  he lived showed up as promised, for coffee -- prompting her hostess to believe  that her coffee must be better than the other host's, for surely the social  honor system could not have been a factor -- she found him sitting on a  drawing-room sofa, next to the replacement guest.  </P> <P> They were merely sipping coffee, chatting quietly and looking at each other, as  proper guests do after a proper meal. The old-fashioned hostess thought their  behavior impeccable.  </P> <P> But the latecomer didn't. She took one look at them and understood immediately  what had happened. As a desperate last-minute move to salvage her private life,  she attempted to insert herself into the non-existent space between them.  </P> <P> But it was too late. The gentleman escorted the latecomer home, and the other  lady thanked her hostess, who pressed her hand warmly in a silent gesture of  return thanks for saving the evening.  </P> <P> Miss Manners is happy to report that some time after the dinner party, the  gentleman and the so-called extra lady were married. This is a true story, and  she invites her readers to supply the moral.  </P></p>

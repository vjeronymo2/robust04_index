			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 12 May (MENA) -- Interior Minister Hasan  al-Alfi has declared that within the next 48 hours details of  security officials' efforts to apprehend a large group of  terrorists, numbering more than 20, will be announced. He said  that these terrorists are the accomplices of terrorist Tal'at  Yasin Hammam, leader of the Islamic Group's military wing who  was killed in the Kubri al-Qubbah this month.    In press statements today, the interior minister said that  the announcement was to have been made a few days ago but was  postponed following the discovery of new angles and important  information that led to the arrest of more members of this group.    He stressed that there is full cooperation between Egypt and  other countries through bilateral agreements, especially with  countries where the phenomenon of violence and terrorism has  appeared.    Addressing reports in some opposition papers about the  lawyer  who died after being arrested, the interior minister said the  matter is being investigated by the prosecution office and legal  measures are being taken. He added: We will announce the truth  to everybody and nothing will be covered up.    In reply to a question on whether the Interior Ministry will  set up an inquiry committee to investigate the incident, the  interior minister said: We are investigating every issue that  is being raised concerning the Interior Ministry. He noted that  the police are always at the service of the citizens.</p>

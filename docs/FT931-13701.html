			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: UK to help deported Palestinians BRITAIN is ready to make RAF helicopters available to airlift some of the Palestinians deported from Israel if a further humanitarian visit by the Red Cross is agreed. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, told MPs last night that if the security of the operation could be guaranteed, the UK would provide helicopters based in Cyprus to airlift out of the area between Israel and southern Lebanon some medical cases and the nine Palestinians whom the Israeli government admits were deported by mistake. Mr Hurd emphasised the diplomatic pressure Britain was putting on Israel to comply with relevant UN directives.</p>

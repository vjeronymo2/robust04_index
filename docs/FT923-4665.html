			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / International Company News: Krupp Stahl plunges into the red DEPRESSED steel prices and rising pay costs pushed Krupp Stahl into a DM32m (Dollars 22.8m) pre-tax loss in the first six months of this year, after a DM44m profit last time. There were no significant signs of improvement in leading steel markets, and the full year's results would depend on further cost reductions and price developments, the company said yesterday. Efforts so far to reduce costs, including cutting 1,500 jobs, had no effect. Total pay costs rose DM40m, pushed up by a 6.4 per cent wage settlement earlier this year and influenced by acquisitions which brought 1,000 new workers on to the payroll. Current indications on the price front are not encouraging. The company said increases noted at the start of the year had not been maintained. Although the core steel division's order intake was 14 per cent higher than in the first half of 1991 in volume terms, the value was unchanged. A 7.5 per cent order increase in other sectors was due entirely to acquisitions. Group sales, affected by falling product prices and reductions in output caused by plant modernisation, fell DM190m to DM3.76bn. Krupp, which is integrating the steel operations of the recently acquired Hoesch group, is counting on economies of scale to improve results in future years. For the present, the group is suffering together with the rest of German industry from the effects of recession abroad and fading demand at home. Market conditions worsened further last month, according to figures from the federal statistics office. August raw steel output in western Germany fell 3.7 per cent compared with the same month in 1991. In the eight months to the end of August, production was down 1.3 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lu Yu-shan (4151 6276 2619): "An Increase of 130,000 </F> Personnel in Public Security Organs, Procuratorial Organs, and  Courts--CPC Is Getting Tough Mostly for Stability]    [Text] Judging from what Chinese officials have recently  done abroad and at home, people have the feeling that the higher  echelons of the Chinese leadership are adopting a policy of  tightening up, and the get-tough mentality has raised its head  once again.    Although every event has its own specific backdrop and the  causes for it cannot be lumped together, just as an insider  said: Apart from their specific backdrops, these tightening-up  phenomena are inseparable from the macroclimate of China's  current political environment. Historical experiences have  proven that tightening up of the overall climate is enough to  make things that could have been handled in a relaxed manner  rigid. How the higher echelons of the CPC leadership judge  changes in the situation is an important factor in whether the  macroclimate is tightened up or relaxed.    So, what made the higher echelons of the CPC leadership  think  that the recent situation was worsening and regard it as  necessary to tighten up? According to the insider's analysis, a  single factor was not enough to worry the higher echelons of the  CPC leadership. What made them nervous was the multiplying of  factors they deemed anything but reassuring and the simultaneous  existence or worsening of those factors. It is revealed that  the factors include the following:  <H5>  Intellectuals' Free Discussion Becomes a Focus of Attention </H5>   1. The political factor:    --Deng Xiaoping's health is a cause for the concern of all  sides in society.    --The fifth anniversary of the 4 June incident is  approaching. People attach special attention to every  "five-year" or "10-year" date. It is learned that in February  this year, a number of persons regarded as sensitive gathered in  an open place near the Beijing Nationality Hotel, chatting about  recent developments and current affairs. The authorities became  nervous because they regarded the meeting, which was originally  an idle-talk gathering, as being the same in nature as the  "Beijing Hotel conference" in which the intellectuals rose in  revolt in 1989. Moreover, word circulated from the authorities'  inner circles that the information they had gathered revealed  that some people were planning "some action" during the fifth  anniversary of the 4 June incident. This made them feel more  disturbed.    --As Deng Xiaoping's health is declining, all forces are  racing against time to consolidate themselves. Therefore, they  all need "stability" both internationally and domestically and  thus agree to tighten up.    2. The economic factor.    3. The social factor:    --What most worries the CPC is that the workers' and  peasants' sentiments are unsecured. There are indications that  some workers' movements have been integrated with the  intellectuals. Last year the government discovered for the  first time that when studying the reasons for the failure of the  pro-democracy movement of 1989, some people concluded that it  "failed to integrate with the workers and peasants." This year,  this momentum has become increasingly clear and underground  trade unions have become more and more active, thus making the  authorities become more nervous.    --The public security situation and corruption have  drastically deteriorated, becoming a hidden crisis for social  unrest. The most cohesive and appealing call during the  pro-democracy movement of 1989 was to "struggle against  corruption." Recently, the higher echelons of the CPC  leadership have been studying four or five corruption cases of  cadres at the vice-ministerial level, one of which involved a  vice minister of power industry. When announcing such cases,  the CPC confined itself just to the case of Li Xiaoshi, vice  minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, and  kept the others secret.    The Chinese authorities have set up an "Anticorruption  Bureau" under the procuratorate with additional manpower and  necessary facilities to replace the former "Economic Supervision  Department." Nevertheless, in the last six months, the higher  echelons of the CPC leadership unexpectedly discovered that the  procuratorates and the courts also "competed with each other for  business." The procuratorates held up and reached conclusions  on 40 percent of the cases which ought to be handled by the  courts, because they could proportionately retain "case-handling  fees" by so doing and the litigants had to pay "business-trip  allowances." In this way, the impartiality of the law is bound  to be reduced significantly and popular discontent can be found  almost everywhere.    --Social unrest generated by a fall in the standard of  living  is a time bomb which the CPC carefully guards against.    An Additional 130,000 Personnel Are Employed To Carry  Out the "Severe Crackdown" Drive    The insider stated that the abovementioned factors played a  certain role in the efforts of the CPC to tighten up recently.  Political and economic factors are, more often than not, a  latent crisis, while social factors are an "igniter." This  being the case, the CPC will not make any concessions on  political and human rights issues. Otherwise, domestic and  overseas forces will form a united front against it. It has to  adopt a "severe crackdown" stand on the public security issue.  (Of the serious cases which constituted 25 percent of the  national total in the first quarter of this year, quite a lot  were cases "cracked" by the authorities so as to reduce others  to submission.) If no "severe crackdown" is carried out, there  will be instability in the grass-roots units. On the issue of  integration of the workers movement and the pro-democracy  movement, tremendous forces should be employed against it even  more. Otherwise, the ruling foundations will be shaken.    Therefore, in February this year, the higher echelons of the  CPC leadership dispatched personnel to conduct a social  investigation to discover the possibility and degree of "popular  disorder." Later, they conducted similar investigations on a  greater scale in March in northeast China, northwest China,  Hunan and Hubei, and Shanghai, with a view to conducting such  activities in selected localities with different setups. The  investigation results showed: "Destabilizing factors are  numerous."    Then they urgently worked on countermeasures. At the meeting  of the Political Bureau in early March, they unanimously agreed  "to try every possible means to keep the situation stable and  under control." Things that could have been handled in a  relaxed manner should now be handled carefully and tight  restrictions should be imposed if necessary. The higher  echelons of the CPC leadership have thus decided to provide an  additional 130,000 personnel to local public security organs,  procuratorial organs, and courts so as to strengthen their work.  (When launching the "severe crackdown" drive in 1984, the  public security organs, procuratorial organs, and courts  received a boost of 200,000 personnel. The current one is the  second-largest one-time boost in personnel ever seen.) Zhu  Rongji ordered the allocation of 500 million yuan as a relief  fund for "those in exceptionally great difficulties." On 5  April (the commemoration day for the Tiananmen incident), Jiang  Zemin called together military leaders in Beijing and urged them  to make preparations to avoid popular disorder. He said:  "Public security organs, procuratorial organs, and courts have  coordinated their activities."</p>

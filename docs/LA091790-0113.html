			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTER WOULD NOT RULE OUT DEATH PENALTY  </P> <P> Supreme Court nominee David Souter said today he would not rule out the death  penalty as a violation of the constitutional ban on "cruel and unusual  punishment."  </P> <P> "I think that would be an insupportable constitutional conclusion," Souter told  the Senate Judiciary Committee.  </P> <P> "That is an opinion I could not join."  </P> <P> If confirmed, Souter's view would be in line with the current majority of the  high court. His response underscored his reputation as a law-and-order judge.  </P> <P> Souter, in his third day of testimony, today explained his approach to a range  of criminal law cases, including one in which he supported police use of  sobriety checkpoints.  </P> <P> During his tenure on the New Hampshire Supreme Court, it ruled against the  checkpoints as violating people's rights. But Souter alone dissented.  </P> <P> In his testimony today, Souter said the checkpoints differed from other  searches because driving a car is "a highly dangerous and regulated activity."  He said if the checkpoints were properly conducted, police were correct in  using them to try to prevent tragedy.  </P> <P> The use of police sobriety checks was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier  this year.  </P></p>

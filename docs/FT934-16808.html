			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Philippines poised to accept N-plant deal THE PHILIPPINE government is moving towards accepting an offer for an out-of-court settlement from Westinghouse Electric of the US to end a protracted legal battle involving the construction of a 620MW nuclear power plant. President Fidel Ramos yesterday said he had approved 'in principle' a review committee's recommendation to accept Westinghouse's offer worth Dollars 49.5m (Pounds 32m) to settle the conflict. The committee, set up to review the government's options in connection with the case, is headed by Mr Delfin Lazaro, the energy secretary. The Philippines had sued Westinghouse, along with its subcontractor Burns and Roe Associates, in a US court for allegedly bribing the late Mr Ferdinand Marcos, then Philippine president, and an associate in order to win the power plant contract. Last May a New Jersey court cleared the two US companies of the Philippine government's charge. However, the Philippines kept its option for an appeal. Mr Ramos, after the May verdict, had also ruled against operating the facility as a nuclear plant, ordering instead its conversion to enable it to be fired by conventional fuel. The settlement offer involves the supply by Westinghouse of two turbine generators, which can be fired by oil or gas. The first is due by the end of this year and the other in February, and both should be in operation by May. Mr Ramos said in a press briefing yesterday it was still necessary to inform the two chambers of Congress about the compromise package. While Mr Ramos said informing Congress was only a formality, some members of the House of Representatives and the Senate said they would in fact vet the agreement. Some congressmen were yesterday already criticising the deal, noting that the Philippines was 'at the losing end'. Before the trial on the case early this year, Westinghouse had offered a compromise worth some Dollars 75m, but the Manila government rejected it. After the May verdict, Westinghouse offered originally one turbine worth Dollars 25m to avert a Philippine appeal. Mr Lazaro, who had led the talks with Westinghouse, described the settlement as 'the best we can get at this time'. He said further litigation could prove costly without any guarantee of winning. The settlement does not cover loans acquired by the Philippines for the nuclear plant construction. Some Dollars 1.1bn of such obligations remain payable to a consortium of financing institutions led by the US Export-Import Bank.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Yuill conviction quashed in Australia Mr Brian Yuill, the former managing director of Spedley Securities, one of the high-flying Australian investment banks of the 1980s, has had a conviction for misusing company money quashed in the appeal courts, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. He had previously been sentenced to eight years in prison, after a jury found him guilty of seven offences under the state's companies code. The New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeals yesterday ordered a retrial based on a possible misdirection by Judge Shadbolt, who heard the previous trial. The judge had made comments on the cost of such trials, and told the jury that if a unanimous verdict was not reached another trial would have to be held. Mr Yuill, who had pleaded not guilty to all charges on which he was found guilty, still faces some additional charges relating to interest-free loans from another company which he controlled. These will be heard in August. No date has been fixed for the retrial on the first matters.</p>

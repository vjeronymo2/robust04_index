			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Leading Article: A system on trial ONE CLEAR lesson has so far emerged from the contagion of corruption currently being exposed in Italy: the disease in the country's body politic runs so deep that none of the physicians in attendance can offer a satisfactory course of treatment, let alone a viable cure. Not the magistracy, which has been busily accusing and incarcerating politicians, officials and businessmen in recent weeks. Not the parliament, more and more of whose members are being caught in the net. And certainly not the government of Mr Giuliano Amato, which last Friday proposed a 'political solution' to the crisis, only to be accused all round of seeking to protect the guilty from justice. The affair has brought the Italian ruling class into disrepute, the government to the brink of collapse, and the country's public works to a virtual standstill. But it would be hard to pretend that anything resembling justice is yet being done. Many of the accused are being held in jail without charge, and the allegations against them are being treated as a presumption of guilt. Moreover, there is no chance of any of them being brought speedily to trial. Italy's judicial system is notoriously slow and inefficient: cases regularly take six to 10 years to grind through the courts. Endless litigation will scarcely hasten the reform and strengthening of Italian politics and society: instead there is a danger that the country's political establishment will be decapitated and its institutions paralysed at a time of maximum public ferment. In view of this, it is understandable that the politicians have been fumbling for a 'political solution'. The plan adopted by Mr Amato's cabinet last Friday would retroactively change the law on party financing, nexus of most of the corruption scandals, turning the payment of illicit contributions to party coffers from a crime punishable by prison to a mere misdemeanour, with fines and other civil penalties attached. The result - just as predictably - was uproar among opposition parties, magistrates and the public. The cabinet's measures were not entirely without merit. It is clear, for example, that the authorities will have to draw some form of distinction between criminal and merely illicit forms of graft if they are to avoid filling Italy's prisons to bursting point. Yet attempting at this point to tamper with the judicial system was an act of astonishing political insensitivity on the government's part: the public is behind the magistracy and in no mood to see politicians letting each other off. Italians sense that they are witnessing an indictment of the whole way their country has run its affairs for decades. The judiciary - not the politicians  -should respond by taking corruption prosecutions out of the existing, overtaxed court system and creating a special legal structure under respected judges to expedite them. This the politicians should agree to fund. Meanwhile, the latter, for their part, should inject greater urgency into their deliberations on electoral reform, the subject of a referendum on April 18, with a view to holding early elections shortly thereafter. Only then can a new parliament and a more legitimate government set about agreeing the constitutional reforms that Italy so badly needs.</p>

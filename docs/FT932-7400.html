			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Observer: Just kidding Imagine the horror felt by gold bulls, who have been bellowing like mad about the recent gold price rise, when the latest International Monetary Fund statistics showed that in March Belgium's central bank had sold another 60 tonnes of the metal. For there is one thing virtually guaranteed to send the gold price spiralling back down again - any clear indication that central banks have once again started to sell off their gold stocks, about 34,000 tonnes or 10 years' supply. Belgium appeared to have chosen the moment when the gold price in US dollar terms hit its lowest level in seven years for its third sale of central bank bullion. It previously sold 127 tonnes in 1989 and 202 tonnes in 1992. But there were sighs of relief all round when the Belgian bank admitted that it had sold no gold. It had provided the IMF with the wrong figures because of 'human error'.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (13): Much illness linked to pollution - After decades of environmental abuse, drastic reforms are needed EDWARD CRANKSHAW once published a set of essays entitled: 'Putting Up with the Russians.' But perhaps now, since massive military-industrial cities have been opened to the outside world, a subtitle could be added to the book: 'What the Russians put up with.' Apart from the appalling state apparatus of fear and coercion which kept this vast country together, the Russians endured decades of ill-health, not only caused by malnutrition, but by the pollution and radio-active waste which devastated large parts of Russia. A visit to any large city in the Urals confirms what independent-minded scientists knew for many years. Compared to west European levels where the average life expectancy is 76 years, Russia's level has fallen to 69 years over a period of 20 years. Experts, including Prof. Alexey Yablokov, President Yeltsin's advisor on ecology and public health policy, says over 40 per cent of illnesses are connected with the environment. In Chelyabinsk, a city earmarked by Stalin in 1929 to forge ahead with the arms race, people constantly complain of headaches. The most common operations performed by the local hospital are for heart-related diseases. The military-industrial complex is one of the roots of the country's enviromental problems. There are many others. The absence of public accountability meant that enterprise managers, regardless of fictional legal penalties, could dump radio-active waste in the rivers and lakes. Indeed, in the suburbs of Moscow, scientists say the dumping of radio active waste has, and will continue, to affect the health of the capital's citizens. These same scientists are hoping that the revolution affecting the economy will also have a beneficial affect on the environment. But in addressing the problems of the environment, where does one start? The accident at the power plant in Chernobyl, April 1986, provided the first tentative step towards galvanising public opinion against the poor safety standards of these RBMK reactors. Mr Yablokov believes that all sixteen of the RMBK reactors which are of the Chernobyl-type, should be closed down, immediately. The problem is that since these reactors provide about 12 per cent of Russia's total energy needs, any immediate shut-down would lead to a shortfall in energy supplies. But Mr Viktor Danilov Danilan, Russia's ecology and resources minister, admits that his country's use of energy is inefficient. Not only are prices still low; waste is phenomenal. 'We lose between 10 and 15 per cent of our oil and gas in the pipes, of which many are leaking. We lose about 25bn cubic metres of gas a year. I am sure the real losses are more considerable. They could amount to 30 per cent of our total energy supplies,' he explains. He and other energy specialists also bemoan the fact that households cannot monitor their own energy consumption. Not only is the idea of a thermostat non-existent in most Russian homes. But energy supplies to the domestic consumer are centrally-controlled - normally by the local district council. Mr Danilov-Danilan's office had its own, if not uncommon, thermostat: the window. The ministry estimates that a sum of Dollars 10bn could enable Russia's energy supplies to become more efficient, and modernised. This could also allow the sixteen RBMK plants to be closed down. But in a country committed to holding down public expenditure, Mr Danilov-Danilan is not optimistic. 'I asked the Russian government to allocate to our ministry 2 per cent of the credits we will receive from the international community,' he adds. He is still waiting for a reply. Mr Yablokov, a ceaseless campaigner on the environment over the years says he is in a more fortunate position because he has the ear of Mr Yeltsin. He says that Mr Yeltsin, since coming to office, has already issued six decrees related to the environment. In practice, this means very little. The giant engine of the military-industrial complex, particularly in the Urals, is not yet, nor will it, grind to a halt. So any reductions in arms production will not have an immediate affect on the environment. Moreover, a committment to dismantling Russia's vast arsenal of tactical and nuclear weapons offers nightmares as well as hope for the environment. Defence experts in Moscow recall how, as part of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, signed between the US and the former Soviet Union, dozens of tactical weapons were exploded in Kazakhstan. 'I dare to ask what this did to the environment,' commented one senior Russian defence analyst. In the meantime, Mr Yablokov is campaigning for three things: identifying 'zones of ecological disaster,' creating national parks; and making the water in Moscow and other cities clean enough to drink. The many maps on his office wall - a splendid room overlooking the Kremlin - bear testimony to many of these zones which are scattered throughout Russia and the republics of the former Soviet Union. Mr Yablokov wants all nuclear testing, and other experiments, stopped. Setting up national parks, he believes, would give the earth time to overcome the decades of abuse. His account of the pesticides and chemicals which have destroyed Russia's forests and lakes are well-known. That fact also explains the sorry nature of the water supplies. 'For us, the ozone layer is academic. The big issue is the quality of our drinking water,' said Mr Yablokov. Some western financial institutions are carrying out studies on ways to clean up Moscow's water system. A new water network would, among other things, involve ripping out the worn 19th century sewerage pipes and replacing lead pipes. But the root of the problem would not be resolved: stopping waste from being poured into the republic's rivers and lakes. 'We do not expect miracles overnight,' said Mr Yablokov, adding: 'it will take years to improve our environment - maybe 20. But we have to start today, otherwise the next generation will have nothing to inherit.'</p>

Lying 80 kilometers north of Guangzhou city, capital of  Guangdong Province, Shantang town received 130 households with  more than 600 people who were moved from limestone mountain  areas in Qingyuan city.    Xie Fei, also a member of the party's Politburo, visited  Chen  Quangui's house and gave spring festival greetings to the family.    Chen told the local party chief that in the second half of  last year, when his family was moved to the new village, his  family had reaped 5,000 kilograms of rice, three times more than  the harvest in the past three years.    He said that his family sold about 2,000 kilograms of rice  for and 1,400 yuan.    Xie Fei then visited six families in the town and he was  pleased to see that more than 100 new houses for resettled  people were under construction.    Xie said that Guangdong has set a target of modernization in  the next 20 years. But the limestone mountain areas presented a  problem -- their barren conditions made them unfit for people.    So Guangdong provincial government decied to resettle about  100,000 people from the mountain areas to the outskirts of  Guangzhou city, including the counties of Qingyuan city, where  there is more farmland with fewer farmers.    Last year, about 5,700 households with more than 30,000  people were moved from the limestone mountain areas to the  counties of Qingyuan city.    Xie Fei urged the resettled farmers to open up the potential  in agriculture and gradually get prosperous.</p>

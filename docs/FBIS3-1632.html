Li Wenquan said in his speech: In the preceding stage, the  province had a situation characterized by political stability,  social stability, economic development, and market prosperity,  and in which the people lived and worked in peace and  contentment. However, we must notice that there are still  factors affecting social and political stability and the tasks  for keeping stability are still arduous. The party and  government leading comrades at various levels should approach  from the high plane of the overall situation and from the high  political plane to grasp and well handle the relationship among  reform, development, and stability; go all out to safeguard the  stability of the overall situation; and never, in the slightest  degree, be vague on or shake this matter of principle. At  present, we should emphatically grasp the basic work of the  grass roots, the improvement of administrative honesty, the  improvement of ideology and work style, and the setup of legal  system to ensure and promote the smooth progress of reform,  opening up, and modernization.    Sun Shuyi, standing committee member of the provincial party  committee and secretary of the provincial commission of  political science and law; and Wang Yuxi, vice governor of the  provincial government, attended and addressed the forum.</p>

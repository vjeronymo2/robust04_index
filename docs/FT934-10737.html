			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Brittan wants larger anti-dumping unit - Brussels to vote on proposals to speed unfair trade investigations THE European Community's trade commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, is pressing for the Commission's anti-dumping unit to be doubled in size to help improve the speed and efficiency of investigations into unfair trade. Proposals for increasing staff, shortening inquiry deadlines and restructuring the anti-dumping department will be voted on today by his fellow commissioners. However, trade lawyers in Brussels fear they will not improve the transparency of anti-dumping investigations and will make it more difficult for companies accused of dumping to respond to Commission findings. 'Even if they publish decisions which are twice as long as they are today, the real reasons for the decisions will always remain to some extent secret,' said one lawyer. Commission officials hope plans for improving efficiency will please all member states, even though there is deadlock over the more sensitive question of whether to give Brussels more power to push through anti-dumping duties. They also believe the improvements will reassure those southern member states reluctant to abolish national import quotas unless the EC sharpens its trade weapons. Dumping occurs when products are exported to the EC at unfairly low prices compared with the price in the home market. The Commission can only act if these cheap imports are causing 'material injury' to the EC industry. Sir Leon could face opposition from fellow commissioners today because staff numbers are under extreme pressure. A plea for more personnel was issued yesterday in the Commission report on anti-dumping activities for 1992, the first to appear under Sir Leon's stewardship. The report - much more detailed than usual - argues that the Community anti-dumping services are 'critically understaffed' compared with those in the US, Canada or Australia. The number of professionals handling cases at the Commission dropped from 94 to 89 last year, making a total of some 130 including support staff. Officials estimate that the US operates its anti-dumping policy with some 500 professionals. Sir Leon is proposing that all anti-dumping investigations be concluded within 15 months, and that provisional duties should be imposed, if necessary, within nine months of the start of an inquiry. At present complex investigations can take well over 18 months. He is also planning to strengthen the involvement of consumer organisations in inquiries, and split the anti-dumping department into units investigating dumping and injury, as in the US. According to the 1992 report there were 158 anti-dumping duties in force at the end of last year, of which nearly 30 per cent were against state trading countries such as China. However, measures against Japan still represented 70 per cent of the total trade value of all measures in force. Since 1988 the chemicals and electronics sectors have been the most heavily implicated in anti-dumping actions.</p>

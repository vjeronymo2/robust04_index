			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / UK Company News: Scot Power in Rumbelows deal SCOTTISH POWER, the electricity utility in southern Scotland, is expanding its retail network by buying 17 shops and eight superstores from Thorn EMI, which is pulling out of electrical retailing. Scottish Power said the deal will reinforce its position as the leading electrical retailer in Scotland, with a network extending into northern Scotland - the territory of its rival Scottish Hydro-Electric. The 17 shops are currently part of Rumbelows, with the superstores trading under the Atlantis name. The shops will now come under the Scottish Power banner and will develop its position as a brown goods retailer in addition to being a white goods outlet. In January, Thorn EMI said electrical retailing had lost the group about Pounds 50m over the past three years. Its chain of 450 Rumbelows shops, which had not made a profit since 1986-87, would be converted to rental outlets for consumer electrical goods although most have kept the Rumbelows name. About 800 head office, service and distribution jobs would go, the group said. The estimated cost of the changes was put at Pounds 40m-Pounds 45m. Scottish Power is understood to be paying Thorn EMI Pounds 5m-Pounds 10m, including stock. Thorn EMI said it was pursuing a different strategy in Scotland to that in England, because it already had enough rental outlets in Scotland to be able to dispense with the Rumbelows stores. Mr Mike Smith, Scottish Power's marketing and distribution director, said that with the purchase it will have 91 shops and 11 out-of-town stores Scottish Power doubled its share of the Scottish electrical goods market and raised its retail turnover by 40 per cent in the year to March 31 1991, converting a loss of Pounds 5m into near break-even. Mr Smith said retailing was inherently profitable. He was particularly pleased to buy the out-of-town stores, which would have taken several years to set up from scratch.</p>

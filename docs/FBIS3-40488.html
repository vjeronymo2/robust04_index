Since it  was the first meeting after the formation of the coalition  administration, MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai and the heads of  the electric power industry met to discuss future issues  concerning nuclear power facility siting. In addition to  Minister Kumagai, attending from the MITI side were both  parliamentary vice-ministers (Sadao Wada and Motohiko Endo),  Agency of Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE) Director General  Tomio Tsutsumi and Deputy Director General Yasuo Hayashi. The  electric power industry side was led by Kohei Abe, chairman of  the Federation of Electric Power Companies (FEPCO), and included  presidents of all the electric power companies from Hokkaido to  Okinawa as well as the Japan Atomic Power Company and the  Electric Power Development Company.    In his opening statement, Minister Kumagai emphasized the  importance of environmental and other problems and, maintaining  that the coalition administration will continue the fundamental  policy, stressed that ``Promotion of nuclear power generation is  extremely important.'' Minister Kumagai also asked the electric  power industry to make ``even greater efforts to ensure safety  and to gain the understanding of the local population in the  work of promoting nuclear energy.'' He also expressed the  thinking that ``It is important to promote the nuclear fuel  cycle on the basic premises of peaceful use of nuclear energy  and the ensuring of safety.''    In response, FEPCO Chairman Abe stated that the industry  side  would ``work on the best mix of electric power resources,'' and  explained the status of progress on the nuclear fuel cycle.    The electric power company presidents individually reported  on the status of electric power resource sitings, especially for  nuclear power generation, and requested more support for  regional promotion.</p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / People: Dearing steps down at FRC Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Financial Reporting Council, is stepping down at the start of next year after more than three years in the job. His replacement is expected to be announced shortly by the Department of Trade and Industry, which formally makes the appointment. Sir Ron, who was chairman of the Post Office Corporation in 1981-87, will still be very actively occupied by his other commitments, including the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority. He was persuaded to take on the Financial Reporting Council, a body of his own making, since he chaired the official 1988 report which recommended the creation of a new machinery for accounting standards-setting and enforcement.</p>

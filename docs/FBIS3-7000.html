			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, March 22 KYODO -- Japanese Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa urged the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) forum Tuesday [22 March] to have closer links  with a nongovernmental Pacific economic council to promote  economic cooperation in the region.    In a message addressed to the 10th assembly of the Pacific  Economic Cooperation Council (PECC), Hosokawa said APEC and PECC  "should complement each other by identifying complementary  activities for the promotion of regional economic cooperation."  This is because "PECC and APEC share common objectives and an  equal recognition of the importance of facilitating and  promoting Asia-Pacific economic cooperation," he said.    PECC, a nongovernmental organization formed in 1980,  provides  a forum for the region's best thinkers, business leaders and  government officials to meet and exchange views every 18 months  on ways to boost economic cooperation in the world's fastest  growing region.    Hosokawa noted the importance of dialogue in boosting  cooperation among countries in the region. Japan, he said, "is  ready to make efforts to continue playing a positive role in  promoting such cooperation." Hosokawa's message was read to the  audience of 500 delegates.    He also expressed hope that trade blocs in the Asia-Pacific  region such as the ASEAN Free Trade Area [AFTA] and the North  American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] will not become economic  fortresses. "I hope to see AFTA and NAFTA, while keeping up  their coordination with GATT, continue to contribute to  maintaining and strengthening the open and multilateral trading  system," he said.    "Open, multilateral free trade under the auspices of GATT is  of paramount importance for the development of not only the  Asia-Pacific area but the entire world," he said.</p>

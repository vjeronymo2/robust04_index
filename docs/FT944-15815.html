			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Standards for plugs proposed The controversy over the future of the UK's 13-amp plug and socket system has moved into its final stages with publication by the British Standards Institution of two draft standards for a harmonised European system. The standards, eagerly awaited by the plug and socket industry, consumer associations and safety experts, are for a system using a plug with two round pins, and for an adapter to facilitate a changeover to the system. The standards have been produced by a technical committee of Cenelec, the Brussels-based electrical standards body for Europe. They are the culmination of years of lobbying among the 18 member countries of Cenelec, which run about 20 conflicting plug and socket systems. The Cenelec members will vote by March on the new system. If approved, conflicting standards such as the UK's BS1363, on which the 13-amp rectangular-pin plug is based, would have to be dropped - unless opposing countries were to seek an exemption or derogation. A BSI technical committee will cast the UK's vote, and the institute said it was establishing a deadline of December 31 for public comments, to give the committee two months to weigh up opinion. Mr Ian Campbell, head of the BSI's electrical standards development department, said: 'We want to make absolutely sure that we have reached a consensus in this country before entering the wider arena.' Some British safety experts have said that the proposed plugs could be inserted dangerously into existing UK sockets and that the unfused European plugs would not be safe with the current British ring networks. European electrical supplies work on a radial network. But supporters of the proposal reject these arguments, and say a standardised European system would benefit consumers and appliance manufacturers because of reduced costs and product compatibility across Europe. BSI's role in the saga has also been criticised, with supporters of the proposal claiming that its technical committee is too weighted towards the interests of UK plug and socket manufacturers. The BSI has rejected this, stressing that it acts only as a facilitator for its committees, and has no commercial interest in, or influence over, their conclusions.</p>

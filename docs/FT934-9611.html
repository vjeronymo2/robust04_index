			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Vauxhall workers vote to strike WORKERS AT one of Vauxhall's main car plants, Ellesmere Port, near Liverpool, have voted narrowly in favour for a strike over pay. But it is unlikely to go ahead without support from other plants and other unions, David Goodhart writes. Members of the TGWU general union at the plant voted 911 to 848 for a strike but by 1,259 votes to 547 for industrial action short of a strike. Mr Tony Woodley, TGWU national secretary, said the company's offer failed to reflect record profits and big improvements in productivity. The offer is for a 2.5 per cent rise now with another 3 per cent next autumn plus a 1 per cent lump payment and a further 1 per cent if inflation reaches 4 per cent. Union officials say privately that workers at Vauxhall's other large plant at Luton, Bedfordshire, are much less likely to support industrial action. The Luton plant is not producing cars at the moment because of weakness in the European market Members of the AEEU craft union, who are expected to start balloting on the offer at the end of next week, are also much less likely to support industrial action.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / US second-quarter growth sharply lower THE US Commerce Department confirmed yesterday that economic growth in the second quarter of this year was less than half that recorded in the first quarter. Its revised figures for the expansion in gross domestic product in April-June were unchanged from its estimates of a month ago, at 1.4 per cent real annual rate. In the first quarter, the economy grew by 2.9 per cent. There was some greater encouragement in the simultaneous report that the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits in the week ending August 15 had dropped by 92,000 to 382,000 - the largest weekly decline since records began in 1967. But the Labour Department conceded that almost all the improvement was attributable to the end of a two-week shutdown at General Motors car plants in Michigan. Given reports this week of another decline in durable goods orders and diminishing consumer confidence, there remains little statistical evidence of recovery. Business inventories in the second quarter, for example, rose by a revised Dollars 9.2bn, having fallen by Dollars 12.6bn in the first quarter.</p>

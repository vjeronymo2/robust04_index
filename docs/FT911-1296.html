			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Survey of South Africa (12): On the road to 'normalisation'  -Michael Holman on international relations SOUTH AFRICA'S changing status in the international arena was vividly illustrated last month by the experiences of President F. W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela, the ANC deputy-president, during their briefly overlapping visits to London. At meetings of leading businessmen and before a packed press conference, the South African president - en route to Denmark and Ireland - confidently outlined his vision of a 'new South Africa', and pressed the case for a rapid end to remaining sanctions. By contrast, Mr Mandela, speaking to journalists in the same hall that last year saw a triumphant appearance during his first official visit to Britain, seemed a subdued figure. Sanctions had to stay, he argued, adding that he was opposed to the visit to South Africa later this year by Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary. But his case lacked conviction. In his heart Mr Mandela must surely have conceded what many of his senior officials now acknowledge privately: sanctions are crumbling, and the barriers to political, cultural, academic and sporting contact with Pretoria are falling. The combination of reform at home and revolutions abroad is making the process irreversible. In the eyes of most outsiders - including an increasing number of African states - Mr de Klerk has demonstrated his reformist credentials. And the once reliable rear-bases for the ANC - the Soviet Union and its eastern bloc allies - have been among the first to establish links with post-apartheid Pretoria as they undergo radical reforms of their own. For Mr Neil van Heerden, director-general of the foreign affairs ministry, who played a key role in Namibian independence negotiations early last year, the developments have opened new horizons. Today's objectives were once unattainable: consolidating existing African links and developing new ones, notably Nigeria; exploring opportunities in Pacific Rim countries; cautiously assessing the trading potential of eastern Europe; and preparing for Organisation of African Unity membership. 'Our first priority is to normalise relations with the outside world,' says Mr van Heerden. Evidence of this 'normalisation' has come thick and fast, often catching the ANC on the hop. Over the past year Pretoria has opened trade or 'interest' missions in more than 20 countries as diverse as Hungary, Togo, Ivory Coast, Mauritius and - later this year - the Soviet Union. Mr van Heerden particularly welcomes the fact that relations with the European Community as a whole have dramatically improved. It seems unlikely South Africa will be as divisive an issue for the EC as it has been in the past. Shortly before President de Klerk's arrival in London, the EC ignored the last-minute objections of a delegation of senior ANC officials, and lifted its 1986 ban on the import of South African iron, steel and gold coins. This followed the repeal last year of the EC's voluntary ban on new investment. 'The decision again shows clearly how Europe allies itself with white South Africa,' complained Mr Mandela. 'We are the victims, yet they reward the jailer for letting a little more light into our hell-hole.' Mr Mandela might well direct his wrath on states much closer to home. It has long been the case that all but a handful of African states trade with Pretoria, overtly or covertly: this trade is now flourishing, and South Africa's diplomats are boasting of contacts which they once made surreptitiously. New links are paying off handsomely. According to the South African Foreign Trade Association (Safto), the value of exports to the rest of Africa rose 40 per cent in 1989, and a further 22 per cent last year, making the market worth some R5.5bn. The ANC leader can derive some comfort from the United States, however. Washington is still applying sanctions, banning imports of agricultural products, coal, iron, steel, uranium, sugar and gold coins and other items. It also bans US investment in South Africa, computer exports and direct air links between the two countries. But the wall is likely to breached later this year. Last week Mr Hank Cohen, the assistant secretary of state for African affairs, told a congressional committee that Pretoria had met three of five conditions that must be fulfilled to allow the US to lift economic sanctions: repeal the state of emergency and release detainees held under it; unban democratic political parties and permit participation of all races in the political process; and agree to enter good faith negotiations with the black majority without preconditions. The two further demands - release of political detainees or repeal of the racially based Group Areas Act and Population Registration Act - are being put into practice. The process of repeal, Mr van Heerden estimates, should 'come to fruition in the second half of this year'. He acknowledges that what he calls 'second tier' sanctions - measures imposed by cities for example, which are not susceptible to executive fiat - will continue, but expects a gradual erosion. The platform for any recovery in the South African economy, however, is the region as a whole, however welcome the resumption of international trading opportunities. Mr van Heerden stresses the link between a successful outcome to peace talks in Mozambique and Angola, now under way, and South Africa's own transition to democracy. 'If we can stop these wars, our part of the continent can take off,' says Mr van Heerden. 'And our neighbours tell us: 'Whatever you do, don't self-destruct, because we're depending on you to be the source of technology, consumer goods, and so on', except the Zimbabwean government, where President Mugabe still sees South Africa as the enemy, even though our trading figures are going through the roof]'</p>

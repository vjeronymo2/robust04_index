The Dutch guests  were welcomed by Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and his wife,  Deputy Foreign Minister Nguyen Dy Nien and other senior  officials. Dutch Ambassador to Vietnam Mr. Dave Ader was also on  hand.    This evening, Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and his wife  gave a reception in honour of the Dutch guests. On this  occasion the Army paper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN runs an article  expressing the Vietnamese Government and people's gratitude to  the Dutch Government and people for their support to the  national construction in Vietnam, especially their humanitarian  aid in various healthcare projects for the Vietnamese people.  `The Dutch Government and non- governmental organisations have  granted help to Vietnam's healthcare and education under various  forms: financial and technical assistance, and donation. The  Dong Ha hospital in the central province of Quang Tri was built  with Dutch assistance. In addition, a number of healthcare  programmes such as malaria, TB, leprosy, immunisation, drinking  water have also received assistance from the Netherlands.  Together with its assistance to the Amsterdam High School in  Hanoi, the Dutch Government has granted scholarships for  hundreds of Vietnamese students to study in the Netherlands. In  1993 alone it gave vietnam some USD 20 million as aid, not  accounting the assistance through the European Community and  various UN bodies. `The Netherlands also decided to exempt  Vietnam's debt service payment which was worth about USD 1.4  million, and was one of the countries who agreed to delay  Vietnam's time of payment for its arrears at the donors'  conference on Vietnam in Paris last year. At present, the  Netherlands ranks ninth among foreign investors in Vietnam with  a capital totalling more than USD 283 million, and is the second  largest EC country which is carrying out ever broadening  investment in the country. The paper also recalls the  Netherlands growing cooperation with Vietnam in many fields,  i.e. oil and gas, air service, harbour building and enlarging,  water management, food processing industry which have led to the  signing in 1993 of the Vietnamese-Dutch agreement on investment  encouragement and protection and of the establishment of the  Vietnamese-Dutch dredge joint venture.</p>

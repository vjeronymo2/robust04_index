			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Fabio Valencia Cossio, president </F> of the Colombian Conservative Party's National Directorate, by  unidentified reporters; place not given -- live]    [Text] [Reporter] Mr. Valencia, has the Conservative Party  taken a position with regard to its possible cooperation with  Ernesto Samper's liberal government?    [Valencia] First we want to praise the extraordinary  election  day activities led by Andres Pastrana on Sunday in which more  than 3.5 million votes were secured, within the framework of a  big partisan movement that has created a balance of power in the  nation. The Conservative Party, as you know, is a traditional  party, which is permanently in force, has a hierarchy, and  obviously participated very actively, very strongly, and with  very good results, through a major partisan movement, during  Andres Pastrana's presidential campaign.    The National Directorate will meet today to assess the  electoral results and to highlight the work of the Conservative  Party. We want to express our appreciation to all the directors,  congressmen, deputies, councilmen, and party leaders, in  general, because the party truly had an extraordinary and  historical day. Within that order of priorities, we are  analyzing the positions the president-elect has been presenting.    Obviously, in accordance with that attitude, we are going to  make a decision in this regard. For starters, from a democratic  point of view, we recognize Ernesto Samper's victory. We wish  him success, because what we want is for Colombia to succeed.    [Reporter] As president of the National Directorate of the  Conservative party, I would like to say that the Conservative  Party provided enormous support at the voting tables.  Nevertheless, there are those who pose this question: Will the  Conservative Party let itself be absorbed by the democratic  force represented by Dr. Pastrana and his supraparty ideology,  or will the Conservative Party begin reorganizing its followers  as an alternative to power?    [Valencia] I believe that neither Dr. Pastrana nor we are  interested in losing the Conservative Party's historical stance.  I want to give an explanation to ensure that the country will  understand the structural differences between the Liberal and  Conservative Parties. The Liberal presidential candidate and the  party leadership became confused, while by national convention,  we elected Andres Pastrana as part a large supraparty movement.    [Reporter] Dr. Valencia, let me fulfill a commitment we have  every day at 0730; we can then continue with this conversation,  which is very important because many political sectors are  anxiously waiting for it.    [Valencia] Of course, Carlos.    [Reporter] We were talking with Fabio Valencia, the  Conservative Party's National Directorate president. He was  answering an important question, which I will repeat to Dr.  Valencia.    [Reporter] Will the Conservative Party now reassume an  alternative-power position or will it continue participating in  the New Democratic Force [NFD]?    [Valencia] I believe we must make a distinction at this  point. The Conservative Party is a permanent and historic party,  with its own hierarchy and legal identity. Out of conviction, we  took Andres Pastrana as the supraparty candidate, and we  participated as part of the NFD. In the case of the Liberal  Party, the candidate and the head of the party were the same  person. In our case, we chose our president and a supraparty  president, whose participation and national leadership were  undisputed. The Conservative Party chose a candidate, but the  party's leadership remained with its national directorate, and  its legal representation [words indistinct]. As I said before,  the structures of the parties are different. The Conservative  Party is obviously intact, and it has a clear representation in  Congress. I reiterate: We are ready to continue working on  behalf of the country and promoting the ideas of change  advocated by Pastrana during his campaign.    [Reporter] Would the Conservative Party collaborate with  President Samper instead of the NFD, or, vice versa, would  Pastrana's followers and the NFD collaborate with Samper instead  of the Conservative Party?    [Valencia] There is a very significant circumstance at this  point: Andres Pastrana represents half of all Colombians, who  chose him for his ideas and leadership. From this angle, no one  can deny the significance of the Conservative Party. The  Conservative Party, considering the political  hierarchy--Pastrana noted it last night--is not in his hands,  but in ours, and we are working on this basis.    [Reporter] Therefore, that decision is yours and not  Pastrana's. Do you believe that the Conservative Party should  participate in the government?    [Valencia] We, together with all the friends of the  Conservative Party, are studying the situation. We will hold  consultations with all the parliamentarians and will meet with  the National Directorate today. We are waiting to see the  attitude of President-elect Samper, because he has the first say  on this. The ball is in his court.    [Reporter] Consequently, Dr. Valencia, would you be willing  to talk to President-elect Ernesto Samper Pizano to define the  Conservative Party's possible cooperation, if any, with the next  government?    [Valencia] Obviously, as president of the National  Directorate I have the authority to make these kinds of contacts  and, I believe, they are very important for the country. We have  a very positive attitude, and, of course, we are also very aware  of the situation. However, we really want the country to be able  to start on the road toward advancement and development, and,  hopefully, we will do this as smoothly as possible.    [Reporter] In other words, you do not believe the Colombian  Conservative Party should oppose the next government?    [Valencia] I believe this depends totally on the attitude  assumed by the president. The president has to study what has  happened in the country. Andres Pastrana is really a very  important national leader. He managed to convince the entire  Conservative Party to back his program and political platform,  as well as independent and important sectors from the Liberal  Party. I believe the president-elect of the Republic, who  already has to think like a head of state, will study this new  political situation, the breakdown in Congress, and all of the  factors a president must consider to have a good government.    [Reporter] What is the mood within your party on the  possibility of assuming the role of the new opposition?    [Valencia] I believe the Conservative Party really cares  about Colombia's well-being and is willing to back the good  things presented by the government, as well as being willing to  criticize the bad things. At this time, however, as I have  already stated, it is not up to the Conservative Party to decide  whether or not it will participate in the government. This is a  privilege of the president-elect. However, we have a positive  attitude and the highest level of patriotic will, and, as I told  you, we will back the good and criticize the bad.    [Reporter] Before I continue asking questions, we have to  congratulate you for the extraordinary amount of Conservative  votes--specifically, 471,834 votes--obtained in Antioquia. We  also want to ask another question regarding the Conservative  Party's immediate actions in Congress. What parliamentary  actions will the Conservative Party emphasize?    [Valencia] First, thank you very much for your compliments  on  the votes received in Antioquia. We have a great team in the  region. All of the Conservative Party members worked hard, and  we also know a large number of independent liberals voted in our  favor. [words indistinct] Antioquia has had experience in  changes. We have been changing for the past five years. We  started with the Constituent Assembly, and later we got Juan  Gomez elected to the governor's post and Luis Alfredo Ramos to  the mayor's post. That is why Andres Pastrana's victory in  Antioquia was so overwhelming.    Regarding the work to be done in the legislature, we will be  calling to a meeting of the Conservative Party bloc. As you  know, we have 30 senators and more than 60 representatives.  Therefore, we have a very important force in Congress. We are  going to work to further the country's best interests. The party  has made great advances under Andres Pastrana's leadership  within the context of the supraparty movement, and we do not  want to squander this great historic opportunity.    [Reporter] From Antioquia, Orlando Carames will ask the next  question.    [Carames] Thank you. Dr. Valencia, gubernatorial and mayoral  elections will be held in October. Based on the work done by the  multipartisan United Antioquia Movement, Governor Juan Gomez and  Medellin Mayor Luis Alfredo Ramos were elected in the previous  election. Will this experiment be repeated, or will the party go  it alone in the upcoming elections, now that it has an  autonomous electoral force of more than 471,000 votes?    [Valencia] I believe the situation in Antioquia has to be  studied. However, I repeat, I believe Antioquia voted with the  supraparty movement because, as you stated, Orlando, the United  Antioquia emerged precisely from the convergence of several  political forces [words indistinct] liberal and independent  sectors, and even from the M/19 [19 April Movement/Democratic  Alliance]. This, I believe, gave us very good results. We all  want serious, effective leaders who have good management skills.  An example of such leaders are Juan Gomez Martinez and Luis  Alfredo Ramos. We want the very best for Antioquia.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 10 Jun (PL) -- Today, Cuba highlighted the  increasing rejection of the U.S. economic and trade embargo  against the island. Cuba pointed out recent decisions by  several international organizations and within certain circles  in the U.S. Congress itself.    The Cuban Foreign Ministry expressed its satisfaction for  statements made to this effect at the last meeting of the Latin  American Economic System (SELA) and at the Cairo meeting of the  Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Foreign Ministers.    This is the first time SELA has ever approved a resolution  rejecting the blockade. It goes even further than the  resolutions issued by the UN, the ministry added, as it  expressly calls for the lifting of the punitive measure.    Referring to the NAM meeting, Foreign Ministry spokesman  Miguel Alfonso said the ministers' statement is stronger than  other resolutions previously approved by the organization. It  specifically supports similar decisions approved by the UN, and  with which the United States has yet to comply.    Regarding what he called the increasingly evident  international rejection of the economic and trade prohibitions  against Cuba, Alfonso underscored the events that took place on  9 June in several U.S. cities, demanding an end to the policy.    Lobby Day, as it was called, featured activities by a  coalition of over 45 national and state organizations supporting  a bill presented by Congressman Charles Rangel, who is calling  for the lifting of the embargo.    One of the main events was a round table discussion in the  U.S. Senate, which addressed the current Cuban situation and  relations between the two countries. Several members of  Congress and other political, cultural, and media personalities  were present.    Alfonso, who met with local and international reporters,  also  mentioned recent statements by Latin American foreign ministers  within the context of the last OAS meeting. The ministers  called for the organization to change its policies regarding  Cuba.    It is this series of reactions, he pointed out, that make it  increasingly evident that support for the idea of an alleged  international isolation of the country is vanishing.</p>

Hoj. Nuri said parliamentary relations between the two  countries are helpful for the expansion of mutual ties in other  areas.    During the meeting the speaker also warned the U.S. against  any moves which tend to breach the international norms. "The  U.S. should take lessons from the collapse of the former  superpower of the Soviet Union, and should not violate  international norms simply because it has no rival anymore."    Referring to the dual attitude of international  organizations  towards the killings of the innocent people of Bosnia and  Herzegovina by the racist Serbs as well as the carnage of the  Palestinian Muslim worshipers by the criminal Zionists, the  Majlis speaker called on the world countries to take serious  action vis-a-vis such crimes.    Stressing Iran's determination to maintain security and  stability in the Persian Gulf region, Nuri said that the U.S.  presence in the Persian Gulf is a threat to the security of the  region.    Qian in reply said that Iran served as a bridge between Asia  and Europe, and termed Iran's role in the strategic and  sensitive region of the Persian Gulf as "positive and  constructive". He also said expansion of the mutual  parliamentary relations would strengthen the two countries' ties  in other areas.</p>

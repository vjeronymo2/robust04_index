			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To value water, we used a cable from the U.S. consulate in Pakistan. We used this cable because we could not locate a value for water in any Indian or Pakistani publication. Because the price contained in the cable was for a period prior to the POI, we adjusted the factor values to account for inflation between the time period in question and the POI using WPIs published in IFS by the IMF.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To value labor costs, we used the International Labor Office's 1992 Yearbook of Labor Statistics. To determine the number of hours in an Indian workday, we used the Country Reports: Human Rights Practices for 1990. Because the published labor rate was prior to the POI, we adjusted the factor values to account for inflation between the time period in question and the POI using the consumer price index published in IFS by the IMF.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To value factory overhead, selling, general and administrative expenses, and profit, we calculated percentages based on elements of industry group income statements from The Reserve Bank of India Bulletin. We did not include an amount for energy in our factory overhead calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To calculate FMV for one ton of sebacic acid, we added each of the costs derived above. We also added to FMV, where appropriate, an amount for packing labor based on the appropriate Indian wage rate, and an amount for packing materials based on Indian prices from the Monthly Statistics of the Foreign Trade of India. We made no adjustments for selling expenses. Finally, we added surrogate freight costs for the delivery of inputs and packing materials to the factories producing sebacic acid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this investigation, respondents stated that the factories produce three valuable by-products (glycerine, fatty acid, and caproyl alcohol) in the course of producing sebacic acid. Respondents maintain that the Department should deduct the value of these three by-products from the cost of manufacture. We disagree with the respondents that the products are all by-products, and that the value of each should be deducted from the cost of manufacture of sebacic acid. Rather, as discussed below, we agree that fatty acid is a by-product but determine that glycerine and caproyl alcohol should not be considered by-products in this case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The three products in question are all yielded during the production of sebacic acid and the products are an unavoidable consequence of the production of sebacic acid. These products are produced from the same raw materials, by the same equipment, during the same manufacturing operations, as those used for sebacic acid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, by-products are treated differently from other types of products (i.e. joint or co-products) for purposes of determining a product's costs. The distinction between by-products and these other products is based on relative sales value. By-products are identified by their relatively insignificant sales value, whereas these other products, regardless how they are referred to, generally have significant sales value relative to the product under investigation. In this case, we determined whether the value of a product was significant or insignificant based on the quantity yielded and the value assigned to each product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To determine the relative values of all subsidiary products and the subject merchandise, we took into account the fact that: (1) The factories generally sell the subsidiary products in the domestic market; (2) the factories sell sebacic acid in the domestic market; (3) the PRC renminbi is a non-convertible currency; and (4) the factories' costs and profits have not been considered because we have not yet addressed respondents' MOI claim. In accordance with the hierarchy for preferred input values as set forth in the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings From the People's Republic of China, 57 FR 21058 (May 18, 1992) (Comment 4) and the publicly available published information selection methodology noted above, we used surrogate values from India for sebacic acid, glycerine, caproyl alcohol, and fatty acid to determine the relative value of each product based on the production of one metric ton of sebacic acid, as well as to determine the total value of one metric ton of sebacic acid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this case, we determine that fatty acid is a by-product because the overall value of fatty acid is insignificant compared to the relative value among all of the ``subsidiary'' products and the subject merchandise. As a by-product, we subtracted the sales revenue of fatty acid from the production costs of the other products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SHARED A-SECRETS WITH FRANCE;  </P> <P> WHITE HOUSE DISPUTES CONTENTION THAT ACTION BROKE LAW  </P> <P> The Bush Administration on Saturday confirmed that the United States has  discreetly shared some nuclear-weapons information with France since 1972, but  it disputed a published report that the cooperation violated U.S. law.  </P> <P> In an article published Saturday, Princeton University Prof. Richard H. Ullman  maintains that the cooperation was a "covert" arrangement that "almost  certainly has violated U.S. law." But he added that the arrangement has also  strengthened the nuclear deterrent available to the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization and has helped reverse the ill effects of French President Charles  de Gaulle's 1966 decision to pull France out of the alliance's unified military  command.  </P> <P> A statement issued jointly by the Bush White House in Rome and by the State  Department here pointed out that the cooperation with France dates back to  1961, when the John F. Kennedy Administration reached a formal agreement with  France to exchange some classified information "concerning training, military  planning, protection against nuclear-weapons effects and operation of delivery  systems."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Accord Suspended in 1966  </P> <P> That agreement was suspended in 1966, after De Gaulle marched the French  military out of NATO and ousted the alliance headquarters from Paris. But the  arrangement was resumed in 1972, during the Richard M. Nixon Administration,  and it was further expanded in 1985 in an amendment to the 1961 agreement.  </P> <P> The U.S. statement Saturday said that the 1985 amendment allowed "exchanges of  certain classified information related to the safety, security and reliability  of nuclear activities and installations."  </P> <P> The statement went on to insist that the relation with the French, extending  back 28 years, "has been entirely consistent with the terms of the Atomic  Energy Act of 1954, as amended. . . . While this cooperation has been  confidential, it is a mistake to label it as covert (because) this cooperation  takes place with the full knowledge of both governments and does not involve  activities of an intelligence nature."  </P> <P> In his article, in the Washington-based periodical Foreign Policy, Ullman not  only calls the exchange covert but insists it was in violation of a 1958  amendment to the Atomic Energy Act that, by implication, limited American  nuclear cooperation to Britain, then the only ally with a nuclear weapons  capability.  </P> <P> Yet in his article, Ullman also concedes that after the Nixon decision to  resume cooperation was worked out between Henry A. Kissinger, then national  security adviser, and Michel Jobert, then French foreign minister, care was  taken not to go beyond existing restrictions on disclosing certain types of  information.  </P> <P> "Much of the technology involved . . . has in fact been unclassified," Ullman  writes at one point. "For the most part the exchanges have steered away from  the actual design of nuclear weapons . . . so as not to run afoul of U.S.  legislation. In this respect the program of assistance to France has differed  sharply from the one with Britain, where weapons designs are routinely  exchanged."  </P> <P> What the Ullman article skirts in its assertion that laws were violated was the  fact that President Kennedy asked Congress on Sept. 7, 1961, for unusually  prompt action to amend the Atomic Energy Act to permit exchanges of sensitive  information with the French. Acting under pressure after the Berlin crisis of  that summer, Kennedy explained that the exchanges "will make possible effective  cooperation with France in NATO mutual defense planning and in the training of  French NATO forces."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Detailed Report  </P> <P> Meanwhile, on Saturday, a Pentagon spokesman issued a more detailed statement  on the U.S.-French cooperation.  </P> <P> The United States "has cooperated with France in improving the operational  effectiveness and survivability of its strategic missile systems, including  supporting command and control systems," said the spokesman, who declined to be  identified by name.  </P> <P> "There have been several meetings involving U.S. and French technicians every  year since 1972 under the terms of the 1961 agreement," the statement from the  Pentagon said.  </P></p>

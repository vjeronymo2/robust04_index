			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "S.Sch.": "Compensation for the Research </F> Budget?"]    [Text] Berlin, 20 January -- Contrary to assurances from  the government that the Research Ministry's budget would remain  untouched, Research Minister Krueger, Christian Democratic  Union, must now accept reductions totaling 250 million German  marks [DM] in his DM9.4-billion budget. This means his  department -- after the Defense Ministry, the fiscal  administration, and the Economics Ministry -- is in the top  group of the 29 federal institutions that are obliged to make  economies. Krueger told this newspaper he regretted that his  department, which accounts for only 2 percent of the total  budget, has been burdened with 5 percent of the amount that is  to be saved. He is not pleased with this development. He must,  however, accept the Federal Government's decision, especially as  he has been offered "compensatory measures." It is planned that  his ministry should receive approximately DM150 million from SED  [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] assets. It is still  "litigation" money, however, as the legal dispute about SED  assets has still not been resolved. Krueger is, nevertheless,  firmly counting on the money, because guarantees have been  offered at the federal level. The funds, which were always  envisaged as additional funds for the Research Ministry, are  only available in a limited way. They can only be allocated for  research in the new laender. A further DM100 million of this  year's budget should, according to Krueger, be financed through  the Bank for Reconstruction with low interest loans. This means  that in the future, research institutions will increasingly have  to finance their work with loans rather than state contributions.</p>

Kazannik believes that he  has not broken the law or thereby provided grounds for being  released from his post. He voiced confidence that Russia could  have in him a really independent general prosecutor. To date,  Kazannik has not received from the Federation Council an  invitation to participate in the session at which his question  will be discussed, and he does not intend to "angle" for this,  although he reckons that the question of his resignation will  not, all the same, be examined in the absence of the claimant.    This statement appears strange, to say the least, if you  recall that Aleksey Kazannik tendered his resignation to Boris  Yeltsin of his own will and even against the will of Yeltsin,  and it was widely rumored by the General Prosecutor's Office.</p>

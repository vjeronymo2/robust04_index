			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Corporate Finance (10): Barings' transatlantic leap - A venerable British bank has a 40% stake in Dillon Read THE US remains the world's biggest market for corporate finance. Yet it remains virtually closed to foreign banks, which have never prospered in the fiercely competitive atmosphere of Wall Street. Barings, one of the longest-established merchant banks in the UK, finally decided this year that it could not remain on the outside any longer. Its decision to buy 40 per cent of Dillon Read - a Wall Street firm whose size and blue-blooded culture makes it roughly comparable to the British bank - marks one of the most ambitious attempts yet to build a transatlantic corporate finance business. Barings has spent the past two decades developing an international presence from scratch. In the the early 1970s it opened offices in Asia and in the 1980s set up in the leading European markets. In these less-developed corporate finance markets, it managed to gain a foothold. But the 12-strong corporate finance team it had built up in New York by the end of the 1980s was paltry in comparison with established Wall Street houses. 'Several of our clients did deals in the US, and did them with US investment banks,' says Mr Nigel Melville, a director of Baring Brothers. The decision to take a stake in Dillon Read was partly opportunistic: the US bank had been in the process of negotiating a buy-out from Travelers, the insurance company, at the time. But it marks a big risk for a bank which had survived two centuries without tying up with any other house. The nature of the link marks a compromise. On the one hand, the banks will remain largely separate. Both will continue to be run independently and each will keep its own name. On the other hand, the two sides hope to benefit from being able to make joint pitches to win business and from co-operation on transatlantic deals. The glue that is meant to hold this liaison together is a mixture of financial self-interest and, both sides hope, a close working relationship. A fee-sharing arrangement has been negotiated which is meant to encourage the banks to refer deals to each other, although no details have been made public. Getting people on each side of the Atlantic to work together will not be easy. Ambition, an addiction to secrecy and the fear of jeopardising a relationship with a client make corporate financiers loathe to share their best clients, even with people working in the same bank. Sharing them with people across the Atlantic will take a big leap of faith. Barings counters by pointing to the productive relationship that exists between Lazard Brothers in London and Lazard Freres in New York, two banks which operate independently (it denies that it has modelled its own alliance on the two Lazards). However, Barings admits that managing the relationship presents a challenge. 'The possibility of dropping a ball between two firms that are co-operating is obviously greater than within a single firm,' says Mr Melville. In an attempt to avoid problems of overlap, a single director will be responsible for the relationship with each client. Barings' corporate finance office in the US has been closed down (with two of the 12 staff transferring to Dillon Read). One of the British bank's directors has moved in with Dillon Read to act as a link between the two sides. In London, the US bank has shut its corporate finance unit, one of its managing directors (Mr Christopher Kemble) becoming a Barings director and the other (Mr Lorenzo Weissman) moving into the British bank's offices. Meanwhile, the two banks' securities arms continue to operate separately. That means, for example that Dillon Read salespeople in London continue to sell some European shares to their clients, in competition with Barings (though US equities comprise the bulk of the business). There are no plans to bring the securities sides closer, Barings says. Publicly, no extra business has yet flowed from the corporate finance link. That partly reflects the time spent so far bringing the two businesses closer, as well as the time lag in developing deals jointly. It is also partly the result of a sluggish takeover market. Only when the transatlantic takeover market hots up will it become apparent whether the Barings/Dillon Read tie was worth the gamble.</p>

He was speaking last week at the unprecedented gathering of  the finance ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  (Apec) in Honolulu, where macroeconomic strategies, capital  inflow and capital market development were the dominant theme  for informal consultations.    Tharin indicated that stable macroeconomic environment,  coupled with proper planning, implementation of infrastructure  projects and resources development projects, is the most  important factor attracting foreign capital, aside from making  it easier to obtain external financing and assuring efficient  uses of the fund.    "Encouragement of long-term over short-term funds will yield  a more stable pattern of capital flow.    Sound development of domestic capital market will help  prevent destabilizing portfolio investment," he said.    But Tharin warned that large capital inflows could affect  economic stability and lead to financial volatility.    "In our case, these issues have not hitherto been a serious  problem due to satisfactory macro-economic performance and  appropriate monitoring.    "Our fiscal surplus has helped to reduce the impact of large  capital inflows on monetary expansions," he noted.    "Meanwhile, we maintain our policy options to uphold  stability. The authorities can choose among combinations of  foreign exchange policy, interest rate policy, sterilization  measures.    "The choice and timing depend on the prevailing  circumstances. The ultimate goal, however, is to induce capital  inflows."    Tharin also drew up Thailand's growth strategy, which has  been based on a reliance on private sector initiatives, an  outward looking policy and a strong emphasis on macroeconomic  stability.    "Throughout our modern history, Thailand has always  encouraged private sector investment based on market mechanism.  Broad incentives were granted through the Board of Investment,"  he said.    "Although these incentives were selective in nature, they  did  not represent a real sectoral emphasis.    "Foreign direct investments have always been welcomed and  indeed have played an important role in the industrialization  process.    "Price control was a rare incident, reflecting the  government's belief in the function of market forces," he added.</p>

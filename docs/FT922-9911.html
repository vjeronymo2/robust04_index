			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Thatcher may be offered earldom MRS Margaret Thatcher is to be offered a hereditary peerage in the dissolution honours next month, it was reported last night, Ivo Dawnay writes. Dissolution honours are awarded following general elections and are strictly in the power of the departing or continuing prime minister. But there has been speculation that Mr John Major might avoid stirring up controversy by offering only life peerages, as was the cross-party convention in the 1960s and 1970s. If Mrs Thatcher accepts a hereditary earldom, giving her the right to the title of countess, her son Mark will immediately have the right to an honorary viscountcy and be in line to become an earl on the death of his mother. This would allow him to sit in the Lords, unlike the baronetcy which he will inherit from his father Sir Denis. Downing Street last night refused to comment on the speculation, saying only that the dissolution honours were not expected to be published before the beginning of next month.</p>

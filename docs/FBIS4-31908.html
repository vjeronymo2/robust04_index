			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 13 (CTK) -- The National  Democratic Party-New Alternative (NDS-NA) leadership failed to  decide today whether it would seek a coalition with other  parties of the right in advance of the Slovak general elections  on September 30 and October 1. The parties the NDS-NA might  unite with are the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), led by  Jan Carnogursky, and the Democratic Union (DU), led by Slovak  Premier Jozef Moravcik.    NDS Deputy Anton Hrnko said the Executive Committee had  requested the party leadership to come to a definitive decision  by Saturday's meeting of the NDS Central Council.    The KDH, which is the second largest party in the coalition  government, has stipulated that, while the NDS-NA can field  candidates jointly, the NDS-NA could only form a separate  deputies' group in parliament if the KDH received 16 percent of  the vote. Polls indicate this is not likely.    Hrnko said the NDS-NA therefore preferred joining forces  with  the DU. The DU has been reluctant to offer the NDS-NA joint  candidacy but now there are signs of change in the party  leadership, Hrnko said. "We want to prevent a re-run of the  situation at the elections the year before last when most of the  votes were divided between the splintered right, which aided the  anti-reform groups," he said.    It appears probable the KDH will go it alone in the  elections. If so it is expected to reap between eight and ten  percent of the vote and can therefore count on seats in  parliament.    Negotiations should resume with the DU on the possible  formation of an electoral coalition. The DU is a breakaway  group from ex-premier Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). The NDS-NA was formed by the  "anti-Meciar faction" within the Slovak National Party (SNS),  which was in coalition with the HZDS before the government fell  in March.    The non-parliamentary coalition of the Democratic Party (DS)  and the Party of Slovak Entrepreneurs and Tradespeople (SPZ) has  uncertain prospects of getting into parliament.</p>

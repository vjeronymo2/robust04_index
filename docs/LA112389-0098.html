			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPORTSCOPE;  </P> <P> CAL POLY COACH DARLENE MAY SHOOTS FOR HER 400TH VICTORY  </P> <P> Longtime Cal Poly Pomona Coach Darlene May will be after a milestone when the  Broncos play host to Weber State at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at Poly Pavilion.  </P> <P> May, in her 16th season as coach of the women's basketball team, is only one  win away from her 400th career victory. She will take a 399-91 record into the  game.  </P> <P> Pomona is 2-0 while Weber State will play its opener.  </P> <P> It was business as usual for Cal Poly last week as it won its second straight  Bronco Classic. Pomona crushed San Francisco State, 91-38, in the first round  and defeated California Collegiate Athletic Assn. rival Cal State Northridge,  83-73, in the championship game.  </P> <P> The Broncos were led by senior All-American forward Niki Bracken (6-2), who  averaged 20 points last season to lead the team to a 28-6 record and the NCAA  Division II final. Bracken scored 54 points in the two games last week,  including a tournament-record 32 against Northridge.  </P> <P> Another impressive performer for the Broncos was 6-2 freshman center Danielle  Carter, an All-CIF Southern Section performer for Fontana High last season, who  averaged 12.5 points and nine rebounds in the two games.  </P> <P> Carter was a reserve in the games but still made the all-tournament team along  with Bracken, the tournament's most valuable player.  </P> <P> Pomona is also starting junior Kelly Connelly (6-1) at forward, senior Marcine  Edmonds (6-1) at center and juniors Stephanie Coons (5-11) and Denise Ogburn  (5-5) at guard.  </P> <P> Weber State is led by 5-6 guard Melanie Knott, who averaged 13 points last  season.  </P> <P> After finishing second in its own tournament last week, the Cal Poly Pomona  men's basketball team will step up in class to visit NCAA Division I opponents  Southern Utah State and UC Berkeley on Saturday and Monday.  </P> <P> The Broncos, 1-1, will visit Southern Utah at 7:30 p.m. Saturday in Cedar City  and Cal at 7:30 p.m. Monday.  </P> <P> Both opponents figure to cause problems for the Broncos.  </P> <P> Southern Utah, which will be playing its season opener, is led by 5-8 Kenny Lee  who averaged 12 points last season. The Thunderbirds have eight players who are  6-6 or taller, including former USC and Brigham Young center Alan Pollard at  7-3.  </P> <P> California, which suffered a 101-81 loss to top-ranked Nevada-Las Vegas in the  second round of the National Invitational Tournament after defeating Air Force  70-49, is 1-1. The Bears are led by guards Keith Smith (6-4) and Ryan Drew  (6-3) and former Diamond Bar High star Brian Hendrick (6-8) at center.  </P> <P> On the bright side, Pomona appeared much better than its 7-19 squad of last  year in the Bronco Classic. Pomona defeated Pacific Christian, 110-83, before  dropping a 104-95 decision to Chico State in the title game.  </P> <P> The Broncos were sparked by junior forward Terry Ross (6-6), who scored 37  points and grabbed 14 rebounds against Pacific Christian, and junior guard  Chancellor McCobb (6-3), who scored 20 points against Chico. The team also  starts Jim Skinner (6-4) at forward, Rafael Vargas (6-7) at center and D.J.  Norman (6-1) at guard.  </P> <P> Six teams from the San Gabriel Valley are listed in the latest Kinney  California State High School Cross-Country Rankings.  </P> <P> Topping the list is Maranatha of Sierra Madre, which is rated in both the boys  and girls polls. The Minutemen are ranked No. 3 in boys Division III and fourth  in girls Division III.  </P> <P> The Maranatha girls figure to advance higher after winning their fourth  consecutive CIF Southern Section 1-A Division title last week.  </P> <P> The only other valley team ranked in Division III is the La Salle boys at No.  5. In Division II, South Pasadena is ranked No. 7 in the boys division and San  Marino is No. 5 and South Hills of West Covina is No. 6 in the girls division.  </P></p>

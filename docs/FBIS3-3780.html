Tsai] </F>   [Text] Geneva, March 23 (CNA) -- The Convention on  International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Wednesday [23  March] decided to begin using the name "Taiwan, China," when  referring to Taiwan and its wildlife conservation efforts.    The decision was made following protests by the Mainland  Chinese delegation which said that earlier CITES reports treated  Taiwan as an independent state and not as an integral part of  China.    Beijing's chief delegate to the CITES Standing Committee  meeting rejected a proposal to change the name to "Chinese  Taipei," the one used by Taiwan in the Olympic Games and other  sporting events.    But delegation head Wang Weimin complained that "Chinese  Taipei" is an exception and should not be used. Wang is deputy  director of the Treaty and Legal Affairs Department under  Beijing's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    Wang insisted CITES revise Taiwan's name before discussing  the alleged trade in rhino horn and tiger bone in Taiwan,  Mainland China, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Yemen.    As a non-CITES member, Taiwan is not allowed to attend the  Standing Committee meeting, which opened Monday and will  continue through Friday.</p>

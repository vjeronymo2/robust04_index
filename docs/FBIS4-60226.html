			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] On the occasion of the onset of the blessed 'Id  al-Adha, brother President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] went to  the Hammam Lanouf martyrs cemetery in Tunis where he said a  prayer for the souls of the martyrs amid a huge gathering of  Palestinians cadres.    Brother President Abu-'Ammar delivered a brief speech in  which he said: In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. [passage omitted] Dear brother Abu-Iyad [Salah  Khalaf], Abu al-Hawl, Abu-Muhammad, Abu-Jihad [Brigadier General  Muhammad], 'Atif, Abu-'Ali Iyad, Hamad ['Abd-al-Karim], Ghassan  Kanafani, Abu al-Walid, Majid Abu-Sharar, Abu-al-Mundhir;  brothers and beloved martyrs. While you rest in you paradise,  the members of the Palestinian police force have entered  Palestinian soil, the first liberated Palestinian land where the  Palestinian flag is flying, and where we are going to set up the  first Palestinian authority.    We are very aware of the significance of what we have  achieved. We have not achieved everything that we wanted, but  this is a step on the path of achieving what we want; a step  toward the establishment of a Palestinian state whose capital  will be Jerusalem. Some people see this as a long-term goal,  but we see it as a short term one; we know we are right.    Once again brother martyrs, I would like to say that the  promise that is between us will remain the same. We realize  that the road to Jerusalem is a difficult and long one, but we  will fly the flag of Palestine, the flag of the Arab nation, on  the walls, churches, and mosques of Jerusalem. [passage omitted]    While we bid farewell today to sisterly Tunisia that stood  by  us and hosted this Palestinian work, this revolution, and  leadership, we would like to express to our brother Zine el  Abidine, to his hospitable people, and wise government our  heartfelt thanks. We say to them we are in this path, the path  of the Arab nation. We, the Palestinian people, represent this  front, the Arab front on the sacred land, the first of the two  qiblahs and the third of the holy places. We are an integral  part of our Arab nation, we are an extension of this Arab land  and this nation. The Arab columns who today enter Gaza and  Jericho will tomorrow enter Nablus, Hebron, Tulkaram, Bethlehem,  Ramallah, and every Palestinian territory. We have a date  there, brothers.    The international resolution sought to undermine this  revolution and the PLO, however, this blessed intifadah managed  to put our people on the political map of the region. This  result firmly puts our people on the political and geographic  map, and consequently on the Middle East map. This baby  requires all of us to work for him and with him, so that this  baby will be able to grow and mature.    Once again, let met reiterate to you that our promise will  remain the same promise and the pledge the same pledge. Let us  stand together as one until the liberation of Jerusalem.</p>

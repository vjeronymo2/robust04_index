			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hattersley hints on top rate - Taxation LABOUR provided a further clue to its plans for a 50 per cent tax band yesterday when Mr Roy Hattersley, the deputy leader, said that people earning less than Pounds 36,000 a year would not have to pay the top rate. Mr Hattersley, speaking on LBC radio, said that people would be willing to pay more tax to finance higher pensions and child benefit. Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, has repeatedly said that an incoming Labour chancellor would need flexibility in drawing up his Budget plans, and has refused to be drawn on exactly where the 50 per cent band would apply. Labour has emphasised, however, that the top rate would affect only those earning 'well over Pounds 30,000'. Party officials said that Mr Hattersley's remarks were no more than an amplification of this line, and that he was giving merely indicative figures. His comments were seized on by the Tories as evidence of Labour confusion. Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, said: 'Roy Hattersley has shown once again that he does not trust John Smith to shape Labour's economic policy.' He added: 'The trouble for Labour's split and splinted economic team is that people will remember the lessons of history.'</p>

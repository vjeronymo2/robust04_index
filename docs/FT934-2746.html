			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Fashion: Niche brands spread their wings - Changes in the high street are leading specialist companies to diversify The fashion industry is in the throes of a brand revolution, as niche brands are 'going life-style'. Companies successful in a specialised area - such as knitwear - are diversifying into comprehensive clothing and accessory ranges in order to capitalise on the strength of their name. Pringle and Burberrys, known for their cashmere jerseys and raincoats respectively, have introduced ranges of men's and women's clothing and accessories. Dr Marten, famous for its boots, has branched out into men's casual wear. Designer Paul Smith, acclaimed internationally for his menswear, is now designing for children and is about to launch a women's collection. Andrew McRobb, Pringle marketing director, says the reasons for diversification are more complex than simply exploiting a name. 'We are responding to dramatic changes in the high street over the past few years,' he says. 'The growth of branded life-style chains such as Next has forced the demise of many specialist boutiques, which used to stock our merchandise. We must, therefore, produce a life-style offer aimed at department stores.' McRobb believes changes in department stores have also fuelled the movement. 'Stores used to have specific sections for knitwear, but now they have life-style sections, which include knitwear,' he says. 'They stock brands such as Cerruti and Escada which offer knitwear as part of a broader range. British brands have been traditionally slow to adapt to the evolving retail structure, and we have a lot of catching up to do.' When niche brands diversify they tend to make a bold statement to consumers by opening a flagship store displaying the full range. Pringle, for instance, has just opened one in London at 93 New Bond Street. And Levi Strauss customers have been made aware that it offers lots more than just jeans since the opening of its Original Levi's stores. The expanded Pringle collection emphasises casual wear: men's Fair Isle jerseys are combined with tartan shirts, polo shirts, washed cotton chinos or denim jeans. Alongside marine-inspired cotton knits for women can be found flowing floral dresses or more sophisticated cashmere/silk palazzo pants and tunics for the evening, and Celtic-inspired, hand-crafted jewellery. Wayne Hemingway, managing director of Dr Marten Clothing, says of his company's diversification: 'Dr Martens is one of the few icon brands in youth culture. Like Levi's, Wrangler, Timberland and Nike products, DM boots transcend fashion. The brand name is strong enough to carry a complete clothing range.' The clothing collection is aimed at style-conscious young men and is divided between the street-wise Dr Marten Useful Clothing range and the more mature Dr Marten Gents line. The latter is a witty combination of British work wear and the type of clothes worn by the gentry for sporting pursuits. It includes heavy leather despatch-rider coats, donkey jackets and tartan trousers, along with tough cavalry twill and washed corduroy, chunky jerseys, tank tops, and semi-formal shirts in exaggerated cotton Oxford. For next spring and summer, the range takes a nostalgic trip back to caravan holidays in Bognor in the 1950s with towelling tops, knitted waistcoats and cardigans and short trouser suits dominating. Dr Marten is opening a large clothing and footwear store next year in London's Covent Garden. The clothes are already stocked by Harrods and Selfridges in London, and Red or Dead stores in Leeds, Nottingham, Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow and London. Burberry is equally keen to draw attention to the width of its range which already embraces clothes for men, woman and children, luggage, food, scent, toiletries and, most recently, jewellery and evening wear. Thomas Burberry, the company's diffusion line launched last year, deliberately steers clear of rainwear and includes sweat shirts, bodies and leather jackets. Managing director Stanley Peacock says: 'Today, Burberry rainwear represents only 35 per cent of the business and the main growth areas are knitwear and accessories. The house check has become a signature used as a mark of identity linking a wide range of products.' Its men's clothing collection for this autumn and winter features navy pin-striped or grey Prince of Wales suits, Burberry check shirts, polka dot and paisley ties along with casual suede waistcoats, Ban sweaters and duffle coats. Paul Smith says he is introducing women's clothing, having observed how many women come into his shops to buy menswear either for their partners or for themselves. His collection captures the essence of the men's range with the emphasis on beautifully-cut suits and separates, quality fabrics, and details such as inside pockets, hand stitching, and vivid linings, normally the reserve of men's tailoring. The silhouette is slim, with long, four-button jackets and knee-length Epsom coats in natural linen, navy mohair, and quirky pistachio/damson plaids. Skirted jackets feature pronounced flap pockets and fishtail cuffs and come in orange, purple, red and navy silk dupion. Trousers are slim, as are shirts which have long collars and, often, Nottingham lace cuffs. Paul Smith is opening a shop for his women's wear early next year, alongside his menswear emporium in Floral Street, London. The collection will also be stocked nationally by leading department stores. It is not just clothing manufacturers who are diversifying in order to capitalise on their name. Jigsaw, the women's chain, has opened a men's clothing shop in Floral Street, with knitwear and a covetable black leather reefer coat, priced reasonably at Pounds 385, proving particularly popular. Browns, the designer retailer on London's South Molton Street, having acquired a reputation through stocking labels such as Romeo Gigli and Donna Karan, is basking in the reflected glory by launching its Browns' Own Label women's clothing collection. Both Jigsaw and Browns' Own Label fill a gap in the market between high-priced designer labels and affordable high street brands. While Italian, French and US fashion houses make fortunes out of everything from licensed scent to sunglasses to bath towels, UK brands are just beginning to wake up to the opportunity of a lifestyle.

A tribunal in the southern province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau  handed  down the sentence earlier this month following his arrest last  July, the exiled sources said.    The Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam based in the  Australian capital Canberra said in a statement received here  that another monk Thien Tho was sentenced to 18 months house  arrest.    Two other monks, Dong Hai and Dong Hy, were allowed to go  free but remain under police watch, it said.    No official in Hanoi could confirm the report.    "The hearing was held in secret on January 5 in an army  establishment," the statement from the exiles said. "The local  press were barred."    Vo Hanh Duc, 48, and abbot of Son Linh pagoda since 1983,  was  arrested last July for having "conducted activities against the  law" and "handing out documents hostile to the socialist  government of Vietnam," according to the charges.    The abbot began a hunger strike several weeks ago while in  prison and his health is deteriorating, the statement from the  exiles said.    According to Buddhist sources, about 100 monks and their  supporters were arrested during violent confrontations with  security forces on July 9 when a crowd challenged the eviction  of the abbot from his pagoda.    Most of those arrested were released recently, the sources  said.    In other incidents, of four monks accused of provoking  dissent last May in the central city of Hue, two were sentenced  to four years jail and the other pair to three years.    Five civilians classed as agitators for joining an  anti-government demonstration last May in Hue received sentences  ranging from six months to two years.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 14 Jun (EFE) -- The  Central American governments have agreed not to receive Haitian  refugees, as was requested by U.S. President Bill Clinton,  official Central American sources have told EFE.    The matter of the refugees was discussed by the chiefs of  state of the region who met yesterday in Costa Rica and later in  the Colombian city of Cartagena, where the Fourth Ibero-American  Summit is being held today and tomorrow.    Although they have not made an official announcement en  bloc,  they decided not to accept the refugees, not even temporarily,  sources from a Central American country who chose to remain  anonymous have told EFE.    Clinton asked the governments of the Central American  countries last month to accept the refugees fleeing the Haitian  crisis, while it was decided whether their cases could be  considered cases of economic or political emigration. If the  cases were political, they would be admitted into the United  States.    The request regarding the Haitian refugees was made directly  to the six Central American presidents last month when they met  in Tegucigalpa with U.S. Vice President Al Gore.    Several countries turned down the request because of  economic  or emigration problems in their respective countries. Others,  such as Costa Rica and El Salvador, said unenthusiastically that  they would consider the matter.    Honduras, which a couple of years ago gave asylum to a group  of Haitians and later had problems assimilating them, had said  beforehand that it could not receive any more refugees.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The  Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Mr. 'Ali Akbar  Nateq-Nuri and the deputies from Tehran, Khorramabad, Urmia, and  Khorramshahr gave preagenda speeches.    Then the Majles took up its agenda, and we direct the  attention of our esteemed readers to the detailed proceedings.  <H5>  'Abbas Shibani, Deputy From Tehran </H5>   The commands in the Koran and the speeches of the saints are  not merely sermons. We ourselves must first act.    The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles  session was Shibani, deputy from Tehran. During his speech he  said: Instead of a preagenda speech, I wanted to observe 10  minutes of silence. Perhaps this silence will be more expressive  than my inexpressive remarks. I have admired the president of  the republic for more than 35 years, and I have been obedient to  the leader since before the Islamic revolution.    Continuing, the speaker added: Before anything else, I  advise  myself to be pious, for that is needed now more than at any  other time. We are on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the  Imam's death. We were unable to recognize that unique  gentleman's concern for supporting Islam, the revolution, and  the deprived and oppressed people, and we did not act on his  advice in accordance with our duty to do so.    Continuing, Shibani said: Our old father, our Imam, and our  leader, said that the people are our benefactors, but  unfortunately our unsuitable performance has disappointed them  in us and our revolution. Wasn't it his eternal cry to the  people and especially to the officials, not to forget the  greatest jihad, which is struggle with the base self?    The deputy from Tehran said that if the Imam was able to  stand up against the superpowers, it was because he was master  of himself. He said: If we do not see this ability in ourselves,  it is because we are prisoners of our base selves.    Continuing, Shibani also added: Wasn't it Gandhi, the leader  of the Indian people, who stood up to the English imperialists  and said: I will wear my own handwoven burlap clothing, and I  will not submit to the humiliation of using foreign goods?    The speaker discussed the fact that we consider ourselves  Shiites and the nation of this Imam (peace be upon His Holiness  'Ali). He said: Now the latest machinery and various kinds of  foreign food and beverages are abundant in this land, and every  year our indebtedness to others increases.    Shibani discussed the fact that as the managers of the  Islamic government, we need first to develop ourselves. He said:  What I am saying is that we should not treat the commands in the  Koran and the speeches of the saints merely as sermons. We  ourselves must first act. My purpose in making the request I  made and am making of the president of the republic and that has  been approved by the leader that he hold morality classes for me  was that these matters be promoted so that the people will know  what has been said to us and to what extent we have acted upon  it.    Shibani added: Of course, I have a lifetime behind me and I  do not have that much hope of reforming myself. My hopes are in  the young generation and the Majles, so that we can review what  has happened and change our procedures and policies.    The speaker asked that more attention be given to the  reconstruction of Abadan and Khorramshahr. With regard to price  controls, he said: Without Majles approval, no sector in the  government or its companies has the right to increase prices,  and the judiciary must help with this matter. If someone says  this cannot be done, I say it can. Give me the authority and I  will do it myself. Nonessential expenditures must be avoided,  purchases must be made with care. There are many hospitals  throughout the country whose return is no more than 20 percent.  Instead of building new hospitals, let them equip these  hospitals so that they can better answer to the needs of the  people.    He discussed moral and cultural decadence. He said: You must  first think of bread before you can promote faith. Do not fear  satellites and antennas. You must train us in such a way that we  will not use videos, television, and harmful programming.    At the end of his speech, the speaker asked the minister of  cooperatives to try to consolidate consumer cooperatives in  order to provide the people with goods at lower prices.  <H5>  Akbar Farid, Deputy From Khorramabad </H5>   I recommend that officials investigate the results of  seminars, meetings, and guidelines without advance notification.    The next speaker was Farid, deputy from Khorramabad. In his  speech he offered condolences on the anniversary of the  martyrdom of the Iranian pilgrims to the House of God. With  reference to the geographic position of the province of  Lorestan, he said: This province, with all its characteristics,  which are known to all, is at the top of the national  deprivation table. Its deprivation is striking in all areas,  including roads, education, industry, and classroom space, and  the deprivation is more evident in the province's central  municipality than it is in the other municipalities.    He added: The city's main streets are in poor condition and  full of unemployed individuals, the old alleyways have not been  improved, the entry and exit routes have not been widened, and  due to their makeup these things show the deprivation all the  more.    The deprivation is such that its dimensions in this city  have  been confirmed by all the dear ones who have been in this city  and its environs. The deprivation in our city and province has a  historical precedent, which revolves around the commitment,  religious belief, honesty, and bravery of the people of this  region.    The deputy from Khorramabad then discussed the struggles of  the children of Lor. He said: After Reza Khan came to dominate  the Lorestan region with thousands of tricks, plots, and  deceptions, due to his fear of the children of Lor and the fact  that he did not want the battles of Lorestan to have a name in  the management system, with the help of his English bosses and  their theorists he converted the tribal and religious values in  Lorestan to antivalues, and turned the fate of the province of  Lorestan over to a thousand families outside the province on the  insulting grounds that the children of Lorestan are unable to be  responsible for their own affairs because of their tribal and  ethnic makeup.    He added: With the triumph of the Islamic revolution led by  His Holiness the Imam (peace be upon him), the palace of  oppression and despotism collapsed, the disgraceful ring of  idolatry was defeated and the talents of the children of Lor  flourished. A group found its way into the nation's universities  and graduated with high-specialist degrees in various sciences.  By order of the great Imam, a group also went to the war fronts  of truth against falsehood to defend the gains of the revolution  and the Islamic homeland.    He said that one of the factors in the success of a manager  is understanding the work setting and the surrounding  environment. He said: There are some schools of thought in  management that say we should leave the administrative center  and go to the cities, districts, and villages where special  disruptions and malfunctions are sensed in administrative  affairs, and this itself has weaknesses and vulnerabilities. In  the cities, this mostly takes the form of coordination between  the government and nongovernment offices.    He continued: Sometimes, to obtain a small loan, a  government  client goes from municipality to Tehran and back four or five  times on dangerous roads at heavy expense and is ultimately  faced with a rejection. Sometimes it is seen that an official is  improperly assigned to a task because of his relationship with a  deputy minister or a manager, without study or consideration of  the relation between job and worker. After a short time he does  things that not only cause him to be reprimanded, but also bring  others into question. This takes on a different dimension and  appearance under the influence of opportunists, whose numbers  are not small.    I recommend, to study and monitor the issues and to  alleviate  the existing problems and difficulties, that we make unannounced  and unofficial appearances at official gatherings, even wearing  disguises if possible, in order to pursue the guidelines and  results of their seminars and meetings and to see how they are  being implemented in the cities and villages and where the work  problems are.    Farid discussed the parliamentary aides. He said: One of the  duties of these dear ones is to convey the information and  logical requests of the deputies, which arise from the problems  of the people, to the ministers, deputy ministers and  organizations under the ministries. Some of the dear ones,  willingly or not, fall short in transferring information  intended to solve problems.  <H5>  Nosrat Samadzadeh, Deputy From Urmia </H5>   The third preagenda speaker was Samadzadeh, deputy from  Urmia. During his speech he said: The experts have regarded the  goal of economic adjustment and eliminating subsidies as being  to direct capital and currency in circulation into the producing  sectors and arriving at true prices. It was their belief that  after the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan current  capabilities and quality would increase, and that consequently  the prices of goods would drop.    He added: During the plan, with a study of the market we see  that the prices of goods and services increased by the day and  sometimes by the hour, disturbing the people.    The reasons are: (1) The lack of executive guarantees in the  policies of the plan and the lack of financial regulations in  the government, the government's failure to intervene in the  market for goods needed by the people, and the failure to  control prices. (2) The banking facilities given to the  government and private sector companies to invest were not spent  on the goal, the percentage of currency in circulation increased  and consequently the government, instead of guiding capital into  production and definite activity, created a thriving market for  gold and currency speculators and drove the nation's interests  out of the production sector into trade. (3) The economy was not  properly evaluated, and due to the unstable policy making in the  economy, part of the country's labor capability was wasted. The  Five-Year Plan must specify the productivity of investment.  Finally, the consumption model was not in accordance with  incomes. (4) More than 80 percent of the foreign exchange  revenues were obtained from oil exports, and because of the  conditions in world markets, the anticipated prices were not  implemented and likewise there was no specific procedure for  collecting taxes under the Five-Year Plan. (5) The lack of  public participation in setting priorities, especially in  national projects. Since the Islamic government is founded on  the commands of religion and the votes of the public, and His  Holiness the Imam gave special importance to public  participation and today the exalted leader also emphasizes this  important matter, therefore the people are the main ones setting  the policy for the nation's executive organizations. He added:  Unfortunately, the National Planning and Economic Policy Council  deals with statistics and numbers. (6) The First Five-Year Plan  only had the goal of growth. No attention was given to  investment procedures aimed at procuring social justice and  alleviating deprivation. In studying the Second Five-Year Plan,  in addition to goals, attention must be given to assessment of  the First Five-Year Plan and to the objections to it. In short,  policy making, planning, investing, and even managing must be  such that all the nation's high ability will be used, so we will  ultimately, in the near future, be able to follow the exalted  leader's guidance and get away from a one-product economy  dependent on oil, which is the only way of salvation in order to  reach true independence for the nation of the Islamic Republic.    The deputy from Urmia asked the president of the republic to  think about the measures necessary to deal with the rising  waters of Lake Urmia.    He continued: Due to the lack of agriculture and industry,  the province of West Azarbaijan is deprived of huge national  credits.    The speaker added: The Technical College and Urmia  University  as the only support for technical manpower training in the  region, must receive special attention in order to develop the  West Azarbaijan region. The current problems, such as equipping  laboratories and factories, must be solved.    In conclusion, the deputy from Urmia congratulated sports  officials on the province of West Azarbaijan volley ball team's  victory.  <H5>  Yunes Mohammadi, Deputy From Khorramshahr </H5>   During the last 14 years the Majles has passed good laws,  but  it has acted weakly in the area of oversight.    The final preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles  session was Mohammadi, deputy from Khorramshahr. During his  speech, in connection with 3 Khordad [24 May] he discussed the  anniversary of the liberation of Khorramshahr. He said:  Khorramshahr is not just a city, it is a model and a symbol. It  is a model of the power, greatness, and grandeur of the proud  Muslim nation of Iran. With the liberation of Khorramshahr the  enemies of Iran were politically and militarily demoralized.  Today also, in commemorating this great day, we are teaching the  lessons of moral heroism and courage to our children and we are  reminding our enemies of the noble nation of Iran's  steadfastness, sacrifice and courage. He discussed 7 Khordad [28  May], the anniversary of the establishment of the Majles, the  manifestation of the justice of 'Ali (peace be upon him). He  said: The Majles must act in such a way that it will realize the  desires and hopes of the late Imam, for the Imam said: "the  Majles is at the head of affairs."    He continued: The Majles is also a bird with two wings,  making laws and oversight. During the last 14 years the Majles  has passed good laws, but it has acted weakly in the area of  oversight. The Majles is the home of the nation and it must show  this nation's determination, steadfastness, and greatness.  Governments must always follow the Majles, and the Majles must  not allow individuals, willingly or unwillingly, to abstain from  acting on the law.    The speaker then discussed 14 Khordad [4 June], the  anniversary of the death of the great Imam. He said: We must all  keep the Imam's memory alive in our hearts forever. We must  protect with our good work this sacred government, which is his  trust, like a valuable trust. Recently the president of the  republic said that the policies of the enemies of the Islamic  Republic of Iran are to make the people of Iran lose hope and to  despair, and to keep them from continuing on their path.    The deputy from Khorramshahr then discussed the that fact  that pessimism and despair grow like a dangerous bacteria in a  place where it is possible for them to develop. He said: We must  destroy the circumstances and factors that cause pessimism to  grow. In my view the following factors create the possibility  for the growth of pessimism and despair:    (1) The nation's failure to recognize the government's  services;    (2) the nation's lack of awareness of the great problems  that  surround our government; and    (3) the nation's failure to understand the nation's revenue  situation.    He continued: Perhaps the people think the government has so  much financial capability that it can meet all their  expectations, but it is not this way. We have great problems  with regard to revenues and the people must become aware of  them.    (4) The failure to recognize the domestic and foreign  enemies  who act in various domestic and foreign dimensions, in various  ways and in various political, military, moral and economic  dimensions, and sometimes disguised as friends.    (5) The government's failure to deal decisively with the  enemies of the system.    In this regard, he added: Those who are damaging the system  in order to accumulate wealth and think only of their own  interests especially have created this market situation, and  moment by moment the prices of goods and services are going up  without any reason. This is causing severe suffering among the  people and has created circumstances to make the people  pessimistic.    Continuing, the speaker added: The people are saying that a  government that has stood up to America, the hypocrites, Saddam,  and tens of domestic and foreign enemies can also defeat these  economic enemies. The people want decisive government  supervision in the market. At the end of his speech the deputy  from Khorramshahr called for the alleviation of the economic  problems in his electoral district. He said: Bandar-e  Khorramshahr must be a protected port or it must be declared a  free trade zone so this city can prosper.  <H5>  Legislation </H5> <H5>  Majles Amends Law on Abortion Enacted by the Interests </H5> Discernment Council  <H5>  Amendment Approved for Motion To Establish Files for </H5> Registered Appeals Without a Record  <H5>  Motion To Establish Files for Registered Appeals Without a </H5> Record    The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles  session was the report from the Judicial and Legislative Affairs  Commission concerning the Motion To Establish Files for  Registered Appeals Without a Record or Whose Protests Have Been  Lost by the Judicial Authorities (returned from the Guardian  Council), and the above amendment was approved.    Article 1 as amended: As of the date of this law's  enactment,  with regard to appeals concerning the principle or boundaries of  property, which are sent to the relevant judicial authorities  under Articles 16 and 20 of the Registry Law by the end of the  year 1360 [20 March 1982] or which for any reason do not have an  appeals record with the judicial authorities, the appellants or  their legal representatives may, within no more than six months  after the date this law goes into force, submit their appeals  along with the necessary documents to the competent court. They  must obtain the necessary affidavit to this effect and submit it  to the registry office at the place where the property is  located. If they do not file during this period and if there is  no excuse justified under religious law, the appeal will be  considered rejected.  <H5>  Iran-Russia-Finland International Shipping Agreement </H5>   The second item on the agenda was the report from the  Housing  and Urban Construction Commission concerning the Bill on the  International Highway Shipping Agreement between the Government  of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Government of the  Federation of Russia (returned from the Guardian Council), for  which the commission's amendment was approved by the deputies.    Amendment to Article 13, Paragraph 3, on the last line: will  either be taken out of service under the supervision of the  appropriate customs officials (the meaning of "taken out of  service" is "turned away"), or will be given at no charge to the  customs officials of the aforementioned side.    The third item on the agenda was the report from the Housing  and Urban Construction Commission concerning the Bill on the  International Highway Shipping Agreement between the Government  of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Government of the  Republic of Finland (returned from the Guardian Council), which  was approved by the deputies.  <H5>  Bill on the Uniform Retirement Pensions System </H5>   The next item on the agenda was the report from the first  consultation of the Administrative and Employment Affairs  Commission concerning the Bill on the Uniform Retirement and  Obligatory Service Pensions System, the general form of which  was approved by a decisive majority of the deputies.    Rashidi, the commission's expert, said concerning this: The  basic issue was that the retirement wages were not appropriate  for the periods before and after service, and government  employees were truly disturbed by the arrival of the time for  retirement and even fled from it. The time they were to retire  was the time their children were entering the universities, the  time their children were getting married and other things, and  therefore the drop in their wages disrupted their lives.    He then added: The ceiling on retirement pensions is about  18,150 tumans, and those with academic credentials have specific  ceilings. Henceforth, however, retirees will receive pensions in  view of their years of service and their academic credentials.    Rashidi emphasized: Likewise, those who are already retired  will have their payment ceilings raised under this law.  <H5>  Law Amending Abortion Rules </H5>   The fifth item on the agenda was the report from the first  consultation of the Judicial and Legislative Affairs Commission  concerning the Motion To Amend Note 6 of the Abortion Rules  Amendment Law enacted 8/28/1371 [19 November 1992] by the  Interests Discernment Council, the general form of which was  approved.    The amendment to Note 6 states: "During a divorce requested  by the wife demanding compensation for work that was not her  responsibility under religious law, the court will first seek to  meet the wife's demands through reconciliation, and if  reconciliation fails, if conditions are set on financial matters  in the marriage contract or the contract for dissolution, the  court will act in accordance with that. Otherwise, whenever the  divorce is requested by the wife and also if the request for the  divorce does not arise from the wife's violation of her duties  as a spouse or her bad morality and behavior, the court will act  as follows:    A) If the wife has done tasks that were not her  responsibility under religious law at the husband's order or  without the intention of the work being voluntary, and if this  is proven to the court, the court will calculate the equivalent  value and order its payment before issuing the divorce decree.    B) In cases other than the one in Paragraph A, in view of  the  number of years of communal life and the types of jobs the wife  has done in the husband's home and the husband's financial  situation, the court will designate for the wife a sum as a  forgiveness (evacuation) amount for the wife. It is worth  mentioning that Paragraph A was added in the measure enacted by  the Interests Discernment Council, and in the Majles motion the  vote was taken after that paragraph was amended and Paragraph B  was added.    It is worth mentioning that Mr. Mohammad 'Ali  Movahedi-Kermani said in a constitutional memorandum: If the  Majles wants to enact a motion or a bill, it must be within the  limits of religious law and the Constitution. Enactments by the  Interests Discernment Council is above this. This means that the  Interests Discernment Council may approve a measure based on  interests and it may even be outside the bounds of religious law  and the Constitution. Can the Majles change a measure enacted by  the Interests Discernment Council? This issue was studied in the  Interests Discernment Council, and the gentlemen in the Guardian  Council specified precisely that the Majles may not make this  change.    Mr. Nateq-Nuri said in answer: This issue you are raising  was  discussed in the Interests Discernment Council, and no measure  was adopted with regard to it. We also believe that the  gentlemen in the Guardian Council must ultimately issue an  opinion.    Then Mr. Shibani gave a speech. He said: Our poor  performance  has disappointed the people in the us and the revolution. Then  the speaker of the Majles, Mr. Nateq-Nuri, said: Of course,  whenever Mr. Shibani speaks, he is clearly either concerned,  passionate or sincere, but sometimes his language is harsh, and  that is also sincere. He should modify his comment that the  people are all disappointed now. He himself does not even  believe that the people have become disappointed in this way, he  is just saying that they should be more careful.  <H5>  Measures by Majles Commissions </H5> <H5>  Amendment to Bill on Independence of Judicial Attorney's </H5> Society    Paragraph "J" of the aforementioned article is amended as  follows: In addition to being members for one term in the  Judicial and Legislative Affairs Commission, Majles deputies  must have a judicial bachelor's degree or at least four years  experience teaching specialist classes in the law colleges or a  certificate of completion of high-level studies from the Qom  Seminary or five years judicial trial experience. Continuing  below is Note 2, under which the society is required within six  months to make a decision about requesting a certificate of  on-the-job training or parliamentary membership.  <H5>  Bill on Organizations, Duties, and Elections in the National </H5> Islamic Councils and Mayoral Elections    Article 5 of this bill states: A council will be formed in  each village with a majority of its members chosen from among  the chosen representatives of the councils of the rural areas  within the village limits, and if a member presented by the  rural council for full membership is elected for membership in  the village council, he will not cease to be a member of the  rural council. This bill was approved in the National Councils  and Domestic Affairs Commission with five sections and 103  articles.  <H5>  Bill To Add Iran to the Agreement Between Member Nations of </H5> the Islamic Conference Organization To Support Guaranteed  Investments    Based on Article 2, Section 2 of this bill, the parties to  the agreement will authorize in accordance with their own laws  the transfer of capital and its use among the countries and  within their own domains in authorized areas of activity. The  investments made must have sufficient support and security and  the host country must provide the necessary facilities and  incentives for the investors actively working in its territory.    The aforementioned bill was approved in the Joint Economic  and Financial Affairs and Cooperatives Commission.</p>

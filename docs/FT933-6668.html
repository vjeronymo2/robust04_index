			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: WH Smith WH Smith's careful excision of Do It All from the breakdown of its figures almost implies that it does not own the business. Perhaps Smith wishes it didn't. The red ink at Do It All flowed as freely as expected, yet Smith's timid roll out of its new trading format and coyness over its impact hardly add to confidence. Nor is it a persuasive excuse that some stores are badly located. If the company cannot find another 50 of its 220 sites which would benefit from treatment, the portfolio is a rag bag indeed. In truth, Smith's strategy for Do It All is a mixture of shutting the very worst stores, spending the minimum on the few certain to benefit and whistling to keep its spirits up. How long partner Boots will be prepared to indulge this is an interesting question. Smith is trying to muddle through, while hoping for a strong housing upturn, because the alternatives of closing Do It All or heavy investment are simply too costly. Boots has the cash flow and balance sheet to take the strain. Smith, by contrast, would have seen a rise in borrowings this year had not freakishly strong sales in the last month distorted the figures. It is not as though prospects are particularly rosy elsewhere. Getting Waterstone's to an acceptable return on capital will be a protracted process, Virgin Megastores are proving that Our Price sites are simply too small, and the company's improbably low tax charge cannot last forever. Since the core businesses will also struggle to sparkle, the company must long for the days when it had surplus profits to squander on its adventures.</p>

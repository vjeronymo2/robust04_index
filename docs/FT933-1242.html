			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drug stocks steady The much heralded presentation by President Clinton on the proposed health care reforms proved something of a diluted cocktail, and the relevant UK stocks traded sideways after an initial marketmaker-inspired lift at the start of trading. Most analysts had seen the full text of the proposals at least a week ago and most investors with an interest in the area had read leaked US press reports. Both the text and the reports contained more detail than the President provided. Specialists said companies would have to provide 15 per cent discounts to Medicare, the state programme for the elderly which accounts for a third of US sales, but this would in part be compensated by increased turnover. Mr Nigel Barnes of Hoare Govett said Glaxo could be expected to lose 4 per cent of US turnover but he had already factored in a 2 per cent fall. Glaxo was steady at 642p but Wellcome was hit, its shares slipping 9 to 709p ahead of a conference on Sunday at which SmithKline Beecham may produce comparative data on a rival herpes drug to Wellcome's Zovirax. SmithKline is due to announce details of the first head-to-head trial of its herpes treatment at a meeting in Copenhagen. SmithKline 'A' shares eased to end the day 4 lower at 421p. Tobacco and insurance group BAT Industries rebounded 10 to 472p after President Clinton made no reference to a tax on alcohol and cigarettes in his health care speech. However, Rothmans International, which is also overshadowed by worries that it might lose its Footsie status, shed 4 to 645p.</p>

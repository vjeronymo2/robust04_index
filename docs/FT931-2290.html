			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Tax cut will hit your income - Dividends / The Budget and You IT MAY SEEM confusing that a cut in the tax rate on dividends is bad news for private investors. But it is. Both non-taxpayers and higher rate taxpayers look set to suffer a cut in dividend income of about 6.25 per cent as a result of the change. Someone who previously had net dividend income of Pounds 10,000 will see that fall to Pounds 9,375. However, there is some good news. Basic rate taxpayers will be unaffected. And corporate dividend policy may change to cushion shareholders from part of their loss, although this will be difficult in the light of low dividend cover ratios. The change is complicated in effect because companies do not pay a 'gross dividend' - they pay a net dividend and a further payment (the equivalent of basic rate tax) to the Inland Revenue. This is a downpayment on the company's tax bill, hence the name Advance Corporation Tax. It is a convenient way for the government to use the corporate sector as a tax collector. Under the old system, if the company declared a net dividend of 7.5p, the investor would receive the dividend payment, together with a tax credit of 2.5p. (see table) Non-taxpayers (such as pension funds) could use the tax credit to reclaim the tax paid from the Inland Revenue. In effect, they received a gross dividend of 10p. Basic rate taxpayers needed to do nothing; the net dividend reflected the impact of 25 per cent tax. They thus had no further tax liability, nor any ability to reclaim tax. Higher rate taxpayers were assessed as having received a gross dividend of 10p. At the 40 per cent rate, they were liable to pay 4p in tax. Thus in addition to the 2.5p already deducted, they had to pay an additional 1.5p, leaving them with 6p. Under the new system, the tax rate on dividends is 20 per cent. If companies pay the same net dividend of 7.5p, non-taxpayers will get a tax credit of just 1.875p. This makes the gross dividend 9.375p (9.375p, less 20 per cent, is 7.5p). The effect is to cut gross dividends by 6.25 per cent (from 10p to 9.375p), hitting pension funds and Pep holders. Basic rate taxpayers will still get the net dividend of 7.5p and will face no further charge. So the effect on them is neutral. But higher rate taxpayers will face an additional charge - the difference between 20 per cent and 40 per cent tax. So instead of a further 1.5p payment (under the old system), they will have to pay 1.875p (20 per cent of 9.375p). Their net income will be 5.625p, instead of 6p under the old system, a decline of 6.25 per cent. This may cause some investors to increase that part of their portfolios they hold in bonds, rather than in equities. This may have been part of the chancellor's intention since he has a lot of gilts to sell. However, there may be some unintended consequences of the chancellor's move. The income shares of split capital investment trusts became less attractive after the change. As Nigel Sidebottom, associate director of brokers Gerrard Vivian Gray, points out: 'Split level income shares - particularly those with very high flat yields and annuity characteristics - provide virtually all their return to shareholders in the form of income. Pension funds holding these shares will as a result suffer significant reduction in returns. 'The gross redemption yield will in some cases fall by over 2 per cent as a result of the change' adds Sidebottom.' The market reacted quickly to the change with most income shares being marked 2 to 3 per cent lower first thing on the morning after the Budget.' The full implications of the change may take some time to appear, as companies review their dividend policy. But there are two consequences: equities have become slightly less appealing; and within the field of equity investment, capital gain has become more attractive, relative to income.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACT ON DIVIDENDS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                      Old          New                                   system       system  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Notional gross dividend              10p       9.375p Return to Pep holders                10p       9.375p Tax credit                          2.5p       1.875p Net dividend                        7.5p         7.5p Return to basic rate tax payer      7.5p         7.5p Higher rate tax                     1.5p       1.875p Return to higher rate taxpayer      6.0p       5.625p  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

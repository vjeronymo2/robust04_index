			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Mexico sells final stake in Telmex The Mexican government has sold its final stake in Telefonos de Mexico, the national telephone utility, in a convertible offering worth up to Dollars 550m. The offering brings to an end the privatisation of Telmex, the largest public company sold by a developing country. The privatisation began at the end of 1990 when the government sold a controlling 20.4 per cent stake for Dollars 1.76bn. It continued with a series of big equity offerings in international and domestic markets. The most recent Bank of Mexico annual report indicated the government had obtained Dollars 6.18bn from previous offerings of Telmex equity. The convertible would bring the total sale to around Dollars 6.73bn. The government sold peso bonds convertible into Telmex equity 90 days after the issue. They can be redeemed by the government between the third and fourth year. The peso interest rate is 11.25 per cent, and conversion price is 15 per cent over the current share price of Telmex. In spite of the volatility in Mexico's financial markets, the offering sold relatively well, according to one participant. In part, this was because an 11.25 per cent peso interest rate is considered relatively generous, as is the 15 per cent conversion premium. Mr Guillermo Ortiz, the deputy finance minister, said the Dollars 550m obtained from the convertible offering would be placed in the government's special contingency fund. In the past, money from the contingency fund has been used to retire public debt. The additional resources now available to the government may help calm investors nervous about the political and economic situation in the run-up to the August election.</p>

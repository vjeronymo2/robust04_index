			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Piotr Adamowicz: "`S' Appeals to Lech Walesa"] </F>   [Text] The Presidium of the National Commission [KK] of  "Solidarity" ["S"], which held a session on 14 June in Gdansk,  appealed to Lech Walesa not to sign the new law on neopopiwek  [the enterprise tax on above-normative pay]. Discussed was also  the behavior of "S" Parliamentary Club Head Zbigniew  Romaszewski, who supported the competition's candidate in  supplementary elections to the Senate.    The unionists believe that the president should officially  ask the Constitutional Tribunal whether the neopopiwek law is in  accordance with the Constitution. They recall that "S" demands  that the administrative control of wages be abandoned. Wages  should be regulated through collective agreements; we are  worried by the president's statements; he says that he is  prepared to sign the neopopiwek law, due to the strikes and wage  demands. The economic results of the last two months prove that  despite the fact that there was no neopopiwek, inflation did not  increase, said "S" Spokesman Piotr Zak.    "S," which did not submit its own lists of candidates,  appealed to its members to take part in the 19 June  self-government elections. "Unionists should back their  colleagues or lists of oppositional groupings," Zak explained.    It was recalled that the only "S" candidate in the  supplementary elections to the Senate in the Elblag Voivodship  is Waclaw Bielecki. The teacher from Sztum was also supported by  seven opposition parties, from the Union of Freedom to the  Center Accord and the Movement for the Republic. In the  meantime, Senator Zbigniew Romaszewski, head of the "S"  Parliamentary Club, became involved in the election campaign of  a competitor -- Edmund Krasowski of Gdansk, who currently does  not belong to any party. Romaszewski's behavior encountered  protests from almost 30 plant commissions.    "I would like to recall that the National Commission fielded  Waclaw Bielecki. The involvement of an "S" senator in the  campaign of another candidate is a violation of the union's  procedures." Romaszewski was reprimanded by KK Deputy Chairman  Leszek Szwec last week. Although he was asked to withdraw his  support, Romaszewski took part in the campaign of a competitor.  The unionists criticized the Sejm for amending the law on the  protection of conceived life.</p>

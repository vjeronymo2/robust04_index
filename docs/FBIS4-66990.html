			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["People Behind the News" column by Mai Muangkrung] </F>   [Text] "Do you know that today, the world refers to  Thailand as `Thai Switzerland?'" said Khanin Bunsuwan, a  Solidarity Party MP [member of parliament] from Chonburi  Province, to a reporter the other day. He also said that "the  reason why they call us that is that banks in Thailand accept  deposits freely with no questions asked. Thus, money is flowing  into the banks from all corners of the world and from within the  country. Some of this money may come from illegal activities  such as heroin, marijuana, and cocaine trafficking, trafficking  in war weapons, activities carried on by international gangs,  corruption, numbers rackets, embezzlement, fraud, and smuggling.  Even though this money comes from illegal activities, once it  enters the banking system, it becomes `clean money.' It has in  effect been `laundered.' In the end, that money will be used to  buy land, build hotels, buy stock shares, build huge  entertainment establishments, or invest in major business  activities. The result is that those people become millionaires.  Wherever they go, people praise them. They engage in  merit-making activities as a front or donate huge sums of  money," said Mr. Khanin.    "If we know that people are laundering money like this, why  hasn't something been done about this?" asked the reporter?    The MP from Chonburi took a deep breath before replying.  "It's because our banks do not impose any conditions on making  deposits or transferring money into an account. And they have  never had to check to see where that money comes from. Instead,  they view money like a god. The more the better. In effect, they  are helping to promote the illegal activities of those people.  Because regardless of how tainted the money is, it can be  laundered in a second," said MP Khanin.    He then talked about what other countries are doing about  this problem. "In other countries, they conduct an investigation  if large sums of money are deposited or if there are unusual  deposits. If it cannot be proven that the money was earned  legally, the money is seized. They have laws to control the  laundering of money obtained illegally. But Thailand still  doesn't have such a law. I think that the ministries of finance  and interior should push for the promulgation of such a law. We  must take quick action on this. Otherwise, Thailand will become  the money-laundering center of the world," said MP Khanin about  what will happen.    Yes, if we continue to ignore this, some people may think  that the government itself is laundering money.</p>

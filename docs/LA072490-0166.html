			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> 'SAFETY NET' FOR DEFENSE WORKERS  </P> <P> Connecticut's two senators today announced legislation to provide a "safety  net" for workers expected to be laid off in the defense industry and direction  for integrating defense businesses into the civilian sector.  </P> <P> The measure, one of several introduced in Congress aiming to assist workers  soon to be displaced as a result of defense cutbacks, would use 10% of the  so-called peace dividend of defense cutbacks, or about $1 billion, to fund a  package of severance and health benefits for laid-off workers and create a  federal council to coordinate assistance to the workers.  </P> <P> The plan, scheduled to operate for seven years, was announced at a news  conference by Sens. Joseph Lieberman and Christopher Dodd, both Democrats.  </P></p>

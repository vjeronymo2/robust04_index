			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Hartwell cash bid values Trimoco at Pounds 25.9m HARTWELL is making a mandatory cash offer for Trimoco following the conversion of its holding of 11.5 per cent convertible unsecured loan stock. Its offer of 17.5p per share and Pounds 175 per Pounds 100 nominal of the outstanding culs values Trimoco, the Dunstable-based motor dealer, at Pounds 25.9m. The announcement was made after the close of the market on which Trimoco's shares had closed unchanged at 17 1/2 p. Hartwell, a motor trader ultimately owned by a discretionary trust set up by Mr Abdul Jameel, believes Trimoco's prospects would be enhanced if it won control. Before yesterday Hartwell, and persons acting in concert with it, held a share stake of 29.8 per cent and 92.1 per cent of the culs. The conversion into shares raised the holding to 39.4 per cent of the enlarged capital requiring a bid to be made under the takeover code at a price set by the code. The Jameel activities have been raising their holding in Trimoco over the last year. In December last year Mr John Wei, Hartwell chief executive and Mr Mahmoud Abdulla, a senior Hartwell executive joined the Trimoco board, which said at the time that it intended to work closely with the Jameel organisation on future development.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 22 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb forces  trapped a UN convoy Friday [22 April] when it began retreating  to Sarajevo after failing to reach the besieged Moslem enclave  of Gorazde, UNPROFOR spokesman Richard Pernod told AFP. The  convoy, made up of some 100 French, British and Ukrainian  peacekeepers from the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR], was on its  way to relieve Gorazde when it received orders to head back to  Sarajevo but Serb forces stepped in and have stopped its  retreat, he said.</p>

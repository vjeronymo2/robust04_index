			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Carmen Calderon de Escalon (the president's  sister) has received a death threat. Gloria Salguero Gross, the  president of the National Legislative Assembly, reported this  yesterday.    The official said that the deputy, who lives in Santa Ana,  received the threat on Wednesday in an anonymous telephone call,  taken at the headquarters of the Nationalist Republican Alliance  (ARENA) in that western city. They said they "were going to  kill her along the Santa Ana-San Salvador highway." Miss  Salguero credited the threats to "sick minds." Deputy Calderon  de Escalon, sister of President Armando Calderon Sol, is  currently the secretary on the Assembly Board of Directors and  an ARENA leader. She also chairs the Assembly Treasury  Committee and a Special Budget Commission.    A commission, which was appointed by the Assembly Board of  Directors, is studying security for the legislative building and  its deputies. There are 84 deputies in all and to provide  security for all of them would require a special budget  appropriation.    Salguero Gross, during the first news conference she has  given as assembly president, also reported that President  Calderon Sol will appear at today's plenary session to formally  present his first request for permission to leave the country.  Unofficial sources said the president will travel to Costa Rica  and Puerto Rico. The assembly president indicated that he will  be given a special one-year permit to travel anywhere in Latin  America.    Meanwhile, the official announced that members of the media  will be required to carry a special "card" to gain access to the  assembly installations. In her opinion, this is organization.  For others it is limiting the freedom of press.    In addressing the "self-investigation" the deputies are  supposed to complete on themselves on the excessive cost of the  remodeling and repair work done at the legislative buildings,  Salguero Gross reported that an external audit will determine  whether there was mismanagement or not. Deputies of the new  Technical Committee (charged with overseeing the construction  work at the building) agreed to request an independent audit to  determine if the construction of wooden dividers really costs  4.2 million colones. A member of this committee reported  yesterday that before this the committee will investigate the  name and background of the contractors involved in the project,  including the air conditioning supplier.    [San Salvador DIARIO LATINO in Spanish on 9 June carries a  375-word report on page 24, with reactions by the UN Observers  for El Salvador, ONUSAL. ONUSAL Chief Enrique Ter Horst said  that "the threats should not be taken more seriously than what  they really are." He explains that "they are anonymous so  anyone can make them." "We have no way of knowing," Ter Horst  continued, "whether the threats were made by death squads or by  some impulsive individual wanting to have some fun creating  instability." Diego Garcia Sayan, chief of the ONUSAL Human  Rights Division, said that the special ONUSAL investigation  group will look into the incidents.]</p>

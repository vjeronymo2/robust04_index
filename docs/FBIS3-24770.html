"Today Africa stands at the door of total  political liberation as apartheid is about to be relegated to  the ignominy of history", the organisation's secretary general,  Salim Ahmed Salim said.    Addressing the 59th session of the OAU Council of Ministers  which began in Addis Ababa Monday, Salim said at a time when  South Africa was undergoing fundamental transformation, Africa  which had invested so much energy and resources in support of  the liberation movements must make its presence felt in that  country.    He told the foreign ministers that Africa had a  responsibility to South Africa and must sustain interest and  keep the momentum of support to the on-going process in order to  accomplish the objectives it set for itself in the country.    "Today, when we are walking the final mile and we are about  to see the results of years of struggle and sacrifice, we owe it  to ourselves and the people of South Africa not to relax our  vigilance or allow our enthusiasm to diminish", he said. The  end of apartheid, Salim stressed, marked not only the closing of  one of the saddest chapters in the history of Africa, but also  the beginning of a new challenge of economic cooperation in the  southern African sub- region and Africa as a whole. "We now need  to see how the immense potential which exists in South Africa in  terms of capital, resources and know-how, can interface with  those found in the rest of the continent, to forge an economic  partnership which can propel the continent to new heights of  growth and development". Salim said for Africa to successfully  monitor the forth-coming South Africa elections, "we need to be  there, in good time and in sufficient numbers, to support the  process and to encourage our brothers and sisters". He said  that concerted action on the part of African countries would  make a difference similar to the success they achieved during  the Namibian election. Africa must give some material  assistance to the liberation movements to enable them compete  against a government "endowed with almost unlimited resources  and the advantage of incumbency", he added. The OAU scribe  urged African states to urgently contribute to the election fund  established at the OAU summit in Cairo in 1993 to support the  liberation movements.</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Insurance gain keeps Gaskell in black Only an exceptional credit kept Gaskell, the carpet manufacturer, in profit over the six months ended July 2. It made Pounds 393,000, against Pounds 15,000. Mr Edward Andrew, chairman, said price cuts had to be made to defend the market share, and that was successful in that turnover rose by 6 per cent over the preceding half year. However, the pressure on margins led to a turnround from an operating profit of Pounds 286,000 to a loss of Pounds 369,000. The exceptional profit was Pounds 913,000, realised on fixed assets destroyed by fire. The proceeds will enable the group to bring forward an important item of capital investment in a second non-woven production line. On the future, Mr Andrew said the market was slowly recovering and the order books were beginning to increase for the first time since 1991. Half year turnover was Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 15m). Earnings per share came to 5.2p (0.2p)and the interim dividend is again 1.5p.</p>

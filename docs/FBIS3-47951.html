Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren), said it was "highly regrettable" that  the four political reform bills were killed.    Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and  Industry, called the failure a dark day for Japan and one that  could further dampen the slumping economy.    Inaba also expressed concern that the setback for political  reform could slow economic deregulation that had been promoted  by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's administration.    Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of  Corporate  Executives (Keizai Doyukai), said a joint committee of both  chambers of the Diet should compromise so that the package is  enacted.    Takeshi Nagano, president of the Federation of Employers  Associations (Nikkeiren), said failure to enact the package  could heighten public distrust of politics and damage Japan's  image overseas.</p>

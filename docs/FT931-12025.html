			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Paris wants EC probe into Hoover FRANCE is to ask the European Commission to investigate whether Hoover may be breaking European Community law in apparently using pension fund money to invest in a Scottish plant which is drawing jobs away from France. The domestic appliance group denies breaking any EC rules. Hoover's announcement this week that it was closing its vacuum cleaner factory in the Dijon region, and switching production to Cambuslang near Glasgow has caused a political storm in France, where the Socialist government faces record unemployment two months away from a general election. Mrs Elisabeth Guigou, France's EC affairs minister, said yesterday a key factor in Hoover's decision appeared to be the company's ability to put pension fund money into the expansion of its Cambuslang plant. If this was true, she said it would be contrary to a 1980 EC directive. This directive, a French official said, is designed to protect workers in the event of their companies going bankrupt. It includes provisions to 'prevent pension funds being taken hostage' by companies, he said. 'If one day Hoover were to go bankrupt, then this pension fund money might disappear.' Hoover said last night that it had reached agreement with its British workforce on the future of the company's UK pension fund. This is Pounds 28m in surplus. Under the proposed deal with the workforce the surplus would be reallocated. Hoover said the pension fund agreement had not yet been approved by the Inland Revenue but would involve dividing up the surplus. He said 53 per cent would be returned to the workers in improved benefits, 19 per cent would go to the Inland Revenue, and 28 per cent recovered by the company. Reallocating company pension fund surpluses is lawful in Britain and Hoover does not believe it breaches EC rules. Concessions made by Scottish workers to woo the Hoover investment have angered French trade unions. They accuse Britain, which refused to accept the full social provisions of the Maastricht treaty, of allowing 'social dumping'. This refers to undercutting labour standards to attract foreign investment. The French government has instructed its EC ambassador to ask the Commission to inquire into possible 'distortion of competition' in the EC single market, as a result of Scottish Office aid to Hoover.</p>

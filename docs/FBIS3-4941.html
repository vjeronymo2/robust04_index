The puppet army's large-caliber artillery group, moved and  deployed in Yulli-ri and Waechon-ri, Chorwon-up, Chorwon County,  Kangwon Province, South Korea, showered tens of shells on the  area near the DMZ that day. The puppet army's armed rascals  occupied battle positions in Sogong-ri, Paju County, Kyonggi  Province and Korangpo-ri, Yonchon County and created a stir by  firing at random as many as some 2,000 shells of large-caliber  machine guns and automatic rifles, while advancing toward the  Military Demarcation Line [MDL].    On the same day, the South Korean puppets openly and in  broad  daylight moved and deployed some 10 armored cars and many armed  rascals near the DMZ in the north of Kajon-ri, Inje County,  Kangwon Province, South Korea. They also mobilized hundreds of  armed rascals to Chungse-ri, Chorwon-up, Chorwon County, Kangwon  Province, South Korea, and were immersed in a war frenzy  [chonjaeng kwanggirul puryossumnida].    Meanwhile, the puppet army's fighter-bombers flew in  formations in the skies above Changsin-ri and Haesang-ri, Kosong  County, Kangwon Province, South Korea and were frenzied in  ground striking aimed at the northern half of the Republic.  Armed helicopters and transportation helicopters moved out in  formations in the skies above Yonchon, Paju, and Hwachon and  were frenzied in ground-attack supporting and air-borne  operations exercises, flying at low and very low altitudes.    This worthless fire game [mumohan pulchangnan sodong] shows  even more clearly the South Korean puppets' bellicose nature  [hojongjok chongche].</p>

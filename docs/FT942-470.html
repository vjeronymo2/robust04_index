			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Six London radio licences attract 41 bids The Radio Authority yesterday received 41 applications for six London radio licences including 12 applications to provide an adult contemporary music service - aimed at an audience aged between 25 and 50. The groups fighting for the right to fill what they see as the big remaining gap in the London commercial radio market - playing music such as Elton John, Fleetwood Mac and Simply Red - include: Chrysalis, the music and entertainment group; televiTrans World Communications, the radio group; Metro, the Newcastle commercial radio station that is trying to break into the London market; Emap, the magazine and radio group; and Energy London, a consortium led by the French commercial radio group NRJ. Mr Richard Eyre, managing director of Capital Radio, which yesterday reapplied for its two London licences, warned that launching an adult contemporary service would tend to cannibalise Capital's audience and advertising revenues without offering the maximum possible diversity. The Radio Authority is required to seek applicants who offer the maximum possible choice for the 6.2m to 7.3m adults expected to be covered by the new licences. In addition to the two licences that are expected to be retained by Capital, two new FM and two new AM licences are on offer. Mr Richard Branson, who runs Virgin 1215, the national AM commercial station, and who previously failed to win a better quality FM national licence, is trying again in London. Virgin Radio has applied for an FM licence to broadcast 'existing Virgin 1215 rock-orientated music output with speech content specific to London'. Apart from adult contemporary and other popular music there are applications for classic and album rock, alternative, and soft music services, as well as for two arts services. Art FM is promising a mixture of entertainment and arts coverage with non-pop music while Festival Radio is offering independent music, comedy, arts, interviews and listings. A number of formats that failed to win a licence last time are trying again. These include London's Business radio, London Christian Radio and Viva - speech and music in a magazine format aimed at women listeners. There are also two competing sports services, a range of ethnic and international broadcasting aimed at Arabic-speaking and Pakistani listeners plus Radio France Internationale and a service for parents of pre-school children. The intense interest in the new licences is a further sign of the growing attractiveness of commercial radio. Last year revenue in the sector grew by 26 per cent to Pounds 178.5m. This was because of the higher profile generated by the new national stations and the better selling of radio advertising, which added up to a record 3.4 per cent of all advertising. Some analysts now believe a 5 per cent share for radio is possible. The Radio Authority will decide which of the 41 applicants will get licences by this autumn.</p>

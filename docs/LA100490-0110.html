			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: MORE EATERIES:  </P> <P> Watson's Drug &amp; Soda Fountain, 116 E. Chapman Ave., Orange. Open Mondays  through Fridays 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Saturdays 5:30 p.m. to 4 p.m. (714)  532-6315.  </P> <P> This diner/drugstore in the heart of Old Towne Orange is a real throwback.  True, the bobby-soxers are gone and the drugstore no longer fills prescriptions  for whiskey, but the malts still come thick, rich and big enough to share, and  meals are the kind Mom might've made.

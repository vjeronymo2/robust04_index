			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by N. A. Bagrov, Hydrometeorological Scientific </F> Research Center; UDC 551.513.001.572:551.583]    [Abstract] Linearization of the heat balance equation for  the climatic system leads to the linear differential equation  for the dependence of system temperature on CO[.sup]2[/], the  main substance absorbing longwave radiation. Estimates of  equation parameters make it possible to find simple connections  between temperature and CO[.sup]2[/] content in the  atmosphere. Attempts are made to predict the heat pattern for  the next few decades. References 10 (Russian).</p>

Andrey Kozyrev declared that Russia supports the  normalization of relations between countries in global terms,  and advocates the development of democratic processes and  progressive economic reforms, particularly in Cuba. He pointed  out: We consider that the reestablishment of diplomatic  relations between Colombia and Cuba will help consolidate  democracy and stability on the South American Continent. At the  same time, our position is that all relics of the "Cold War"  must be eradicated throughout the world. We oppose all  manifestations of extremism, which has an ideological basis, and  we are in favor of consistent political solutions to existing  differences of opinion.    The Colombian minister gave a positive assessment of  Russia's  position and declared that her country would welcome the Russian  Federation to the Nonaligned Movement, where its voice would  play an important role in strengthening peace throughout the  world and eliminating ideological confrontation.</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: N Sea Assets boosts profit to Pounds 1.95m North Sea Assets, the energy industry services supplier, reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 1.33m, after losses on asset sales of Pounds 478,000, to Pounds 1.95m. The result was also helped by lower net interest charges of Pounds 468,000, against Pounds 656,000. Turnover was Pounds 29.3m, against Pounds 23m, which included Pounds 1.44m from discontinued activities. Continuing activities showed a 36 per cent improvement but this was not translated into a similar increase in profits because of cost over-runs on certain projects. Acquisitions and capital investment totalled Pounds 5.8m, but year-end debt only rose from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 5m for gearing of 53 per cent (25 per cent). Earnings were 2.76p (2.08p). The dividend is 1.1p (1p).</p>

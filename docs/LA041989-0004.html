			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SDG&amp;E SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE MERGER PLAN  </P> <P> San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. shareholders Tuesday endorsed a $2.4-billion  stock swap that would blend the utility into Southern California Edison and  create the nation's largest gas and electric utility.  </P> <P> SDG&amp;E officials said that, among shares that were voted, the proposed  merger drew support from at least half of the utility's common stockholders and  two-thirds of its preferred and preference shareholders.  </P> <P> Shareholders of SCEcorp, Edison's Rosemead-based parent company, are expected  to approve the merger during a meeting Thursday. The merger also must be  approved by various regulatory agencies, including the California Public  Utilities Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adjournment Feared  </P> <P> Tuesday's annual shareholders meeting generated some tense moments for  SDG&amp;E executives because votes were still being tabulated as the 11 a.m.  meeting opened. Chairman Tom Page began the session by warning the nearly 900  shareholders in attendance that the slow-moving vote count might force an  adjournment.  </P> <P> Shortly after 1 p.m., however, executives announced that the merger had been  approved by margins required in the corporation's bylaws. Official results will  be made public this afternoon, according to Jennifer Lewis, SDG&amp;E's manager  of investor relations.  </P> <P> The vote count was delayed because a New York-based proxy solicitation company  was slow to forward proxies to SDG&amp;E, Lewis said.  </P> <P> By coincidence, Tuesday's shareholder vote to fold SDG&amp;E into the much  larger Edison came on SDG&amp;E's 108th birthday. That irony was not lost on a  handful of SDG&amp;E shareholders, who peppered Page with questions about the  wisdom of a merger with Edison.  </P> <P> One stockholder pointed to the "firestorm of protest" the merger has generated  in San Diego County. The shareholder questioned whether the merger is really  necessary because "SDG&amp;E has made steady, modest progress over the past few  years."  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Sources Needed  </P> <P> Page defended the proposal, saying that alone, SDG&amp;E would not be able to  meet the rapidly growing demand for electricity in San Diego and southern  Orange counties. "Our rates were going to be trending upward" for SDG&amp;E's 1  million customers unless new sources of electrical generation were secured,  Page said.  </P> <P> SDG&amp;E's board approved the proposed merger Nov. 30, largely because it will  give SDG&amp;E access to Edison's vast electric transmission grid and excess  electricity generated by Edison plants.  </P> <P> Page repeated his previous claim that  </P> <P> the merger with Edison became a necessity after SDG&amp;E's proposed merger  with Tucson Electric Power in Arizona fell apart. He expressed doubt that that  merger will be revived if the Edison merger falls apart.  </P> <P> According to the merger agreement, SDG&amp;E shareholders will receive 1.3  shares of Edison stock for each share of SDG&amp;E. That swap provides a 23%  premium for each share of SDG&amp;E common stock, according to the utility. The  swap would also boost SDG&amp;E common stock dividends by 24% and boost the  book value per share of each SDG&amp;E common share by 29%, according to the  company.  </P> <P> SDG&amp;E closed up $.25 Tuesday, at $37.50. SCEcorp closed up $.25 at $32.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pickets Outside  </P> <P> While SDG&amp;E shareholders gathered for the meeting at the Sheraton Harbor  Island East, a handful of SDG&amp;E employees picketed outside.  </P> <P> "We've got about 50 people here," said Dave Moore, business manager for Local  465 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. "They think it's  important for shareholders to know what we feel about this merger."  </P> <P> The protesters, who carried anti-merger signs and wore black armbands, gathered  at the hotel about 9:30 a.m.  </P> <P> "I think that Tom Page and the board are selling all the employees down the  road," complained John Minto, an SDG&amp;E employee for 31 years. "Page and the  board were against this merger at the beginning, but then the pot got richer  for them and they changed their minds."  </P> <P> Minto was referring to lucrative employment contracts that Edison offered Page  and other key SDG&amp;E executives.  </P></p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Markets: First the rethink, then the squabble - Serious Money Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester savers and borrowers have another nail-biting month ahead of them. The society has abandoned its original scheme for dividing up Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn. The scheme was vetoed in the High Court in June, and C &amp; G has decided not to appeal. It is, however, confident that it can produce a new scheme which will be acceptable to members and lawyers alike. Details and a timetable are expected in mid August. (See Section I of today's paper.) All those scheduled originally to benefit from the division of the spoils should keep their fingers crossed. Those who have most to hope and least to fear are the savers with qualifying accounts who have held them for more than two years. Those with cause to worry are savers with less than two years' service and borrowers. Their strength is that they account for roughly a quarter of the votes, so C &amp; G is eager to have them on-side. But even if it would like to find other ways of getting money into their pockets, its options are limited  -particularly for rewarding borrowers. (See Section I for some possibilities.) Whatever the new plan, the danger is of a wrangle between voting members with different interests; this could scupper the plan. As in some Victorian melodrama, both legitimate heirs and illegitimate ones are waiting to see who gets what from the overall estate. Once C &amp; G's last will and testament is known, the squabble can begin. Anyone unaware that rolling settlement starts on Monday must be blind, deaf and dumb. Advent calenders pop out of every financial newspaper. But rather less has been heard about margin trading - buying shares on borrowed money, with only a small down-payment. There are two reasons why it becomes an issue automatically after the death of the old account system, which netted out all deals within a two week account period. First, the average period between dealing and paying will be shorter. So, many investors may find it hard to settle on time. Second, account traders - speculators who buy and sell within the account - will have to find a new game. Under the old system, they hoped to make money without putting any up in the first place. The obvious alternatives under the new system are either switching to futures and options, or trading equities on margin. But both types of investment are relatively high-risk because they involve 'gearing' - evocatively known as 'leverage' in the US, where both are common. You put up only a small percentage of the value of the deal initially (the margin), and hope to make a profit before the date on which full settlement is due. Like someone buying a house with a mortgage, you benefit disproportionately if the price rises and suffer disproportionately if it falls. British investors wanting to trade on margin may find the present situation confusing, however. For, although the Securities and Futures Authority has rules designed to protect investors, there are no rules telling brokers how to handle the commercial side of margin trading. For example: what interest rate to charge; what percentage margin to demand; what securities to accept as collateral; how to value the collateral for margin purposes; and what to do if a client breaches margin requirements. Some brokers are avoiding the problem by suggesting that account traders simply roll over a deal from one settlement day to the next. The official line seems to be that a margin of around 70 per cent would normally be about right. One of the more aggressive brokers is offering minimum margins of 30 per cent already. Others are still dithering at the starting post. A bit of a good British bungle, what? If you want a good example of gearing at work, look no further than the coffee market. The price has moved from under Dollars 1,200 a tonne to more than Dollars 4,000 this year. Most of the rise has occurred since late May because frosts have damaged the crop in Brazil. This is the kind of market about which commodity speculators dream. In their dreams they are, of course, always on the right side of the trade. In real life, though, not everyone can be on the right side of a trade. Here is what might have happened to a couple of speculators. First, the background. The price reached a temporary peak of Dollars 2,430 a tonne on May 24, fell back to Dollars 1,875 on May 27 - just three days later - and then began the long climb up to Dollars 4,000. On May 24, the value of one futures contract (five tonnes) would have been Dollars 12,150. A typical margin would have been around Dollars 2,500, roughly 20 per cent. Anyone who sold on May 24 and closed out the contract on May 27 would have made a profit of Dollars 2,775. So, within four days, he would have made a profit of more than 100 per cent on his actual investment. Anyone who had bought at the top and sold at the bottom would have made a similar loss over the same few days. Now assume both our speculators had stuck with their original investment until this week. The bull would have made a profit of Dollars 8,275, the bear a similar loss. Gearing is a double-edged machete.</p>

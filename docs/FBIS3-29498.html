			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nagoya, Feb. 18 KYODO -- Toyota Motor Corp. will  provide full technological assistance to a Chinese automaker  with an eye to future business opportunities in the potentially  vast market for cars there, Toyota officials said Friday [18  February].    The officials said the top carmaker in Japan will extend  more  comprehensive support to Shenyang Jinbei Passenger Vehicle  Manufacturing Co. in Shenyang, Liaoning Province.    Under a technological transfer agreement reached in 1989,  Nagoya- based Toyota has technologically assisted the firm, its  only Chinese partner, in assembling its Hiace van.    The Shenyang firm, which started operations in 1991,  produced  4,400 units of the commercial vehicle in 1993 and plans to boost  output to 20,000 units in 1995.    The Toyota move came as Japanese makers are lagging far  behind Western rivals in making entry into the Chinese market,  which Beijing plans to expand to a size of two million units a  year by the year 2000, four times of the present scale, with aid  from foreign makers.    A Toyota official said the Chinese market is indeed  "attractive in the future" and that "there is an urgent need to  boost our technological help for our Chinese partner."    The Toyota official said the details of the planned  assistance have yet to be worked out, but will probably involve  technological advice on more complicated parts of the car such  as steering mechanisms and accelerators.    The officials also said Toyota plans to help the partner  manufacture not only commercial vehicles but also passenger cars  in the future.    As a step toward that, they said, the company plans stronger  links with Gold Cup Automobile Corp., the parent of the Shenyang  firm, through capital participation.</p>

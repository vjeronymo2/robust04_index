			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Food &amp; Drink: The great north-west seafood pilgrimage - An endless variety of fish makes Galicia Spain's seafood locker. Nicholas Woodsworth eats his way around A good meal is more than just good food. Its enjoyment derives from many other things - the surroundings, the occasion, the company, our own mood on sitting down before a table. There are technically accomplished dinners I have had that I scarcely remember. On the other hand there are many less-than-accomplished meals - some drunken, some last-minute, some downright bad - that I recall with intense pleasure. In the end, cooking is a relative thing the success of which depends as much on the diner as on the dined on. This is by way of introducing an account of some meals I had in travelling through Galicia in north-western Spain. More than anywhere else I have eaten recently, this is a place where, together, food and surroundings combine to produce meals of strong and unforgettable flavour. Galicia - isolated, rural, and battered by Atlantic weather - has a cuisine all its own. Peasant farming in the green valleys produces a limited range of crops - untypically 'northern' for Spain - such as cabbage and turnips. By contrast, the waters off the rocky and indented shoreline of its rias, or drowned river valleys, produce a wealth of ocean produce. Scallops, mussels, crayfish, crabs, eels, oysters, squid, shrimp, octopus and an endless variety of fish make Galicia Spain's seafood locker. Every night special trains and fleets of trucks leave Galician ports so that next morning fresh seafood deliveries will show up everywhere from chic Madrid tapas bars to tiny Andalucian villages. Some critics rate Galicia's rias as the source of the best seafood in Europe. But Galicia itself is no centre of culinary cultural refinement - in my drive from Santiago northwards through a dozen fishing ports I did not once see a restaurant that might be termed sophisticated. Wet weather puts off tourists and local underdevelopment discourages any kind of pretension. I ate on paper tablecoths in simple restaurants, often to the accompaniment of a blaring television. So much the better. What counts here is the freshness of the food and a chance to watch ordinary Galicians go their everyday way. THE SANTIAGO MARKET Santiago de Compostela has been the site of Europe's greatest religious pilgrimage for more than 1,000 years. Its medieval covered market is also a good place to begin a culinary pilgrimage. It is like a large shopping centre straight from the middle ages - long, stone-paved alleys and row after row of arcades mimic the aisles of a modern supermarket. But there is nothing modern here. Whole animals hang from hooks. Skinned sheep's heads stare at you. Squat, head-scarved Galician farmers' wives work with thick, field-roughened fingers to arrange bunches of chives into precise piles on wickerwork baskets. Plastic wrapping, polystyrene, and clerks in white jackets might never have existed. All the aisles were piled high with produce from the surrounding countryside, but my favourite was the cheese aisle, where each cheese rested softly on straw-covered wooden racks. I bought a queso San Simon from a toothless, grey-haired granny in black widow's weeds. It was a wonderful cheese - creamy coloured, large, and conical in shape. Such cheeses are much prized in Galicia - when I told the old woman that I was taking my cheese home with me I received 10 minutes of instruction on its care. What did not last more than five minutes, though, was the fresh tuna and sweet red pepper empanada I also bought. Empanadas are the Iberian version of Cornish pasties, and very popular. Downed with a glass of cool Galician apple cider, they make a delicious market-morning snack. EL BOMBERO There is nothing fancy about El Bombero, a small upstairs restaurant overlooking a narrow Santiago street. From my table I could watch three generations of family members at work in the kitchen. A small child, getting in everyone's way, played about the floor on hands and knees. But homely restaurants make homely food, and a caldo gallego was just what I needed to ward off the raw air and the Atlantic rain pelting down outside. A caldo is the simplest of peasant fare, a thick soup of cabbage, potatoes, white beans and turnips in a meat broth. Its popularity is attested by the dark green cabbages seen growing high on thick stalks outside every rural house in Galicia. The merluza a la cazuela or hake stew which followed is just as humble a dish, and just as delicious. Prepared in a small terracotta bowl that came to the table bubbling hot, it is a hearty marriage of Galician products from sea and shore: thick slices of hake baked in a fresh tomato sauce with peas, potatoes, onions and savory chunks of cured serrano ham. I walked out of El Bombero ready to take on any kind of weather. SAN FRANCISCO The roadside San Francisco restaurant, near the coastal village of Lauro, has a vast collection of key chains mounted in glass cases on the walls. It is one of the more arcane branches of collecting, and I would have preferred to see a menu. But no. The lady of the house asks you if you would like such-and-such a dish. If you would, you get it. If you would not, you get it anyway. Did I want lenguado, she asked. I had never heard of it, and shook my head. Did I want a pitcher of Ribeiro? I had never heard of that either, and shook my head again. Lenguado and Ribeiro were duly produced, and in this way I enjoyed a delicious meal of sole and the local wine, a refreshing change from the heavier wines grown in hotter, sunnier parts of Spain. PLAYA DE BALEO It does not much matter what you take on a picnic to the Galician seaside. It is all so beautifully wild and deserted you cannot help enjoying the simplest of food. Crusty Spanish bread, savoury chorizo sausage, cheese, tomatoes, a bottle of Ribeiro; in these surroundings what more could you want? I am afraid, though, that after half-a-dozen picnics on half-a-dozen glorious Galician seashores, I have become seriously addicted to anchovy-stuffed olives. They are difficult to find in London. CAMARINAS There are dozens of fishing boats in the port at Camarinas. But when I arrived a heavy three-day blow meant there was nothing left in O Meu Lar, the little fish restaurant decorated with photos of the local football team and its cups and trophies. Off then, to the local hamburgueseria, a place so unassuming that this was the only name marked on the sign outside. But so many Galicians have emigrated to Argentina and then returned home that Argentine meat-eating habits are well established here - you will find the same grill houses in rural Galicia as you will in downtown Buenos Aires. Hamburgers be damned, said I. Humming a tango, I feasted instead on sticks of pinchos morunos, grilled marinated pork doused in a fiery, garlic-based hot sauce. The wind dropped, the boats went out, O Meu Lar was back in business, and so was I. To a television-roaring of Zaragoza playing Vigo, a Galician team, for the national football championship, I tucked into fat orange ria mussels in escabeche sauce. By half time I had moved on to calamar salad and a bowl of chipirones, small stuffed squid swimming in a sauce of their own ink. To great howls of despair, Vigo finally lost on sudden-death penalties. Everyone else in O Meu Lar was destroyed. Rather ashamed, I walked out feeling like a winner. MALPICA All Malpica, once a busy Spanish whaling port, is mad about the ocean. Elderly men and children - those too old or too young to be out on the sea - clamber about on the rocks at low tide. They poke around with nets and hammers and sticks, looking for octopus, moray eels, mussels, bait worms, nasty-looking but highly tasty clumps of goose barnacles, and the spiny little rock fish that make such good soup. Down at the harbour, young men set out daily on the high tide, heading for the fishing grounds in little wooden boats. And when the Ave Marina, the Flor de Espana, the Maria Mercedes, the Jesus Miguel and the rest of the fleet returns home, squads of short, heavy-set women await them on the quay. With rubber boots squelching and the arms of their jerseys shoved up to the elbow, they heave and haul at boxes of fish and tubs of squid. You can dine on vast plates of caldeira in O Burato, a restaurant not far from the harbour where the walls are covered with pictures of Christ and the Virgin framed in scallop shells. And if there is a little spare time between courses, you will see the three elderly waitresses who work there gather in the kitchen to recite their Hail Marys. Even more uplifting is to sit at twilight by a window in O Pescador, the fisherman's bar perched over the port, and order a tapa of grilled shrimps or fried octopus. Inside, in a blue fug of cigarette smoke, the conversation is loud, the laughter raucous, the sound of dominoes being slapped down on tables by groups of whiskery fishermen pistol-sharp. Outside, seagulls scream, boats bob, and ocean waves surge over the rocks. There could be no better place to finish a seafood pilgrimage.</p>

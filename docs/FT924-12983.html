			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Despatches: Dinner for 5,750 please, James - Brunei / Kieran Cooke sups with a sultan but finds the six-hour wait tedious WHEN THE richest man in the world issues a dinner invitation, it is best to be punctual. The sultan of Brunei, estimated to be worth a cool Dollars 37bn (Pounds 20.7bn) at the last count, was throwing a little anniversary bash marking his 25 years on the throne. Dinner was at 7.30. At 5.30, a few select members of the international media arrived at the palace gates. The sultan is known to be a bit of a stickler when it comes to dress. Slept-in suits were brushed down. Scuffed shoes were given a quick wipe. Stained ties were adjusted. The man from Russian TV looked in need of a snort of vodka. It was going to be a cosy affair. Just us, the sultan, a sprinkling of Malay royalty, a layer of heads of state, a few prime ministers added as garnish. Plus a few thousand other dignitaries, even a few ordinary people. A mere 5,750 altogether, all seated in the same room. You either hide your wealth or flaunt it. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, 29th sultan and absolute ruler of Brunei, is not afraid of spending a bob or two. His palace is described as the biggest in the world. There are nearly 2,000 rooms. There is a throne room that can seat 2,000. Marble covers more than 12 acres of wall. Carpets as lush as newly-fallen snow. Chandeliers that weigh a ton apiece. Gold that hurts the eyes. Nearly 300 lavatories. The meal was running late. No one can raise a fork until the sultan gives the word. We waited. The dining room was a cross between Versailles and high season at Butlins. 'G'day,' said an Australian waiter, one of more than 700 catering staff flown in for the occasion. 'Not a bad little party, eh?' In the kitchens, chefs sweltered and tempers frayed. Plates of prawns collided with sides of mutton. The meat for the meal was flown in from Australia where the sultan's ranch is twice the size of Brunei itself. More waiting. A few of the down top table guests sloped in. Prince Edward - representing his mother, Britain's Queen Elizabeth - sat in the corner by the royal serving hatch. A Thai prince smiled serenely at the ceiling. A Malay princess adjusted a troublesome tiara. The sultan, still only in his mid-40s, has two wives and 10 children. And a great deal else besides. Two palaces in Brunei plus a hotel in Singapore and another which he bought, then sold, to the Brunei Investment Agency (BIA), a secretive organisation that handles an estimated Dollars 35bn of the country's international investments. The sultan has a mansion in Malaysia. He owns the Beverly Hills hotel in the US, plus another couple of houses in Tinseltown. His father was something of an anglophile who even had a special Winston Churchill museum built in Brunei. That has been closed but the present sultan - who spent time at Sandhurst, England's military college for officers - still maintains strong British links. He bought the Dorchester hotel in London but sold it recently to the BIA. There are various flats and houses dotted round the British capital. The sultan's main residence is a country house situated on the flight path to Heathrow airport. The sultan is partial to planes. He bought his own 747 recently and has a couple of other jets in Brunei. Then there are the automobiles: estimates of the number of his Rolls-Royces vary between 135 and 157. Plus a whole starting grid of sports cars. Dinner was getting very late. There were ugly mutterings from the international press. No alcohol allowed in this increasingly Islamic state. Diplomats, dressed in their full regalia, perspired quietly; their wives glowed. The sultan loves polo. He flies in whole teams to play special tournaments. His horses are said to have air-conditioned stables. Britain has a battalion of Gurkhas stationed in Brunei. The sultan has his own Gurkha battalion, made up of retired soldiers who now form the palace guard. Any mutinous sounds from the waiting diners and the kukris might be out. Army chaps were the only ones to maintain stiff upper lips throughout the long wait. They would not even taste a tumbler of water until the sultan - always referred-to among expatriates as 'HRH' - had first lifted a glass. It was 9.45 pm when the sultan finally arrived. The whole family was in attendance. The sultan doubles up as prime minister and minister of defence. A brother is foreign minister, another is minister of finance. Sultan, princes, princesses and prime ministers sat down, stock still. Not a word was spoken. Just the sound of a thousand camera shutters clicking. The press were ordered back to table. The sultan had given the word. Food was fallen on. The Russian fantasised about the cold of a Moscow winter. 'And then you drink - like that,' he said, knocking back a pineapple juice. We rose. 'Tut, tut,' said the army. Dammit all, everyone has to wait till HRH has finished. We escaped through the kitchens. 'You people have no bloody decorum,' said the Australian waiter, smiling. We agreed. Six hours of dinner was enough, even if it was with the richest man in the world.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: Vereinsbank plans rights issue BAYERISCHE Vereinsbank, the larger of Germany's two big Bavarian banks, plans to hold its third rights issue since the beginning of last year. It is offering one new share for every 10 already held to raise a total of DM627m (Dollars 382.3m), following a total of DM968m raised in two issues last year. The new shares will be offered at DM350 each. The Munich-based bank also announced yesterday that its group partial operating profits had risen 21 per cent to DM1.19bn last year, while parent company partial operating profits - which are a more direct reflection of conditions in the domestic banking market - rose 31.4 per cent to DM763m. As with all of Germany's big banks, the Vereinsbank - the country's fourth largest - has been a beneficiary of strong demand for credit in the past year. The bank gave no reasons for its rights issue, but it is likely that the proceeds will be used to finance further lending and its continued expansion into the five new eastern German states, where it has built up a network of around 50 branches from scratch since the summer of 1990. The bank said yesterday that its dividend for the current year would be DM13 a share, the same as in each of the past five years. The rights issue will create a total of 1.79m shares. These will qualify for the 1992 dividend, and the subscription period will last from April 30 to May 15. On Monday this week, the Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank (the Hypo-Bank), the other large Bavarian bank, announced a one-for-six rights issue to raise DM910m.</p>

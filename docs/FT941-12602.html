			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Japanese unemployment rises Japanese unemployment is continuing to creep up, and industrial output has lagged for a record period, yet glimmers of potential recovery were visible yesterday in the latest batch of economic figures. Industrial production fell by 1.7 per cent from November to December, less than most economists had forecast. That was the 27th consecutive monthly fall in output, Japan's longest losing streak, giving a 4.5 per cent decline for the calendar year. But manufacturers think output might rise slightly this month and next, said a Ministry of International Trade and Industry survey . The unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose by 0.1 per cent from November to 2.9 per cent last month, a 6 1/2 -year high, said the government's management and co-ordination agency. There were 65 jobs available for every 100 seekers in December, unchanged on the previous month, and close to the 64:100 average in the 10 years to 1986, the year the late-1980s boom began. The number of people in work rose slightly last month, by 0.2 per cent from December 1992, to 64.32m. 'A rise in employment is standard for the early stage of a recovery,' said Mr Robert Feldman, director of economic research at Salomon Brothers Asia. Even so, he was sceptical about Japan's recovery prospects, in that a series of encouraging economic indicators early last year had heralded a deepening of the recession. Japanese inflation continued to ease last year - another symptom of the weakness of economic activity. Consumer prices rose 1.3 per cent in 1993, compared with 1.6 per cent in the previous year, said the agency. The inflation rate in Tokyo, available earlier than the national figures, was 1.4 per cent in January, 0.1 percentage points higher than in the previous month. However, the underlying Tokyo rate was unchanged if fresh food prices, which are volatile, are removed.</p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Arts: Tchaikovsky as artist and man With Tchaikovsky: The Final Years 1885-1893 (Gollancz 1991, 527 pp Pounds 45), David Brown completes the most extensive survey of that composer's life and works yet written in English. In bulk, Brown's four volumes fall short of Modeste Tchaikovsky's massive Life of Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky, issued at the turn of this century, but Brown far outstrips the composer's brother in musical insight and evenhandedness. Brown's scholarly virtues continue to enliven the latest volume with his sensitive integration of life and art, and acquainting the reader with Tchaikovsky's neglected capital works. His discussion of the opera The Enchantress is exemplary in this respect, one of several analyses richer and more thoughtful than those found in the earlier volumes. For the most part Brown eschews extraordinary interpretations of Tchaikovsky's personal life and deals with evidence from available sources as it stands. He sees Tchaikovsky's later years as full of constant interruptions from compositional pursuits, which in turn bespeak the extraordinary discipline and energy behind the creation of the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies, The Sleeping Beauty, and The Queen of Spades. From this vantage point the composer emerges more charitable than self-centered - financing a village school, arranging for the adoption of his niece's illegitimate son, using his prestige and money on behalf of other artists. Tchaikovsky's acquaintances with the young Richard Strauss, Gustav Mahler and Ferrucio Busoni clarify his place in the continuity of western music, here in a clearer and more satisfying way than in other accounts. Since Volume I of his Tchaikovsky appeared in 1978, Brown has surely experienced and obviously resisted pressures to yield to the latest fashions of historiography. He appeals to readers who like their Tchaikovsky in the grand tradition, untainted by deconstruction, Marxism, feminism, or those analysts for whom historical context is irrelevant and the works' autonomous greatness a fiction. Psycho-sexual interpretation is a part of this nouveau vague, replete with hints of the sensational, judging from a young musicologist in Chicago recently who argued that Schubert's 'Unfinished' Symphony was a record of its composer's being raped as a child by his father. While not so extreme as this, Alexander Poznansky's Tchaikovsky; The Quest for the Inner Man (New York: Schirmer, 1991, 679 pp, Dollars 39.951) is a counterpoint to Brown's book which seeks to put the record straight on the long-known and occasionally controversial topic of Tchaikovsky's sexuality. Poznansky's premises are unassailable: that a scrutiny of this kind is pertinent and overdue, and that sundry hands have attempted to purge Tchaikovsky's correspondence of references to homosexuality. We learn from the book that Poznansky was born in Russia, graduated from Leningrad University, and is now living in the US. There is no mention of his specialty, leaving open to question the relationship of his credentials to those of professionally trained psychoanalysts, such as Maynard Solomon and Alan Tyson, who also study the lives of composers. This question aside, Poznansky's book reflects a diligent scrutiny of published sources, including Tchaikovsky's rare Letters to Relatives. Poznansky's is an exhaustive account of Tchaikovsky's life consisting mostly of the composer's quotations, which he glosses to highlight the details of Tchaikovsky's sexual urges. This is the book's major preoccupation, as if the inner man were not formed as well by religious belief, worldly fame, artistic sensitivities and friendships based on considerations other than sex. Poznansky relies heavily on his own interpretations of words in the texts he quotes,his conjectural restoration of expurgations, and outright speculation, most of which are persuasively presented if unverifiable. Yet Poznansky offers some fine insights. Whatever the folly whereby Tchaikovsky thought his marriage might succeed, the bulk of his marital agony derived as much from the fact that his wife was deranged as from any fear of exposure. Poznansky also corrects the impression of some widely misinterpreted alphabet letters in Tchaikovsky's diaries, thought to refer to homosexual urges but probably connoting the near-irrepressible anger which sometimes came over Tchaikovsky while playing cards. For all its virtues, the book is myopic and far-flung, wavering uncomfortably between somewhat inconsistent vantage points. We are asked to accept that Tchaikovsky was neurotically afraid of his homosexuality being exposed, but also that Russians of all social strata in Tchaikovsky's day treated homosexuality as an open secret. In this connection Nadezhda von Meck becomes an almost Russellesque caricature, whose puritanical views about sex would bring an end to Tchaikovsky's subsidy if he were discovered. Yet in reality it seems unlikely that a woman who endured 18 pregnancies, ran a multi-million-rouble business, patronised art and travelled widely, would be quite such a prude. Poznansky does not allow the Tchaikovsky-Meck friendship to stand on its merits, a remarkable blend of practical earthly generosity and idealistic escape from earthly travail. But he concedes, in retrospect, that Meck probably knew about Tchaikovsky's sexual orientation for many years while this extraordinary flirtation was being carried on. On one point - Tchaikovsky's death - Poznansky and Brown exchange places. Brown persists in advancing the psycho-sexual hypothesis that Tchaikovsky's death was a suicide forced upon him when a homosexual liaison threatened to be exposed. The traditional view, that he died of cholera after drinking unboiled water, is part of an elaborate conspiracy to disguise the facts. Poznansky, who has refuted this interpretation elsewhere, accepts that Tchaikovsky died from cholera and dismisses the conspiracy as one of many unfounded and bizarre speculations. What is indisputable about Tchaikovsky's death is that the facts are unknown and the implications of his final illness murky. What is notable in these accounts is the retrenchment of their authors from more vehement stands taken in earlier publications. Perhaps this contentious point is imploding upon itself, a sign that disparate strands of Tchaikovsky's biography are moving towards an uneasy consonance.</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOODWILL GAMES;  </P> <P> BOXING;  </P> <P> DE LA HOYA, GRIFFIN FINISH WITH GOLDEN FLOURISHES  </P> <P> Oscar de la Hoya and Eric Griffin were just doing their thing, which in this  case meant winning another fight.  </P> <P> Griffin, a 106-pounder from Broussard, La., capped his run through the Goodwill  Games boxing competition Sunday by winning the gold medal with a 5-0 victory  over Anatoli Filippov of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> De la Hoya, a teen-ager from East Los Angeles, also was impressive as he won a  gold medal in an all-American final at 125 pounds. It helped the U.S. team end  up with a surprisingly strong showing by winning four gold medals, one less  than the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "It's not that I'm bragging or trying to show off, but I am unbeatable," said  Griffin, who has been just that for the last two years.  </P> <P> Griffin hasn't lost since dropping a decision to current International Boxing  Federation light-flyweight champion Michael Carbajal in the 1988 Olympic  trials, dominated Filippov, as he had done with his two previous tournament  opponents.  </P> <P> In the final round, he hurt the Soviet with right-left combinations, and piled  up points with inside flurries.  </P> <P> As impressive as Griffin was, he may have been overshadowed by De la Hoya, who  beat Ivan Robinson, 4-1, in a rousing fight that had the crowd of 8,576 at the  Seattle Center Arena on its feet cheering both boxers.  </P> <P> The 17-year-old De la Hoya, the youngest fighter in the tournament, also may  have been its best in his first major international competition.  </P> <P> "This was my biggest win ever," said De la Hoya, who will be a senior at  Garfield High in September. "To be only 17 and win this, it's just great."  </P></p>

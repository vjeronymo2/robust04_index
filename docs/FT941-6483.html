			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: TI expands in Asia with Singapore deal TI Group, the specialist engineering concern, said yesterday it had reached agreement with the Sembawang Group, a leading Singapore-based industrial conglomerate, to develop business opportunities in the Asia Pacific region. The agreement is an important step for TI, which is keen to expand in Asia. The group and its associated companies already have sales of Pounds 100m in nine countries, including India and New Zealand. The two companies were introduced by Singapore's Economic Development Board and signed a memorandum of understanding last month. Initially they will focus on developing business opportunities in Singapore and China. TI is also talking to Sembawang to explore opportunities for the Dowty aerospace business in south-east Asia. The deal is the first such arrangement made by TI in Asia, although it does have a growing presence in the region. Its John Crane offshoot has had a Japanese joint venture for 25 years, and in 1991 bought a majority stake in Dover Japan, now called Japan Marine Technologies, to help it exploit the Asian market for marine seals. As part of its regionalisation, the EDB has been encouraging local and international companies to combine resources to tackle the expanding regional market.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Council of State has expressed its horror at the  news that, during the night of 22 June, a number of innocent  displaced Liberians at the displaced people's center in the  vicinity of [place name indistinct] outside Monrovia were  brutally slaughtered by a group of persons said to belong to a  faction of ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in  Liberia].    In a statement on the incident, Councilor Phillip Banks, who  has [words indistinct] for the Ministry of Justice, condemned  the killings, noting that such acts not only violate the Cotonou  accord, but are wanton violations of several international human  rights conventions to which Liberia has subscribed, as well as  the violation of human rights of innocent unarmed civilians.    The councilman further noted that there can be no  justification for the barbaric atrocities committed against  unarmed, helpless civilians. The council, he said, has  therefore instructed the Ministry of Justice to launch a  full-scale investigation into the incident, and to promptly  bring the perpetrators to justice.    Inveighing the directives of the Ministry of Justice,  Councilor Banks stated that the violators must be subjected to  trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity. He called on  the Ministry of Justice to put necessary machinery in place for  that purpose. The council, he noted, will not countenance such  acts against the citizens of Liberia.    The councilor noted further that while the council has not  pursued persons who violated the human rights of the Liberian  people prior to the Cotonou accord and since the council's  seating, it has no intention of permitting the perpetration of  crimes against innocent Liberians by any person or a group of  persons, or of allowing those who have committed such crimes to  go unpunished.    Such war crimes, the council emphasized, are not covered by  the amnesty provisions in the Cotonou Accord and therefore those  identified as being responsible for the perpetration of such  crimes must be formally charged, and when convicted should be  bear the full punishments prescribed by the relevant  international conventions and the penal laws of Liberia. This,  he said, includes punishment by death.    Meanwhile, the councilman has instructed Justice Ministry to  have the area where the incident occurred and other areas of the  city securely covered and monitored, so as to avoid a repetition  of the incident. The council, he said, is calling upon ECOMOG  [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring  Group] to (?fully) coordinate with and involve Liberians [words  indistinct], especially personnel of the Liberia National  Police, to ensure the maximum protection of all citizens and  residents in areas under the control of ECOMOG and the Liberia  National Transitional Government.</p>

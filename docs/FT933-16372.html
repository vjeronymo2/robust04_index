			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Sport: Hand of God for troubled players - Soccer SUMMER can be cruel for footballers. While league champions and cup victors are still basking in the glory of their procession to the town hall in open-topped buses, it is the time when relegated clubs resign themselves to life in a lower league. It is also when players' contracts run out. Many teenagers on trial are told by their clubs that they have not made the professional grade. And old-timers are eased out with a free transfer - plus, if they are fortunate, the proceeds of a decent testimonial match. So who is there to help players when the final whistle blows? Increasingly, football club chaplains are providing a shoulder to lean on. There are around 40 chaplains in the Premier League and the Barclay Football League. There is even an organisation to promote the spread of sports chaplaincies, called Sports Chaplaincy Offering Resources and Encouragement or Score for short. It is run by John Boyers, formerly chaplain to Watford FC, and chaplain to current league champions Manchester United, since last November. Although Boyers is a Baptist minister Score is inter denominational. It has high-profile backing, with England team manager, Graham Taylor, and the BBC soccer commentator, John Motson, on the board of reference. Ken Merrett, secretary of Manchester United, is also on the board. Merrett also invited Boyers to come north to be his team's chaplain. Boyers, whose position is honorary, spends Monday at United's training ground. He likes to have lunch with the players, although he is at pains to point out that his 'parish' is the whole staff - not just the team members. 'My main job is to be a counsellor, and be a listening ear. The chaplain is there to help people - the manager is there to bring success.' About 50 league notches below mighty United is second division Fulham. For the past three seasons, Gary Piper, the vicar of St Matthew's, Fulham, has been the chaplain to the club. Piper, a former teacher, is a life-long fan of Fulham. He helped run the junior supporters' club before offering his services as chaplain - the then manager, Alan Dicks, accepted. Fulham's assistant manager, Ray Lewington, admits the club does little for players whose stay at Craven Cottage ends. For that, Fulham relies mainly on retraining schemes provided by the Professional Footballers' Association, although Fulham will ring round other clubs to see if there are any takers for their discarded players. Piper tries to provide moral support. 'Sooner or later a player comes to the end of the line,' he says. 'A lot of juniors guess beforehand that they are not going to be signed on. It's a heart-breaking thing. Since primary school they have dreamed of being a footballer. I have been there for them, sitting and listening and sometimes drying the tears. The essence is saying: 'You matter as a person'.' Isn't that approach at odds with the macho world of the changing-room? Piper admits that he wonders if he has done anything useful. 'Sometimes I feel I'm standing round like a spare part. The hardest thing was introducing myself to the players. I felt I was an outsider. There's still a bit of that, but most of them are very friendly.' Piper has moved from outsider to insider. He has taken part in the club's phone line for fans. His greatest honour - apart from donning a Fulham shirt and playing at the ground for the staff team - was being asked to pay tribute at Craven Cottage to Bobby Moore, after the former England captain and Fulham player died in February. Lewington says: 'With Gary, there's always someone there for the players to talk to. He's the type who will sit down and listen. Coaches and managers are not the people to do it. There's a block between us and players - sometimes they need a neutral. Gary has bridged the gap really well.' Piper usually spends Thursday morning at the club, for the training session, as well as going to the first or reserve team games on Saturday. Thursdays are better for seeing the players, because there is no match-day pressure. The players can discuss problems with him in confidence. 'They know it isn't going to get back to the manager or the directors' he says. He keeps an eye out for players who have been dropped from the side, or are out for months through injury. News is passed down the chaplains' grapevine and Piper has been to see players in hospital who have come to London from other parts of the country for an operation. In the 1992-93 season Fulham finished midway down the table. When people hear that the team has a chaplain says Piper they tease that the club should be doing better. But how does he see his role? 'I'm there because I'm a Christian, but not to thrust religion down the players' throats. I say to them that I am quite prepared to talk about my faith, but I let them bring the subject up - and some have talked to me about it.' Piper, like Boyers, is unpaid. British soccer is still very different from American Football. For professional and college teams in the US services and prayer meetings are regular accompaniments to games. Piper says: 'Players for the San Francisco 49ers regularly go to church. They were surprised that it doesn't happen here. I think it is very difficult for players here who are Christians. But there are a number who are not frightened to say they are. They are becoming more vocal.' None of the Fulham players are regular churchgoers, as far as he knows. Piper does not see the players prior to the kick-off on Saturday. 'The changing-room is absolutely sacrosanct before a game, except for the manager and coach,' he said. 'I never go there.'</p>

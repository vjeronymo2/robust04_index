These plans  were discussed during talks in Washington. Bonn believes that  the security needs of Poland and the other neighbors might, for  the time being, be satisfied by decreasing the distance to the  West European Union [WEU].    Germany wants to present the East European states, which  have  already signed association treaties with the European Union  [EU], with an offer of membership in the European Political  Cooperation, in the system of diplomatic consultations of the  EU, which, in line with the Maastricht Treaty, will be replaced  by a joint foreign policy.    In line with Chancellor Kohl's plans, Poland as well as  other  countries would take part in the meetings of political directors  of foreign affairs ministries, and they would have the full  right to express their opinions when joint policies on the most  fundamental issues are established. At the same time, a process  of shortening the distance to the WEU would be ongoing; it would  be harmonized with the integration with EU structures.    One could also hear in German diplomatic circles talk that,  even though the entire "Partnership for Peace" proposal is still  quite fuzzy, one thing, according to Bonn, must be made clear:  Excluded from the "Partnership" will be any and all states  making territorial claims on their neighbors.</p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> ROJAS ACCUSED OF SOCCER SWINDLE  </P> <P> World soccer's governing body, which has suspended Chilean goalkeeper Roberto  Rojas for life, accused him today of attempting the sport's biggest swindle and  called Chile's conduct "criminal."  </P> <P> The International Soccer Federation sanctioned Rojas last month after he  retracted claims that he was hurt by a signal flare thrown from the stands  during a Sept. 3 World Cup qualifier at Brazil. Chile abandoned the match,  saying its safety was endangered.  </P> <P> The organization's general secretary, Joseph Blatter, said other Chileans seem  likely to have colluded with Rojas in staging "the biggest attempt at swindle  in the history of (the federation)," making him "perpetrator and victim at the  same time."  </P> <P> The suggestion of conspiracy spells danger for Chile because the federation's  executive committee could decide on further punishment in considering the case  next month. Possible measures include banning Chile from international  tournaments for a time.  </P></p>

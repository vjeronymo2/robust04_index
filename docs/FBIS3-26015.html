			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By He Jun: "Technology Transfers Increase by Big Margin"] </F>   [Text] China's fledgeling technology market reported a  record turnover of almost $2.4 billion last year, up nearly 40  percent on 1992. The figure covered technology transactions  registered across the country. But does not include the Tibet  region and Shenzhen Special Economic Zone.    The technology market was first introduced into China nine  years ago.    And the paid transfer of science and technology has helped  the country's development, according to Han Deqian,  Vice-Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission  (SSTC).    The government has helped the market by introducing  competitive mechanisms and protecting intellectual property  rights.    And the market boom indicated that China's technological  market had "entered a new era," Han said.    The boom was spread right across the country last year with  each of the 25 provinces, autonomous legions and cities dealing  in at least $11.5 of technology transfer contracts.    Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which saw a 105 per cent  jump in its technology trade over the previous year, was singled  out by Han. But Beijing stayed at the top of the table with a  contract volume of over $400 million. Of the 29 provinces,  municipalities and autonomous regions in the survey, 28  witnessed expansion of their local technomarket.    And the average value of individual contracts rose by over  30  percent to $9,700.    This indicated a remarkable improvement in the level and  quality of the traded technologies, Han said.    China will focus on improving the management, legal,  supervision and investment systems for the technological market.    And it will aim to establish a competitive and standardized  technomarket, Han said.    Full support would be made available to train techno-agents  and to develop the market's intermediary institutes. The  technology market is an important part of China's market  economy, he said.    And it was keeping pace with a country, which was taking off  economically.    In the past years, the central and local governments have  pushed Chinese scientists and technicians to devote themselves  to the commercialization, industrialization and  internationalization of technology.</p>

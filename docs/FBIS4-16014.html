			<p>BFN     [Text] The military council of the Black Sea Fleet asked on  12 April the presidents of Ukraine and Russia to help bring  about the immediate release of the arrested officers and "put an  end to the practice of the use of force by the Ukrainian Defense  Ministry, since they lead nowhere and can cause nothing but  adequate counter measures on the part of the Black Sea Fleet  personnel."    The Black Sea Fleet cannot be intimidated. It has always  been loyal to the peoples of Russia and Ukraine, to the military  duty and the oath of allegiance sworn only once.    A group of the Odessa special forces attempted to arrest in  the port of Odessa on 9 April, the Black Sea Naval vessel  "Cheleken" and prevent its planned movement to Sebastopol. A  group of Black Sea Fleet reserve ships were blocked last weekend.    Three Black Sea Fleet officers were arrested In the early  hours of 11 April in Odessa. Unofficial reports say that two of  them are still under arrest. This vicious practice is a link in  a chain of well-planned actions aimed at re-subordination of  part of Black Sea Fleet facilities to the Ukrainian Defense  Ministry. It is an out-of-bounds attempt to torpedo the  Massandra agreements, says the appeal.    Moreover, the senseless policies by definite circles in the  Ukrainian Defense Ministry and its naval force may cause  unpredictable consequences up to armed clashes and casualties,  says the document.</p>

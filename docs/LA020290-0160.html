			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Frenchman Bob Wollek won the pole for this weekend's Daytona 24-hour endurance  race in a Porsche 962 after Oscar Larrauri started a record-breaking qualifying  session by topping the track mark, then crashing in another of the Porsche  prototypes.  </P> <P> Larrauri, from Italy, escaped injury when he apparently blew a right-rear tire  as he passed another car coming off the fourth turn of the banked portion of  the 3.56-mile road circuit at Daytona International Speedway. The car spun,  became airborne and skidded down the track on its roof.  </P> <P> Wollek, whose co-drivers are South African Sarel van der Merwe and American  Dominic Dobson, posted the pole-winning speed, 131 m.p.h., on his final lap.  </P></p>

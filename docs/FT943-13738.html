			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (5): East Asian 'miracle' is needed - Economic policy must deliver stable growth and jobs No matter how one crunches the numbers, it is obvious that the fate of the new South Africa lies in the hands of foreign investors, bankers and fund managers. This is little more than a statement of the obvious in an increasingly integrated global economy, but also a result of a capital outflow of some Dollars 25bn since the mid-1980s. Reversing this capital outflow is the top priority, since foreign capital is likely to make all the difference between sluggish growth of 2.5-3 per cent annually and expansion of at least 5 per cent a year. Recognition of this unpalatable reality has bred a new consensus within the African National Congress to accept the inevitable trade-off between fiscal and monetary discipline on one hand and social upliftment spending programmes on the other. That consensus remains firm, despite the unwelcome news that Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, has decided to resign, from October. He leaves behind an overtly pro-business, supplyside budget that will do little for populist expectations in the short term; and an economic team which gives every sign of carrying on his policies without him. At the same time, the foreign capital issue is splitting the country into two camps, with many in the business establishment urging the new administration to lift at least some exchange controls and abolish the financial rand. 'With a sound conservative budget behind us, commodity prices improving and massive world support and sympathy, there will never be a better time for dropping the finrand,' says one banker who also warned: 'The climate for exchange control liberalisation is not going to get any better'. 'The cute money' he adds, 'is waiting for the second shoe to drop, for the inevitable decline in the commercial rand, before taking the plunge.' The danger is that this could turn out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy as foreign investors watch and wait for exchange controls to be loosened. Having achieved the seemingly impossible on the political front, President Mandela's new government now needs an economic miracle. South Africa must become the first non-Asian country to replicate the East Asian miracle of growth with equity. The numbers in this year's United Nations Human Development Report underscore the challenge. South Africa, with a gross domestic product of Dollars 120bn and one of the world's 25 biggest economies, ranks 93 in terms of human development, and sixtieth in terms of income a head. The UN says that if white South Africa were treated as a separate country, it would rank 24th in the world, just below Spain, while if the same were done for black South Africa, it would rank 123rd, just above Congo and behind Lesotho, Zimbabwe and Vietnam. The sheer unsustainability of such comparisons, now that the black majority is in the driving seat, highlights the formidable nature of the economic challenge. It is not just a matter of jerking the economy back on to the relatively high growth path of the 1950s and 60s - 5 per cent annually - which will be difficult enough, but of restructuring it to ensure substantially greater participation for those marginalised for the past 300 years. East Asian experience shows this can be done although whether South Africa is ready for the sacrifices this will involve is another matter. With the commodity cycle having passed its trough, the global economy on the mend and South Africa's investment climate looking better than at any time for at least 40 years, the economy is poised for a period of sustained growth. Even so, few economists believe that growth of more than 2.5-3.5 per cent is on the cards for the next two years, while for the rest of the century, a battery of constraints - the cumulative legacies of apartheid, the balance of payments, unsustainable levels of domestic debt, the shortage of skills and the need to restructure manufacturing - will keep expansion below 5 per cent annually. At issue is the new government's capacity to impose restructuring while simultaneously delivering on the social front. In the first post-apartheid budget last month, Mr Keys set a near-perfect example. Given the constraints on fiscal expansion - a budget deficit of 6.6 per cent of GDP at a time when the country is teetering on the edge of a domestic debt trap - the minister focused on reallocating public spending rather than raising taxes to fund social upliftment programmes. He managed to find R2.5bn (Dollars 700m) in savings from normal departmental votes to finance the ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), while leaving unscathed those earning less than R50,000 (Dollars 14,000) annually. The RDP is the instrument designed to redress the ills of apartheid - the yawning chasm between white and black living standards. The government has 'pencilled in' RDP spending of R37.5bn over the next five years on health, education, housing and land. The plan is that government's contribution will be leveraged by private sector contributions, especially in housing, by the parastatals - high-density township electrification and telecommunications - and by foreign donors. The Keys rubric - avidly shared by others in the government's economic team  -is that spending overruns on normal departmental votes will erode the 'pot of money' available for such social programmes. While initial market response to the budget was favourable, it was not long before second-thoughts surfaced. Some of this had more to do with global developments than the budget, but in the words of one government adviser: 'The markets don't trust us . . . Because there is no track record, we have a credibility problem.' But while the confidence factor is certainly critical at this stage, there is more to it than that. Almost everyone wants to see exchange controls and the financial rand abolished, but while many in the business community believe this can - indeed must - be done soon, ministers and their advisers are much more cautious. The central bank governor Dr Chris Stals, has set three conditions for financial rand abolition: that the discount on the investment currency falls below 10 per cent; a substantial reduction in financial rand balances, estimated at R4.5bn, held with the banks; and, most important of all, a build-up in the country's foreign reserves, which in May had fallen to R7.2bn, some five weeks import cover. These three conditions are unlikely to be satisfied this year and possibly not until mid-1995, or even beyond. However, the critics warn that an overly cautious administration will always find reasons to delay. Their argument stands and falls on the assumption that the end of the financial rand would spark huge capital inflows, without which the economy will remain stuck in the slow lane. Government economists, question whether now is the time for a 'leap over the cliff' that could end in tears with interest rates of 30-40 per cent, the commercial rand down a further 20 per cent and the government's credibility in tatters. Countries such as Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe have all shown that exchange control liberalisation can result in exchange rate appreciation and a rapid increase in reserves. But Mr Keys believes South Africa is different, with wealthy individuals, cash-rich corporates and institutional investors just waiting for the opportunity to invest offshore. Officials point out that South Africa is not as under-borrowed as often suggested, noting that while foreign debt is only a modest 14 per cent of GDP, if foreign holdings of equities, and fixed interest securities, are added in, the ratio doubles. Dr Stals questions whether South Africa is ready for 'the burden of convertibility' - the impact that premature exchange control abolition might have on the exchange rate, inflation, wages and interest rates. It is ironic that the private sector, so insistent that now is the time for 'an economic leap of faith like the constitutional agreement', is more pessimistic about the economic fundamentals - inflation, growth and the new administration's capacity to impose fiscal discipline, than the government. Private sector economists believe not just that the trough of the inflationary cycle has passed but that inflation, which touched a 21-year low of 7.1 per cent in April, edging fractionally higher to 7.2 per cent in May, could be back in double-digit figures before the end of 1995. There are real reservations, too, about the fiscal strategy. The 1994 budget is a stop-gap affair; the really tough decisions will come next March when the new minister will have to act on the advice of the recently-appointed Tax Commission, on such issues as zero-rated valued added tax for basic foods, equal tax treatment for women and inflation-adjustment taxation to minimise fiscal drag. All are very worthy causes in their own right, but each one comes with a price tag at a time when the RDP is certain to bulk large on the spending side of the ledger. All of this suggests that the markets will have to live with the uncertainty surrounding the future of the financial rand for least another nine months. In the meantime, after a poor first six months, the economy is picking up, but with growth of little more than 5-5.5 per cent over the next 18 months, unemployment is set to worsen while living standards stagnate. 'It all comes back to track records,' says an industrialist. 'If the government gets the next budget as right as this one, and exchange controls go early next year, we could be on our way. . .' President Mandela's problem is that he doesn't have a year or two in which to await meaningful results. Its not that expectations are excessive but that the new administration must deliver soon in the fields of township electrification, housing, more school places and improved social services, but also on the key issue of jobs. The World Bank estimates that half the country's black workforce is without formal sector employment. Optimistic as ever, the Bank believes that given appropriate policies, including wage restraint and fiscal discipline, this ratio could halve within 10 years. If President Mandela can deliver jobs on this scale, he will indeed have performed a remarkable double-whammy - an economic as well as a political miracle. But in the 1990s world of jobless growth this has the ring of mission impossible.</p>

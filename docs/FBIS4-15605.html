			<p>BFN     [Text] On 9 April, Anatoliy Kovalyov, counsellor-minister  of the Russian Embassy in Kiev, was summoned to the Ukrainian  Foreign Affairs Ministry. A note of protest was handed to him  in connection with the illegitimate actions of the Russian  survey vessel Cheleken in the vicinity of Odessa. On the night  of 8-9 April, in gross violation of international law, it  resorted to violence with the threat of arms and illegally  seized hydrographic and navigational equipment belonging to  Ukraine. The fact that people's lives were endangered is  grounds to qualify these actions of the command of the Russian  vessel as an international terrorist act. It was only due to  the balanced stand of the Ukrainian guard that bloodshed was  prevented. The irony of this bandit action deserves special  attention. It was carried out on the eve of the celebrations in  connection with the 50th anniversary of Odessa's liberation from  the German fascist invaders.    The Ukrainian side demands that the seized property of  Ukraine be returned immediately and those guilty be severely  punished.</p>

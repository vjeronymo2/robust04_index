			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vsevolod Sikelnikov, Yuliya Andrianova, Sergey </F> Knyazkov, and Boris Kudryavtsev: "`Almaz' Almost Invisible"]    [Text] They say that Isaac Newton learned to "evaporate"  the diamonds by focusing sunlight on them with a large  magnifying glass. When Newton demonstrated his experiment to the  English queen, she was immediately stunned: Right before her  eyes the diamond grew red hot and disappeared. But then at once  she ordered that the destructive experiments be stopped.    It would seem that today the same sort of destructive  experiment is being carried out with one of the largest defense  enterprises of the fatherland, the "Almaz" [diamond] plant. No  one would deny that military expenditures and the defense  industry of Russia must be optimized. Unfortunately, we have  always lacked a sense of moderation, especially during the "Cold  War." But in the years of perestroyka and the development of  democracy, on the contrary we began to "uproot" the defense  sector ruthlessly, as we did with the vintners in the course of  the anti-alcoholism campaign. Today, conversion here is a drug  for populists in a political struggle, rather than a state  program to optimize the restructuring of the defense industry  with maximal advantage to Russia. It is too bad that to this  point only those who decide nothing understand this. And  irreversible processes are taking place in this time, doing  enormous harm to the country.    Indisputably each person who works at "Almaz" is a patriot  of  this enterprise. But this does not at all mean that only  corporate interests impel us. "Almaz," which develops air  defense systems, is known throughout the world and is the  strongest competitor of an American company of similar profile,  Raytheon. For decades there was an unpublicized competition  between "Almaz" and "Raytheon," and in recent years a publicized  one, in developing air defense systems. "Almaz" has never lagged  behind its rival, and to a great has extent surpassed it, as it  does today.    On 1 May 1960, an American U-2 spy plane piloted by the  pilot  Powers was shot down by an air defense system which was  developed by "Almaz." The missile hit the target at an altitude  of more than 20 km, a complete surprise to the American  military, who were confident of the impunity of these flights.  Just this single successful launch then plunged the air forces  of the world into extremely high spending to achieve safe flight  altitudes close to the ground. Then, when the Americans deemed  themselves invulnerable at extremely low altitudes, a new SAM  system from "Almaz" dispelled that confidence.    But before that there were long years of other competitions  in the air, including combat ones, as in the skies of Vietnam.  The then ultra-modern American Phantoms, B-52s and other planes  felt themselves practically untouchable, covering the earth of  North Vietnam with "carpet" bombing of unheard-of density. The  very first day our SAM systems were used there, the American Air  Force suffered enormous losses. In the skies of Vietnam a total  of several thousand American planes were shot down, and a large  portion of them fell to missiles of our system.    Then the world understood that SAM systems were one of the  necessary components of defense, safeguarding the security of  the state. They began to be actively purchased, basically from  us and from the U.S. The profit amounted to many billions of  dollars. And even without detailed calculations, one can say  that the "Almaz" paid back the public funds which were invested  in the creation of new systems. Incidentally, people remember  that time. The money earned by us in the international market  was returned to the country in the form of bananas, oranges,  lemons, different foods, and scarce consumer items, accessible  to all because of their low prices.    And no one could chide "Almaz" that these monies were earned  from weapons which brought death and destruction. On the  contrary, SAM systems are extremely defensive weapons.    These days SAM systems have become a generally accepted  means  of defense and have begun to be shown at international  exhibitions. It has turned out that modern all-altitude  multipurpose SAM systems with a long range of action can be  developed only by two countries in the world, Russia and the U.S.    At international exhibitions at Le Bourget (France),  Abu-Dhabi (United Arab Emirates), the Zhukovskiy Aerospace Show  (Russia) and others, specialists were able to vividly compare  the characteristics of the American Patriot air defense system  and our S-300 PMU1 and see that the Russian system surpasses the  American both in range of action and in minimal altitude of  downed targets.    It must be said that here in Russia, too, specialists  understand that the S-300 PMU1 system is quite competitive, and  that in the current difficult economic situation enormous  amounts of money can be earned with it. But what are they doing  with "Almaz" today in Russia? Perhaps this is a somewhat  subjective opinion, but the impression is that they simply want  to destroy us. But you know, "Almaz" is not the property of  political figures, but a treasure of the people.    The average pay at "Almaz" today is 30 to 40 thousand  rubles.  There are world-class specialists: Chiefs of scientific  departments and sectors, doctors and candidates of science, and  leading specialists receive 50 to 70 thousand rubles a month,  while experienced engineers with years of work behind them, just  as young specialists, receive 20 to 30 thousand rubles.    One young cooperative owner, earning a half-million a month  serving Russian millionaires, burst out laughing when he heard  the pay at "Almaz," and then "wisely" noted that probably we  just had a collection of loafers, if that was all they could  earn. It would be better if they fixed imported audio and video  equipment. . . The worst thing is that the young man did not  think this up himself, but was only repeating what some  ideologues of market relations are saying, believing the market  to be a goal in itself.    For now the approach of the state to the fatherland's  enterprises, which determines the level of science and  technology in the country and the world is surprisingly  uniformly destructive: The hammer of high taxes against the  forge of miserable wages will leave not a single industrial  giant standing. Of course, our state has long been in agony,  choking from the shortages of resources. But then, no one  besides our leaders is guilty of this. Well fine, one can still  understand these difficulties. But when the state itself slows  export deliveries of goods permitted for sale, and from what is  sold, it gives almost nothing to the enterprises, the impression  is that temporary people are making some temporary deals.    "Almaz" did not escape this fate either. It received nothing  from recent deliveries from a foreign contract, and even worse,  further export deliveries are starting to be slowed under  various pretexts. But you know, this amounts to hundreds of  millions of dollars, which Russia urgently needs.    "Almaz" itself is being enveloped quite energetically in a  web of commercial and banking structures, which judging by their  behavior are not at all concerned with developing the science,  technology and industry of the fatherland, but are parasitically  interested, for example, in acquiring a prestigious building  which 20 minutes' drive from the center of Moscow.    Thus "Almaz" finds itself in a trap. The government, using  high taxes and pay restrictions, is driving the still-powerful  enterprise into the nets of indebtedness set up by commercial  structures.    And what of the people at "Almaz"? Yes, our unique  specialists, by breaking into consumer goods and commercia  activity, can more than feed themselves. And some of them are  doing this. But overall the collective continues to work on the  main programs and to develop new and extremely complex systems,  because "Raytheon" is making such systems, because the world  will never give them up.    Of course we understand that this drama is only for those  who  worry about the state. You see, if matters go on like this, then  in a few years the country will begin to pay hard currency for  worse systems (no one will ever sell better ones that those of  Russia) from foreign companies. And then many bureaucrats and  merchants as middlemen will get those profits which they are  promised by the destruction of "Almaz." And since nothing comes  from nowhere or goes anywhere, the loser will be our people, who  have already expended a lot of manpower and resources on  creating high-tech enterprises of the "Almaz" type and, if they  are destroyed, will be forced to correct the state's mistakes  out of their own pockets.    How can we not recall the English queen here?</p>

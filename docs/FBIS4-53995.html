			<p>BFN     [Text] The New Zealand prime minister, Jim Bolger, has  denied dodging human rights issues in talks with Indonesia's  President Suharto. He says he clearly voiced his concerns about  the situation in the former Portuguese colony of East Timor  during a visit to Jakarta last week.    New Zealand's opposition Labor Party has condemned  conciliatory remarks made by Mr. Bolger after his meeting with  Mr. Suharto, branding him an apologist for Indonesia. But Mr.  Bolger said he discussed the situation in East Timor at length  with the Indonesian leader. He said he conveyed the substance  of a petition signed by 51 of New Zealand's 99 members of  parliament protesting against human rights abuses in the  territory. Mr. Bolger said the suggestion that the warmth of  his welcome in Indonesia stopped him from talking about the  issue is simply wrong.</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Reluctant spenders hindering recovery and continued reluctance by consumers to spend rather than save - hindered the recovery of consumer demand in the second half of last year, Central Statistical Office figures showed yesterday. Real personal disposable income fell by 0.2 per cent in the third quarter compared with the second and by 0.6 per cent compared with the third quarter of 1990. The savings ratio, which measures personal savings as a percentage of total personal disposable income, dropped only marginally - from 11.2 per cent in the second quarter to 10.9 per cent in the third. The state of company finances provided no sign of relief for the economy, with seasonally adjusted figures from the CSO revealing a financial deficit of Pounds 2.5bn in the third quarter compared with Pounds 1.4bn in the second. Mr Kevin Gardiner, an economist at Warburg Securities, said that, in spite of the latest increase, the corporate sector's financial deficit would probably continue to shrink - the trend in previous quarters - as companies ran down stocks rather than invested. The increase could be explained partly by a jump of 24 per cent in third-quarter dividend payments to Pounds 5.8bn from Pounds 4.7bn in the second quarter. At the same time, the rate of destocking eased from a Pounds 1.7bn reduction in the second quarter to Pounds 0.7bn in the third. Gross trading profits of the UK corporate sector, net of stock appreciation, stayed at about Pounds 17.9bn, similar to the second quarter. However, the figure was maintained by North Sea oil companies' gross trading profits. Those increased by 22 per cent to Pounds 1.5bn in the third quarter from Pounds 1.2bn in the second, thanks mainly to increased crude oil sales. Non-North Sea oil companies' gross trading profits fell between the second and third quarters from Pounds 16.7bn to Pounds 16.3bn. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist for Salomon Brothers International in London, said the higher savings trend in the personal and company sectors would continue to hinder the recovery of the economy. 'Consumer spending is going to stay sluggish for the rest of the year, and in turn that means that the recovery of the overall economy is going to be very weak,' he said. The higher company deficits, acting as an encouragement to cut investment, were also likely to hinder growth. 'The financial position of the corporate sector is sufficiently weak that the emphasis is still going to be on saving and hence on retrenching rather than investing,' said Mr Saunders. The latest squeeze on employment was highlighted by the modest increase in wages and salaries before tax from Pounds 71.8bn in the second quarter to Pounds 72.5bn in the third. Income-tax payments were up only 1.6 per cent compared with the third quarter of 1990. Benefits and transfer payments from the government were up 15.6 per cent. Mr Gardiner said the figures showed that the personal and corporate sectors were still adjusting to the financial excesses of the late 1980s. The Treasury said, however, that it was confident the savings ratio would decline this year. There was scope for some fall in the savings ratio in the coming year as consumer demand began to recover in response to lower interest rates and inflation, and as personal wealth increased, said the Treasury.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Deputy IMF head to quit The International Monetary Fund yesterday announced that Mr Richard Erb would be stepping down next week after 10 years as its deputy managing director. The number two slot at the Washington-based IMF, which is normally within the US's gift while the top post is filled by a European, will be taken by Mr Stanley Fischer, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former chief economist at the World Bank, the IMF's sister institution. The IMF is also considering a management restructuring that could give it three deputy managing directors under Mr Michel Camdessus, the managing director, in the same way that the World Bank has placed three managing directors under its president, Mr Lewis Preston. But officials are still debating how to make clear that Mr Fischer, as the US appointee, would be the principal deputy, and how to avoid simply adding an extra layer of bureaucracy.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Comment" column: "Clinton's Satisfaction"] </F>   [Text] The U.S. President's purposeless intervention  expressing satisfaction for the course of the Cyprus problem  causes surprise. Clinton's letter to Tansu Ciller came when  there was a deadlock on the Cyprus issue, when Turkish  intransigence had once again torpedoed the talks. This is why  it causes surprise but also gives rise to deep thought about the  U.S. President's position. How is it possible, at the time of  the unofficial failure, for Turkey to be  praised--indirectly--because there has allegedly been progress  on the Cyprus issue? How is it possible that Mr. Clinton, who  declares his interest and pledges personal intervention, does  not know that not only is there lack of progress but even  regression? It has been quite some time since Turkey has been  considered the occupation force, the country that violates  internationally recognized principles and rights. It has been  quite some time since Turkey disassociated itself from the  Cyprus problem and every time it becomes implicated in the  problem it merely refers to the two communities. Ankara's  systematic policy of complete disassociation from the problem  has borne fruit and proof of this is the allegedly good  intentions that many circles see on the part of Turkey.    However, to be sincere and realistic, this has not happened  behind our backs, it has happened with our own tolerance if not  with our indirect promotion. When the one who is directly  concerned accepts Ankara's disassociation, when he accepts the  downgrading of the problem to a bicommunal conflict, when he  calls upon Turkey to persuade Rauf Denktas to cooperate, no  foreigner would intervene in a contradictory way, especially  when the foreigner's interests coincide with those of Ankara.  That is why, along with the disappointment caused by such  international moves as the content of Clinton's letter, it would  be right to look for our own responsibilities, too. In the last  analysis, the foreigners follow their own policy. We, what do  we do? Do we compromise with it so that we do not feel  "isolated" or do we demand what belongs to us? No support is  given to people who do not struggle and, unfortunately, this is  what happens in the case of Cyprus.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / International Company News: Contrasting fortunes for US stores CONTRASTING fortunes in the US stores sector continued to surface yesterday when Woolworth, the large general merchandise and specialty store chain retailer, reported slim earnings of Dollars 2m after tax in the second quarter. Federated Department Stores, however, saw results for the same quarter swing from a loss to profit. Woolworth's Dollars 2m net profit in the three months to end-July compared with a Dollars 33m surplus in the same period of 1992, and was reached on sales of Dollars 2.28bn, little changed from last time's Dollars 2.23bn. The result took earnings for the first half to Dollars 3m after tax, compared with Dollars 50m at the same stage in 1992-93. The sources of Woolworth's second-quarter decline were the general merchandise and specialty stores. The former posted an operating loss of Dollars 4m, against a Dollars 21m profit a year ago, with sales declining by 1.2 per cent. Specialty stores remained profitable at the operating level, but saw a decline from Dollars 67m to Dollars 37m. Sales rose by 7.4 per cent. Yesterday, Woolworth painted a dismal picture for the remainder of the year. 'Weak economic conditions and low consumer confidence in the major markets in which we do business continue to depress sales and gross margins, making it unlikely that there will be a year-to-year increase in earnings,' said Mr William Lavin, chairman. By contrast, Federated Department Stores, which emerged from bankruptcy in early 1992, reported an Dollars 8.9m profit after tax in the second quarter, up from a Dollars 15.8m loss (before extraordinary items) in the same period last time. Sales rose from Dollars 1.46bn to Dollars 1.5bn, and profits after tax but before extraordinary items for the first six months now stand at Dollars 30.6m, compared with last time's Dollars 4m loss. Federated said that it had 'slightly' exceeded profit expectations in the quarter and first half, and attributed this to 'fresher inventories, better merchandise assortments, improved expense controls and enhanced operating efficiencies'. Mr Allen Questrom, chairman, noted that the company had continued to take extra second-quarter discounts in merchandise in order to keep goods in the stores looking 'fashion-current'. He added that Federated had been able to offset the earnings effect of this by expense reductions, but stressed the rate at which the expense-to-sales ratio was improving was unlikely to continue through the autumn season.</p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PARK'S TRAFFIC IDEA  </P> <P> Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman, is expecting federal government assistance  to build roads and solve traffic problems in Anaheim or Long Beach before he  can consent to building a new Disneyland Park.  </P> <P> This is a charming idea. Since we in Orange County are unable to find federal  money to solve our existing freeway problems, Eisner, if successful in  obtaining federal money, might consider sharing Disneyland profits -- so we can  solve our traffic problems.  </P> <P> DAVID G.

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Letter: Debt and economic activity Sir, I agree with 99 per cent of Samuel Brittan's excellent article, 'Debt work-out dangers' (July 13). However, there are two important 1/2 per cents remaining. First, the argument against 'debt deflation' theory can be greatly strengthened, again for Keynesian reasons. When I repay debt (instead of spending) out of extra nominal income, my creditor (instead of my supplier) has more money. If my creditor is a bank, its monetary base is enlarged and it can lend more, fuelling other people's spending on consumption or investment. If my creditor is a firm (or household), then my repayment permits more investment (or consumption) directly. Of course, the state of confidence may be such that my creditor uses my debt repayment to increase its savings, not its economic activity - or the exchange rate may be such that my creditor uses my repayment to import. But, if so, that is not the fault of 'debt deflation' but of 'low' levels of economic confidence - or 'too high' exchange rates. One person's, or institution's, debt repayment is another's - the creditor's - receipts. Only to the extent that creditors have a higher marginal propensity to consume (as opposed to saving or importing) than debtors is there a 'debt deflation' brake on the growth of economic activity. Second, there is an important exception to Mr Brittan's judgment that macro-economic policy options cannot affect the real economy. Options that lead to significant, sustained rises in real long-term interest rates lead economic agents to arrange their affairs so as to shift incomes more firmly towards the present, and costs more firmly to the future, than was the case at lower real long rates. This increases rates of resource depletion; and reduces incentives both to adopt resource-saving methods of production and consumption, and to discover new reserves of resources. In the long run, this has a fairly dramatic effect on the real economy, viz. to destroy it. Michael Lipton, 15 Eaton Place, Brighton, Sussex BN2 1EH</p>

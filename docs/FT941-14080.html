			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / International Equities: Dollars 100m issue from Indian transport company Great Eastern Shipping, the Indian transport group, has raised Dollars 100m through a fully underwritten equity issue. Jardine Fleming and James Capel (part of the HSBC Investment Banking group), joint lead managers, bought the issue and then placed the shares with international investors. The steady stream of Indian equity issues is expected to continue, investment bankers said, with several names already lined up tap the international capital markets. Earlier this week, Indo Gulf Fertilisers and Chemicals, a private sector company, raised Dollars 100m with its offering of global depositary receipts. The GDRs were priced at Dollars 4.51 on Monday and traded at Dollars 5.50-Dollars 6.00 yesterday according to BZW, the lead manager. Investment bankers point out that recent Indian issues have frequently attracted Dollars 1.5bn in demand in the book-building process, reflecting strong investor appetite. Kleinwort Benson is currently holding roadshows for Indian Rayon, a rayon, cement and carbon black producer, which is hoping to raise about Dollars 125m with its GDR offering. Videsh Sanchar Nigam, the state-controlled international telecommunications network, is expected to launch a large international equity offering this spring. Investment bankers expect the offering to raise more than Dollars 500m. Salomon Brothers and Kleinwort Benson are global co-ordinators.</p>

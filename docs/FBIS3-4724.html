			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [By reporter An Yong-pae] </F>   [Text] The controversy over Party President [PP] Yi's  "New Line" gives advance notice that, after the regular session  of the National Assembly, the Democratic Party [DP] will be  plunged into a "hot battle" over the questions of an "early  party national convention" and future party direction. Will the  DP be victorious in its political agenda linking  local-government [Chijaje], general and presidential elections?  Will it succeed in taking office? We did a concentrated analysis  of this question through interviews with the DP's next seven  leaders: Yi Ki-taek, Kim Sang-hyon, Kim Won-ki, No Mu-hyon, Yi  Pu-yong, Yi Chol and Chong Tae-chol.    Has DP president Yi Ki-taek actually begun full-scale  mobilization in preparation the 15th presidential election?  There has been no time since the last party national conference  in which PP Yi has so captured the interest of the media and  public. If one visits the PP Yi camp, one can feel an air of  bustling activity somehow different than in the past. As  expected, "public relations" concerning PP Yi's image are being  carried out more actively than before and the level of the  offensive against anti-Yi Ki-taek forces has gone up  considerably. This began with Yi's talk with reports on 28  September and his speech before the National Assembly on 27  October. Out of these sessions came statements the media has  named the so-called "New Line." It was about this time that he  started to organize his own faction, the "Tongil Sanha Hoe."  There has been no consistency in the series of statements and  actions he has shown. This makes possible the analysis that  behind it lies a calculated political foreshadowing in  connection with his political agenda.    The spectrum of evaluations of the "New Line" is as varied  as  the number of factions within the DP. First to attack PP Yi's  line, DP Co-President [Choego Uiwon] [CP] Yi Pu-yong asserts:    "If it were only the opinion of another co-president that  might be okay, but for the party president to elucidate a new  line and announce a party direction, the decision should pass  through a process of debate in which many within the party  participate. A party president must to collect the opinions of  people disagreeing with him. If he makes a decision after  listening to the opinions of only a few secretaries, can this be  said to be an opinion representative of the party? I don't know.  Apart from official meetings as party president with the party  leadership or with lawmakers, he might have held one meeting to  debate party line and policy. In a situation like this, he  suddenly comes out calling this the new line. It's difficult to  understand."    Some are drawing attention by presenting their opinion that  "joint responsibility" for this lies with the media also. CP No  Mu-hyon interprets, "It doesn't appear that the new line was  decided upon after systematic study. It is essentially an  exaggerated expression used of a speech and a few statements by  PP Yi. (The media) created this name because it is material for  new articles." The sentiments of non-mainstream lawmaker Kim  Sang-hyon are more cynical. "I don't know what the New Line of  PP Yi is. His line is constantly changing. It may be more  accurate to say he has no policy line. The expression that the  old line was the liquidation of the past and the new line is  heading toward the future is not even worth debate. Can there be  a future-directed blueprint without a settlement of past issues?"    On the other hand, PP Yi's defense is not easily refuted.    "In their speeches, successive political party presidents  have stressed politics, economics, security, and society, in  that order. In my speech, however, I gave more time to, and put  greater stress on economic issues, rather than political ones.  They seem to have given it the name `New Line' because they  think it a different perspective than in the past. I'm proud  that the party set up this future-oriented policy line one step  ahead of the government and ruling party. For example, after I  finished my address to the National Assembly, many of my close  friends said: The 21st century and the future are the exclusive  property of the government and ruling party. What are they going  to do if you occupy them first? But this doesn't mean I'm going  to be lax about settling the problems of the past. It's my  philosophy that, without it, there can be no reform either. I'm  merely suggesting that in our agenda, we work on them both  simultaneously."    That there cannot but be sharp differences in  "interpretation" over one policy line clearly shows us one  aspect of the DP's problems. Anyway, whether the "controversy"  caused by PP Yi is a clever move resulting from a changed heart  or a bad move made after a long time spent in thought, it  appears that judgment on it will be made after the regular  session of the National Assembly with the evaluation of the DP's  parliamentary activities. The "New Line" controversy and  questions about PP Yi Ki-taek's leadership ability are related  to each other, like two sides of a coin. The give and take is  functioning to elevate the whole controversy, dragging this  question of leadership into the arena of full-scale criticism.  Most questioned PP Yi aggressively. "There is a lot of criticism  that, as the party president, he is only able to exercise  one-ninth of the leadership."    PP Yi's answer was also unexpectedly aggressive.    "The talk that I'm only exercising one-ninth of the  leadership is correct. That's the way the party constitution  sets things up. According to the party constitutional system, I  represent the party as one of nine representatives. I've lead  the various meetings smoothly in these circumstances, without  breaking any dishes. Does it make any sense to say that I have  no leadership ability? I'm leading the way both in reform and in  settling the issues of the past. In the struggle against the  ruling party too I'm doing as much as anyone else. Is there any  other opposition figure who severely criticizes the Kim Yong-sam  government, both in public and in private, as much as I do?  Personally, I don't think it's right for me, the party  president, to stand out so vehemently. It bothers me that I'm  leading like this. Shouldn't the co-presidents of the party  leadership aggressively lead for me? Shouldn't the party  president be the last card played?"    There are many holding the opposite opinion. "I don't  believe  this is a result of the group leadership system," said Rep. Yi  Chol, diagnosing the problem, "It's because most of those in the  leadership are hastily taking care of their own interests." CP  Yi Pu-yong's attitude is a little more serious. "I think the  limits of PP Yi's leadership ability were seen a lot in the  regular session of the National Assembly. I figured that if his  leadership was displayed in the regular session of the National  Assembly, the most important item on the political agenda, then  he would have no problem for the remainder of his term.  Recently, however, it is my honest feeling to doubt whether  during the regular session of the National Assembly we can  effectively make it through the complex political situations  with PP Yi's leadership ability."    There are also those holding reserved positions. Rep. Chong  Tae-chol thinks, "For an evaluation of his leadership ability,  we need to give him a one-year grace period." However, "There do  seem to be problems with the nine-man group leadership system  and with PP Yi's leadership ability, such as the loss of timing  for a decision on party policy because party policy is being  changed all the time," he added cautiously. Some insist that  consideration must be given for the historical nature of the DP.  "Some of what is being said is not entirely unfair. Criticism  is deserved on things such has the reshuffling of party  officials and his inability to return the party to normal after  the national convention," says CP Kim Won-ki, acknowledging a  leadership problem. He added, however, that "there is one thing  to be considered: in the past, there was the charismatic  authority of former party president Kim Tae-chung, in which all  power was concentrated. When he suddenly retired, this changed  into a system of group leadership. Side effects are occurring in  a situation in which this system has been unable to become fully  established."    Regardless of whether questions are raised concerning PP  Yi's  leadership, most feel that there must be change in the present  leadership system. Opinions differ, however, on whether it  should be a group leadership system or a system of sole  leadership by one man. CP No Mu-hyon: "We have to go to a single  leadership system. The transitional period is now past. If we  get a single leadership system, the number of co-presidents  won't be important." He insists that if the group leadership  system is maintained, its number must not be reduced below the  seven members stipulated by the party constitution. This is  because he believes that if it is changed to have five members,  even only three of them could form against the others, so if the  desire is there it would be easier to achieve illicit alliances.  CP Chong Tae-chol thinks, "Even a single leadership system is  okay." Only, in this event, "the party president definitely must  have the capacity to assemble the party's divided, complex and  diverse factions."    There are also many who prefer a group leadership system  somewhat different from the present one. CP Yi Pu-yong: "Since  we have to go through several elections, a single leadership  system with group characteristics is desirable, giving more  authority to the party president while reducing the number of  those in the supreme, decision-making structure." "Because the  system is too diffuse and complex, the number of co-presidents  needs to be reduced," says CP Kim Won-ki, "But, as yet, a group  leadership system is still desirable." It is only that the party  president must demonstrate more leadership, he says. Rep. Kim  Sang-hyon also prefers a group leadership system. "Although a  single leadership system has its strong points, without  leadership ability it will be just the same. If the party moves  in a uniform, undemocratic way, it could actually become  inflexible. In the case of a single leadership system, because  of the practice of appointing a vice president in particular, in  the event the president has no leadership ability, there is a  high probability that he would only appoint someone from his own  faction, causing even greater problems. In that case, the party  could even be broken up." PP Yi Ki-taek and Rep. Yi Chol hold  reserved positions, saying that the two systems both have good  and bad points.    There are presently various issues disputed within the DP,  but the "hot potato" into which all confrontation is condensed  is, as expected, when the next party national convention will be  held. The national convention is the place where all factions  within the party stake their survival, hoping to provide a  candidate for the next presidential election or hoping to make  use of the opportunity to increase their influence. The question  of when it will be held cannot help but be fluid because it is  linked to the local-government agenda and other events scheduled  to be implemented next year. Because the "calculations" of each  faction change according to the time of the convention, they are  conducting unseen preparations for a secret struggle over the  selection of the time. Of interest here is the fact that the  non-mainstream group challenging the party presidency is  actually less interested in an early national convention.    Defeated by a narrow margin in this challenge for the party  presidency during the last national convention, Rep. Kim  Sang-hyon says, "I have no intention to demand that the national  convention be convened early. If in the election-law negotiation  process we come to an agreement, so that local government can be  implemented after May, 1995, there won't be any big problems. I  bring up the problem of Yi's leadership ability, but this is a  call to amend the party line. I'm not saying that we must  immediately change the 2-year term party president. I think it  would be best to hold the party national convention normally, in  1995." However, that does not mean that he is unconditionally  opposed to an early national convention. It is undesirable to go  beyond reason in opposing it, he says.    CP Chong Tae-chol opposes this as a general rule. However,  "If all agree to the need to prevent a situation in which we  would be faced with local-government elections with an  ill-equipped party, actually divided since it hasn't been long  since the last national convention, we could hold an early  national convention unrelated to the issue of the party  leadership," he says. "I understand the situation within the  party, but I don't agree with an immediate opening of an early  convention due to interests limited to internal party problems,"  says CP Kim Won-ki. Because the public must be convinced that  "those actions are appropriate, given the circumstances," "It  seems that we'll have to pass the first half of next year to  know what we're going to do about the question of an early  national convention," he adds.    On the other hand, controlling the party leadership, PP Yi  actually shows a relaxed attitude. "Originally, the next party  national convention is, because of my term of office, supposed  to open in May, 1995. To effectively prepare for the  local-government elections, we must put the party organization  in order at least five to six months beforehand. There is talk  in the government and ruling party that the local-government  elections will be held in January or February of 1995, but,  anyway, if it's of help to the party, there is no need to  withhold support for proposals to hold the national convention  during the latter half of next year. Just before next year's  regular session of the National Assembly would be good too."    CP Yi Pu-yong hopes more aggressively for an early national  convention. "Objective conditions are driving this, unrelated to  anyone's intentions. There is no way we can carry out  local-government elections with this sort of leadership system.  Interlocked with the Democratic Liberal Party's [DLP] next  national convention, local-government elections, etc., I feel  that the question of reorganizing the party leadership after the  regular session of the National Assembly is unavoidable."    CP No Mu-hyon explains the situation within the party, thus:  "Because it is not a question of only dynamic relationships  within the party, we must be careful about an early opening of  the national convention. This is because we must do an  integrated study of the issue, including changes in the ruling  party, the economic situation and the DP's public image. At  least, a feeling held in common by both mainstream and  non-mainstream groups is that we must not do anything that might  ruin the party's image or might cause the party damage because  of its leadership." Many aspects of this consensus, however, are  due to non-mainstream efforts to prudently avoid exposure to  accusations of just carrying on an in-house fight to gain the  party presidency.    If the DP is going to go for an early national convention,  then it will have to be held before or after next year's regular  session of the National Assembly. Regardless, it will have no  choice but to enter into a national-convention phase next year.  In connection with this, it is as yet difficult to predict what  form will be taken by the complex alliances for or against the  main group. "What's important in the party national convention  is influence and popularity. Unlike the DLP, in which President  Kim Yong-sam controls the territory held by each faction, in the  DP the indiscriminate acquisition of influence is more important  that anything else," according to the analysis of one young  lawmaker.    "Presently, the KT (PP Yi Ki-taek) and DJ (Kim Tae-chung)  alliance makes up over 40 percent of the party, securing close  to 50 percent of the `influence.' For now, the mid-liners and  non-mainstreamers may make up over 50 percent, but if the KT-DJ  alliance can draw in only a part of these, the competition is  over. For example, all that remains is the question of  partnership: Will the mainstream alliance get CP Kim Won-ki's  camp or will it get the reform group? The posture of the  mainstream is reserved, however, because there is no need for it  to decide on a partner now, making many enemies early. The  various factions within the party are adopting wait-and-see  postures, still not drawing clear battle lines, because they  know too well the fact that if they fail here, they will  experience great difficulty in securing a share of influence  within the party."    This analysis is convincing only if one accepts the premise  that the alliance between PP Yi and Tonggyo-tong [Kim  Tae-chung's group] will continue in the future. Let us listen to  more of what he has to say. "The KT-DJ alliance is in effect  because of joint interests in maintaining the status quo. If  this alliance falls apart, there is a high probability it will  lead to great confusion and could even end in the party breaking  up. Furthermore, if they go with an early national convention,  it will naturally be held before next September, because they  cannot hold a party national convention while the regular  session of the National Assembly is being held. Then, it will  immediately follow the close of this session of the National  Assembly. Another partnership is unlikely to be achieved during  that period of time."    However, there are many who view the alliance between the Yi  camp and Tonggyo-tong as a temporary structure, soon to be  cleared away. Having a particularly close relationship since the  previous generation with former party president Kim Tae-chung,  CP Chong Tae-chol says, "I personally heard it directly, on  several occasions," that, "[Kim Tae-chung's] relationship with  PP Yi is his keeping a promise to help him for about a year,"  and, "Concerning the party candidate for the next presidential  election, his thought is that the most capable person will win."  CPs No Mu-hyon and Kim Won-ki have similar thoughts on this.  "This is because his apparent backing of PP Yi does not mean  that his relationship with those he previously supported has  suddenly become shallow," according to the interpretation of CP  Kim Won-ki. Also, "To interpret with fixed concepts each action  of those [Kim Tae-chung] had normally been close to, saying that  they do what they do because a button was pressed in  Tonggyo-tong, is too much of an exaggeration," he points out. If  their views are correct, then we cannot hastily judge the  balance power within the party in a fixed way. Also, then, the  situation is inevitably fluid.    Concerning yet another variable, rumors of a return to  politics by former party president Kim Tae-chung, responses are  generally negative, although there are differences in nuance.  The words of Yi Ki-taek: "Shouldn't we believe the words of Kim  Tae-chung himself? Aren't we in a third-person position?  Believing is a virtue." CP No Mu-hyon: "I believe this taking  someone who said they were quitting politics and, without any  grounds to do so, calling him a liar and making up various  things about him is no more and no less than a plot by people  trying to make the DP appear to be a regional party with no life  of its own." One lawmaker close to PP Yi asserts, "As for this  talk about DJ returning to the front lines of politics, an  attempt at making the image stick that the DP is still DJ's  party, although the party president is now KT, leaves one with  the strong impression that it is for preventing the desertion of  DLP supporters, particularly the middle class, and those from  the Taegu and North Kyongsang Province regions."    Concerning the opposition's chances of taking office during  the 15th presidential election, many stress that most external  factors provide considerably good conditions for this. It will  not be easy for the Kim Yong-sam administration to resolve the  economic crisis and the presidential-candidate "cards" capable  of being played by the DLP are not too powerful, it is judged.  Many argue, however, that to make the most of this good  opportunity, there must first be "radical reform" within the DP.  "We must have no more people, as at present, with declining  public support and who, too concerned over the shape of things  in the party, abandon their own districts. We must no longer put  out ridiculous candidates in some districts, because of  factional interests, who then loose, as in the recent special  election. For the overall development of the party, we need  fundamental reform and a reshuffling of personnel," says Rep. Yi  Chol. One co-president even confessed, "A full-scale reshuffling  of the chairmen of district chapters is needed for the reform of  the DP. But because if this were elucidated, it would mean the  end of vote management in the party national convention, it's  difficult to openly talk about it."    It is safe to say that the next local-government elections,  general election, and presidential election are all one  political agenda. This is because the results of each election  are predicted to have a large, in some cases decisive influence  on the next election. Rep. Chong Tae-chol gives this  prescription. "Beginning now, we need to select candidates in  preparation for the election of local-government leaders  [tanchejang songo] and through competition to highlight the  public images of at least the candidates for leader of  large-area local governments [kwangyok chachidanchejang]. The  painful experience of the last election, for which we had no  good candidates, must not be repeated. Together with the Honam  region, we must win at least in Seoul, Kyonggi Province and  Inchon, be evenly matched in Chungchong Province and Taejon, and  publicize in Kangwon Province, North Kyongsang Province and  Taegu, if we are going win in the general and presidential  elections."    The runners to take part in the relay race, the grand finale  to take place in 1997 are now catching their breath. It is still  uncertain who will run the base line as a representative  contestant for the DP. Only in the first heat, the next party  national convention will his profile slowly begin to appear.  After the close of the regular session of the National Assembly,  each team will be looking to those around them and will enter on  an all-out quest for candidate competitors to participate in the  preliminaries, a competition surpassing that of the college  entrance exams. One thing is clear, however. The circumstances  have now changed. Just as the conglomerates are shouting  management reform in order to survive, the DP must be successful  in its reform of opposition political culture in order to enjoy  the thrill of gaining the pennant of victory in the end. The DP  on the night before the big meet. As if to forecast the arrival  of a storm, the waves are gradually beginning to rise on its  quite waters.    Yi Ki-taek Interview    Criticism for Lack of Leadership Ability Ridiculous    [Interviewer] Many questions are being asked about your  leadership ability both inside and outside the party.    [Yi] People are too often saying I lack leadership ability.  I  can't accept this. There are no perfect politicians. I too have  faults. About this, however, I think it is a problem of the  whole party rather than my own problem. To be blunt, if I had no  leadership ability, how could I have been student committee  chairman in high school and college during my school days?  Selected as a member of the National Assembly at 29, how could I  have become secretary general at 39, even though there capable  seniors above me, and vice president of the party at 42? In  politics, you have to watch your timing. Just as you can  accelerate if needed, you've got to have flexibility in dealing  with things. It's ridiculous to say you lack leadership ability  because you are a little late.    [Interviewer] They say you have no general principles in  your  management of the party.    [Yi] I made three promises as I became party president. I  said that I would make the DP a democratic party, a science  party and a policy party. The DP has been so democratically  managed that lawmakers directly selected the floor leader, a  field-army commander. We made the party scientific by, for  example, managing it according to budget accounting principles.  During the last parliamentary inspections, in our handling of  policy inspections we so established our position as a policy  party that there are no dissenting opinions on this. A party  president must take responsibility for bad results, but  shouldn't the credit for these desirable changes also be given  to him? They only question my leadership ability with no mention  of this. I have no choice but to view this as a coin toss, an  argument just for argument's sake, because I'm leading the way  with no other political defects.    [Interviewer] It is said that former party president Kim  Tae-chung's influence on the DP is still too great and that one  of your greatest bases of support is the Tonggyo-tong faction.    [Yi] It is a fact that in actuality, former PP Kim Tae-chung  plays the role of a fence of the DP and has enormous influence  in the party. They ask whether the DP isn't too dependent on  him. Since he is to me a senior opposition politician and a  political leader whose influence is acknowledged worldwide,  isn't it natural that I respect and not neglect his opinions?  And I think former PP Kim's position is neutral. I have a good  relationship with the Tonggyo-tong faction because I have had  deep ties with CP's Kwon No-kap, Han Kwang-ok and others,  because we are close and have worked together for a long time  and because we achieve easy harmony on problems of running the  party and National Assembly.    No Mu-hyon Interview    Advocating Leadership by "Next Generation of  Runners"    [Interviewer] You introduced the "Next Generation Runner  Debate."    [No] It's saying that it would be desirable for CPs Chong  Tae-chol, Yi Pu-yong and the others, with PP Yi, to hold a  competitive selection in the great battle to take place during  the party national convention. The only large group within the  party capable of taking PP Yi is the Honam faction. The DP must  first of all come up with a plan capable of overcoming the idea  that it is a "Honam party." Also, to create the image of a party  capable of producing a candidate much more novel than Rep. Pak  Chan-jong, regardless of people's positions for or against the  party leadership, discussion of the next generation of leaders  cannot help but come up in the next party national convention.  In the battle between PP Yi and the next-generation candidates,  the public will begin to see a new DP image. A "color  confrontation, rather than regional confrontation" will been see  as a fresh image by the public. We must carry out the  local-government, general and presidential elections in this  context if we are to have a chance of winning.    [Interviewer] Concretely, who do you support?    [No] I'm helping CP Yi Pu-yong.    [Interviewer] What will be your role in the future political  agenda?    [No] If there is competitive selection in the party national  convention, no middle way will exist. Some talk about roles  divided among three persons. I don't have a role. You can't call  supporting someone else a role, right? I have work to do, but no  position.    [Interviewer] In connection with CP Cho Se-hyong becoming  director of the Local Government Working-Level Research Center  [Chibang Chachi Silmu Yonguso], many understand this to be not  unrelated to the future political composition.    [No] This was done out of an intention to improve the image  of the research center and get actual help, while excluding the  tendency to view research centers as means for individual  political maneuvering. It has nothing to do with political  preparations.    Yi Pu-yong Interview    DP in Need of Reform Groups    [Interviewer] You are openly putting the brakes on PP Yi's  policy line.    [Yi] Taking the long view, we must gain tangible results in,  for example, changing or abolishing immoral laws, for there to  be less of a burden on the DP. How will we handle public  criticism of the DP if we end up only playing the best man in  this? Even though we get some criticism from the conservative  media right away, we need to highlight disputed points of the  National Security Law, Agency for National Security Planning  Law, Communications Secrecy Protection Law, etc. PP Yi's new  line avoids the formation of issues to dispute. We need to  highlight points of dispute and secure these, if for nothing  else than as important assets for gaining support for the DP and  for preparing for the local-government elections. A clear,  strong tone in the DP would also for the benefit of PP Yi  himself. This is because, rather than coming undone at  accusations of insubstantial leadership, to gain tangible  results for securing democratization, liberalization and a  foundation for unification would be to take on the form of a  genuine, 21st-century leader.    [Interviewer] There are also those who view with misgivings  the image of reform groups within the party.    [Yi] I have determined not to hold dual membership in  another  faction while belonging to a reform group. I plan to participate  in a more organized way in party-line-related discussion groups  in the future. This must not happen, and probably won't, but  even people who ridicule and are unhappy with reform groups will  need them in the DP to get themselves elected in the next  elections. Isn't it difficult to imagine a DP without reform  groups?    Yi Chol Interview    Make All Party Management Public    [Interviewer] What is your reason for saying the party has  no  principles?    [Yi] Official meetings such as the party executive committee  and party general meetings have almost become nominal. There are  even times when, in the case of the executive committee,  meetings are not held because of the party president's personal  schedule. The party platform has to be decided in the party  executive committee. But only the co-presidents' council  [choegouiwon hoeui] is held; conflicting opinions are processed  and spit out without being made into conclusions. In the  selection of party officials, etc., they are only concerned with  dividing the spoils in the next convention, thus exposing the  chaos of the party. As a result, among party lawmakers and party  members, there is almost no consent to party decisions or mood  of confidence in the future.    [Interviewer] Could you point out some concrete problems  which have appeared?    [Yi] A representative example would be the selection of  party  officials after the party national convention. This should have  been done fairly, but after being put off for five or six months  and selection principles being reversed several times, it ended  in an unprecedented dividing of the spoils contrary to the party  constitution and regulations and even the rules of the personnel  selection committee. Completely unknown figures whose past it is  impossible to know suddenly occupied important positions. There  was even a case in which body guards were placed in positions  requiring special expertise. When I protested this, PP Yi  responded, "Doesn't someone have to guard documents and protect  offices?" While implementing the budget, some of the leadership  pay not a cent in party fees. Also, with personal interests  involved, important districts and the position of standing  committee chairman go to totally unqualified people. In short,  things are happening which go beyond common sense. In the  future, all aspects of party management will have to be made  public: financial problems, the party-platform decision process,  the deliberation process of the Chogang [no Chinese characters  were provided in the text so I was unable to determine the  correct English translation] special committee, etc.    Chong Tae-chol Interview    More To Gain Than Lose From an "Opposition Merger"    [Interviewer] There is strong opposition to an "opposition  merger."    [Chong] The opposition must band together in an anit-Kim  Yong-sam line. Absorption merger, Hosokawa-style merger,  whatever its form, it would be better to unite, than not to  unite. This is to say that in order to win in our political  agenda headed toward the presidential election, our fundamental  principle is that we must unite, to include everyone from the  opposition lawmakers to those out of office. If this is done on  the premise of mutual concession, substantial compromise is  possible. I know that there is opposition to this composition  within the party, but it will be difficult to take office in the  next presidential election if we cannot overcome the confusion  in setting up an opposition candidate. I also meet personally  with Pak Chan-chong, Kim Tong-kil, Yi Chong-chan and others.  Although some won't tell their position on this, basically, they  want to join the DP.    [Interviewer] Some insist that it would be best to quickly  select a candidate to run in the presidential election.    [Chong] There is a greater probability that making our  candidate visible now will have adverse effects. It's desirable  that he come to the fore on his own through the competitive  process after the party national convention.    [Interviewer] Are you thinking of running in the next  election?    [Chong] There as been no change in my intention to take a  shot at the presidential election. But for this, you have to be  chosen by the people and by heaven, and there has to be a  possibility of winning. To be honest, who comes out of the DLP  is also important.    [Interviewer] How do you view the idea of separating the  party presidency and presidential candidacy?    [Chong] As a general rule, the party presidency and  presidential candidacy must go together for their strength to be  amplified. This is a natural phenomenon, but, there's nothing  wrong with dividing roles if it is warranted by conditions at  that time.    Kim Wong-ki Interview    Little Possibility of Reform in Political Sector    [Interviewer] What do you think of the "Three-Way  Role-Division Debate"?    [Kim] It seems to begin in the critical mindset that there  has to be new leadership. With only one (of either established  politicians or those out of office), we are unlikely to gain  public support. To go in a reformist direction, but pursue  stability in keeping with the current of the times, we have to  acquire the support of those with whom we are friendly. I am  mentioned along with CPs No Mu-hyon and Yi Pu-yong because,  while an established politician, due to my duties I have often  played the role of mediator in my contact and cooperation with  politicians not in office and been involved in a lot of dialog.  What is important here, however, is not who is being discussed,  but our strategy for getting in office and the issue of party  direction for forging ahead without stagnating.    [Interviewer] How do you view the issue of reorganizing the  political sector, about which there has only been a great deal  of talk so far.    [Kim] Only looking on the outside, the fact that we cannot  go  on like this is felt by all in the DLP as well. Just judging  from the DLP lawmakers I have contact with, few in the DLP think  of it as "my party." Just because President Kim Yong-sam says he  wants to create a new situation, as though the prominent  behavior of lawmakers is problematic, doesn't mean that it all  works out 100 percent as he wants. For example, if the number of  active lawmakers were small, it would be difficult for them to  execute policy as they should. But it is difficult at present to  follow his formula closely. Because politics are variable, an  attempt at change will be made, whether it is temporary or  gradual. Given the present circumstances, the probability of a  reorganization of the political sector with the DP as a partner  is not very high. In a government-led reorganization of the  political sector, if DLP lawmakers consider possible gains and  losses when it has gone in the ruling party's direction, few of  them will judge there to be much actually to be gained from it.    Kim Sang-hyon Interview    Someone Should Run in Kim Yong-sam's District    [Interviewer] What political culture must the DP improve?    [Kim] To prevent the weakening of district chapters and open  a way for fresh personalities to participate, passing through a  vote in which over 300 representatives participate, the total  number of members of the National Assembly and candidates for  local government must gradually increase. Things are difficult  with the present regulations calling for over 50 persons. Also,  the list of representatives must be made public at least ten  days ahead of time and candidates must be given an opportunity  to contact them. Taking as an example the experience of the last  party national convention, representatives came up unknown to  even the deputy chairmen and head officials and several hundred  letters sent out to representatives were returned, even the  district chapters did not know their addresses.    [Interviewer] Is the "Shared Roles Debate" still in effect?    [Kim] Inasmuch as no opposition party has ever gained office  through a direct election, democratic forces must take office in  the next election at all costs. This idea suggests that the  Honam faction play the role of kingmaker. The Honam faction  takes control of party leadership and a non-Honam faction  provides the presidential candidate. Anyway, I'm saying that I  won't break up things in order to become president. We can also  put forward fresh a personality as presidential candidate. If I  become party president, I have a strategy and plan for winning  in the next presidential election. For example, the party  president chosen in the next national convention would run in  President Kim Yong-sam's Pusan district. Whether or not he wins,  he must get publicity. Because we must win in the  local-government and general elections to be victorious in the  presidential election, the party president must lead the way,  bearing the cross and showing the public a responsible posture.  Even if the party president, one man, looses, it could be a good  opportunity for stirring up a DP wind.    [Interviewer] Who do you think of as possible  next-generation  leaders?    [Kim] We can count on Chong Tae-chol, Yi Pu-yong, and Yi  Chol.</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Observer: Time out One thing unlikely to change after the weekend elections in Nepal, land of timeless beauty, is the time. The Himalayan kingdom is thought to be the only country in the world which lives in its own, 15-minute time warp. Since 1985, it has set its clocks four hours and 45 minutes ahead of GMT - a quarter of an hour in advance of neighbouring India. Such demonstrations of independence carry great weight in a country trapped between the giants of India and China. But some Nepalis insist the difference is strictly scientific. Time is determined by the longitude of the centre of a country, which in India was set during the Raj at 82.5 degrees. That longitude goes nowhere near Nepal, let alone cuts it in half, according to Gopal Sharma, chief reporter at the country's government-owned newspaper, The Rising Nepal. Religion, it seems, also plays a part in setting the clocks. The longitude, which actually divides Nepal and provides the reference point for local time, cuts through a mountain called Gauri Shanker named after the wife of Lord Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction and rebirth. If the Congress party, the centrist group backed by India, emerges victorious, there could be pressure to realign Nepalese time. But as Shiva can bestow power upon those who please him, any sensible politician with an ounce of ambition may be best advised to leave well alone.</p>

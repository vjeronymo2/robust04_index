			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed GeWe: "Ukraine Agrees To Close Down </F> Chernobyl -- Financing Unclear But Partnership Agreement Signed"]    [Excerpt] Ukraine is prepared in principle to close down  all four blocks of the ailing nuclear power station in  Chernobyl. However, it is unclear how much it will cost to  decommission the plant and close the energy gap that will arise  as a result. The Ukrainian Head of State, Leonid Kravchuk, who  is currently in Luxembourg to sign the partnership agreement  with the EU member states, believes that between $6-8 billion  will be required. The European Commission, meanwhile, is  talking of costs of about $1.5 billion, and wants other European  states to contribute toward the expense.    Eight years after the Chernobyl reactor catastrophe, two  reactor blocks are still in operation. By 1998, Ukraine wants  to build another three nuclear power plants that are up to  Western standards. Ukraine believes that the European Union  should contribute toward the cost of building these plants by  providing Euratom [European Atomic Energy Community] loans. The  definitive closure of the Chernobyl power station will probably  result in a 35-percent drop in energy supplies. Ukraine wants  to avoid becoming dependent on energy supplies from abroad. In  the Council meeting, Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques Poos  had warned against the danger of a repeat catastrophe.    European Council President Theodoros Pangalos told the press  that the closure of Chernobyl had not been made a precondition  for ratifying the partnership agreement. On the other hand,  signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty had been made such  a precondition.    Among other things, the partnership and cooperation  agreement  signed yesterday, which still has to be ratified by the member  states and the European Parliament, provides for most-favored  nation status. Special agreements still have to be concluded  for coal, steel, nuclear, and textile products. In the past the  European Union imported goods worth only approximately ECU1  billion from Ukraine, compared with exports worth more than  ECU1.4 billion (0.3 percent of all EU exports). Within the  framework of the TACIS [Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth  of Independent States] program offering technical assistance to  the members of the CIS, Ukraine received a total of ECU120  million between 1991 and 1993 for the purposes of reconstruction.    After signing the agreement, Mr. Kravchuk said that it  marked  the inclusion of his country in the process of European  integration, which would in turn boost the process of  democratization. The agreement also refers to guaranteeing  human rights. Pangalos approved the Union aid to help the  transition to a market economy. European Commission President  Jacques Delors described Ukraine as a link between East and  West. [passage omitted]</p>

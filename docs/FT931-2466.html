			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Observer: Dead letters Anyone confused by all the name-changes among Britain's trade unions may feel happier to know their bewilderment is shared by some of said unions' members. Or so it seems from the reaction of staff at Tyne Tees Television yesterday when asked what their own union BECTU's initials stand for. Three unions at Tyne Tees - the NUJ, the EETPU and BECTU - are co-operating in a campaign against rumoured job cuts and loss of local decision-making in the aftermath of the merger with Yorkshire Television. The NUJ, that's easy: the National Union of Journalists. The EETPU, now part of the enlarged AEEU, we can describe, for short, as the electricians . . . But BECTU? The question stumped not only the NUJ's Tyne Tees FOC (that's 'father of the chapel' or branch secretary), but also several BECTU brethren present. Fortunately their branch chairman, John Moore, came to the rescue, explaining that it stands for the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematographic and Theatre Union.</p>

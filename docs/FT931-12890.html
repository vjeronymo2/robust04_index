			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Insolvency body plan in dispute PLANS FOR a joint regulatory body for insolvency practitioners are being held up by a dispute over its control. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, which regulates nearly half of UK practitioners, wants more than a proposed three out of 11 voting shares on the Joint Insolvency Monitoring Unit. Discussions are well advanced for the creation of the unit, which would be supported by the principal professional insolvency bodies - the three UK chartered accountancy institutes, the certified accountants and Institute of Practitioners of Insolvency. Plans for the unit, which would be registered as a limited company, were generated by pressure from the Department of Trade and Industry. It believes on the basis of random inspections last year that monitoring of practitioners was not rigorous enough. It would inspect all the UK's 2,000 insolvency practitioners every three to five years. Meanwhile the DTI is likely to hand to the Insolvency Practitioners' Association control of the registration and supervision of about 150 individuals who fall outside the bodies recognised in the 1986 Insolvency Act. The government's insolvency service, which is under financial pressure, sees the move as a logical development of the self-regulatory regime.</p>

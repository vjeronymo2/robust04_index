			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> 911 CALL ALERTS DEPUTIES TO ROBBERY  </P> <P> A hushed phone call from a woman held captive during an armed robbery at her  San Dimas home led to the arrest of two suspects as they fled the residence  with about $100,000 in cash, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said  Monday.  </P> <P> The arrest occurred Sunday about 9 p.m. after a 28-year-old woman being held  with her infant son called the 911 emergency line, sheriff's spokesman Van  Mosley said.  </P> <P> The woman phoned when one of the suspects, who had been left to watch her,  stepped away to confer with two other men who had taken her husband to a room  containing a safe. Two men, armed with a sawed-off rifle and a knife, ran out  of the house not knowing the Sheriff's Department had been notified, Sgt. Phil  Little said. The third suspect saw the arrests taking place and escaped through  the back door, he said.  </P></p>

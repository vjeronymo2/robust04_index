			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Arts: Business abounds in 'The Rivals' - Theatre Chichester has launched its season with a robust, energetic, and strongly-cast production of Sheridan's 1775 classic, The Rivals. It has been too long since England had a major account of this play - few of us have seen it since Peter Wood's illustrious 1983 National Theatre staging (with Geraldine McEwan, Michael Hordern, Fiona Shaw, Edward Petherbridge, Tim Curry) - and everything about it delights the Chichester audience. So much so that I hardly like to add that this production is over-busy and, in several respects, vulgar. Mrs Malaprop, the play's most celebrated character, is affected, so Patricia Routledge plays her as an 18th-century version of her own famous TV role, Hyacinth Bucket. But the main joke about Mrs Malaprop is that she is intellectually affected. Yes, she muddles her words, but both the words she means and those she says reveal that she is trying to be clever. Routledge, though she brings the role an appealing energy, plays it as a silly old harridan. An undisciplined performance, marked by exaggerated facial reactions and an excessive range of vocal effects. And disappointing: Routledge has often been a most stylish comedienne. What a relief to turn from her to Timothy West, who plays the explosive Sir Anthony Absolute with perfect economy. Self-contradiction is the keynote of The Rivals's main characters; and it is West who catches this best, furiously attacking his calm son for displaying fury, stonily nosing out his son Jack's tricks and stratagems. When Jack's efforts to woo Lydia Languish as two different suitors are being uncovered, it is West's way of barking out (stock still) 'Who the devil are you?' to his son that provides the evening's great comic pay-off. Abigail Cruttenden brings to the pettish proto-romantic Lydia Languish just the right hothouse over-cultivation. She has porcelain prettiness, an absurd (school of Sara Crowe) laugh, and all the necessary spoilt charm, so that you laugh at her without taking against her. Emily Raymond, however, as her cousin Julia, the play's most rational and touching role, is a lovely bore who loses one's attention during her every extended speech. Adam Goldley is a lightweight, puppyish Faulkland; the role's ludicrous romantic agony has little force. As Jack, James Simmons has mischief and virility nicely compounded. The director is Richard Cottrell, who paces everything with a welcome briskness. But he has allowed, or encouraged, several actors to overdo things. Characters keep pacing four yards away from each other amid intimate conversations for no good psychological reason. Lucy (Caroline Holdaway) nods her head rapidly whenever she is listening. The music, by Mark Warman, is not only cheaply scored, but is introduced, distractingly, to underline certain big speeches, as if in a movie. Business, in the most literal sense, abounds. In repertory at the Chichester Festival Theatre, until June 23</p>

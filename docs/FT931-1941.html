			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Arts: Morbid modern message - William Packer questions the artistic merit of 'installations' It may seem a bore to bang on yet again with the great 'modern: is it or isn't it art' debate, but while our institutions continue to show the stuff, the questions will hardly go away. Is whatever is put into a room enough to constitute a work of art? Does the putting together, however so elegantly and scrupulously, of given elements, constitute a work of art? And where do such practices leave the careful carving and modelling that was the norm only a generation ago? Three current exhibitions of sculpture set out the issues. Robert Gober, who, we are told in his blurb material, is in the forefront of America's new generation, has, for his first solo show in Britain, rehung the Serpentine throughout with wallpapers of his own design. One paper carries only two images, of a man asleep in bed and, next to it, a black man hanged upon a tree. Another, given in two ways, light on dark and dark on light, is a little more complex, setting graffito-like male and female genitalia beside each other. The most complex pattern is of trees in an autumn wood, the ground covered in golden leaves. Not merely repeated but inverted, the paper transforms the room into a glade, at least to the extent that a drop-cloth achieves the same effect in a pantomime - Babes-in-the-Wood, perhaps. It would be unfair to dwell too long on the qualities of these essays in decoration. Mr Gober is no draughtsman, and to say that they are crude, alike in conception as in execution, is enough. But I do concede that here they serve a higher purpose. The glade, for example, is further elaborated by a huge cigar lying in the centre of the room, and against the walls some pairs of truncated legs, set as though the rest of the unfortunate bodies were burrowing into the piles of leaves. One is in his underpants, with plug-holes set into his bare legs: another supports candles in square holes cut through his trousers. In the middle of the darker of the genitalia-decorated rooms sits a paper bag full of doughnuts: the lighter room has an arm-chair in one corner, a sack-like wax torso, half male, half female, in another, and more plug-holes set into the wall. The bedroom has a wedding dress as its centre-piece, and hand-painted bags of cat-litter against the walls. Such are what Mr Gober calls his 'natural history dioramas about contemporary human beings'. His publicity apologists go further, saying that they evoke 'scenes of intimacy and social repression' that may be 'construed as a reaction to the escalating horror of living today . . . His sculpture stands as a provocation and a defiant challenge: not only to good taste and good sense, but to the accepted practice and consumption of art.' But is any of that true? Far from being provocative, Mr Gober is merely the academic and the conformist, to which his burgeoning international reputation bears eloquent witness. And what he actually does, with such perfunctory competence, is no more than the staple of the anonymous window-dresser, or the scene-painter, whose whole duty is merely to hold for the moment a passing interest, enough for the message to get across. Ah] The message] the horror of living today, AIDS, eroticism, perversion, morbidity, death. And has he never looked at Breughel, Callot or Grunewald, Goya or Picasso, Bellmer or Kienholz? Perhaps he has. Susana Solano, at the Whitechapel, is a different case, again an artist who has come to international prominence with remarkable rapidity - she began working only in the late 1970s - yet one whose orthodoxy is formal rather than conceptual. Her work is abstract, often set on a large scale, and her practice the conventional manipulation and disposition of industrial elements in an industrial way - welded, bent and bolted. Her formal ideas are remarkably consistent, limited virtually to the single theme of enclosure, upon which she works endless elegant variations - the box; the cage; the drawer; the cabinet; the shelf; the cell. It is all immaculately presented, every element set against the next just so, every surface particular in its quality and contrast. Yet is it not all just a little soulless and impersonal? Heavy metal is impressive by its very presence, and elegant simplicity inevitably portentous. It is a formula less to respond to than to respect. Dennis Mitchell is now 80 and gravely ill. He has only ever been shown on his own in London in small gallery shows, which makes the substantial retrospective of his post-war work, now filling Angela Flowers' gallery all, the more welcome. He has worked in Cornwall all his life, a true veteran of Saint Ives in its pre-war days, his work founded in the simple, symbolic abstraction of Brancusi and confirmed in the example of Barbara Hepworth. Seen in the light of the Gobers and Damien Hirsts of this world, he must now seem sadly old-fashioned and irrelevant a figure, yet here, personified in the quiet, consistent achievement of a lifetime, an unexpectedly powerful creative integrity distinguishes him - old-fashioned indeed. Carved and modelled polished and patinated, everything carries the mark of the artist's hand, unprogrammed and intuitive. Each curve and bend, each cavity and convexity, each surface, is unique in its modulation and adjustment, the purpose not merely to serve or indulge some external Goberean angst, but simply to get it right, to make it true. I knew the work and had expected to respect it: I had not expected to be so moved by it. Robert Gober: Serpentine Gallery, Kensington Gardens W2, until April 25, then to the Tate Gallery, Liverpool; sponsored by Beck's Beer. Susana Solano: Whitechapel Art Gallery, Whitechapel High Street E1 until May 2, then to Malmo and Grenoble; supported by the Spanish Foreign Ministry and Henry Moore Foundation. Dennis Mitchell: Angela Flowers, London Fields, Richmond Road E8 until April 18</p>

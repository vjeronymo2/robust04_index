			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Australia's monthly unemployment rate has fallen to  its lowest level in six months, coming in at 10.7 percent in  December. Linda Mottram reports from Canberra that the number of  people finding work has also gone up despite a fall in the  number of people officially looking for work.    [Begin Mottram recording] The December figures just released  by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show unemployment fell by  31,000. That means around 937,500 Australians were officially  out of work in the month.    Most Australian states mirrored the downward trend in  unemployment. The figures show 22,000 people nationally found  jobs during the month, partly attributable to the usual  pre-Christmas increase in available work. But the number of  people officially looking for work appears to have dropped --  typically a sign of disillusionment with the continuing poor job  outlook. The better overall outlook though continues a steady,  if slow, trend of serveral months.    Unemployment will be a major policy focus this year with the  Keating government preparing a final paper on addressing  long-term unemployment. [end recording]</p>

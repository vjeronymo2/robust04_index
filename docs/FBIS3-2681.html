Both growth  rates are greater than the growth in revenue.    -- Starting this year, covering the deficit will depend  entirely on debts without borrowing bank loans.    -- On January 1, 1994, China began to institute a  revenue-sharing system based on a rational division of  responsibilities and rights between the central and local  authorities.    -- This year the country will improve the grain reserve  network, establishing a natural disaster relief fund at the two  levels of the central and local governments, appropriately  raising the purchasing prices of grain and cotton when the new  grain and cotton are put on the market this year.    -- The country will bring investment in fixed assets under  strict control. Everything must be carried out in strict  compliance with the state budget, and neither reductions in  revenue nor increases in expenditures are allowed.    -- Efforts will be made to integrate price reform with  transformation of the operational mechanism of state enterprises  in order to eliminate subsidies to them for operational losses  and reduce subsidies to those suffering losses due to policy  changes.    -- The management of tax collection will be improved and no  taxes may be contracted, and no tax rates may be arbitrarily  altered. Governments at all levels and every government  department may reduce or exempt taxes only in cases as  stipulated in the tax laws.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ARMORED CAR GUARD SLAIN AT MARKET;  </P> <P> GUNMAN TURNS PISTOL ON HIMSELF AS DEPUTIES CLOSE IN  </P> <P> An armored car guard was gunned down at a busy Lakewood supermarket Friday by a  robber who then turned his pistol on himself as sheriff's deputies closed in.  </P> <P> The scene unfolded at mid-morning as about 20 shoppers and employees of the  Vons market looked on in horror, then ducked to the floor at the sound of the  gunfire. As the gunman appeared in the store's glass-enclosed breezeway, the  guard's partner -- locked safely in the armored car just outside -- frantically  beeped the horn as a warning.  </P> <P> But as his partner swung around holding a sack of cash and store receipts, the  robber opened fire, according to a spokesman for the Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Store Surrounded  </P> <P> Deputies from the Lakewood station, only a block away, quickly surrounded the  market and began to move in. But the gunman, apparently seeing there was no  escape, shot himself in the head.  </P> <P> The slain guard, John Allen Stoddart, 25, of Santa Ana, was the third employee  of Armored Transport of California in Los Angeles to die in a holdup since  October.  </P> <P> The suspect, who died shortly after being taken to the hospital, has not been  identified.  </P> <P> Stoddart, who had worked for only a year at Armored Transport, was approached  by the robber, his gun drawn, as he was making his way out of the store about  9:45 a.m., according to sheriff's investigators. The store in the 4000 block of  Hardwick Street is across from the Lakewood Center Mall.  </P> <P> When the shooting started, the investigators said, Stoddart managed to get off  two shots and wound the robber before he was shot and killed.  </P> <P> "Witnesses inside the store began screaming that the suspect was reloading,"  Sheriff's Deputy Sam Jones said.  </P> <P> Before deputies could enter the store, the suspect put his pistol to his head  and shot himself, Jones said. "It appears the suspect acted alone," he said.  Deputies, however, brought a canine unit into the store shortly after the  shooting to search for other suspects. none were found.  </P> <P> As soon as the shooting erupted, people started to flee outside, said Merlyn  Haase, an electrician who was working in the back of the supermarket.  </P> <P> Liz Bowden, who works at a dry cleaners next to the supermarket, heard screams  and gunshots coming from inside and said she "thought it was an explosion.  </P> <P> "I locked up the store right away," she said. "You're not safe anywhere  anymore."  </P> <P> Two saleswomen from a nearby dress shop also heard the shots. One of them, Kay  Wiser, said that "there was a series of pops, like an automatic" weapon being  fired.  </P> <P> A Vons employee, who asked not to be identified, said the store, which opened  six years ago, has been robbed twice. A Vons spokeswoman, Mary McAboy, said  this is the first time there has been an armored car robbery.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies found the robber's car -- a green jacket and a box of  ammunition under the passenger's seat -- parked behind the shopping center. The  rust-colored Cadillac had been reported stolen in Redondo Beach on Monday.  </P> <P> Larue Quiznell, 61, owner of the stolen Cadillac, said in a telephone interview  that her car was taken from the parking lot of a Vons market near her home in  Redondo Beach by a light-haired male with a "Joe College" appearance.  </P> <P> Quiznell said that as she was getting into her car after grocery shopping  Monday, the man, whom she described as about 25 years old and 6 feet tall,  walked up to her and asked her the time.  </P> <P> But while she was putting bags of groceries into the back seat of her car, the  man pulled a pistol, pointed it at her and said, "I really need your car bad."  </P> <P> "I don't know how long I stood there," Quiznell said. "Then he told me, 'I  could blow your head off,' and my keys went right to him."  </P> <P> She said she knew her stolen car was found before investigators had the chance  to tell her.  </P> <P> "My sister saw it on TV," Quiznell said.  </P> <P> At his Placentia home, James Stoddart, the dead armored car guard's father,  said he and his wife worried when their son took the job.  </P> <P> "He really liked this job, " Stoddart said. "We were a little concerned for  him. I expected the worst. I'm that kind of person. So I wasn't surprised (upon  hearing of his death)."  </P> <P> "His mom even suggested we buy him a bulletproof vest," Stoddart said. "I knew  he wouldn't have worn it. We should have done it anyway."  </P> <P> Guards typically work in pairs, one staying in the armored car at all times,  while the other gets out at each of the stops, which number anywhere from 70 to  100 a day. Guards are instructed that, no matter what happens outside the  armored car, the guard inside is never to leave the vehicle.  </P> <P> Contributing to this story were Times staff writers Mary Lou Fulton, James M.  Gomez and James Rainey.  </P></p>

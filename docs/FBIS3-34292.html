			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's  political adviser, said that the PLO was prepared to immediately  sign the understandings reached at the beginning of the Davos  talks. Al-Tibi asserted that the meeting between 'Arafat and  Foreign Minister Peres was conditional on Israel's -- and  especially on Prime Minister Rabin's -- readiness to permit a  rapid completion of the negotiations.    Speaking before the Jewish-Arab center in Yafo, Ahmad  al-Tibi  criticized the police force's intention to use dogs against  Palestinians. Al-Tibi added that the PLO leadership was very  interested in Minister Hayim Ramon's political future, because  he had played a positive role in achieving the agreement between  the PLO and Israel. Ahmad al-Tibi's remarks were reported by  our correspondent Qa'is al-Qudra.</p>

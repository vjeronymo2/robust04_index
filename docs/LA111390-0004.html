			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> CHARGERS;  </P> <P> IT'S PREDICTABLE, BUT EFFECTIVE  </P> <P> If the Chargers' offense is predictable, it doesn't bother Coach Dan Henning.  </P> <P> "I would like to be whatever you want to call us, and win four out of every  five and have no interceptions and one legitimate fumble in five games," he  said. "Predictable.  </P> <P> No imagination. All the comments that I've heard in the past.  </P> <P> "Generally when you end up with a tendency it's because you're doing something  pretty good, because you keep going back to it until somebody stops it. We have  a tendency to run (Marion) Butts."  </P> <P> Running back Ronnie Harmon performed more than adequately in relief of the  injured Rod Bernstine Sunday, carrying 10 times for a 7.1-yard average. What  keeps him from carrying the ball more when Bernstine is healthy?  </P> <P> "He makes things happen in the hole, but there are times that Bernstine or  Butts, when things get closed up in there tight, may push for another yard or  two," Henning said. "Ronnie doesn't have the same kind of push."  </P> <P> Bernstine missed Sunday's game with a hamstring injury. Henning said it won't  be known until Wednesday whether Bernstine will be healthy for Sunday's game at  Kansas City.  </P> <P> Tackle Leo Goeas, whose foot was injured when he was stepped on in Sunday's  19-7 victory over the Broncos, is expected to be healthy enough to practice  this week. Henning said the Chargers had no significant injuries after the  game.  </P> <P> Henning said the original plan to use linebacker Gary Plummer on offense came  in training camp when the Chargers waived Joe Mickles, a Plan B running back  acquired from the Washington Redskins during the off-season. Plummer scored the  Chargers' only touchdown Sunday on a one-yard run. . . . A sack credited to  cornerback Donnie Elder Sunday has been changed to a half-sack shared with  linebacker Leslie O'Neal.

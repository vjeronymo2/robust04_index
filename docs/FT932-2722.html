			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Barlo IPounds 19m open offer and placing Barlo, the Dublin-based radiator and plastics manufacturer, announced an IPounds 19m (Pounds 18.6m) open offer and share placing to finance the acquisition of VEHA, a Belgian radiator manufacturer. Total price will be IPounds 14.5m; the additional proceeds will be used for extra working capital and capital expenditure in the enlarged group. The 35m new shares are to be offered at 58p per share on a 2-for-7 basis to existing shareholders. The placing is underwritten by AIB Capital Markets. Last month Barlo reported a sharp upturn in pre-tax profits to IPounds 3.9m for 1992-93, with strong growth in its radiator division. The deal, agreed with VEHA's present owners - Royal Begemann - will boost the division's turnover from IPounds 20m to over IPounds 50m. Although profits at VEHA last year were only IPounds 500,000, Barlo said the company has embarked upon 'a substantial programme of capital investment and rationalisation'.</p>

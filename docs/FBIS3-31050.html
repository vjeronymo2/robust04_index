The Czech Trade and Industry Minister emphasized this yesterday  before the representatives of German economic and political  circles in Sankt Augustin near Bonn. Dlouhy described cheap  labor and low wages as one of the main advantages of the  economic reform and [a reason for] the successes of Czech  exports. At the same time, he rejected the accusations on the  part of various Western firms that the Czech Republic carries  out dumping exports.    Dlouhy spoke yesterday about the results of the economic  transformation in the Czech Republic in Sankt Augustin, at the  seat of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, which is close to the  government Christian Democratic Union (CDU). He emphasized in  his lecture that an important goal of the reform right now is  economic growth to maintain the hitherto social consensus with  the economic measures. The Czech Republic is approaching  convertibility of the currency, although, according to the  minister, it will not happen next year.    Dlouhy acknowledged the results of cooperation with Germany,  which is the most important trade partner of the Czech Republic.  The German side is the most flexible in investments and the  foundation of joint ventures. Of the total number of joint  ventures in the Czech Republic, approximately 30 percent are  German-Czech enterprises.    Dlouhy described as an important signal for Western Europe  the intensification of the economic cooperation within the  framework of the Visegrad Group oriented toward a free trade  zone. He pointed out, however, that Prague does not intend to  politically institutionalize the collaboration of this group.    Minister Dlouhy also spoke in Koeln am/Rhein on the progress  of the transformation representatives of one of the most  influential economic associations--the Federal Alliance of  German Industry (BDI).</p>

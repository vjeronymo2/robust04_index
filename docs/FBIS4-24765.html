			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 2 KYODO -- Japan's naval forces are  no longer exclusively defense-oriented, while the country's  capability to project military power must be monitored  carefully, a Chinese military journal warned in its latest issue.    The observations came in XIANDAI JIANCHUAN (MODERN NAVAL  VESSELS), which ran a feature on Japan's Maritime Self-Defense  Force. The monthly magazine is published by the Research  Institute of Naval Vessels, a think-tank associated with the  Chinese Navy.    It said Japan's naval strategy evolved from a defense of  neighboring waters in the 1960s and 1970s to active defense of  distant waters from the early 1980s.    The change in orientation was attributed not only to Japan's  desire to protect its status as an economic superpower but to  its alleged "militaristic desire."    The article cited recent developments as suggesting that  Japan is probing world opinion regarding its embarkation on a  "new militaristic path."    It cited Japan's dispatches of forces abroad for United  Nations peacekeeping operations and minesweepers for operations  in the Persian Gulf area as well as its participation in Rimpac  exercises with the United States and other countries.    The article apparently indicates the Chinese military  leadership still harbors strong doubts about Japan's intentions  despite the official pronouncements in Beijing and Tokyo of  friendly relations.</p>

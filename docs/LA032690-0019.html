			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOSPITAL RELEASES SAGON PENN AFTER ATTEMPT TO KILL HIMSELF  </P> <P> Sagon Penn was released from Sharp Memorial Hospital early Sunday morning after  a suicide attempt. A hospital spokeswoman said that Penn, 28, was released at  3:50 a.m. after being brought in semi-conscious, reportedly from taking a  combination of sleeping pills and alcohol.  </P> <P> Penn's girlfriend, Annilie Carmichael, summoned paramedics to her home on  Caminito Aguilar in Clairemont about 7 p.m. Saturday. Carmichael said that Penn  had attempted suicide. Paramedics called police to check the apartment before  treating Penn.  </P> <P> Police arrested Penn two weeks ago when Carmichael reported that she had been  assaulted by Penn in her home. Carmichael called police when Penn refused to  leave. He was later charged with assaulting a police officer who was attempting  to handcuff him. He was not prosecuted but has a court hearing on April 5, when  the district attorney's office is expected to argue for a probation revocation.  </P> <P> Penn was sentenced to three years' probation in 1989 after pleading guilty to  misdemeanor vandalism charges stemming from a fight with an ex-girlfriend's new  boyfriend.  </P> <P> In 1985, Penn was accused of killing San Diego Police Officer Thomas Riggs and  wounding officer Donovan Jacobs and civilian ride-along Sara Pina Ruiz. He was  acquitted of all charges in two separate trials when both juries ruled that  police had provoked the incident by beating Penn.  </P></p>

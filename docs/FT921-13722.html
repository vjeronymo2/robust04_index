			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / International Company News: Kellogg earnings advance 9% KELLOGG, the large US cereals group which has been fighting back against intense competition in its domestic market, reported an 8.9 per cent profits increase to Dollars 118.2m after tax in the final three months of 1991. The fourth-quarter result came after a Dollars 15m one-time charge and translated into earnings per share of 49 cents. This was broadly in line with analysts' expectations, although the shares eased Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 59 3/4 on Friday. Earnings for the full year stood at Dollars 606m, up by a fifth on the previous year's Dollars 502.8m, on sales of Dollars 1.45bn (Dollars 1.36bn). Mr Arnold Langbo, Kellogg's new chairman, said that there had been 'strong volume increases in ready-to-eat cereal sales around the world' and was optimistic both over growth for '1992 and the long-term'. Kellogg came under intense pressure in its home market from both General Mills, its big US rival, and private label producers in 1989 and 1990, but it has been mounting a strong effort to regain market share. Domestically, this had fallen from over 41 per cent to under 38 per cent; on Friday, the company claimed that the figure had stabilised at around the 38 per cent level by end-1991. ANHEUSER-Busch, the largest US brewer and best known for its 'Budweiser' brand, claimed that it is 'on target' to gain a 50 per cent share of domestic beer market by the mid-1990s. It said that market share overall reached 44.1 per cent in 1991, an increase of 0.7 of a percentage point during the year - and has already topped 50 per cent in the light beer segment. It added that the 1991 profits, to be reported in early-February, should reach a new high. In 1990, they were Dollars 842.4m after tax, and analysts have been predicting around Dollars 930m-Dollars 940m for the year which has just ended.</p>

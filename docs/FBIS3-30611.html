			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Podgorica, 7 Feb (TANJUG) -- The Government of  Montenegro has no official reports on or evidence of the  mobilization of refugees, TANJUG was told today by Rade Perovic,  deputy prime minister in the Montenegrin Government. The  parliamentary Social-Democratic Party of Montenegro was the  first to voice its opinion in reaction to reports on the alleged  mobilization of refugees claiming that "with the blessing from  the republic's bodies and the support of military authorities,  refugees from the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina are issued  call-ups to be mobilized into the army of the republic of  Srpska."    The issue was also raised at a session of the Montenegrin  parliament, held last week, when deputy Savo Jablan asked: "Who  is behind the forced mobilization of refugees in Montenegro, and  what is its aim?". Stressing that the government of Montenegro  has no official reports on the alleged mobilization, Perovic, in  charge of that ministry, claims that the UN convention on the  status of refugees is honored in Montenegro.    "A decree on the care for refugees, passed in July 1992,  regulates their position and status, and they are exempt from  mobilization," Perovic stressed.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Names reject 'success fees' A GROUP of Lloyd's Names with heavy losses yesterday decisively rejected proposals to award success fees to representatives organising legal action on their behalf. The Names, who are among more than 3,000 members of Gooda Walker syndicates, also voted overwhelmingly to remove Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg and Mr Paul Marland, the Conservative MP for West Gloucestershire, from the committee of the Gooda Walker Action group.

More than 2,000 Gooda Names are seeking to recover Pounds 394m in insurance losses in the largest legal action at the Lloyd's insurance market. Gooda Walker syndicates specialised in catastrophe reinsurance business  - covering the losses of other Lloyd's syndicates and London companies. Its losses between 1987 and 1990 are calculated at more than Pounds 900m. On average Gooda Names face losses of more than Pounds 185,000. Writs naming 67 Lloyd's members' agents were served earlier this month. Mr Doll-Steinberg claimed that he had been 'ousted' as chairman and said the committee would become 'immune from the concerns of the action group'. He added: 'My main concern has nothing to with receiving remuneration. There has been a serious breach between the committee and the group.'</p>

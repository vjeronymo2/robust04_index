Therefore, based on the results of one of the Science and  Technology Agency's projects aimed at researching basic nuclear  materials, construction commenced in fiscal 1990 on a  distributed materials database called the ``Data Freeway'' that  would be capable of being mutually utilized by all participating  research organs. Basic nuclear materials research is being  carried out by large numbers of research organs, each  specializing in a particular branch or field of this research.  For this reason, the Data Freeway will serve as a network system  interconnecting various databases constructed by individual  research organs and enabling all participating nuclear materials  research organs to make mutual use of these databases taking the  proprietary rights and timeliness of results and advanced  specialization into consideration. The development of the Data  Freeway system is the joint responsibility of the National  Research Institute for Metals (NRIM), the Japan Atomic Energy  Research Institute (JAERI) and the Power Reactor and Nuclear  Fuel Development Corporation (PNC), who are striving to  construct the fundamental portions of this system by fiscal  1994.[.sup]1-3)[/] Once completed, this system should  efficiently promote nuclear materials selection and materials  development.  <H5>  1. Current State of the Data Freeway </H5> <H5>  1.1 System Configuration </H5>   In order to achieve maximum system performance, and to  ensure  smooth operability and sufficient compatibility, NRIM, JAERI and  PNC all opted for the same hardware and software. The hardware  used by each of the research organs consists of Unix-based  electronic workstations (EWS), two gigabytes or more of storage  capacity, hard disks, and communications control equipment. And  the various research organs are interconnected with one another  via a network comprised of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT)  Corporations 9,600 bps DDX-P and/or net 64 public telephone  lines. They are using the TCP/IP communications protocol.    Software being used includes a relational database  management  system (RDBMS) called ORACLE, programs for processing images and  displaying image data and programs for processing diagram  preparation operations, and the programming languages C and  Fortran, which can support science and technology calculation  libraries (ASL). In addition to networks and databases, the Data  Freeway system is also steadily being outfitted with  data-manipulating scientific environments.    The Data Freeway network links together the research organs  shown in Figure 1. By the end of fiscal 1993, users should be  able to access the data they require from NRIM, JAERI, PNC, the  National Research Lab of Metrology (NRLM), the Ship Research  Institute (SRI) and the Japan Information Center of Science and  Technology (JICST) without consciously being aware of where  (which of these organizations) the data is actually coming from.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-29A>      Figure 1. Data Freeway Network </FIG>   <H5>  1.2 System Functions </H5>   Figure 2 provides an overview of the functions being built  into the Data Freeway system. The system features functions for  retrieving data from the database, applications software for  processing data, electronic mail/bulletin boards and even a  function that explains in summary form how the system works. To  access these various functions, all the user has to do is click  a button. The operation screens feature pull-down menus operated  by clicking the button on an electronic mouse input device;  keyboard input is held to the absolute minimum. This makes the  Data Freeway system so easy to operate that even a novice can  use it with no problems.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-29B>      Figure 2. System Overview </FIG>   <H5>  1.3 Database Overview </H5>   The Data Freeway database has been developed so that the  data  structure can rationally describe the irradiation, high  temperature and environmental parameters peculiar to nuclear  materials, beginning with the manufacturing process, chemical  composition, basic materials and mechanical properties for Fe-Ni  alloy or ceramic materials. As shown in Figure 3, the database  possesses a three-tiered structure, comprising six table  categories, including raw materials, specimen processing, test  conditions and test results, roughly 60 types of data tables,  including raw material data, manufacturing methods, testing  devices and test atmosphere, and approximately 800 data  elements, included among which are the name of the raw materials  manufacturers, irradiation dose, corrosion volume and impact  values.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-30A>      Figure 3. Database Structure </FIG>     The smallest unit or element in the basic data set is a  single specimen. That is, data is stored in the database so that  a user can search backward from the results of testing a single  specimen to find out about raw materials, manufacturing methods  and test methods. Therefore, when abnormalities turn up in  retrieved data, the user can check the chemical composition of  the raw materials, the manufacturing history and test methods,  etc. that produced the abnormal test results, determine the  cause(s) of the abnormality and then decide whether or not to  use the data. The Data Freeway database is also capable of  handling structural photographs in the form of image data.  <H5>  1.4 Data Retrieval </H5>   Data retrieval is carried out in accordance with the  operational flow indicated in Figure 2 above. The user makes use  of a multi-window display to pull down menus from the various  windows and select the functions he wants to use, then  implements these functions with the simple click of a button on  the mouse.    The mechanism used to retrieve required data from the  databases maintained by NRIM, JAERI and PNC is described below.  First, a sub-window is displayed outlining the data elements  necessary to retrieve data on materials by speciality field, and  the user selects from this sub-window the field he requires.  Next, the Data Freeway system automatically checks to determine  which of the three research organs maintains data related to the  specified field, and connects the network up with that  organizations database system. To perform this check, the Data  Freeway system queries its data table address management file  which specifies the address of that data. The system must  therefore add to its address management tables for each  participating research organ the names of tables containing data  newly added to those respective organs' databases. And when the  system doesn't connect up to the organ maintaining the specified  data, it displays a message to that effect.    The following method is employed to retrieve data using the  data retrieval operation screen. Ordinarily, a structured query  language (SQL) has to be used to retrieve data stored in a  relational database. However, novices can not use an SQL without  prior knowledge of the database system. This is because SQL  retrieval operations require the user to specify the particular  database tables and data elements in which the desired data is  stored, and to execute instructions that describe one-by-one the  search conditions. And to do this, the user has to be familiar  with the names of the tables and data elements that comprise the  database, as well as with the descriptive syntax used to define  search conditions. The developers of the Data Freeway system  therefore put together an operation screen capable of  automatically executing SQL. They also added a function to the  system that would enable the user to change the units of  retrieved data to data units of his liking.    Figure 4 (not reproduced) shows the retrieval screen and  search results display screen displayed with a data retrieval  operation carried out using this operation screen. These screens  are examples of a retrieval operation that sought the results  (presence or absence of rupture, test load, time to rupture,  reduction in area, etc.) of creep tests conducted at  temperatures in excess of 1,000C on materials containing  the character string ``Inco'' in their name. The search results  display screen is equipped with functions for maintaining those  results in a file for processing and print out.    As explained above, the Data Freeway system makes it easy  for  users to retrieve and analyze information they need. And the  operation screen, operation instructions screen, etc. are in  both Japanese and English to enable foreigners to use the system  as well.  <H5>  1.5 Data Contents </H5>   Table 1 shows the types and amounts of data currently stored  in the Data Freeway system. The system presently contains a  total of 6,600 data sets, the combined total of information in  NRIM, JAERI and PNC databases. The contents of the Data Freeway  relational database system are scheduled to be expanded to  include data on numerous new types of materials such as  ceramic-metal compounds, slope function materials and functional  structure materials.[.sup]3)[/]       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

Examples of Results of Inter-organizational Cooperation </H5>   NRIM, JAERI and PNC are pushing ahead with the development  of  the Data Freeway system for their mutual utilization. As a means  of reviewing methods of mutual utilization, the developers took  up as a sample problem helium embrittlement in type 316 steel.  Type 316 steel is used in the fuel cladding pipes of high-speed  breeder reactors and in the blanket structural material of  nuclear fusion reactors, but since the helium generated as a  result of neutron irradiation is closely linked with void  swelling and embrittlement in type 316 steel, users must  determine its material degradation behavior. NRIM, JAERI and PNC  therefore brought together their respective data on the high  temperature tensile and creep characteristics of type 316 steel  to see what advantages could be gained by this type of  inter-organizational cooperation.[.sup]1)[/]  <H5>  2.1 Data Integration </H5>   Figure 5 provides an example of the data brought together by  NRIM, JAERI and PNC, showing the total elongation data at  various temperatures held by each organization on irradiated  type 316 steel, and the results of integrating that data. The  data held by NRIM shows the total elongation of type 316 steel  hypothetically for use as blanket structural material for a  fusion reactor following experiments in which it was irradiated  with helium ions at relatively high temperatures. JAERI's data  shows the results of similar tests at a wide range of  temperatures. And PNC's data focuses primarily on the total  elongation of type 316 steel at temperatures ranging between  700-800K in line with its targeting of high-speed breeder  reactors. Integrating all three organizations' data produced the  graph labeled ``Irradiated Material'' in the bottom right corner  of Figure 5.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-31A>      Figure 5. Broad Range of Material Characteristics Revealed </FIG>    By integrating their respective data in this way, the three  Data Freeway developers were able to determine the elongation  temperature dependency of type 316 steel across a broad range of  temperatures extending from room temperature to 1,000K. And they  also learned that whereas the lowest value indicated for  elongation temperature dependency in non-irradiated materials  was around 700K, that for irradiated material exhibited an  unvaried decline in proportion to increases in test  temperatures. Therefore, integration of the respective research  organizations' data made it possible to grasp a broad range of  material characteristics.  <H5>  2.2 Using Analysis Tools </H5>   The Data Freeway system offers a variety of applications  programs to enable more useful analysis of data retrieved from  the databases that make up this system. And the developers are  outfitting the system so that users can execute these  applications programs at the click of a mouse button. For  example, the system makes available programs for preparing  diagrams, processing images, estimating the volume of helium  generated during neutron irradiation and the induced  radioactivity in various types of reactors. These tools are used  to complement and grasp the overall image of the data  retrieved.[.sup]1-3)[/]  <H5>  3. Future Plans </H5> <H5>  3.1 Facilitation of Data Input </H5>   In constructing databases, using the minimum amount of labor  to store data of the highest reliability is always a problem.  JAERI has therefore taken the lead in promoting the development  of a data input support system. The design concept calls for an  input support system that will make it possible to input the  data contained in the reports of material test results prepared  by researchers at the same time they are writing them. That is,  the data input support system will create a corresponding  relationship between data to be stored and the data elements in  the database, and then guide data input in line with data entry  procedures. This will require the construction of common  databases that contain synonyms, units and material standards.  In line with this, the Data Freeway developers are planning to  promote data collection for common databases.  <H5>  3.2 Network Expansion </H5>   The Data Freeway system uses a telecommunication network to  make possible the automatic retrieval of required data from  among that data stored in participating research organizations'  databases. Participating research organs will naturally strive  to increase the amounts of data contained in their respective  databases and to perfect the tools used to analyze this data.  However, it will also be essential to expand the network  interconnecting participating research organs and to increase  the number of organizations participating in the system.  <H5>  4. Conclusions </H5>   In order to expand the Data Freeway system and enhance the  databases available therein, the operators of this system will  have to ensure data reliability, maintain an abundance of data,  expand utilization and deal adequately with users' needs. The  development of the Data Freeway system should be promoted  bearing these points constantly in mind. We are looking forward  to the further enhancement and growth of the Data Freeway in  line with its scheduled expansion in fiscal 1993 to include  NRLM, SRI and JICST. And once the development of the Data  Freeway is complete, we can also expect to see the ripple effect  expand the areas of expertise covered therein beyond the realm  of nuclear materials alone to include other energy fields,  outerspace development, and the manufacturing and information  industries. We intend to continue to promote the development of  the Data Freeway in future to make it a widely used common asset  capable of contributing to the efforts of researchers in fields  other than nuclear energy as well.  <H5>  Reference Materials </H5>   1.

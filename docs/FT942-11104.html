			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Palestinians wait for taste of freedom The self-rule agreement has been signed and sealed, but for the 800,000 Palestinians in Gaza it will be several weeks before they get the first real taste of freedom after more than 25 years of Israeli occupation. As the second day of self-rule passed, Palestinians and Israelis woke up to the fact that the Palestine Liberation Organisation is hopelessly ill-prepared to take over the complex administrative and security functions of running the townships of the Strip. Self-rule is more likely to trickle than flood into Gaza. According to Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, PLO chairman Yassir Arafat has asked that Israel 'drag out' its withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank enclave of Jericho for at least three or four weeks while he prepares details of the take-over. The PLO denied Mr Rabin's statement and said it was ready to take over at once. But it is clear the PLO is far away from being ready. Yesterday's expected deployment of 1,000 Palestinian police in Gaza-Jericho has been postponed by the PLO until next week. The lack of planning on a more serious policy level was confirmed yesterday by Mr Hassan Abu Libdeh, PLO official in charge of the 'Technical Committees' supposed to have in place a full scheme for Palestinian control over all services. 'We are not ready to receive authority,' he said yesterday. 'For example, environmental questions are really new to us. It may take 3-6 months before we are really ready.' Another official said the PLO was only really ready to assume control over health. Mr Arafat has yet to name the 24-member national authority which will govern Gaza-Jericho as a de facto cabinet, let alone the key officials who will move in and take over the 34 departments and 24,000 employees of the Israeli military-run civil administration. Many Palestinians said the problem lay with Mr Arafat's authoritarian style of leadership, his inability to delegate and the tension between the leadership in exile and Palestinian leaders who have emerged during the seven-year uprising against Israeli rule. Institutions created at PLO headquarters in Tunis and in the territories did not co-ordinate their activities. Delay in implementing the agreement will further erode Mr Arafat's fragile support base. In Gaza, many Palestinians seemed disappointed and frustrated at the few signs of immediate change in their lives. 'Are they here to take over or just to talk to the Israelis?' shouted one man. 'We expected much bigger things to happen,' said another. Nobody knows if things are really going to change or if the Israelis are really going to leave.' Israel continued yesterday to wind down its occupation in Gaza, completely emptying the city's central prison and dismantling radio antennae. Some prisoners were freed after they signed a document saying they supported the peace process, while others were transferred to another prison in the Negev desert. But despite the snail's pace of implementing self-rule, many people in Gaza still had hopes for the future. Low-key celebrations have been going on since Wednesday's signing of the self-rule agreement, for the deportees and Palestinian prisoners allowed home. New graffiti painted overnight said: 'Our return to Palestine was a dream and now it is the truth.'</p>

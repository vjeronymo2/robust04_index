In July 1993, CII advised the Board of Trustees of the CIGNA Funds that CIGNA Corporation and its subsidiaries intended to redirect resources away from the active management of equity securities and concentrate their equity management activities in indexing strategies. Accordingly, CII indicated to the Board of Trustees of the CIGNA Funds and to Investors that it would be unwilling to continue to serve as investment adviser to any of the CIGNA Funds on a long-term basis. CII also indicated that it would work with Investors to identify and implement a successor arrangement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Following discussions with several major mutual fund groups, Investors and CII determined that Putnam Capital Manager Trust (the ``PCM Funds'') and Putnam would provide a means for the orderly withdrawal of CII's investment advisory services in light of: (i) The willingness of Putnam to provide interim advisory services to the CIGNA Equity Funds; (ii) the availability of funds which offer investment objectives similar to those provided by each series of the CIGNA funds; and (iii) the availability of a current PCM Funds registration for funds which could be substituted for the CIGNA Funds as the underlying investment vehicle for variable annuity contracts sponsored by Investors. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Putnam currently serves as investment advisor to the Putnam Funds (which serve as underlying investment options for the INA/Putnam Account) as well as the investment advisor to the PCM Funds. The PCM Funds are structured to satisfy the requirements of Section 817(h) of the Internal Revenue Code. Since the Putnam Funds are not so structured, they are not appropriate for the purposes of the Substitution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. On November 29, 1993, the board of trustees of the CIGNA Funds, acting on the advice of CII, terminated the appointment of CII as investment adviser to the CIGNA Annuity Equity Fund, the CIGNA Annuity Growth and Income Fund and the CIGNA Annuity Aggressive Equity Fund (the ``CIGNA Equity Funds''). Concurrently, the board of trustees appointed Putnam as the investment adviser to the CIGNA Equity Funds, effective as of November 30, 1993. The investment advisory agreement between the CIGNA Funds and Putnam is substantially the same as the agreement between the CIGNA funds and CII, except with respect to the provisions of certain administrative services. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  On March 8, 1994, the shareholders of the CIGNA Equity Funds approved the investment advisory agreement between Putnam and the CIGNA Equity Funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> CII was retained to provide administrative services to the CIGNA Equity Funds, pending the effectiveness of the proposed substitution. CII continues to act as investment advisor to the CIGNA Annuity Money Market Fund and the CIGNA Annuity Income Fund. Putnam receives an investment advisory fee calculated at the same annual rate as the fee previously paid to CII for the CIGNA Equity Funds. CII continues to receive reimbursement for a portion of its expenses associated with the administration of the CIGNA Equity Funds. These fees remain subject to reduction under expense waiver or reimbursement arrangements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 9. The PCM Funds are registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end management company of the series type. The PCM Funds currently consist of nine portfolios, each with its own investment objectives and investment portfolio. The proposed substitution would utilize four of the portfolios of the PCM Funds with respect to Account I Policies and three of the portfolios with respect to the INA/Putnam Policies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Investors proposes to substitute shares of the CIGNA Funds for shares of the PCM Funds on the following basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;As of the effective date of the Substitution, shares of CIGNA Annuity Money Market Fund would be redeemed by Investors. On the same day, Investors would use the proceeds to purchase the appropriate number of shares of the PCM Money Market Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;As of the effective date of the Substitution, shares of CIGNA Annuity Income Fund would be redeemed by Investors.

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Strong northern performance restricts Watson &amp; Philip fall WATSON &amp; Philip, the food wholesale and retail group which last year took over Amalgamated Foods, yesterday announced a 1 per cent decline in interim pre-tax profits, from Pounds 4.17m to Pounds 4.14m, in the 27 weeks to May 1. The result was buoyed by a strong performance from Scotland and the north of England. 'Between the north/south there has been a definite divide,' said Mr Ian Macpherson, chairman. 'Every one of the northern businesses increased profits and turnover, while I cannot say that about every one of the southern businesses.' Mr Macpherson added, however, that the group was beginning to see signs of an upturn - albeit patchy - in the southern businesses. The interim dividend is raised to 4.2p (4p). Earnings per share, depressed by the 17.8m new shares following last year's rights issue and AF purchase, fell from 9.3p to 8.2p. Turnover rose by 9 per cent to Pounds 240.4m. Mr Macpherson said retail margins had come under pressure, while the average spend in the group's 100 local convenience stores had fallen from Pounds 2.60 to Pounds 2.40. Customers were cutting back on higher margin items, he added. 'People continue to buy the same amount of cigarettes, but Johnny isn't getting his crisps any more,' he stated. The growing incidence of theft, which had risen as a proportion from 1 per cent of retail sales to 1.5 per cent, sliced an estimated Pounds 465,000 from profits. The trading contribution from retail services and stores fell from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 2.8m. Cash and carry increased profits by Pounds 342,000 to Pounds 1.43m, following the closure of two 'unproductive' depots. Mr Macpherson warned, however, that the improvement was not likely to be repeated in the second half, with many customers affected by recession. Margins in the catering business had actually strengthened because of a greater proportion of W&amp;P's own brand sales. However, profits tumbled from Pounds 266,000 to Pounds 53,000, after the Pounds 600,000 costs of expanding this division.</p>

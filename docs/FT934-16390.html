			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lithuania seeks western help with exploration LITHUANIA is aggressively seeking western investment to help tap the country's oil reserves and restructure the refining industry. The Baltic state holds a small cache of high-grade crude in its north-west corner. At present 16 fields are being explored, containing 25m tonnes of crude, of which 9m tonnes is recoverable. Total on-shore potential has been pegged at 137m tonnes, of which 40m tonnes is recoverable - not insignificant for a country barely bigger than Belgium, but a far cry from Russia's 152,000 wells and 327m-tonne annual output. Sea Search, a Dutch oil concern, and RWE-DEA, a subsidiary of the German group, are finalists in the competition for rights to a field near Klaipeda, the western Baltic port city, according to Lithuanian energy ministry officials. A contract should be awarded by the end of this month. The two companies had expressed interest along with Svenska Petroleum, Neste and Knight, a US company - which, the officials said, also made preliminary offers before pulling out. This contract will follow an April agreement between Svenska Petroleum and Lithuania's Gargzdai Enterprises to form a joint-venture to develop the north-western fields. Exploration of the Baltic off-shore fields awaits the resolution of political questions. With newly independent states still settling sea borders, Russia and Lithuania are bickering over rights to a field that lies in Lithuanian and the Kaliningrad region's waters. Mr Robertas Timosiunas, a Lithuanian deputy minister of energy, expects that the disputed area designated as D-6 , a tiny plot with some 7m tonnes of oil, will be divided between the two countries. Negotiations are continuing. The undisputed off-shore field holds an estimated 150m tonnes of crude, about a quarter of which is recoverable, and needs outside investment as the Lithuanians cannot afford exploration efforts. The state's refining business similarly lacks western money and know-how to stem the decline in supply and output since the collapse of the Soviet Union. After a 2 1/2 -year dispute with environmentalist, Lithuania plans to restructure the Mazeikiai refinery. A modern structure dependent on imports from former Soviet republics, Mazeikiai operates below its 12m tonnes-a-year capa-city. An Ecu450,000 (Dollars 525,000) grant from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will help restructuring efforts, plans for which are being drawn up by the UK consultancies NM Rothschild and Trichem. The eventual programme, which Lithuanian officials expect to cost at least Dollars 80m, will include a new hydrocarbons port on the Baltic near the Butinge area, a pipeline connecting it with Mazeikiai and renovations at the refinery itself. The Baltic state, weary after two years of intermittent Russian supplies and infrequent payments for deliveries, wants a western partner to ease the move into new market. Above all, however, a refinery needs crude oil: 'We're looking for an investor who can guarantee delivery,' Mr Timosiunas said.</p>

This draft guideline is intended to help distinguish between manufacturing changes that require prior approval through a supplement to an approved new drug application (NDA), abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or abbreviated antibiotic application (AADA), manufacturing changes that require a supplement but that may be made prior to approval of the supplement, and those manufacturing changes that need only to be described in an annual report. The draft guideline covers certain changes in the method of manufacture that involve equipment changes, reprocessing of drug products that fail to meet specifications, and changes made to the physical facility. The draft guideline also advises manufacturers of their statutory obligation to comply with the current good manufacturing practice regulations regardless of whether or not they submit a supplement to an application.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments by March 14, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit written comments on the draft guideline to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Walter A.

Applicants notify FDA of such changes through a supplemental application and, depending on the type of change, may or may not need FDA approval before the change may be implemented (see &sect;314.70(b) and (c)). Examples of changes to a drug product that require prior FDA approval include: (1) Adding or deleting an ingredient or otherwise changing the composition of the drug product; (2) relaxing the limits for a specification; (3) establishing a new regulatory analytical method or deleting a specification or regulatory analytical method; (4) changing the method of manufacturing of the drug product, including changing or relaxing an in-process control; (5) using a different facility or establishment; and (6) establishing a new procedure for reprocessing a batch of the drug product that fails to meet specifications (see &sect;314.70(b)(2)). Examples of changes to a drug product that may be made before FDA approval of a supplemental application include adding a new specification or test method or changing the methods, facilities, or controls to provide increased assurance that the drug will have the characteristics of identity, strength, quality, and purity which it purports or is represented to possess (see &sect;314.70(c)(1)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations also permit applicants to make some changes, including, but not limited to, changes to comply with an official compendium or an editorial or minor change in labeling, without submitting a supplemental application; instead, these changes are described in an annual report (see &sect;314.70(d)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has prepared the draft guideline to help distinguish between some manufacturing changes that require prior approval through a supplement to an approved NDA, ANDA, or AADA, some changes that require a supplement but that may be made prior to approval of the supplement, and some changes that ordinarily may be described only in an annual report. The guideline covers changes in the method of manufacture that involve certain equipment changes, reprocessing of drug products, and certain changes made to the physical facility. For example, the draft guideline explains that changing to equipment of different design or operating principles from previously utilized equipment would require prior FDA approval, but changing to equipment of the same design and operating principles from the same or a different manufacturer could be described in the annual report. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is making this draft guideline available for public comment before issuing a final guideline. If, following receipt of comments, the agency concludes that a guideline will assist firms in complying with the supplement regulations at &sect;314.70, FDA will prepare a final guideline and will announce its availability in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A person may follow the guideline or may choose to use alternative procedures even though they are not provided for in the guideline. If a person chooses to use alternative procedures, that person may wish to discuss the matter further with the agency to prevent an expenditure of money and effort on activities that FDA may later determine to be unacceptable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guidelines are generally issued under &sect;10.90(b) (21 CFR 10.90(b)), which provides for the use of guidelines to establish procedures or standards of general applicability that are not legal requirements but that are acceptable to FDA. The agency is now in the process of revising &sect;10.90(b). Therefore, this draft guideline is not being issued under the authority of &sect;10.90(b), and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, obligations, or benefits for or on any person, nor does it operate to bind FDA in any way. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons may, on or before March 14, 1995, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments on the draft guideline. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. The draft guideline and received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The text of the draft guideline follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Draft Guideline on Supplements to NDA's, ANDA's, or AADA's for Nonsterile Drug Products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> I. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This guideline informs interested persons of certain practices and procedures for notifying the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of changes in approved applications for nonsterile drug products. The information may be useful to persons seeking to comply with certain regulations on supplements and other changes to an approved application (&sect;314.70 (21 CFR 314.70)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> II. Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Guidelines are generally issued under 21 CFR 10.90, and, as such, state principles and practices of general applicability that are not legal requirements but are acceptable to FDA. However, FDA is now in the process of revising &sect;10.90(b). This guideline is not, therefore, being issued under the authority of &sect;10.90(b), and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, obligations, or benefits for or on any person, nor does it bind FDA in any way. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency advises that this guideline represents its current position on the requirements for filing supplements to applications set forth at &sect;314.70. If a person chooses to depart from the practices and procedures set forth in this guideline, that person may wish to discuss the matter further with FDA to prevent an expenditure of money and effort on activities that FDA may later determine to be unacceptable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This guideline may be amended from time to time if FDA determines that an amendment would be useful based on its experience in using this guideline, through its regulatory efforts, and through comments submitted by interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> III. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants with an approved application must notify FDA about each change in an approved application that is beyond any variation already provided for in that application (see &sect;314.70). The purpose of this guideline is to help clarify the provisions of &sect;314.70 in order to distinguish between those manufacturing changes that need to be submitted as a preapproval supplement (i.e., a supplement that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires FDA approval before the change is made) to the approved new drug application (NDA), abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or abbreviated antibiotic application (AADA), those that require a supplement but that may be made prior to approval of the supplement, and those that only need to be described in the annual report. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicant may wish to consider this guideline when deciding whether to submit a preapproval supplement, a supplement for a change that may be implemented prior to approval of the supplement, or an annual report for the following changes that may affect the manufacture of nonsterile drug products: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=1 --> 1. A change in the equipment that affects the method of manufacture,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. A change in reprocessing a batch that fails to meet specifications, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The use of different facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Regardless of whether a supplement or an annual report is filed, the manufacturer in making such changes must conform to the current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B)) regulations (21 CFR parts 210 and 211). Therefore, changes affecting the method of manufacture, such as changed equipment, new reprocessing procedures, or the use of different facilities, require validation under the CGMP regulations before the drug product may be shipped. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

Changes That Require Filing a Preapproval Supplement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=1 --> (i) Changing to equipment of different design or operating principles from previously utilized equipment (e.g., changing from a V blender to a ribbon blender). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Changing to equipment that changes the basic methodology of manufacturing (e.g., changing from a tray dryer to a fluid bed dryer or spray dryer). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Changes That Ordinarily May be Described Only in the Annual Report. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=1 --> (i) Changing to equipment of the same design and operating principles from the same or a different manufacturer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Changing to the same equipment with a different capacity; however, the capacity should not exceed 10 times the test batch size. (See Office of Generic Drugs Policy and Procedure Guide  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=1 --> 22&hyph;90 (revised), dated September 13, 1990, on scale-up batch size production requirements for nonantibiotic, solid, oral dosage form drug products.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Usually changes in volume require a change and validation of parameters such as mixing time and speed. Such validation studies should reflect no change in product formulation or quantitative composition. The applicant should also perform comparative multiple-point dissolution profiles for solid oral dosage forms as part of the validation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> B.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=3 --> Reprocessing of Drug Products That Fail to Meet Specifications (&sect;314.70(b)(2)(x)) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Changes that Require Filing a Preapproval Supplement; Establishing New Procedures for Reprocessing of Drug Products That Fail to Meet Specifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=1 --> (i) Applicants should submit proposed, detailed reprocessing procedures when requesting authorization to reprocess. Applicants may propose such procedures as part of their original applications or they may submit them as preapproval supplements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Reprocessing procedures submitted with the original application normally cover only procedures which can be anticipated reasonably, are not materially influenced by the type of drug involved (i.e., there is no definite or potential effect on the manufacturing process or performance characteristics of the drug), and are ones with which the applicant has experience. Preapproval supplement submissions may also cover such procedures, but are more likely to cover a deficiency where the type of drug may have a material influence, and the reprocessing may be product specific or specific to the problem causing the need for the reprocessing. (See Office of Generic Drugs Policy and Procedure Guide  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=1 --> 23&hyph;90, dated August 9, 1990.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Reprocessing procedures submitted in an original application should be accompanied by supporting data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The applicant may choose to submit the reprocessing information after approval of the NDA, ANDA, or AADA; however, the supplement regulations require that the reprocessing procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the supporting data be approved by FDA prior to release for shipment of products made with the new procedure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Examples of supporting data needed for reprocessing procedures may include, but are not limited to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=1 --> ) A copy of the full investigative report pertaining to the out-of-specification result including all corrective actions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=1 --> ) Full analytical data and results regarding the reprocessed material. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=3 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=1 --> ) A 3-month accelerated stability study, including multipoint dissolution profiles, conducted before the drug product is released into commerce, with a commitment to conduct long-term studies and submit the resulting data to FDA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=3 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=1 --> ) Data previously generated for similar products, such as data to allow adjustment for appearance and physical parameters for other tablets or capsules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Applicants may reprocess a drug product using a procedure approved in an NDA, ANDA, or AADA, but the CGMP regulations require that the resulting product not be shipped until there is validation of the specific reprocessing procedures for that drug product. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Changes That Ordinarily May be Described Only in the Annual Report. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The repetition of one step a single time per batch in the approved sequence of the manufacturing process does not require a supplemental application and may be described in the next annual report. For example, where in-process material does not meet specifications, a firm could repeat the pertinent step, such as the filtering, drying, milling, or blending procedure. Such reprocessing must be done in conformance with the CGMP regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=1 --> FDA notes the following limitations and caveats regarding the repetition of one step of the manufacturing process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The repeated step should be done within the manufacturing parameters and the variations provided for in the approved formulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The output should conform to established specifications based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in-process testing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The repetition of one step should be a random and infrequent event. If a manufacturer finds that a step must be consistently repeated to meet specifications, this constitutes a change in the manufacturing process and requires a preapproval supplement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> C.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=3 --> Changes Made to the Physical Facility (&sect;314.70(b)(1)(v), (b)(2)(vi), and (c)(3)) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

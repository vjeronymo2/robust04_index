If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) and 407(a) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to the continued holding by the Plans of their shares of stock (the Stock) in American Heavy Lift Shipping Company (AHL), provided that (a) the Plans' independent fiduciary has determined that the Plans' holding of the Stock is appropriate for the Plans and in the best interests of the Plans' participants and beneficiaries; and (b) the Plans' independent fiduciary continues to monitor the Plans' holding of the Stock and determines at all times that such transaction remains in the best interests of the Plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Temporary Nature of Exemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the proposed exemption is granted, the exemption will be effective until the later of: (1) December 31, 1995, or (2) December 31, 1996 provided another application for exemption is filed with the Department prior to December 31, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Facts and Representations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Pension Plan is a defined benefit plan that currently has approximately 5,800 participants. As of December 31, 1992, the Pension Plan had approximately $673 million in assets. The IRAP is a defined contribution plan that currently has approximately 5,200 participants. As of December 31, 1992, the IRAP had approximately $87 million in assets. The Plans principally cover members of the International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Bear Stearns Fiduciary Services, Inc. (BSFS) is a registered investment advisor which serves as the Named Fiduciary for the Special Assets Portfolio of the Plans. The Special Assets Portfolio consists of various venture capital and other non-liquid investments which were made by a former investment manager of the Plans, Tower Asset Management, Inc. (Tower), and which were the subject of protracted litigation (the Litigation) between the Department, Tower, the Plans and certain of their trustees, and certain plan participants. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Litigation ultimately was settled pursuant to Court Order entered by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the Court).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In re Masters, Mates and Pilots Pension Plan and IRAP Litigation, Lead File No. 85 Civ. 9545 (VLB) (S.D.N.Y.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. In the course of the Litigation, BSFS was appointed Named Fiduciary for the Plans' Special Assets Portfolio by Court Order dated September 18, 1990 (the Court Order). BSFS assumed its responsibilities on November 8, 1990. The Court Order provided that the Named Fiduciary, rather than the Plans' trustees, has the ``sole, exclusive, full and complete authority and discretion concerning the control, management and disposition of the Special Assets Portfolio''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Since February, 1987, the Plans have each owned 45 shares of the Stock, which Stock represents all of the outstanding shares of AHL. AHL is a Delaware corporation, headquartered in Houston, Texas, that is engaged in the shipping industry. Its principal assets consist of four single-hulled tankers, built in the 1950's, that are used primarily for the transportation of petroleum products in the Jones Act trade (i.e., American-flagged tankers in the domestic intra-coastal trade). The Plans' Stock can be traced back to certain prior investments made by Tower and is held in the Plans' Special Assets Portfolio, along with the Plans' other remaining Tower-initiated investments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Since AHL is an employer of employees covered under the Plans, the Stock constitutes employer securities under section 407(d)(1) of the Act. The applicants represent that the Stock constituted qualifying employer securities within the meaning of section 407(d)(5) of the Act at the time of its acquisition, but as of January 1, 1993, the Stock ceased to be a qualifying employer security because the Stock is wholly-owned by the Plans and thus cannot meet the requirements of section 407(f) of the Act. However, the Plans' continued holding of the Stock is currently exempt from the prohibited transaction restrictions of the Act pursuant to Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption No. 79&hyph;15 as a result of a court order, dated November 2, 1992, entered in the Litigation (the PTE 79&hyph;15 Order). Under the terms of the PTE 79&hyph;15 Order, this exemption is effective until the later of: a) December 31, 1993; or b) December 31, 1994, provided the Plans make application to the Department for an exemption to permit the continued holding of the Stock. By filing the request which is the subject of the exemption proposed herein, the exemption provided under the PTE 79&hyph;15 Order has been automatically extended to December 31, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

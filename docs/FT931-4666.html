			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Business and the Environment: A bridge too far - Plans for a road-rail link between Sweden and Denmark are causing controversy Demolition work has started near Copenhagen's Kastrup Airport, but the buildings are not coming down to make way for a new runway. The space is needed for the approaches to a planned Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4.2bn) road and rail project which has raised the hackles of environmentalists, politicians, and the public and severely embarrassed the Swedish and Danish governments. The controversial bridge-tunnel between the two countries is designed to stretch for 17km and carry vehicles and trains. With another bridge in lower Denmark, due to open in 1995, it would provide an important commercial transport link between northern and southern Europe. The bridge's numerous opponents say the Danish and Swedish governments have not conducted required environmental impact assessments. They also contend the proposal goes against the international positions taken by both Scandinavian nations on issues such as climatic change, transport and marine protection. Although they signed the climate change treaty at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the increased traffic, and thus greenhouse gases, resulting from the bridge counter that commitment, say environmentalists. The polluted Baltic Sea is another issue. The bridge would span a crucial strait that is a narrow lifeline of salt water and oxygen for the sea's already ravaged ecosystem. Both governments - together with the other nations bordering the Baltic Sea - recently signed an international convention aimed at improving the Baltic water quality. Officials from Sweden and the new Danish administration say all environmental concerns will be satisfied before the bridge-tunnel construction begins. 'We can only say that everyone has to trust us to consider all the environmental concerns,' says Jaerel Turdin, head of planning at the Swedish environment ministry. 'Government approval will not be given before all these concerns are satisfied.' While some bridge opponents might dismiss Turdin's promises, the Centre party, of which she is a member, voted against the bridge in 1991. That was before Sweden's Social Democratic party fell from power and the non-socialist coalition, including her party, took over. Last month, bridge opponents gained a significant victory in the battle to stop the bridge when two key environmental review panels recommended against the bridge-tunnel plans. However, Sweden's prime minister, Carl Bildt, whose conservative Moderate party favours the bridge, says 'sooner or later' it will be built. In Denmark, the political situation concerning the bridge is just as muddled. The new Social Democratic government appointed in January also includes political parties that voted against the bridge in a parliamentary vote in 1991. It was in the summer of that year that the governments signed a bilateral agreement to build a train-car bridge linking the Swedish city of Malmo and Copenhagen. The resulting parliamentary votes enraged not only environmental groups, but also political parties in Sweden and Denmark. 'The decision agreed between the two governments was wrong because it committed the two nations to a train-car bridge between Malmo and Copenhagen,' says Bjorn Gillberg, one of Sweden's most prominent environmental advocates. 'The governments didn't say: 'We want a bridge that will cause the least amount of environmental damage and which also provides the least expensive option.' Therefore the agreement disregarded an option such as a train tunnel.' This is the alternative that most bridge opponents prefer if there is to be a fixed link. 'The agreement also disregarded a bridge or a tunnel between Helsingborg (in Sweden) and Helsingor (in Denmark), where the distance across the water is only a few kilometres.' Following the 1991 agreement, a consortium of Danish and Swedish consultants was established and a bridge-tunnel design drawn up. The blueprint calls for a bridge from Sweden to an artificial island several kilometres off Denmark. From there to the Danish shore, a fixed tunnel would be lowered into the sea. With the design work, the consortium spent more than Dollars 5m on an environmental impact assessment. Recognising the stiff opposition, it persuaded Gillberg, who has spent a lifetime fighting environmentally damaging projects, to oversee the study. When the environmental impact survey was completed last autumn, it was sharply criticised by environmental groups, as well as by the Swedish government's Environmental Protection Agency. The failure to examine alternatives was a significant complaint. 'The consortium was given a direct mandate from the governments,' Gillberg explains. 'They called for a train-car bridge between Malmo and Copenhagen and that is what was studied. So it is wrong to blame the consortium for not studying the alternatives.' One contentious issue is the effect of proposed dredging, which is supposed to compensate for the blockage of salt and oxygenated water caused by the bridge's large pilings. The impact study claimed deeper shipping channels would maintain adequate salt water inflow. 'Nobody knows if the dredging will work or not,' says Mats Abrahamson, a marine biologist with Greenpeace in Sweden. 'They have only computer models. The only place where the salt water reaches the Baltic will also be obstructed by the other new bridge that will be completed next year.' He adds: 'Maybe, we could take a chance if the Baltic Sea was not in such fragile condition already. But this could be the nail in the coffin.' The controversy has involved the EC Commission. 'Originally, the Commission said the bridge violated the 1985 EC directive on environmental impact assessment,' says Jan Sundergaard, a Greenpeace official in Denmark. 'But last November, after opposition against the Commission grew in Europe and subsidiarity became such an issue, the Commission dropped the bridge case.' Engineering and architectural companies in Europe are keen to obtain work from the bridge project. The problem is that it is still not clear what will be built and a final decision is some way off.</p>

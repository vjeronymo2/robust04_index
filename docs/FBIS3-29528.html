Total imports reached  $17.63 billion, up by 21 percent, while exports rose by only 15  percent at $11.269 billion.    The Philippine Airline's purchase of two airplanes ($281  million) helped increase by 26 percent the country's import bill  of $1.66 billion for last December.    Total export receipts for the month of December stood at $1  billion.    Electronic imports reached $220.15 million, up by 1.3  percent  from the previous month.    Despite a decrease of 6 percent from the previous month's  level of $181.40 million, import expenditures on power  generators for December remained substantial at $170.45 million  due to the continuing development of energy infrastructure.    Payments for mineral fuels, lubricants and related materials  amounting to $154.20 million grew by only 2.6 percent from the  November figures of $150.34 million. Compared to the year-ago  level, however, a decline of 28 percent was posted.    Importation of telecommunication equipment and electrical  machines was valued at $97.76 million. Import payments on these  commodities, however, represented a decrease of 9.5 percent from  the $108.03 million recorded during the previous month.  Aggregate payments for these principal imports reached $923.49  million, or 55.5 percent of the country's total imports for the  month.    United States and Japan continued to be the biggest  suppliers  of Philippine imports. Imports from these two countries reached  $448.45 and $353.27 million respectively, accounting for a  combined 48.2 percent of the total Philippine imports for the  month.</p>

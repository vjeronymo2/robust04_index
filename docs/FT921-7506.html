			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Maxwells reassured trustee over pension loans THE LATE Mr Robert Maxwell and his son Ian reassured one of Mirror Group Pension Fund's managers, apparently worried about loans of stock without collateral, that there was nothing improper going on barely three months before the fund was placed in administration. Minutes of the fund show that on September 2 1991, the Maxwells convened a meeting of trustees consisting only of themselves and Mr Trevor Cook, the fund's manager. At the time, the fund had 10 trustees, but had given the authority to Robert Maxwell to make decisions if a quorum were not present. At the meeting, they drafted a letter to Mr James Scrymgeour-Wedderburn of Invesco MIM, reassuring him of the propriety of the fund's stock lending activities. The Maxwells said Invesco MIM should comply with instructions from Bishopsgate Investment Management which managed the bulk of the fund's assets and added that they believed stock lending to be a proper activity for the fund. They noted that Invesco MIM was given no collateral against the shares and reassured the fund manager that stock certificates would be returned shortly. On November 20, the trustees were called together to be told that funds managed by BIM for the fund and 'held on deposit by the Robert Maxwell Group could not be repaid.' On December 3, the company publicly announced it had called auditors into the funds. Meanwhile, the minutes of the fund meetings are striking for their absence of detail. Beginning in 1988, there is no record of debate among trustees of items on the agenda, except to record that discussions of benefits took place. Minutes of decisions of the investments committee apparently do not exist and there is no reference to questions raised by trustees about the propriety of investing in several Maxwell-related companies and properties.</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: National Power focuses on export markets NATIONAL POWER, the electricity generator, yesterday provided details of a management reorganisation as it unveiled a 13 per cent increase in pre-tax profits and raised dividends by 16 per cent. The management shake-up is aimed at providing a sharper focus on target, mainly export, markets. Although the senior executive complement remains unchanged responsibilities are altering. Mr Colin Webster has been appointed managing director of the UK operation, Mr Granville Camsey becomes technology group managing director and Mr Rod Jackson corporate services managing director. The two other units, international and finance, remain with Mr Graham Hadley and Mr Brian Birkenhead. Executives below main board level have been given responsibility for targeting developments in different areas of the world as National Power attempts to fill the gap that will result from a de- clining share of the UK market. 'Our main thrust is to make National Power a leading international power business,' said Mr John Baker, chief executive. In the year to March 28, National Power made pre-tax profits of Pounds 580m (against Pounds 514m) on turnover of Pounds 4.3bn, down 8 per cent. Dividend per share is 10.6p (against 9.1p), covered 3.1 times by earnings of 32.9p (28.6p). Mr Baker said dividend cover would be cut to 'more normal levels' in future years but warned that increased domestic competition meant earnings growth prospects were less certain. Turnover in the current year was down, he said. Last year's profits increase was helped by a 4,000 reduction to 7,400 in staff numbers. This led to a 25 per cent productivity improvement. Mr Baker said the company expected to shed at least 1,000 jobs over the next two to three years. Mr Baker said the company has been in discussions with several 'serious players' about selling some of its power stations. He added that the company had considered swapping some of its stations with electricity companies overseas, though no deal was imminent. The company has provided a further Pounds 113m against future costs. The main element is an increase of Pounds 150m in provisions for rationalising and restructuring the company. See Lex</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour MPs seek monarchy review PRESSURE for Labour's constitutional agenda to include the political role of the monarchy intensified yesterday, as members of the party's constitutional commission made it clear they wanted to ensure this was included in the debate. The first meeting of the committee, chaired by Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, yesterday focused on a bill of rights. While wanting to ensure that the question of the monarchy does not overshadow its work, especially in the early stages, committee members said they wanted the issue opened up. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, the shadow public services minister, highlighted the weekly audience given by the Queen to the prime minister as one aspect of the current arrangements which should be reviewed.</p>

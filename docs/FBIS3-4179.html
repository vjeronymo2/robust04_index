			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 28 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today conferred with visiting  ROK (the Republic of Korea) Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, on  bilateral relations and international issues of common concern.    Referring to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, Qian  said there were twists and difficulties in the process of  solving this problem.    However, he said it was imperative to see that the general  trend was advancing, adding that one should be more calm and  patient at a time when there appeared difficulty in the latest  development of the situation.    Exerting pressure would only intensify contradictions, which  would be no help in solving the problem, but make it  complicated, he said.    Qian said the tense situation on the Korean peninsula would  bring no benefit to the countries in this region. Therefore it  was of vital importance to resume consultations among the four  parties so as to solve the problem.    He said it was China's hope that the parties concerned would  continue to make constructive efforts for peace to properly  settle the nuclear issue on the peninsula.    Han said the ROK stands for patient dialogue and hoped for  continuous efforts by the international community to settle the  problem properly, especially through direct dialogue between the  parties concerned.    But, he said, the window for dialogue is closed now and the  issue has been raised at the United Nations Security Council,  adding that the ROK still hoped to find a good solution to the  issue.    This afternoon, Song Jian, China's state councillor and  minister in charge of the State Science and Technology  Commission, met with Kim Si-chung, the ROK minister of science  and technology. The two exchanged views on the further growth  of bilateral cooperation in science and technology.    Wang Zhongyu, Chinese minister in charge of the State  Economic and Trade Commission, held talks with Kim Chol-su, the  ROK minister of commerce, industry and resources, during which  they explored ways and channels for expanding bilateral economic  cooperation and trade.</p>

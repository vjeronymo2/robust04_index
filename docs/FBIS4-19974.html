			<p>BFN     [Text] Jalal al-Talabani, the leader of the Kurdistan  Patriotic Union, one of the Kurdish parties in Iraq, was  received by Francois Mitterrand this morning. The Kurdish  leader earlier met Defense Minister Francois Leotard and Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe. This is not the first time Jalal  al-Talabani has been received in Paris. If he was worried by  the recent contacts between Paris and Baghdad, he must now feel  reassured. More details now with Olivier Dalage:    [Dalage] Jalal al-Talabani must be satisfied with his trip  to  France. The co-chairman of the self-governing Iraqi Kurdistan  government -- a government self-proclaimed against the Baghdad  government following the Gulf war -- was received by the most  important French leaders. Alain Juppe expressed his support for  respect of Kurdish rights, including respect of their political  rights, in the framework of Iraq's territorial integrity. For  his part, the Kurdish leader repeated his plan for a federation  incorporating broad autonomy of Iraqi Kurdistan in the framework  of the Iraqi state. The French foreign minister and his  colleague Defense Minister Francois Leotard both gave assurances  that France would continue its participation in Operation  Provide Comfort to protect Iraqi Kurds north of the 62d  parallel. If Jalal al-Talabani was somewhat apprehensive when  he arrived following recent contacts between Paris and Baghdad,  he was told by Juppe not take any notice of rumors because  France will continue its embargo as long as Iraq will not  observe all the UN Security Council resolutions.</p>

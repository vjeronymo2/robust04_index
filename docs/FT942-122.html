			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Daimler-Benz By the yardsticks used to measure the performance of chairmen of quoted companies, at least outside Germany, Mr Edzard Reuter's tenure at Daimler-Benz has not been a success. Daimler-Benz's shares have dropped by nearly 40 per cent since their historic high point in late 1986 (when Mr Reuter was still finance director), while the DAX index of Germany's 30 leading shares has risen by 35 per cent. Diversification over that period has yet to produce shareholder value. Following a spate of acquisitions, turnover climbed from DM65.5bn in 1986 to DM97.7bn last year, while pre-tax profits plunged from nearly DM6bn to a loss of DM1.8bn. This is the background against which Mr Reuter will step down from the management board next May. His successor is to be Mr Jurgen Schrempp, currently the chairman of Daimler's Deutsche Aerospace subsidiary. He is the continuity candidate at a time when a fresh approach might have been more welcome. Although Mr Schrempp is an enthusiastic cost-cutter himself, he is closely identified with the strategy of creating an 'integrated technology group'. By end of the century, Dasa may well be making a profit to rival the contribution of Mercedes, but the diversification strategy is still a question of 'jam tomorrow'.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1400 GMT on 10 March carries a  series of reports on the combat situation in the republic:    A dispatch from the 7th South Operative Group says: "After a  peaceful morning, fierce enemy attacks have resumed on the  defense lines in the operational zone of the 7th South Operative  Group. After fierce artillery attacks, the chetniks have been  attempting infantry breakthroughs in the Bandera-[word  indistinct] region. The Doboj defenders are successfully  resisting these attacks, which are still going on."    Hajrudin Fermic reports from the Maglaj front that "after  last night's massacre in the old part of Maglaj, when five  civilians were killed and 13 injured, the chetniks are today  trying to repeat this by suddenly shelling the town and by  sniper fire (?in the north). Tanks, Bofors guns, and mortars  have been used to attack at various intervals from the western  and southern side. We have learned in the emergency ward that  one person was wounded by a sniper today. The chetniks are also  continuing their rapid concentration of manpower and deployment  of armored vehicles and artillery." However, he adds, "the  fighters of the 201th Brigade and their affiliated units stand  ready to resist the offensive."    Muhamed Mujic reports from Bihac that "the fierce  Serbo-chetnik offensive continues today in the free part of the  Bihac area. In addition to the defense lines of the 5th Corps  of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the Croatian Defense Council,  the regions of Bihac and Cazin have been targeted by all kinds  of artillery and tanks. The most destructive grenades have  today been falling on Bihac, especially on its industrial zone  and suburbs. The chetniks showed their insolence and truly  desperate motives with a frontal tank assault on the base of the  French battalion in the center of Bihac last night. At 2140  [2040 GMT], tanks from the notorious aggressor's stronghold in  Grabez suddenly opened fire on the French Battalion's base,  which is clearly marked and has been there for over a year.  Several shells hit the building in which the French soldiers  are accommodated and one grenade landed in [word indistinct]  where the vehicles are parked. One truck was completely  destroyed in the powerful explosion while several vehicles have  been damaged. Luckily, according to unofficial reports, none of  the French soldiers was injured." Mujic adds here that "many  people in Bihac wonder why NATO aircraft were not called in to  help."</p>

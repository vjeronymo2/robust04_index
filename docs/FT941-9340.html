			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Shares slide as OSE lists Nikkei 300 contract A new futures and options contract for Japanese shares was launched yesterday on the Osaka Securities Exchange. The long-awaited listing of the Nikkei 300, a capitalisation weighted index, however, helped the underlying Tokyo stock market to decline 2.7 per cent as investors shifted positions from the existing Nikkei 225 futures contract. Financial authorities had long blamed the price weighted Nikkei 225 futures for the plunge of Japanese share prices, and had hoped that the Nikkei 300 would eliminate volatility. However, they were embarrassed when the announcement of the index's details in October by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun prompted a technical sell off as futures traders unloaded component stocks of the Nikkei 225 not included in the new Nikkei 300. Some traders expect further shifts in futures positions to affect Japanese stock prices in the near term. The OSE will not immediately abolish Nikkei 225 contracts, but wants the Nikkei 300 contracts to take over once trading volumes increase. The Nikkei 225 has been blamed for the slump of the Tokyo stock exchange over the past three years, triggering a spate of restrictions to curb speculative trading on the futures and options markets. Leaders of the Osaka business and financial community also hope the Nikkei 300 will restore the OSE's image. Although it is still too early to judge the success of the new futures contracts, the OSE has managed to enlist the country's large institutional investors into a group of business leaders 'promoting the Nikkei 300 to the world'. But while some foreign traders predict that in two to three years the Nikkei 300 futures market could become the largest in the world, the short-term outlook remains subdued before the March book closing period.

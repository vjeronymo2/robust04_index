			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by Hizballah; place and date not given] </F>   [Text] The recent statements and threats by several Zionist  officials, which coincide with the continuing escalation of  attacks against the southern areas, reveal premeditated and  grave Zionist designs. These designs aim to prepare for  wide-scale military operations under the pretext of defending  Zionist security, which is being threatened by the continuing  resistance operations.    Needless to say, the Zionist enemy has not and will not give  up its expansionist designs and aggressive policy. The Zionist  officials' talk about peace is only an overt maneuver to conceal  the terrorist plans being carried out against the south, the  Western al-Biqa', and the occupied Palestinian land.    The Zionist enemy leaders are searching for excuses to  escalate the situation and drive matters toward the brink of  war. The Zionist leaders believe that the threats could twist  the arm of the mujahidin and those resisting the policy of  aggression. They also think that their threats could prompt the  international community to make efforts to pacify the situation  by taking into consideration the Zionist security concerns.    However, we believe that this Zionist method has been  exposed  and that the enemy should never talk about security concerns as  long as it continues its occupation and attacks. Occupation  cannot provide the enemy with security. This is possibly what  the enemy wants so that the occupation might become a fait  accompli recognized, even implicitly, through the destruction of  the resistance role.    Resistance is a continuous embodiment of our people's  rejection of this occupation and its results, like the fait  accompli and the arrangements, which are indeed a recognition of  this occupation.    Hence, we call on everyone, particularly those who hope that  peace is imminent, not to wager on the enemy's claims and  designs. We also call on them to be more truthful with their  people and citizens. We tell them that before talking about  Lebanon's readiness to join the peace, if it ever happens, they  should talk about full preparations to confront the  possibilities of a new war that might be launched by the Zionist  enemy so that no one will be surprised.    We ask about the preparations for confrontation and  steadfastness. What has the Lebanese Government done on this  serious task? Where has the talk about the support for the  south and southerners gone? Does the way to prosperity in  Lebanon come through the purchase of shares in Solidaire or  through steadfastness in the south and the confrontation of the  continuous threats against the people, land, and waters?  Prosperity can only come through strong faith and full  readiness to offer sacrifices for the sake of regaining every  iota of cherished soil that is being occupied by the Zionists.</p>

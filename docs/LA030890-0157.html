			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACTOR RALPH WAITE PLANS TO SEEK CONGRESS SEAT;  </P> <P> CANDIDATE: STAR OF 'THE WALTONS' WILL RUN FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION IN 37TH  DISTRICT.  </P> <P> When anti-war activist and celebrity Ron Kovic told associates earlier this  week he was scrapping plans to challenge Orange County Rep. Robert Dornan,  things looked bleak for those who like a little Hollywood sizzle with their  politics.  </P> <P> But then came a bulletin from actor Ralph Waite. You remember him. Back in the  1970s, Waite played the gentle patriarch of a struggling, Depression-era  Virginia family on the popular television series "The Waltons."  </P> <P> Declaring himself "ready to contribute something on the national level," Waite  said Wednesday he plans to seek the Democratic nomination for the 37th  Congressional District, which spans most of Riverside County.  </P> <P> If he wins the nomination, Waite almost assuredly would face four-term  incumbent Al McCandless, a Republican, in November's general election.  McCandless is expected to easily win renomination in the June 5 primary.  </P> <P> "It is time to get in there and make our country work better," Waite, a Rancho  Mirage resident, said in an interview Wednesday. "I don't believe the problems  that concern our district -- education, the environment, health care, senior  citizens' issues -- are being properly attended to by our current  representative."  </P> <P> Waite, 61, will need more than an endorsement from "John Boy," his trustworthy  television son, to topple McCandless. The veteran politician has cultivated a  loyal -- and generous -- group of followers during his eight years in Congress  and the previous 12 years he spent as a Riverside County supervisor.  </P> <P> McCandless, a La Quinta resident, defeated his last two Democratic opponents by  roughly 2-1 margins. And the most recent voter registration figures for the  district show Republicans holding a 48% to 43% edge over Democrats.  </P> <P> "This district has always been viewed as a no-win situation for Democrats,"  conceded Tom Sherer, a local Democratic leader.  </P> <P> "Ralph Waite is a fine man and would no doubt have a lot to offer any  congressional district," said Assemblyman Steve Clute (D-Riverside). "But that  particular district is a tough one and Al McCandless has been popular."  </P> <P> Still, Clute added, "I would not underestimate Ralph's ability to raise money  and develop grass-roots support."  </P> <P> McCandless did not seem perturbed about the prospect of a celebrity opponent.  </P> <P> "I've met Ralph and he's a personable individual who has been active in the  community," the 62-year-old McCandless said. But "aside from some name  recognition," the actor doesn't have much to offer "when you consider my depth  of experience," the congressman said.  </P> <P> Julie Bornstein, a Palm Springs attorney and member of the state Democratic  Central Committee, praised Waite as "someone who is committed, bright and  sincere."  </P> <P> "We've got a lot of celebrities out here, and you see them at functions," said  Bornstein, who serves with Waite on the board of a Coachella Valley group that  provides housing for low-income people. "But Ralph is someone who rolls up his  sleeves and actually does work for charities. That's rare."  </P> <P> Waite, who describes himself as a moderate, joins two others seeking the 37th  District Democratic nomination -- Jeffrey Jacobs, a paper salesman from Moreno  Valley, and Johnny Pearson, a retired Air Force master sergeant from the Lake  Elsinore area who lost to McCandless in 1988.  </P> <P> Although Waite mulled a run against McCandless in 1988, concern about finances  and a lack of organized Democratic Party support dissuaded him. This year, one  of "the final nudges" persuading him to run, he said, was hearing  Czechoslovakian President Vaclav Havel, a playwright-turned-politician ,  deliver a speech to Congress last month.  </P> <P> "I got a sense of how inspiring our democracy and freedom are to other people  in the world," Waite recalled. "I decided . . . this was the occasion to  rededicate myself to our political life."  </P> <P> Though best known for his portrayal of papa John Walton, Waite served as a  social worker, a Presbyterian minister and a religious book editor before  becoming an actor.  </P></p>

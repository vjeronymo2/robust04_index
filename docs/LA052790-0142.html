			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIL FERGUSON DOESN'T DESERVE REELECTION;  </P> <P> PRIMARY CHALLENGER PHYLLIS BADHAM PREFERABLE TO 70TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT  INCUMBENT  </P> <P> Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) has been representing the 70th  District for nearly six years. That's long enough. He has an acceptable  opponent in the Republican primary this year: Phyllis Badham, a 30-year-old  public relations manager.  </P> <P> Badham, the daughter of former U.S. Rep. Robert E. Badham (R-Newport Beach), is  politically inexperienced, but has energy and ambition. She is preferable to  Ferguson, whose tenure in the Capitol has been marred by petty partisan  politics that have done nothing to aid his district. GOP voters should give  Badham the nomination which, given the solidly Republican makeup of the  district, would virtually assure her victory in November.  </P> <P> Ferguson, 67, simply has not represented his district well. While problems with  traffic and air pollution have grown more serious, he has made himself best  known for an obsession with Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), a former  anti-Vietnam War demonstrator whom Ferguson declared "a traitor." Ferguson, a  former Marine, has made numerous attempts to have Hayden ousted from the  Assembly, prompting one critic to suggest that Ferguson move to Santa Monica to  run against him. For his efforts, Ferguson got a lot of publicity and the  nickname "Rambo" but nothing for his constituents.  </P> <P> Ferguson recently showed his mean-spiritedness by casting tasteless aspersions  on gay activists -- whom he called "faggots" -- a label he later said he didn't  know was derogatory. "I could have called them sodomites," Ferguson said later.  On another earlier occasion, he angered Japanese-Americans when he objected to  state funding for a memorial that would have recognized California's unfair  internment of thousands during World War II.  </P> <P> At a time when his constituents have been concerned about growth, Ferguson has  led the fight against local restrictions on development. At a time when the  majority of his district favors leaving a woman to make the choice over her  reproductive system, Ferguson strongly opposes it. For the current campaign, he  even enlisted Operation Rescue, the aggressive anti-abortion group. Ferguson's  record on environmental legislation has been poor.  </P> <P> The 70th District -- which includes Newport Beach, Laguna Beach, San Juan  Capistrano, Mission Viejo, El Toro, Dana Point, Costa Mesa and several other  Orange County cities -- deserves better representation than Ferguson has  provided.  </P></p>

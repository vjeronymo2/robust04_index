			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> HANGING IN PAID OFF, GERE SAYS  </P> <P> What a difference a year makes, says actor Richard Gere.  </P> <P> "Last year at this time, I looked around and asked, 'Why aren't I being offered  certain movies?' And the hard answer was, 'You're not box office, pal,' " Gere  said in May's Vanity Fair.  </P> <P> The actor says his appeal had dropped so severely after movie bombs such as  "King David" and "Power" that he considered saying sayonara to the big screen.  </P> <P> "There was a point where I thought the courageous choice would be to get out of  the business. But then I thought, 'No, the courageous thing is to stay in it,"'  Gere recalled.  </P> <P> His choice paid off, with "Internal Affairs" and the current "Pretty Woman"  reviving the career of the one-time "American Gigolo."  </P></p>

He talked about China's  preparations for scientific and technological development for  the 1990's, the reform of the science and technology structure,  and the integration of science and technology.    Minister Song Jian is warm and friendly. He is wise and firm  in his conversational style, analyzing problems brilliantly and  thoroughly. He has good poise as a leader and demonstrates the  qualities of a scholar.    This reporter had read a brief biography of Song Jian and  knew that he was not only an outstanding leader in political  circles but also a scientist with great attainments. As a  member of the institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, he  is noted in scientific circles for his systematic cybernetics.  In designing and leading the development of China's  surface-to-air missile control system, antiballistic-missile  weapons, nuclear submarine-launched missiles, and  telecommunications satellites, Mr. Song has made great efforts  and numerous achievements. The celebrated scientist Qian Xuesen  once praised Song Jian as a "Chinese authority on cybernetics."  <H5>  Seize the Opportunity To Quicken Development </H5>   Minister Song told this reporter that the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, which ended not long  ago, made an important policy decision about further reforming  the science and technology structure and clearly stated that the  goal of science and technology structural reform is to establish  a new structure which suits the development of the socialist  market economy, conforms to the laws of the development of  science and technology themselves, promotes scientific and  technological progress, and scales new scientific and  technological heights, to achieve the comprehensive and  coordinated development of the economy, science, technology, and  society. He said it is a heartening and achievable goal.    He said that Deng Xiaoping recently pointed out: "In  history, China has not had many opportunities for vigorous  development." Looking back at history, for various reasons, the  Chinese had missed several good opportunities for vigorous  development and this is deeply regretted. China is now faced  with an opportunity which is very rare in the history of  development. We must cherish this opportunity and seize it to  quicken reform and opening up and the pace of development,  enhance the country's strength, and improve the people's living  standards. Song Jian said, with deep feeling, that people will  use this to assess the achievements and inadequacies in the  future.  <H5>  Strategic Task For the 1990's </H5>   This reporter asked him how he interpreted the principle of  "stabilizing one end and opening up the other end," as stated in  the "Decision," for scientific and technological development and  what was the significance of it.    Song Jian said: That is an important guiding principle for  science and technology structural reform. Stabilizing one end  demands that we make great efforts to ensure the sustained and  steady development of key basic research projects and high-tech  research, tackling key scientific and technological problems  which have a bearing on the national economy and the people's  livelihood; support and save the stamina for the long-term  development of science and technology; and continuously bring  new ideas for technological innovations. Opening up the other  end means that we need to spur the commercialization,  industrialization, and internationalization of scientific and  technological fruits, making a greater contribution to the  establishment of a socialist market economic system.  "Stabilizing one end" and "opening up the other end" are  interdependent. Neither of the two is indispensable. This is a  crucial step toward settling the question of integrating science  and technology and the economy.    Minister Song Jian stressed: A central question which has  puzzled us for a long time is the separation between science and  technology and economic development. Since reform and opening  up, we have taken a very important step on this question and  have obtained notable achievements. However, for the complete  settlement of this question we still need the concerted efforts  and struggle of the scientific and technological circles and the  economic and financial circles.    He pointed out that establishing a science and technology  structure which suits the socialist market economy and forming  an economic structure which is conducive to technological  progress are important strategic tasks for the 1990's.    What aspects should be particularly emphasized in China's  current scientific and technological development? In reply,  Song Jian said:    --Step up agricultural science and technology. In  the mid-21st century, China will probably have a population of  1.6 billion people. Only by maintaining an independent, steady,  and sufficient supply of farm products can we guarantee the  survival and development of the Chinese nation and this is  determined by China's specific national conditions. China needs  to increase its grain output by 50 percent by that time. In the  face of the huge population pressure and unpredictable natural  disasters, the levels of agricultural science and technology  must be improved very considerably. Therefore, it is an  immediate task to develop high-yield, quality, and  high-efficiency agriculture.    --Quicken the development rate of high and new  technology. During the 1990's, we will continue to organize  and guide a large number of scientific research organizations  and scientific and technical personnel into the market to  develop high- and new-tech industries. By the end of this  century, high added-value exports will rise from the current 5  percent to 10 or 20 percent. We must develop our own high- and  new-tech industries. We must have great courage, take the  offensive, open up markets, enhance our strength, participate in  competition, build up a number of large modern corporations, and  form an energetic force to compete with the developed nations.  At that time, our science and technology will occupy a place in  the world.    --Step up basic research. Basic research is the  fountain of the scientific and technological productive forces,  the vanguard of new technologies and new inventions, and the  backing for science and technology as a whole. Once we make  great breakthroughs in it, it will inevitably mean great  progress in production technology, in the economy, and in  society. Therefore, China will maintain a sophisticated,  high-efficiency, and high-level basic research system as a  backing for the long-term development of science and technology  and will increase inputs in it so that we can catch up with the  world and make new breakthroughs in some of the most important  basic research disciplines, new research disciplines, and  interdisciplinary sciences.  <H5>  An Earnest Hope </H5>   "The country's future lies in science and technology." This  is a line from one of Song Jian's poems. He said: The  scientific and technological circles all over the country are  shouldering the heavy task of invigorating the motherland with  science and technology. In order to achieve this historic task,  it is necessary to mobilize all positive factors, unite friends  at home and abroad, and struggle devotedly. During the  conversation, he leafed through the 1994 editions of CHING CHI  TAO PAO and showed contentment with its development and  progress. Moreover, he earnestly hoped that CHING CHI TAO PAO  will contribute more to promoting scientific, technological, and  economic exchanges between the mainland and Hong Kong and Macao.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sofia Khorizont Radio Network in  Bulgarian at 0758 GMT on 27 May begins a live relay of the  morning session of the National Assembly in Sofia, where Indian  President Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma is scheduled to address  deputies.    At 0801 a correspondent reports that Dr. Sharma's arrival  seems to have been delayed, and proceeds to summarize the  proceedings of the preceding ministers' question time session.  He says that Prime Minister Berov answered a Union of  Democratic Forces (SDS) question on the government's financial  policy, following which an SDS vote of censure was defeated.  After this, Industry Minister Rumen Bikov answered a question  on the Neftokhim Oil Refinery.    At 0810 GMT the correspondent announces the arrival of Dr.  Sharma. National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov formally  introduces Dr. Sharma and invites him to speak.    Dr. Sharma begins his speech in his native language, with a  simultaneous Bulgarian translation read out by the  correspondent. After a formal expression of thanks, he reviews  the development of the young Indian democracy, praising the key  contribution of Nehru, and quoting his words: "Democracy is not  merely a political and economic matter, but something linked  with reason. It includes the maximum equality of opportunity  for all people in political and economic respects; and it  includes liberty for the individual to develop his best  qualities." He notes that this year is the 30th anniversary of  the death of "the outstanding world leader" Jawaharlal Nehru,  "who provided an invaluable contribution to the cause of  parliamentary democracy," whose spirit "is present today in the  life of the institutions and processes of democracy in India,"  and "whose contribution is of immense importance for the  dynamics of politics throughout the world."    At 0821 GMT he offers India's warm greetings and good wishes  to the Bulgarian parliament, "democratically elected as the  result of the first multiparty elections in your country." He  reminds the deputies: "You represent the will of your people."    Dr. Sharma then reviews the historical development of  "spirit  of democracy in India." He notes that "the Buddha's legacy and  testament" "influenced the establishment of pluralism and  harmony." This and the ancient Vedic teachings are "key  concepts" that lie behind present-day political life in India.  Further to this, Dr. Sharma notes, "respect for the law is a  permanent feature" of our spirit. "In our society, the law is  historically identified with the truth, and not merely as a  mechanism for ensuring law and order." He reviews the  development of basic elements of parliamentary democracy in  ancient India, including "the establishment and functioning of a  representative assembly,... quorums, open voting, and secret  ballots." He says "this created a lasting tradition of  democratic mechanisms," and notes the important role of the  traditional rural councils in India.    Further, Dr. Sharma notes that "these democratic traditions  and values substantially influenced the main features of our  liberation movement," based on the campaign launched by Mahatma  Gandhi in the name of "human liberty, dignity, and nonviolence."  He emphasizes the peaceful and nonviolent nature of the  independence struggle.    The Indian president goes on to declare that "parliamentary  democracy is the political system that most suits the cultural  character and political aspirations of India." He notes that  "elections are a key aspect of the democratic process," and that  almost 280 million voted in the last Indian parliamentary  elections. However, Dr. Sharma says, "democracy is not only a  matter of elections." He points out that "true democracy is a  synthesis of the rights and obligations of the individual and  the state," that "democratic politics personify the principles  of consistency and change that are so important for the life of  a nation," and that "discipline and restraint are decisive  elements that determine whether a democratic system develops or  disintegrates." He says that "democratic consensus and national  development can only exist when peace and understanding are  present," and that the equality of all citizens before the law  is also an important component.    At 0832 he refers to the recent visits of the chairman of  the  lower house of the Indian parliament to Bulgaria, and of  National Assembly Chairman Yordanov to India with a  parliamentary delegation. He hopes that these fruitful  parliamentary contacts will continue and develop, promoting  cooperation and mutual understanding. Dr. Sharma ends his  formal speech at 0835.    National Assembly Speaker Yordanov thanks Dr. Sharma for his  exposition of the principles governing democracy as developed in  India. He assures the Indian president "that your visit to the  Republic of Bulgaria really opens a new page in the relations  between our two countries," and then declares a 10-minute  recess. The relay ends at 0838.</p>

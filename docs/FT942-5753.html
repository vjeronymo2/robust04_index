			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Germany's FDP struggles to stay afloat: Former kingmakers acknowledge their fate is tied to Kohl's The leadership of Germany's Free Democratic party, the junior partner in the governing coalition, will today in Rostock begin its struggle to convince disillusioned supporters the party is still worthy of being called the 'kingmakers' of the German political system. The party, which made and broke ruling coalitions of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, is struggling to keep its head above the German electoral water. A spate of recent opinion polls gives the FDP just about 5 per cent, the minimum to secure representation in the Bundestag, or lower house. Any successful outcome of this three-day congress depends on Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, who less than a year ago was elected chairman. His task is to impose discipline on an unruly party which increasingly realises, and fears, that its fate is tied to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union. Mr Kinkel, a former civil servant and head of Germany's secret service who joined the party only three years ago, has found it difficult to stamp his authority on the party - unlike his predecessor, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who still hovers in the background. Earlier this year, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the party leader in North Rhine-Westphalia and former economics minister who had to resign over a scandal, suggested that the FDP ditch Mr Kinkel and name its own candidate for chancellor. The party rallied around Mr Kinkel. But the internal dissent has continued largely because the FDP is losing a sense of what role 'liberalism' plays in a party which has shared power for nearly 25 years. 'We see ourselves as upholders of free-market values in the coalition, and of civil liberties,' said one senior party official. Yet its ability to practise what it purports to stand for has been increasingly undermined, particularly over the past four years in power with the CDU. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the FDP economics minister, has been unable to gain enough support for a plan to introduce deregulation, particularly in the energy sector. His colleague Mr Otto Lambsdorff, the party's economic spokesman, was this year forced to shelve his own plans for a revived 1994 federal budget in order to cut the deficit to DM70bn (Pounds 28bn). The liberals have also disappointed the left wing of the party by having to support the CDU's law and order campaign and possible powers for the police to bug private homes. As a further affront, Mr Kinkel, despite much dissent, secured enough backing - in the third and final ballot - for Mr Roman Herzog, Mr Kohl's candidate as federal president. In doing so, the FDP signed up to support the CDU and ruled out any possible future coalition with the Social Democrats. Last month's presidential election showed that, despite ideological differences with the CDU, one principle binds the FDP together: the wish to remain in power. 'If the truth be known, we are no longer the great king makers any more,' a deputy said. 'We know our fate is now tied to Kohl. We are seen by the electorate as part of the government. If the CDU goes up in the polls, it can only do us good. We cannot jump ship now and move over to the SPD. By backing Herzog, we backed the CDU in their bid for extending power after next October.' Yet the traditional liberals would probably argue that it is time the FDP had a stint out of power in order to re-group and redefine their role in a united Germany. 'We might be out for ever then,' one official quipped, adding that this prospect alone might give the chance for Mr Kinkel to unite the party and march behind the chancellor. But its disillusioned supporters will need much persuading between now and October that the party deserves to be returned to the Bundestag.</p>

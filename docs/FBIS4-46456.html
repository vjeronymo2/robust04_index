			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Dolinin of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA: "Another </F> Regiment Equipped With `Topol' Missiles on Combat Alert Duty"]    [Text] As has already been reported in KRASNAYA  ZVEZDA, three missile regiments armed with the RS-12M Topol  mobile missile systems have joined the force composition of the  Strategic Rocket Forces [RVSN]. These are replacing those  removed from duty earlier in strict conformity with  international agreements.    The regiment commanded by Colonel Vladimir Kashkin is  stationed in Yoshkar-Ola. It entered combat alert duty on April  19. Our correspondents report on this event.    Division commander Major-General Musa Tsechoyev relates that  this is not the first rearmament in the 30-year history of the  formation, which is now armed with RS-12 (SS-13) and RS-12M  (SS-25) missiles. But this one is a special event, since it is  taking place in difficult times for the country.    The new regiment was formed almost two years ago. It was  manned partly with servicemen who had come from Belarus and  Ukraine. There was much work to do. They had to get set up. The  combat position required was a new one, but there were no funds  to speak of.    "We are working in debt today," said the chief of the UNR  [Directorate of the Chief of Operations], Colonel Aleksandr  Katyukhin, "we have taken on two billion in debt at the bank."    The missile troops themselves took up the shovels, but the  main thing was to learn the hardware that they would be  receiving. The three-month practice at the proving ground at  Mirnyy was a real test. It concluded with a special tactical  exercise that was rated as "good."    The president and head of the government of the Republic of  Mariy El, Vladislav Zotin, and the assistant commander-in-chief  of the RVSN for indoctrination, Major-General Nikolay Moroz,  visited the formation on the day they went onto combat alert  duty.    The president answered a question about what the attitude of  the strategic missile troops to the republic is by saying, "Most  respectful. We have good, businesslike relations."    The first to enter combat alert duty along with the  commander  were Lieutenant-Colonel Anatoliy Nazarov, Majors Aleksandr  Dubovik, Aleksandr Bolgarskiy, Captain Aleksandr Rudkin, Senior  Lieutenant Igor Bachev, Warrant Officer Elvira Volkova... They  possibly did not think that their taking of their combat posts  would go down in history.    It was no accident that Deputy Regimental Commander  Lieutenant-Colonel Vitaliy Lezhanin distributed historic  information on the Guards Red Banner Akhtyr-Aleksandriya Orders  of Kutuzov and Bogdan Khmelnitskiy Regiment to the  correspondents--a large portion of the officers from the  reinforcements had served in it. This had been a Hussar regiment  at one time under the command of Denis Davydov, in which  Lermontov and Alyabev had served... The unit also won honor in  the Great Patriotic War. Its battle standard and orders are now  in the Central Museum of the Armed Forces.    "For some reason," the missile troops puzzled, "we are  easily  able to part with legendary history, and are creating a new  regiment. It is as if we are starting with a clean slate."    It would perhaps be fair to preserve the honored name for  the  new, Topol regiment, for which everything lies ahead.</p>

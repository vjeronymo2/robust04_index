			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Markets: Inventories fever disperses doldrums - Wall Street In the middle of the summer doldrums it usually requires something important for Wall Street traders to suddenly stop talking about the exciting issues of the day, which this week were - in no particular order - the impending baseball strike, the OJ Simpson case, and the state of Cindy Crawford's marriage. It happened yesterday, however, and few could have guessed what it would be that so excited the traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and in the dealing rooms around Wall Street. Was it a presidential scandal? No. An invasion of Haiti? Wrong. A bank collapse? Think again. The subject of everyone's discussions on Wall Street yesterday was inventories. Or, as the economics dictionary describes them: 'stocks of raw materials, work in progress and finished goods.' Exciting, isn't it? While inventories do not normally make pulses race. Wall Street economists had palpitations yesterday when the second quarter economic growth figures were released. The data showed a 3.7 per cent rise in gross domestic product between April and June, a figure that was at the bottom end of market expectations. The real story, however, was in the inventories data. According to the Commerce Department, the value of inventories jumped Dollars 27.9bn to Dollars 58.5bn, the biggest increase in three years. The rise was so large that it accounted for 2.2 percentage points of the 3.7 per cent gain in GDP. In other words, economic growth rose handsomely in the second quarter less because demand for goods climbed, but more because companies bought materials that never left the factory floor or produced goods that never left the shelves. In fact, demand growth was relatively weak - final sales of domestic product rose only 1.5 per cent in the quarter. A big build-up of inventories usually means one of two things. Either, the build-up was voluntary as companies produced more goods to meet an anticipated peak in demand. Or, it was involuntary as companies were left with an unexpectedly large amount of unsold goods because demand weakened. If it was the former, then it suggests that the economy will continue to grow strongly. If it was the latter, then it suggests the economy is slowing down, probably because of the recent rise in interest rates. Which of the two factors were at work was the question everyone was asking on Wall Street. Elias Bikhazi, an economist at Deutsche Bank, asked: 'Does it constitute an overhang for the second half?' John Ryding senior economist at Bear Stearns, said: 'The question is, were the inventory accumulations unwanted?' And Ken Maryland of Society National Bank commented: 'I've got to believe in some quarters it was unwelcome.' The bond market, typically, wasted little time worrying about what the answer might be. It decided that inventories rose in the second quarter because demand had slowed unexpectedly. This could only be good news for investors in fixed-income securities, who fear that rising economic growth will push up inflation, which undermines the value of their investments. The rush to buy bonds in the wake of this calculation lifted the 30-year government bond almost one and a half points during the morning, and pushed the yield - a key determinant of long-term interest rates - down from 7.55 per cent to 7.41 per cent. Share prices rallied along with bonds, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing 30 points as equity investors bet that the apparent slowdown in economic growth indicated by the jump in inventories would dissuade the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates again. The Fed's open market committee is due to meet on August 16, and most economists were thinking this week that it would vote to raise rates one more time. The inventories data, however, have given the economists cause to think again. Yet, not everyone on Wall Street was convinced that the rise in inventories was good news for bonds and stocks. A few discordant voices pointed out that the bulk of the rise in inventories was at the wholesale trade level, which is largely imported products. 'That's a sign that companies are buying goods ahead of price increases,' explained Mike Strauss, an economist at Yamaichi International. In other words, inventories rose not because of slower domestic demand, but because US companies were stockpiling materials and goods produced abroad before prices went up. Strauss, however, was in a minority. For most on Wall Street, inventories were up because demand was down. This suggested interest rates probably would not go up, so bond yields should go down, and stocks up.  ------------------------------- Monday       3741.84   +   06.80 Tuesday      3735.68   -   06.16 Wednesday    3720.47   -   15.21 Thursday     3730.83   +   10.36 Friday       3764.50   +   33.67  -------------------------------</p>

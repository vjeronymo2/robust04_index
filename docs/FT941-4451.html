			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Clinton officials give Whitewater evidence Three White House officials yesterday gave evidence in secret to a federal grand jury investigating the Whitewater affair. Stacks of relevant documents were also turned over to the same panel, convened by Mr Robert Fiske, the independent counsel probing Whitewater. The officials called yesterday were understood to be Mr Mark Gearan, the communications director, Ms Margaret Williams, chief of staff to Mrs Hillary Clinton, and Ms Lisa Caputo, the First Lady's press secretary. All are said to have attended meetings with regulatory officials investigating Madison Guaranty, the failed savings and loan institution at the centre of the Whitewater affair, involving Mr and Mrs Clinton's 1980s financial dealings in Arkansas. Other senior White House and treasury officials have secured temporary postponement of testimony, most until next week. But one of them, Mr Roger Altman, the deputy secretary of the treasury, confessed in an interview yesterday with the Wall Street Journal to 'a piece of awful judgment' in arranging a meeting on February 2 with the White House to discuss the status of the Madison inquiry. He was then acting head of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency formed to clean up the nationwide savings and loan debacle of the 1980s. He said he never told the president, First Lady, or Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, in advance about his initiative in briefing the White House, but insisted the session was purely informational. Republicans have alleged the briefings were improper and raised the possibility of official tampering in the case. Washington suspects Mr Altman, the Wall Street investment banker who has been a high flyer in the administration, may be the next prominent victim of Whitewater. Although the White House insists there is no question of his resignation, his chances of succeeding Mr Bentsen have clearly diminished. President Bill Clinton went on the road to New York yesterday for speaking engagements to give the impression of business as usual. The threat of early congressional hearings on Whitewater, which Mr Fiske said could interfere with his own inquiries, appeared to recede. Senator William Cohen, the Maine Republican, doubted yesterday that hearings could be held before June. The president could also take some encouragement from two polls published yesterday which showed that, notwithstanding a torrent of critical and now nationwide media coverage, the public is still unpersuaded by the seriousness of Whitewater. The Wall Street Journal/NBC survey found 34 per cent believing it was being used against him for political purposes, with only 16 per cent persuaded he had done anything wrong. The USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll found well over half convinced Mr and Mrs Clinton had done something unethical. But both reported only a little erosion in the first couple's approval ratings.</p>

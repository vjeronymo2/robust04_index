			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): US oil sector - Other Companies The tumble in the oil price late last year is unlikely to make much of a dent in the earnings of the big US-based integrated oil and gas groups when they report fourth-quarter figures this week. Cheaper oil will boost profit margins in their refining and service station businesses - in some cases more than offsetting lower earnings upstream in exploration and production. Bouyed by this, and the prospect of benefits from cuts in costs, Mr Paul Ting of Oppenheimer in New York has raised his fourth-quarter earnings estimates for a number of the majors: Amoco to 83 cents a share, Chevron to Dollars 1.60 a share, Exxon to 96 cents a share, Mobil to Dollars 1.40 a share and Texaco to 87 cents a share.</p>

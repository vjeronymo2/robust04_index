			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 9 (TASS) -- KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA  publishes today an interview with Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev, who said: "If Rutskoy or Zhirinovskiy (former  vice president of Russia and the leader of the Liberal  Democratic Party) become president, Russia will not survive...  I do not see any accord on this matter... What is the essence  of it? Should we reach accord on observing the constitution?  The whole nation voted for the constitution. But those who  called for violence in Russia should be kept in prison. As long  as Zhirinovskiy does not give up his openly fascist slogans, as  long as Rutskoy does not give up hope for actually repeating in  Russia the Yugoslav model, I shall never be in agreement with  them."    ROSSIYSKIE VESTI carries an article by Anatoliy Sliva,  deputy  to the State Duma and chairman of the committee for local  self-government. "Russia will be neither democratic, nor  law-governed, nor social state, if we do not ensure real local  self-government, real people's power... The complexity of the  problem consists in the fact that it is in the focus of various  interests, some of which contradict each other, including those  which are hampering the formation of real self-government."    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an article, entitled "After  Predicting the Establishment of a Dictatorial Regime, Alexey  Kazannik Tenders Resignation for the Second Time." It analyses  the reasons for that step, taken by the former  prosecutor-general of Russia. The newspaper quotes an interview  with Kazannik, the whole of which will be published in the next  issue. He said: "After my dramatic resignation I saw for myself  that President Boris Yeltsin needs a fully controllable,  (?puppet) prosecutor-general, who will fulfil any, even illegal  orders, and not only of the president, but also of some clerks  from his administration."    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA publishes an article about Russia's  Middle East policy, which says: "Moscow's activity in the Middle  East is described as one of the reasons for the correction of  Washington's foreign political course. However, the Russian  Foreign Ministry believes that the participation in the  settlement of Middle East problems is the most natural thing for  Russia, and refutes both accusations of the attempts to get  political dividends and the element of competitiveness between  Moscow and Washington in the Middle East."    "Russia has become a sort of Mecca for illegal migrants,"  Yuriy Arkhipov, head of the external migration department of the  Federal Migration Service, said in an interview with  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. "From the legal point of view, it is not  refugees who come to Russia, but people claiming the status of a  refugee. They can get it only after a corresponding procedure,  which presupposes an appeal to migration services. Foreigners  who have not undergone that procedure cannot be regarded as  refugees are are living on the territory of the country  illegally. According to law-enforcement agencies, there are  about half a million of immigrants from foreign countries, and  their number continues to grow."    TRUD carries one more article about the causes of the crash  of the A-310 plane near Novokuznetsk. "Valeriy Ekskuzyan,  director-general of the Rossiyskie Avialinii air company,  expressed disagreement with the preliminary conclusions of the  government commission. He stressed that the commission's  statement about the presence of third persons in the cabin is  groundless. Some senior officials from the Russian Ministry of  transport share his view. They say there is no indication to the  incompetent operaration of the plane, which could cause its  crash," the newspaper writes.    A decree of President Yeltsin and a corresponding order of  the defence minister have actually given a new shape to the  anti-aircraft defence troops: in the future they will become a  basis for the creation of Russia's air and space defence, Air  Force Colonel General Viktor Prudnikov, commander-in-chief of  the anti-aircraft defence troops, said in an interview with  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA published today. This will be a natural thing  to do, because the air and space defence spheres are so closely  connected with each other that they have long been regarded as a  single whole, Prudnikov said. The principle of the formation of  the anti-aircraft defence system will also be changed. It will  become entirely different and will be based on a territorial  principle. Anti-aircraft defence zones and districts will be  created within the time limit set by the defence minister.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an interview with Vyacheslav  Bulavkin, director-general of the Technomash production  amalgamation, which is the chief enterprises in the sphere of  rocket and space technologies. "Everyday life continually brings  to my mind one and the same alarming thought: what will be the  first to come -- the realisation by the government and the  legislators of the importance of the Russian defence industry,  in which an enormous scientific and technological potential is  concentrated and millions of people are working, or a social  explosion? Experiments should not be staged on a live  organism..."    PRAVDA publishes an article by Valeriy Zorkin, ex-chairman  of  the Constitutional Court, who writes: "The efficiency of power  itself is the most important problem today, because order  cannot be restored in the country without it. Strict discipline  in the state apparatus and the curbing of the corruption of  bureaucrats should become the first steps towards an agreement  on national harmony, towards the consent of society to the  taking of anti-crisis measures by these very power structures  ... National harmony is possible only on the basis of changing  a catastrophic course, imposed by radical `democrats'". Echoing  Zorkin, Chairman of the Russian Christian Democratic Movement  Viktor Aksyuchits said in an interview with PRAVDA: "Personal,  group ambitions should not get an upper hand over common  interest -- those of the nation and the state. In any case, a  chance for reaching accord should not be missed."    The NEVSKOE VREMYA newspaper writes that cases of "housing  racket" are becoming more frequent in St. Petersburg. As a  rule, criminals steal keys, penetrate a flat and force its  owners, using violence, to sign documents for unequal exchange  or the sale of the apartment. The worsening of the crime  situation in the country is influencing the situation in the  armed forces, the St. Petersburg-based newspaper NA STRAZHE  RODINY writes. It was reported at a session of the military  council of the Leningrad military district that several attacks  on sentries had taken place in the district during the past  year. Several cases of stealing arms and ammunition and leaving  one's unit without permission were also registered.</p>

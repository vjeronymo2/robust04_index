			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Indosuez succumbs to pressure on French banks BANQUE Indosuez, a subsidiary of Suez, the troubled French holding company, yesterday highlighted the pressures on the French banking sector by revealing a sharp fall in net profits to FFr101m (Dollars 18m) last year from FFr805m in 1991. Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani, chairman, said he hoped Indosuez would move back towards 'normal profits' this year. However, its poor performance in 1992 was one of the main reasons for last week's announcement by Suez that it made a loss last year for the first time. Suez's shares, which have risen rapidly on takeover speculation since last week's disclosure, yesterday rose again by FFr2.20 to close at FFr320.70. Market sources said more than 870,000 Suez shares were traded yesterday after 1.6m shares (more than 1 per cent of the capital) changed hands on Friday. Axa, the French insurance group, Mr James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French industrialist, and Mr Jean-Marc Vernes, the French financier, have been mooted as possible bidders for Suez, one of France's most prominent holding companies with interests spread across industry and finance. Suez does have the support of several 'friendly' shareholders. One of Suez's chief problems has been the difficulties of its banking subsidiaries, which include Banque La Henin as well as Indosuez, both of which have been heavily exposed to the precarious state of the property market, particularly in Paris. Indosuez, one of France's leading investment banks, was forced to raise its net provisions from FFr1.55bn in 1991 to FFr3.59bn in 1992 mainly because of its losses on loans to property developers. The bank was also hit by the fragile state of small businesses. These pressures took a toll on net profits despite an increase in exceptional gains to FFr1.3bn in 1992 from FFr362m in 1991. Indosuez was also resilient on the operational front with net banking income up at FFr11.31bn from FFr10.93bn over the same period and gross operating profits to FFr3.78bn from FFr3.46bn mainly due to its expansion in Asia and the Middle East.</p>

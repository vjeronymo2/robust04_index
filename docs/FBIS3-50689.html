			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rocio Vicente from the "Newspaper of the </F> Airwaves" newscast]    [Text] There are definitely eight military officers  involved in the disappearance of the students and a professor  from the Enrique Guzman University, La Cantuta, according to  General Guido Guevara Guerra, the new president of the Supreme  Council of Military Justice. Guevara Guerra said a general is  one of those involved but for the time being he will not reveal  where the detainees are being held.    [Begin recording] [Guevara Guerra] Ask yourselves why he is  under arrest.    [Unidentified reporter] Why?    [Guevara Guerra] Because he is responsible. That is the  first thing [passage indistinct]. Eight people are under arrest.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Guevara Guerra] I do not know. We will have to take a look  at the result of the investigations. We also have to respect  the judge's work. [passage indistinct] [end recording]    Those were some of the statements by the new president of  the  Supreme Council of Military Justice, who also said that the  military courts will respect the Supreme Court's jurisdiction in  the La Cantuta case. But he did say his personal preference  would be for the case to be handled by a military court.</p>

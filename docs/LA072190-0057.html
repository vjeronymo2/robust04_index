			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH VERDICTS VOIDED BY U.S. APPEALS COURT;  </P> <P> IRAN-CONTRA: ONE IS OVERTURNED. TWO OTHERS SET ASIDE UNTIL ISSUE OF MISUSE OF  IMMUNIZED TESTIMONY IS RESOLVED.  </P> <P> A U.S. appeals court Friday voided the three-count conviction of former White  House aide Oliver L. North in the Iran-Contra scandal on grounds that his Fifth  Amendment protection against self-incrimination may have been violated during  the trial.  </P> <P> A divided three-judge panel threw out North's conviction on one count involving  removal of sensitive documents from the White House as the scandal broke in  November, 1986. It said the trial judge had given erroneous instructions to  jurors.  </P> <P> On the two remaining counts of obstructing Congress and accepting an illegal  gratuity, the panel set aside North's convictions pending a hearing by U.S.  District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell on whether prosecutors made unfair use of  North's immunized testimony before Congress.  </P> <P> The appeals court ruling is a major setback for independent counsel Lawrence E.  Walsh, who is expected to appeal. Walsh is supervising a continuing  investigation of the role of top Ronald Reagan Administration officials in the  sale of U.S. arms to Iran and the diversion of profits to assist the Contras in  Nicaragua.  </P> <P> In a 2-1 decision, the appeals judges said that Gesell had erred in failing to  hold a hearing prior to North's trial on the potentially damaging impact of  North's nationally televised testimony before Congress in July, 1987.  </P> <P> North's lawyers had argued at the time that some members of Walsh's staff had  been "tainted" by seeing or hearing some details of North's testimony despite a  prohibition against using any of North's congressional testimony in his  prosecution. They said some witnesses used by prosecutors had been similarly  tainted.  </P> <P> "The very purpose of the Fifth Amendment under these circumstances is to  prevent the prosecutor" from becoming "the inquisitor, complete with that  officer's most pernicious tool -- the power of the state to force a person to  incriminate himself," the court said.  </P> <P> For North, the immediate effect of the ruling is to remove the stigma of being  a convicted felon.  </P> <P> Walsh has the option of appealing Friday's ruling to the full appellate court  or directly to the Supreme Court. He said in a statement that he was studying  "the most appropriate next step." He has 45 days to make his decision.  </P> <P> North already has completed three-fourths of the 1,200 hours of community  service that Gesell imposed as his punishment. He was also fined $150,000, but  Gesell had stayed the payment pending a decision on North's appeal of his  conviction.  </P> <P> North, in Baton Rouge, La., campaigning for a Republican Senate candidate,  issued a statement through his attorney, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., saying that  he was "very grateful" for the court's action.  </P> <P> "My family and I have been under virtual assault for more than 3 1/2 years in  this extraordinary legal battle, and I hope that the independent counsel will  end it now," North said. "I thank all those who have stood by us with their  prayers and their support all these years."  </P> <P> The ruling opens the door to eventual reinstatement of North's annual Marine  pension of $23,100, which he lost on his conviction on May 4, 1989.  </P> <P> A Navy spokesman said North would continue to be ineligible for pension  benefits "until we have a chance to review the court of appeals decision." He  said there was no obvious precedent on which to base a ruling.  </P> <P> The two appellate court judges who voted to overturn the conviction -- David  Sentelle and Laurence H. Silberman -- were appointed by Reagan.  </P> <P> Chief Judge Patricia Wald, an appointee of former President Jimmy Carter,  dissented, saying: "I am convinced that the essentials of a fair trial were  accorded North, and that his conviction on the three counts of which the jury  found him guilty should be affirmed."  </P> <P> Legal authorities said that the recent conviction of John M. Poindexter, who,  as Reagan's national security adviser, was North's superior, is not likely to  benefit directly from the court's ruling because a much fuller hearing on  possibly tainted evidence was conducted before his trial.  </P> <P> However, Richard W. Beckler, Poindexter's lawyer, said he was "very pleased" by  the ruling because congressional immunity "is a very big issue in our appeal."  </P> <P> Walsh, in his statement, said that "our other ongoing investigations will  continue." He was referring to a federal grand jury that has heard testimony  from both North and Poindexter, who appeared under grants of immunity.  </P> <P> Sources familiar with the inquiry said the panel was examining the roles of  several other former Reagan Administration officials in the Iran-Contra case.  They include Elliott Abrams, former assistant secretary of state for Latin  America; Donald P. Gregg, now U.S. ambassador to South Korea, who was Vice  President George Bush's national security adviser, and Alan D. Fiers, who was  chief of the CIA's Central American task force.  </P> <P> The appellate court, citing a possible unfair use of North's immunized  testimony before Congress, said a 1972 Supreme Court decision prohibits federal  prosecutors from making any use of such testimony against the criminal  defendant who gave it.  </P> <P> The court said that Gesell should have made a more searching inquiry before the  trial when he learned that North's congressional testimony had served to  refresh the memories of many witnesses who testified before the grand jury that  indicted North in March, 1988.  </P> <P> Such use of North's congressional testimony appeared to violate his Fifth  Amendment rights and should have received more than the "truncated" review  provided by Gesell, the appellate court ruled.  </P> <P> The judges said they understood Gesell's reluctance to hold what he called at  the time "a trial before the trial" on the issue of North's immunized  testimony. But they declared that "the convenience of the government" in saving  time should not outweigh a defendant's rights to avoid self-incrimination.  </P></p>

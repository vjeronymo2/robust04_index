			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays and </F> Moscow City Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov by Itogi announcer Yevgeniy  Kiselev -- date and place not given; from the "Itogi" newscast  -- recorded]    [Text] [Kiselev] It seems that none of last week's events  has evoked such an intense interest in the media as a sharp  aggravation of the conflict between Deputy Prime Minister  Anatoliy Chubays and Moscow's Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov. It is known  that Yuriy Luzhkov maintains that privatization in Moscow should  be implemented taking into account the capital's individual  characteristics. Luzhkov sharply criticized the Chubays-style  privatization. Anatoliy Chubays has his own arguments and  position. You will get more details from interviews with both  sides of this dispute about fundamental principles.    [Luzhkov] We have made our decision on all the conditions of  privatization in Moscow proceeding from the city's interests,  and I see no need to change anything in our attitude to what is  taking place in the sphere of privatization.    [Kiselev] Even despite Anatoliy Borisovich's [Chubays']  appeal to the procuracy demanding that not only this decision  but a number of others, too, should be cancelled?    [Luzhkov] I can say that Chubays' appeal to the Russian  procuracy has no legal grounds, it is nothing but a  demonstration and a wish to intimidate the Moscow government and  myself. I think that the procuracy will draw an unequivocal  conclusion regarding the way we comply with Russian Federation  laws. We have not violated Russian laws. We are speaking about  our attitude to privatization, the results of its first stage  and the failings and failures of the first stage of  privatization. The state budget has not received anything,  there are no property owners, there is no middle class and  territorial individual characteristics are being neglected.  Now, when speaking about the shaping of the second stage Mr.  Chubays says that the second stage will be based on the  achievements of the first step in privatization. What  achievements? There is a total failure, a complete mess! What  achievements can we talk about?    [Chubays] My position is very simple. After all, I am not  discussing the advantages and disadvantages of privatization  with Luzhkov. I am not discussing with Luzhkov whether it is  good or bad. I am not discussing with Luzhkov whether he likes  it or not. I am speaking about something completely different.  I am not debating. I demand that Luzhkov comply with the  Russian legislation, Russian laws, the decrees signed by the  Russian president, the government decisions signed by  Chernomyrdin...    [Kiselev interrupts] Anatoliy Borisovich, excuse me for  interrupting you but do you not think that your tough attitude  toward Moscow Mayor Luzhkov on privatization issues is  indirectly affecting the president, his political prestige and  authority? After all, at the time the president instructed you  to take into account Moscow's individual characteristics while  implementing the privatization program.    [Chubays] I think that what does affect the president very  strongly and is directed right against the president is not my  stand on the issue but the blatant violation of presidential  decrees currently in force by Mr. Luzhkov who continues to  regard himself as a supporter of the president.    [Kiselev] Yuriy Mikhaylovich [Luzhkov], considering that the  president has given Chubays his political support, are you not  afraid to incur the president's displeasure because of your  criticism of Anatoliy Borisovich?    [Luzhkov] I am not afraid and I will tell you why. First,  because as early as last December I told Boris Nikolayevich  [Yeltsin] that we had arguments against Chubays' methods and  asked him to receive us. Boris Nikolayevich met with Chubays  and myself and after listening to both of us, made a decision.  He instructed Mr. Chubays to prepare a draft decree which would  consolidate the individual characteristics of privatization in  Moscow, because in his view privatization issues should be  solved in a somewhat different manner while preserving the goals  and the main principle of reforming the economy.    Well, one must say that Chubays failed to comply with the  instruction, despite the fact that an absolutely unequivocal and  clear instruction was given to prepare a relevant draft decree.  Following this, a couple of months later I sent Boris  Nikolayevich a letter saying that his instruction was being  ignored. So he [Yeltsin] gave instructions again, this time to  Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin, to take into account Moscow's  individual characteristics and prepare relevant documents which  would ensure a legal right to implement these characteristics.  So another few months passed but no decision has been made. I  therefore believe that in this situation I have a free hand to  act in order to protect the city's interests.    [Chubays] In fact, I am not at all against a compromise with  Moscow. I am truly prepared to design compromise plans  applicable to Moscow. But excuse me, as soon as these plans  have been approved I will observe them as much as I observe all  other presidential instructions. Until such a plan has been  designed, as long as the presidential decree on privatization is  in force, Luzhkov must comply with it in exactly the same way as  all other heads of administration.    [Kiselev] But where is the obstacle to designing such a  compromise plan? Who is to design it, you or Luzhkov or jointly?    [Chubays] I think that Mr. Luzhkov's obvious ambition is the  obstacle. As you know, we have put forward a concept of  post-voucher privatization. Luzhkov's main demands are as  follows: First of all, property must not be sold for vouchers  because the vouchers have no value, nobody needs them, so  property should be sold for money. But the concept of  post-voucher privatization envisions selling for money.    Second, Luzhkov used to say that one must not sell so  cheaply, much higher prices should be set, property costs much  more and it should be revalued. In our concept of post-voucher  privatization we proposed that the value of property should be  increased at least 12-fold.    Third, Luzhkov said heads of administration should be  invested with the right to alter the value of property taking  into account local conditions. The concept of post-voucher  privatization says in black and white that heads [of  administration] are allowed to alter the value of property  within a range of up to 200 percent. I could comment on the  list of demands in greater detail. Look, in this situation  Luzhkov should have become, I do not know, chairman of a  movement in support of Chubays' post-voucher privatization,  leader of the movement if he had been really interested in the  matter and the essence of arguments and not the emotional and  political layers enveloping them.    [Luzhkov] We do not like the second stage for quite  understandable reasons -- the same ones which accompanied the  failure of the first steps toward privatization. We are saying  again that the individual characteristics of the regions need to  be taken into account. And with the second stage of  privatization Mr. Chubays and the State Property Committee are  again saying: No, everything must progress only as the State  Property and as Mr.Chubays instructs.    And this privatization is not always needed and is not  always  useful, for the City of Moscow, for example. With regard to the  privatization of markets, for example. How can we privatize  markets today when criminal bodies may buy them up? And if we  find it difficult to fight these criminal bodies today when they  don't own the markets, imagine the conditions under which our  law enforcement bodies will be working when the markets belong  to these criminal bodies. Or with the privatization of hotels,  for example, the same reason applies, and in addition to this  hotels pay a decent amount into the city's budget.    As far as privatization is concerned, we probably need to  discuss the fact that privatization should primarily be carried  out for economic reasons. If it is advantageous, if the city  and the city authorities think that things should be sold, that  it cannot manage the property effectively, that the property is  not profitable enough, then there is no problem. It should be  sold. But if it is of benefit to the city then the city should  probably work out for itself what to do with the property. This  does not mean we wish to keep property for ourselves, not at all.    Our main aim is to emphasize the problem of the economy and  the problem of economic expediency. Chubays, the proponent of  the market, says you do not have the right to auction and to  sell real estate in the City of Moscow at the price fetched at  the auction itself. You are limited to the value of two years  rent. Well, please, is this really a market? Is Chubays, the  democrat and proponent of the market, really offering a  democratic approach to the state? It is a monopoly. It is  arm-twisting, which does not allow the city to solve its  problems in the economic sphere as the city considers expedient.    [Chubays] It is not the actual problem which is important  but  the political game-playing in which Mr. Luzhkov is engaging here.    [Kiselev] What exactly are these political games?    [Chubays] That is quite simple. You probably remember that I  made a statement about six months ago that Yuriy Mikhailovich  Luzhkov had begun his presidential campaign. This provoked a  very skeptical reaction from many people and very few people  took it seriously. They thought that Chubays had just decided  to make all kinds of accusations against Luzhkov. No serious  expert has any doubt today that Mr. Luzhkov is conducting an  active election campaign, an election campaign for the post of  Russian president. And that is what has triggered all of this.    [Kiselev] Yuriy Mikhailovich categorically denies any  intention to start a presidential campaign.    [Chubays] Yes, I heard one of his denials. It is traditional  for many politicians to deny things until the last minute, to  make people beg them to agree and then agree.    [Kiselev] Excuse me, Anatoliy Borisovich, but do you not  think that in accusing Luzhkov of presidential ambitions, you  are putting him at loggerheads with Yeltsin?    [Chubays] Well, first the word accusing is inappropriate  here. I think that...    [Kiselev interrupts] You did make an accusation.    [Chubays] What do you mean? It is the right of any  politician -- and incidentally Boris Nikolayevich has himself  said many times that he thinks it quite allright for people to  want to be presidential candidates.    [Luzhkov] First, I think that it is quite absurd to talk of  a  presidential campaign now when we have a living president, a  president who is working energetically. It is absolute  nonsense. We need to deal with the economy now. That is the  main thing for the Russian state today. And I would also like  to say secondly -- and this is perhaps a lot more important from  the personal point of view -- I have no intention of putting  myself forward for high- ranking posts. I have no far-reaching  aims. I have already stated many times that my main and only  aim is to work in Moscow, for Moscow, and for the people of  Moscow. And I do not want to go anywhere, I do not want to go  anywhere. I want to do something decent if I can for this city,  for my city.    [Kiselev] In your view, does Mr. Chubays have some kind of  political ambitions in this dispute with you?    [Luzhkov] Of course he does. You know, when the person in  charge of a system has failed in his work, he has to find  explanations for society or he has to find a scapegoat to blame  and point the finger at him as the guilty party.    [Kiselev] This is the last question that I want to ask you  today, Anatoliy Borisovich. You recently appeared on the  "Details" program on the second channel and complained that our  journalists are often not critical enough of Yuriy Mikhailovich  Luzhkov, that they are afraid of the mayor of Moscow. Do you  not think that the existing practice of placing paid  advertisements in the Russian mass media, in the newspapers and  on television -- in which a great deal of money is invested --  actually restricts the freedom of Russian journalists to  criticize Chubays and the privatization program?    [Chubays] You know, I'm sorry but I cannot agree with you  that people are stopping journalists criticizing me personally  or the privatization program. I can compete with anyone on the  number of critical remarks tossed in my direction, which I have  actually received. And as concerns the funds which we spend on  propaganda and on information about privatization, I think we do  very little on this. I am convinced of this and this is one of  the areas we still need to work on. We have not given people  enough explanations of the nature, meaning, or aims of the  program. That is the absolute truth. And when the funds which  we spend on privatization and informing people meet their aims  we are sincerely pleased about this.    [Kiselev] But there is an important detail here which is not  widely known by the public. This money is not, in the main,  Russian, it comes from America. The money was allocated by an  American agency, a government agency for international  development, for privatization advertisements among other  things. Do you not think we have a paradoxical picture here --  American taxpayers' money is being spent more or less on  investment in the Russian mass media to support certain economic  and political programs?    [Chubays] You only need to go one step further to accuse  Chubays of having been bought out by the CIA. [words indistinct  due to Chubays and Kiselev talking over one another] Let us not  look at this with stereotypes from the 1930's but in a common  sense manner. Some of the funds for information and propaganda  about privatization actually do come from Russian money, some of  the funds come from international aid to Russia. Moreover, I  can tell you that we intend to continue to be active in this  sphere. We will gladly accept support from the world community  for Russian privatization, especially when it is a matter of  free investment from various organizations. I will therefore  give an unequivocal answer to your question. Yes, of course we  have used them and will use them, and my view is that these  funds should be put to even greater use. It would be wasteful  to refuse these funds and try to squeeze additional resources  for information on privatization from our budget, which is not  very generous anyway.</p>

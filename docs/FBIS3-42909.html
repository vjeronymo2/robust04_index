Sabirov  visited the capital of Ukraine, the city of Kiev.    Bilateral negotiations took place in the House of Government  of Ukraine. M.G. Sabirov, speaking before participants in the  negotiations, emphasized that friendly relations between peoples  whose ancestors have from time immemorial populated the banks of  the Dnieper and the Volga have their roots deep in past  centuries. The historical chronicles mention the agreement  between the Volga Bulgars and the Kievan Prince Vladimir. The  intergovernmental agreement between the two republics concerning  mutually advantageous cooperation in the areas of trade,  science, technology, culture, and art will be another  confirmation of their friendly relations.    In response, the acting head of the government of Ukraine,  Yu.L. Zvyahilskyy, noted that the deep changes occurring in the  socioeconomic life of the two states and the economic  difficulties related to the transition to the market make it  necessary to rethink existing experience in business cooperation  and imbue it with new content. Relations between our republics  should be equal and mutually advantageous and be built on  principles of mutual respect and confidence.    As a result of the negotiations an intergovernmental  agreement was signed for commercial-economic,  scientific-technical, and cultural cooperation between the  Republic of Tatarstan and Ukraine, which envisions providing  favorable economic, financial, and legal conditions for economic  and other entrepreneurial activity: the creation of joint  ventures, the expansion and establishment of direct ties between  enterprises and organizations of the two republics, the opening  of trade missions and branches of national banks, and the  development of cooperation in the areas of culture, art,  science, and education.    The Ukrainian side responded positively to the relations  that  are being arranged between the Republic of Tatarstan and the  Republic of Crimea.    The heads of the delegations gave specific instructions to  the leaders of ministries and departments regarding the  coordination of the list of goods and the volumes of work and  services for which our republics are experiencing a need and for  which mutual deliveries should be organized. Chairmen of  national banks were instructed to earmark a mechanism for mutual  settlements for the goods and services delivered.    The negotiations proceeded in a warm, friendly atmosphere.    Participating from the Republic of Tatarstan were: Deputy  Chairman of the Supreme Soviet A.N. Lozovoy, Deputy Prime  Minister R.F. Muratov, Minister of Foreign Economic Relations  Sh.R. Arslanov, and general directors of the associations  Sviyaga--G.G. Agadzhanov, Orgsintez--N.Kh. Yusupov,  Nizhnekamskneftekhim--G.Z. Sakhapov, and Tatneft--first general  deputy director Sh.F. Takhutdinov. From the Ukrainian side,  Deputy Prime Minister V.I. Landik and leaders of ministries and  departments.    In honor of the delegation from the Republic of Tatarstan  the  government of Ukraine held a dinner during which M.G. Sabirov  and Yu.L. Zvyahilskyy exchanged speeches.    That evening the government delegation from Tatarstan headed  by Prime Minister M.G. Sabirov returned to Kazan.</p>

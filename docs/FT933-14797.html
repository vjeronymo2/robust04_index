			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Bulgarian trade pact delayed BULGARIA has been hit by the failure of the EC Council of Ministers to approve the interim trade agreement signed on March 8 as part of Bulgaria's proposed Association Agreement with the EC, Anthony Robinson writes. Bulgaria has already suffered most from the EC and UN sanctions on Serbia and the closure of trade routes through that country. The EC's failure also puts in jeopardy its trade agreement with European Free Trade Association countries, whose timetable depends on completing all stages of EC internal Association Agreement procedures. Bulgarian officials believe the delay stems from stonewalling by Italian officials seeking to strengthen the safeguard clauses protecting EC members from cheap eastern Europe imports generally. The Sofia government has just survived an opposition attempt to force a dissolution of parliament and early elections, and hopes the Council of Ministers will finally approve the trade agreement at its next session in Brussels on July 19.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Compass moves onto a new heading Compass, the catering group that already has links with Pizza Hut and Burger King, yesterday added the name of Roux to the menu, writes David Blackwell. The group has paid about Pounds 900,000 for the 11 catering contracts managed by the Roux brothers. It will launch a special executive service to be known as Roux Fine Dining. Mr Albert Roux described it as 'a perfect marriage.' The Roux business would benefit from the experience, wide customer base and financial expertise of Compass. Both Albert and Michel Roux will be involved in the business. Mr Francis Mackay, Compass chief executive, said the link would complete the jigsaw of businesses that would enable his group to cater from schools to boardroom level. Last May Compass reported interim pre-tax profits up from Pounds 17m to Pounds 18.2m on sales ahead by 19 per cent at Pounds 209.4m.</p>

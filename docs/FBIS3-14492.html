In a resolution passed at the end of its meetings the Arab  League Council expressed its complete support for the proposal  put (?forward) by the the general secretariat which calls for a  just trial for the suspects at the headquarters of the  International Court of Justice in the Hague emphasising to the  Security Council the importance of following through such a  proposal taking into account the need for a peaceful solution to  prevent an escalation which would lead to an increase in tension  in the region.    The Arab League Council entrusted the secretary general with  the task of following up the execution of the resolution while  also expressing its full appreciation for the Great  Jamahiriyah's initiative to solve this crisis in a peaceful and  just manner.    The Arab League Council then reiterated its condemnation of  the continuation of the unjust harsh measures imposed on the  Great Jamahiriyah as a result of the baseless resolution imposed  on the Great Jamahiriyah by the Security Council at the bidding  of the Western countries expressing its extreme concern at the  human and material effects of these unjust measures.    The Arab League's Resolution was as follows:    `The League's Council, referring to Resolution 5156 of  5/12/1991, 5158 of 16/1/1992, 5156 of 22/2/1992, 5224 of 13/9/  1992, 5281 of 19/4/1993 and 5328 of 21/9/ 1993 concerning the  harsh measures and threats which the Great Socialist Peoples  Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah is being subjected to by the United  States, Britain and France.    Does refer to Article 33 of the United Nations Charter,  dealing with the solving of conflicts through negotiation,  mediation and judicial settlements, does express its extreme  concern at the human and other suffering incurred by the Libyan  people and neighboring countries as a result of UN Security  Council Resolution 748 of 1992 and 883 of 1993, and does  express its full appreciation for the positive initiatives  (?undertaken by) Libyan to solve this crisis and its positive  response to the stipulations of UN Security Council Resolution  731, and does therefore express its extreme concern for the  escalation of the crisis by imposing additional sanctions and  the threat of the use of force, a method which is a violation of  all international conventions and international law.    Does also express its appreciation for the efforts exerted  by  the seven-member committee and the secretary general of the Arab  League in order to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict.    After an examination of the general secretariat's  memorandum,  and after a perusal of the latest developments of the matter,  does therefore decide: 1) To reaffirm its previous resolutions  concerning solidarity with the Great Socialist Peoples Libyan  Arab Jamahiriyah and support for its efforts in arriving at a  peaceful solution to the crisis within the framework of respect  for Libyan national sovereignty and the principles of  international law. 2) To support the recommendtion of the  general secretariat calling for a just trial for the suspects,  presided over by Scottish judges and held according to Scottish  law at the headquarters of the International Court of Justice in  the Hague. It urged the Security Council to take this serious  and novel recommendation into account in order to seek a  peaceful solution to prevent an escalation which would serve to  increase the tension in the region.</p>

The greatest factor in the rapid  increase in the market price of foreign exchange over the last  two weeks is the failure to open draft credit accounts for  factories in the banking system and their turning to the open  market.    Other factors in the increase in the foreign exchange rate  on  the market were the approaching New Year's holidays, planning  for travel, and turning to the market to procure foreign  exchange, conversion of the cash of government factories,  companies and institutions to foreign exchange for future  purchases, and the creation of a psychological mood to make  profits.    The above was announced yesterday in an interview with  RESALAT's parliamentary correspondent by Engineer Seyyed  'Alinaqi Khamushi, Majles deputy from Tehran and chief of the  Iran Chamber of Commerce and Industries. He gave an expert  analysis of the reasons and factors in the instability of the  foreign exchange market in recent months, and he criticized and  studied the Central Bank's policies in this regard.  <H5>  Reduced Foreign Exchange Revenues in the Current Year </H5>   Eng. Khamushi began by discussing the roots of this problem.  He said: In the First Five-Year Plan foreign exchange and  revenue sources and expenses were taken into account, but in  practice the expenses were as predicted while the revenues did  not come in, and there was a scandalous deficit. The second  question is the manner of using financial resources. If debts  are studied it will be clear that 70 to 80 percent of them are  short-term and about 20 percent are long-term, and this in  itself has created escalating problems for the country.    Continuing, he said: Another problem concerns the revenues  anticipated from the sale of oil, which are far removed from  reality. For example, in the current year government revenues  from the sale of oil are about $3 to $4 billion less than  anticipated, and this figure will create problems for the  nation's economic ability.  <H5>  Excessive But Nonessential Imports </H5>   Eng. Khamushi then discussed the problems caused by the  procedures for allocating foreign exchange. He said: Based on  legislation from the Third Majles, the Foreign Exchange  Allocation Committee divided approved credits from the very  beginning according to sectors. In order to spend the  allocations approved for that year the government organizations  consumed and imported in cases where it was not necessary  without taking priorities into account.    He also added: Most of this consumption and importing was in  the commercial sector and in government imports of manufactured  goods, most of which did not have priority. Currently many of  these goods are gradually being put on the market, yet there has  been absolutely no need for some time to import some of these  goods.    Continuing, the chief of the Chamber of Commerce discussed  the way the banking system allocates foreign exchange. He said:  Since the time the foreign exchange rate was allowed to float  and the various banks were authorized to open credit accounts  for goods, any kind of policy or priority in the country went  off the boards, and some goods were imported in abundance into  the country without taking necessities into account. This caused  the amount of foreign exchange earned through oil exports to  become imbalanced in relation to the nation's import needs and  it brought us up against a shortage of foreign exchange. This  caused the price of foreign exchange, which is like a commodity  on the market, to increase.  <H5>  Injecting Foreign Exchange Into the Market </H5>   Eng. Khamushi criticized the Central Bank's injection of  foreign exchange into the market. He said: At the outset the  Central Bank announced that there are no limitations of any kind  on the insertion of floating foreign exchange into the market,  without taking into account the extent of market struggle and  demand. After some time they realized that no matter how much  foreign exchange is injected into the market, there is still a  struggle and that doing this is a mistake.    He added: Before they imposed restrictions, they paid $5,000  to anyone with a passport, and it reached the point where this  procedure brought the nation's foreign exchange consumption up  to $70 million per week. This is one of those mistakes that were  made without paying attention to the market pulse and its  struggles. During the period when this procedure was in effect,  about $1 billion was injected into the foreign exchange market,  while at the same time the figures on opening credit accounts  had fallen to less than $10,000 and we were faced with  nonpayment. This can in reality be called a foreign exchange  disaster and a banking system disaster that brought the country  face-to-face with a problem.    In the same regard the chief of the Chamber of Commerce  added: When the banking system officials took notice and stopped  this practice it was already too late and we were faced with the  failure to make payments, and this failure to make payments has  continued for a little over a year, is still going on, and has  created a serious problem for the country. It has caused foreign  banks to refuse to accept credit accounts because of the failure  to make payments. To solve their problem, importers, most of  which are factories, have resorted to importing without the  transfer of foreign exchange. Doing this means disrupting supply  and demand and the result of that is also to increase the price  of foreign exchange.    Continuing, Eng. Khamushi said: This measure was adopted  about three months ago, and the practice continued for some  time. Gradually the currency changers took over the work of the  banks. Goods were paid to the money seller for the transfer of  foreign exchange, and goods were imported. In negotiations with  the Central Bank we brought the bank to the conclusion that this  was a mistake and that the bank must do this work. Before the  bank adopted this measure the price of the dollar at the bank  was 1,750 rials[R] and it was R2,300 on the market. As soon as  the bank agreed to do the work on drafts, the floating foreign  exchange rate dropped from R2,300 to about R2,000 and this trend  has continued for four months.  <H5>  Registration of Many Orders and the Central Bank's Decision </H5>   The chief of the Chamber of Commerce then discussed a recent  improper decision by the banking system. He said: A procedure  that was adopted by the banking system was a mistake that was  made due to the effects of excessive orders registered in the  Ministry of Commerce. When the Central Bank was unable to open  credit accounts for these orders, the bank suddenly decided to  rescind them. It announced to the applicants that there was no  ability to open credit accounts. As soon as the bank announced  this decision and it became known in the market, all the  applicants turned to the market and the market price of foreign  exchange increased.    Eng. Khamushi discussed the solution to the current foreign  exchange market problems. He said: To reach an immediate result  and stop this current trend, the banking system should continue  the same system of drafts that was being used until three weeks  ago. It should continue this until the day the opening of credit  accounts returns to normal and the banks accept the opening of  credit accounts. Priority should be given to factories,  machinery, and raw materials until this huge volume of demand  can be removed from the market and the bank can stop the rise in  the price of foreign exchange.  <H5>  Agreement Between Iran and Germany Concerning Debts </H5>   In conclusion, the chief of the Chamber of Commerce said:  Just as was announced, negotiations were held with Germany  concerning the suspension of debts and the movement towards  normalization of relations with this country has begun. It is  very likely that the negotiations with Japanese officials will  also conclude by the end of the week. Negotiations will also be  held in turn with other European countries. This will be a step  towards returning the situation with opening credit accounts to  normal. If the banking system does not increase the foreign  exchange rate and if it does not create unwanted inflation, and  if it works with drafts until the opening of credit accounts is  normalized, then the foreign exchange rate on the free market  will decrease, the difference between the bank's foreign  exchange rate and that of the free market will be reduced, and  the situation on the foreign exchange market will return to  normal.</p>

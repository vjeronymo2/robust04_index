Using antibody to  F peptide and monoclonal antibody to HA, the corresponding  proteins were detected in the lysate of infected cells by  Western blot, showing that the expressed products were similar  to the authentic measles virus proteins. Both recombinants  produced a high level of antibodies to measles virus in rabbits,  which were able to both inhibit the hemolysis activity and  neutralize the measles virus in cell culture. In addition,  animals vaccinated with vCmH also developed  hemagglutinin-inhibiting antibody.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Israeli PM survives confidence motions THE minority government of the Israeli prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Shamir, survived five parliamentary motions of no confidence yesterday, Reuter reports. The motions were put down in a single vote which resulted in a 55-49 victory for the government with five abstentions, a Knesset (parliament) spokesman said. It was the first challenge to Mr Shamir's fragile coalition since two far-right parties pulled out last week over participation in Middle East peace talks. Opposition parties brought the motions in protest at what they described as deteriorating social and economic conditions in Israel - rising unemployment coupled with lavish spending on construction of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. Mr Shamir's success in mustering enough support for his government in the vote will give him the upper hand in setting the early date for national elections set for November but now expected to take place within six months. Senior members of Mr Shamir's Likud party yesterday began consultations with coalition partners and opposition parties on the election date.</p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Offshore safety rules planned NEW safety regulations for the offshore oil industry are to be drawn up by the Health and Safety Commission as the third stage in implementing recommendations of the Cullen report into the Piper Alpha disaster. The commission said yesterday that the regulations would be expressed where possible in terms of safety objectives rather than specifying particular precautions. This was in line with Lord Cullen's recommendation - after the 1988 oil platform explosion in which 167 men died - that offshore safety regulation be cast in a less prescriptive style. The reforms will incorporate regulations needed to implement European Community health and safety directives as well as new UK onshore regulations. They will also include Lord Cullen's recommendations on measures such as evacuation and rescue. The commission hopes to have all the regulations in force in just over two years.</p>

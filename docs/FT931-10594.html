			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Forging tighter bonds UK fund managers have shown little enthusiasm for switching from equities into gilts at current yields. But one might reasonably wonder how much longer they will retain a free hand. Actuaries are asking mature pension funds to favour the more certain investment income from bonds. Having paid out too much in bonuses over the last three years, life assurance companies are equally under regulatory pressure to increase weightings in fixed-interest. Legal &amp; General has argued this may already be changing the valuation relationship between bonds and equities. Gilts might normally be expected to yield 2.3 times more than equities at this stage in the cycle. Without any change in long gilt yields of 8.5 per cent, the prospective yield on equities would have to fall below 4 per cent before institutions were tempted into bonds. That implies sharply higher share prices. But a yield ratio closer to 2 times - reflecting a greater institutional preference for bonds - would enable long gilt yields to settle at around 8.5 per cent this year, while allowing for a modest rally in equities. That may sound wishful thinking for a government worried about its funding problem, not least because the maturing of pension fund liabilities is a slow, incremental process. Life companies are equally under less pressure to change investment strategy while equities are rising. Even so, the pension law review committee is expected to recommend a minimum solvency standard for pension funds this year. Actuaries may have little choice but to recommend a higher weighting in bonds.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lithuanian Interior Minister Romasis </F> Vaitekunas by Nijole Versinskiene, under the "Pressing" rubric;  place and date not given: "The Constitution Protects the  Victim"]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Versinskiene] You must  agree that criminals become particularly impertinent if their  crimes are not exposed, and if they go unpunished.    [Vaitekunas] Yes, explosions, the beginning of  privatization,  innovative economic changes -- all these things are interrelated  and they manifest themselves in the criminal world in the most  repulsive manner. When I assumed this office, my colleagues and  I primarily stated that we could not pursue normal results  without a normal instrument, that is, the law. This is from  what we began. A department was set up at the ministry to  prepare draft laws. Where did the law on preventive detention  originate? At the ministry. Certainly, the Seimas [parliament]  had to bring itself to adopt such an untraditional decision.  However, we did not see a better option under the conditions of  that time. No one proposed such an option. This played an  important role in stabilizing the situation. We believe that the  perspective is linked with the law, where our initiative is  essential.    Certainly, our influence on the criminal situation is the  greatest through the exposure of offenses. I suppose that it is  the exposure of some brutal and impertinent crimes which has  allowed us to stabilize the situation slightly and forced  criminals to change "forms" of work. Crimes are becoming more  intelligent... [passage omitted]    [Versinskiene] Let us go back to the law on preventive  detention. How many people were detained in our country under  this law? Are there any situations when courts send the work of  investigators down the drain, when criminals are released from  court rooms, or when they receive very mild punishments?    [Vaitekunas] We detained 270 people over the four months it  was in effect last year, and more than 90 individuals this year.    I would not dare accuse courts, but the situation is hardly  favorable. We have agreed with the prosecutor general to hold a  coordination meeting in the near future. Courts often return  criminal cases so as to add new facts to the investigation,  while their motives concern the uncertainty about the  restriction of witnesses and their evidence. Some lawyers claim  that this restriction should be interpreted in a very specific  manner -- the restriction of persons themselves rather than  their evidence. What would such restriction mean then? We  disagree with such a position. Therefore, we have already  submitted for government's consideration and coordination a  package of amendments to laws that would really allow to  classify witnesses, victims, and their evidence as secret.  Opponents say that this restricts their right to defense, that  the defender and the accused are not allowed to familiarize  themselves with all material, and that constitutional human  rights are violated. Yes, this sounds nice. However, we all  enjoy these rights. If the latter are endangered, the  Constitution protects the victim. [passage omitted]    [Versinskiene] Your relations with the press are rather  complicated. Why do journalists often fail to receive  information from officials?    [Vaitekunas] The press is meant for the reader. Therefore,  it goes without saying that it wants to provide operative  information. We are interested in the press, because it is also  our way of communicating with people. If an official providing  information feels responsible and comments on an event or fact  in line with his duties, there should not be any  misunderstandings. I am being frank -- I have a special  sentiment for your paper. RESPUBLIKA has been of great help for  me not only as a human being, but also as an official in my  difficult duties. I have already said and I can repeat again  that RESPUBLIKA and I are on the same side of the barricade.  However, one must always remember that all people, even  journalists, make mistakes. Thus, one should also admit one's  mistakes. I miss one thing in the press -- I would like to see  not only recorded facts and superficial descriptions, but also  more thorough analyses. Journalists are people who look to the  perspective and who have broad views. Therefore, their  possibilities to influence various processes are also very large.    [Versinskiene] My last question concerns the perspective in  particular. There are plans to transfer border defense to your  ministry. Are you ready for that?    [Vaitekunas] It is the Seimas that will adopt the final  decision. Amendments to relevant laws have already been  drafted. First of all, this means very considerable physical  work for us -- the number of jobs alone in this system is 6,000.  On the other hand, there is great responsibility. After all  legal issues are settled, they will demand the immediate  introduction of order on the border. However, no one can  promise this, because it is a process rather than a one-day job.  Nevertheless, there is no other way. We also have a virtual  need for this. Looting, car thefts, drugs, contraband --  everything travels across the border. We will assume all the  responsibility then, and there will be no one to accuse.  [passage omitted]</p>

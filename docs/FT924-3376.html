			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / International Bonds: Citicorp ready to launch Dollars 2bn offer CITICORP is preparing to launch a Dollars 2bn global offering of credit card-backed securities later today, for pricing tomorrow. The deal consists of Dollars 1bn of five-year floating-rate notes and Dollars 1bn of two-year floating-rate notes, both issued with junior tranches of fixed-rate bonds. A Citicorp official said he expected the five-year notes to meet stronger demand in Europe, while the two-year tranche is likely to perform better in the US. The deal is backed by Citicorp credit card receivables and arranged by Citicorp and Salomon Brothers. BCE, the Canadian telecommunications group which owns Bell Canada, yesterday raised Pounds 125m in the sterling bond market. The financing is linked to its Pounds 480m purchase of 20 per cent of Mercury Communications, the UK's second largest telecommunications operator. The five-year issue met a lacklustre response from investors, despite a series of roadshows last week designed to promote the deal. Traders said the pricing of the deal appeared reasonable, at a yield spread of 70 basis points more than the comparable five-year gilt. But the spread widened to about 73 basis points due to the lack of investor interest in the issue. Some investors were deterred by BCE's lack of credit ratings from the main US rating agencies, although it is rated by Canadian agencies. The weakness of the gilts market also proved a negative factor. But the deal's disappointing performance was mainly due to investors' unwillingness to buy more paper, as the end of the year approaches. BCE's treasurer, Mr Fred Andrew, said the cost of the partial acquisition of Mercury has already been met from disposals of assets in Canada, but the sterling liability will act as a hedge for the Mercury investment. He added that the company may return to the sterling bond market next year. The acquisition is expected to go through in January.</p>

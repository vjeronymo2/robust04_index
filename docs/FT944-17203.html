			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Management: Pioneers and prophets - Elton Mayo The Australian-born pioneer of industrial sociology, is credited with instilling the 'human factor' in management theory. The legacy of his ideas is evident in many modern management theories that stress communications, corporate culture and leadership. Although Mayo's most important work took place at Harvard, where he remained until two years before his death in 1949, his work on industrial unrest drew on an eclectic early career. Born in 1880, his career spanned medical training in London and Edinburgh, a partnership in an Adelaide printing company, teaching mental and moral philosophy at Queensland University and pioneering work on the psycho-analytic treatment of shell-shock during the first world war. He transferred some of his ideas relating to nervous problems to industry, arguing that: 'So long as commerce specialises in business methods which take no account of human nature and social motives, so long may we expect strikes and sabotage to be the ordinary accompaniment of industry'. His best remembered work arose from the lighting experiments known as the 'Hawthorne effect', which took place at the Western Electric company's plant at Hawthorne, Chicago. The researchers set factory lighting at different strengths to discover what would have the greatest effect on productivity. The light was brightened for one group and left unchanged for another. The result was an enigma: both groups increased their production. Subsequently, Mayo found that any change to the workers' conditions led to a rise in output. Mayo concluded that the employees had gained in work satisfaction by the attention lavished on them and by the co-operation between informal groups in the workplace. He argued that the main objective of management was to encourage co-operation and team work among employees. 'Worker-management conflict may be due less to ostensible reasons for the dispute such as tea-breaks or insufficient light, than emotional attitudes,' he said. Workers were ruled by the 'logic of sentiment', while managers were moved by the 'logic of cost and efficiency'. However, David Collinson, a lecturer in organisational behaviour at Warwick University, describes Mayo's ideas as a 'paradox'. Mayo's stress on communications and good personal relationships appears to be a more humanistic philosophy than for example, the 'scientific management' principles espoused by Frederick Taylor. But it can be criticised for its patronising view of an irrational workforce and its supposition that conflict can be sorted out by improving communications between management and workers. Nonetheless, Collinson concedes that Mayo's work 'has a relevance today'. The 'Hawthorne effect' remains widely cited by academics. And management theory and consultancy projects continue to be influenced by the idea that workers want recognition, security and a sense of belonging.</p>

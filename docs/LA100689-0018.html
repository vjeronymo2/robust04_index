			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GRETZKY'S COUNTDOWN STARTS SLOWLY;  </P> <P> SCORER'S DECISION GIVES HIM LONE POINT AS KINGS WIN WEBSTER'S DEBUT  </P> <P> The Kings made Tom Webster's debut as their coach a success, skating to a 4-2  victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs in the season opener Thursday night before  a less-than-capacity crowd of 15,598 at the Forum.  </P> <P> It was a successful debut, too, for defenseman Larry Robinson, playing for the  Kings for the first time after 17 years with the Montreal Canadiens. Robinson  led a strong defensive effort and even added two assists.  </P> <P> Incredibly, Robinson scored more points than Wayne Gretzky, who is on a  much-celebrated countdown to his destiny as the highest scorer in the history  of the National Hockey League.  </P> <P> As the season began, Gretzky needed 14 points to take the record from Gordie  Howe.  </P> <P> After the first game, Gretzky needs 13.  </P> <P> Just one point was all he managed against a determined Maple Leaf defense and  goalie Allan Bester.  </P> <P> And a most unimpressive point it was.  </P> <P> Gretzky's first point of the season was awarded, long after the fact -- on a  scorer's decision between periods, in fact -- for a pass that occurred long  before Hubie McDonough scored his first goal as a King to give the Kings a 3-0  lead at 14:47 of the second period.  </P> <P> There was a carefully measured cheer from the crowd at the start of the third  period at the announcement of the dubious point that cut the gap between  Gretzky's career total and Howe's career total to 12 for the tie, 13 for the  record to change hands.  </P> <P> McDonough's goal was the last of a string of three quick ones in the second  period.  </P> <P> With all the attention on Gretzky, the most unlikely heroes did all the  scoring, striking in the second period, after more than half the game had  ticked away without a point for anyone.  </P> <P> Bob Kudelski, who spent more time in New Haven last season playing for the  Kings' American Hockey League affiliate than he spent in Los Angeles, found  himself all alone skating through the right circle. Robinson found him, too,  giving him the puck for the Kings' first goal at 10:54.  </P> <P> About three minutes later, defenseman Ken Baumgartner got a very rare goal --  unassisted no less -- when he fired a big slapshot from the blue line along the  left side boards. Baumgartner had scored just one goal all last year.  </P> <P> It was just 42 seconds later that McDonough wrapped around behind the Toronto  goal and sailed the puck between Bester's knees to help Gretzky to a point.  </P> <P> Hrudey was just 17 seconds from getting out of the second period with his  shutout intact when Toronto's John Kordic lifted a shot over Hrudey's  outstretched glove to make it 4-1.  </P> <P> Bester had stopped all 14 shots he faced in the first period, including the  lone shot by Gretzky, and had stopped the first five of the second period when  the barrage hit.  </P> <P> The Kings had one near-miss in the first period, thinking that they had a goal  by Jim Fox only to have the officials rule that the whistle had blown before he  scraped the puck out of the pileup of Maple Leafs in the crease and put it in  the net.  </P> <P> The Kings added to their lead in the third period.  </P> <P> Luc Robitaille scored his first goal of the season 17 seconds into a power  play, putting in a pass from Bernie Nicholls. Robinson also assisted on that  goal.  </P> <P> King Notes  </P> <P> The Kings sold out the season opener a year ago, getting their first sellout of  an opener for Wayne Gretzky's debut as a King. But they didn't repeat this  season, coming up short despite Gretzky's run at the all-time scoring lead. . .  . Defenseman Barry Beck has not yet made his debut with the Kings. He was  scratched for the opener, giving a groin injury more time to heal. . . . Mike  Krushelnyski left the game Thursday night after jamming his left wrist towards  the end of the first period. Bob Kudelski took Krushelnyski's place on the left  side of Gretzky's line. . . . The Kings will play the second game of this  four-game home stand Saturday night against the Edmonton Oilers. They also will  play Sunday night against the Detroit Red Wings. Tickets are available for both  games.  </P> <P> GRETZKY'S COUNTDOWN TO 1,851 POINTS  </P> <P> Gordie Howe's all-time regular-season scoring record (points and assists) is  1,850. Through Thursday night's game, the Kings' Wayne Gretzky is 13 points  away from breaking that record.  </P> <P> POINT NO. 1,838  </P> <P> GORDIE HOWE IN 1980  </P> <P> Feb. 15: Winnipeg at Hartford - Scores unassisted goal in the first period.  Goaltender: Markus Mattsson.  </P> <P> WAYNE GRETZKY IN 1989  </P> <P> Oct. 5: Toronto vs. Kings at Forum - Gets an assist on goal scored by Hubie  McDonough in the third period. Goaltender: Allan Bester  </P></p>

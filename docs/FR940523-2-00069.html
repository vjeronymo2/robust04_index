			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Guidelines that would specify which types of Sjogren's patients with what degree of xerostomia and at what points in their clinical evaluation or management would benefit from electrostimulation cannot be developed without further clinical investigation. Long-term studies of well-characterized patient groups will also help to determine how long it takes to achieve a response. According to some investigators, this should allow sufficient time to determine if any regeneration of the salivary gland parenchyma is achieved. In order to determine the effectiveness of electrical stimulation of salivary flow in Sjogren's patients, studies should include information regarding concomitant therapy (continued frequent water sipping or use of other sialagogues) and the duration of the salivary response so that it can be compared with the use of other therapies. Studies and subsequent management of Sjogren's patients with dry mouth should include quantitative assessment of salivary function (unstimulated and stimulated, whole and individual gland salivas), assessment of oral conditions for signs of salivary hypofunction, and subjective patient evaluations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Salivary glands in patients who suffer from rheumatoid diseases show varying degrees of destruction. This damage is progressive and considered irreversible by some investigators.17 The ability to induce secretion in individuals with these conditions will be inversely related to the glandular damage. The study by Stellar et al3 shows that a device providing electrical stimulation to treat dry mouth in patients with Sjogren's syndrome appears to be effective after 4 weeks of study in only a small percentage of patients. These patients may represent a group with less advanced disease (lesser degree of lymphocytic infiltration) and a greater amount of functional salivary parenchyma. These individuals would likely respond equally well to mechanical, chemical, tactile, and pharmacologic means of salivary stimulation. Anything that enhances mastication will induce secretion. So, too, will salts and citric acid solutions. While all of these techniques are effective, their effects are transient; however, there have been no studies to demonstrate that electrical stimulation provides any advantage or is more effective than other existing techniques. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Successful treatment for dry mouth is recorded as both subjective and objective increases in saliva output. According to Fox et al,5 patient complaints of xerostomia or oral dryness may not reflect actual salivary gland capabilities or function. Subjective assessments alone are not adequate for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Although there is no fixed salivary level for intervention, xerostomia is generally associated with whole saliva flow rates of less than 0.1 mL/min. For some patients, a 50% reduction in salivary output leads to the subjective impression of dry mouth. However, the level of diminished salivary output where a patient becomes subject to increased risk of oral disease or dysfunction is not known. Moreover, there is a wide variability of ``normal'' salivary output. A 50% decline for one individual might still result in a flow rate greater than another individual's normal output. Some investigators feel that if the minor salivary glands can be stimulated to coat the mucosa with a thin layer of mucous, the sensation of dryness will be relieved. Even very small increases in saliva output may be beneficial in preventing or minimizing the oral effects of salivary dysfunction. Long-term clinical studies are needed to examine these issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Consultations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), electrostimulation may be useful in management of salivary hypofunction, but adequate data for definitive conclusions are not available. Electrostimulation is not widely accepted as an effective method of treating xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome. In addition, the number of published studies is limited. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NIH has informed OHTA that guidelines that specify which types of xerostomic patients with which conditions and at what points in their clinical evaluation and/or management would benefit from electrostimulation cannot be developed without further clinical studies utilizing well-characterized patient populations. Given the single published study showing that only patients with residual salivary flow in an unstimulated state will respond to electrostimulation, NIH suspects that those individuals would likely respond as well to other means of salivary stimulation, including gustatory or masticatory stimuli. NIH has expressed doubt as to whether electrostimulation using a limited stimulus time (3 minutes, three times a day) could provide sufficient duration of increased salivary output to have a significant impact on the oral health or symptoms of the patient. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

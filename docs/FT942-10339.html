			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / People: Sandy Stewart to chair Scottish Amicable If Scottish Amicable, the mutual life insurer, ever wishes to flex its muscles in Thailand, it has made a wise decision in appointing Sandy Stewart as its non-executive chairman. For among his many other activities he also squeezes in time to act as Thailand's honorary consul in Scotland. Stewart, 60, is taking over the stewardship of Scottish Amicable from William Brown, 64, who was chairman from June 1989 following the death in office of William Cuthbert. The normal duration for a chairmanship is two periods of two years. Brown remains a non-executive director of the company. Sir Ronald Miller has been appointed deputy chairman. Scottish Amicable's 13 member board has just three executive directors, with Roy Nicolson, 49, as managing director. One of its more senior figures, Lord Elgin, has just retired on reaching 70. The title of president of the board will also retire with him, in recognition of what the company describes as his 'unique contribution to Scottish Amicable'. He was a director since 1970 and president since 1975. Born in Edinburgh, Stewart is a solicitor by training, a former partner of McGrigor Donald, specialising in company law. He is also a farmer, and acts as deputy lieutenant for the county of Perth. He joined Scottish Amicable's board in 1985. As for his Thai consulship - it is clearly more than just an honorary title. Next week he will be shepherding a senior Thai government minister through the highways and byways of the Scottish business and political world.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the State Duma </F> Budget, Taxation, Banking, and Finance Committee, by Andrey  Nizamutdinov; place and date not given: "Mikhail Zadornov:  Gaydar's Departure Does Not Mean A Departure From Reforms"]    [Text] As is known, the new constitution perceptibly  narrowed the field of activities of the Federal Assembly as  compared to the former Supreme Soviet; however, control over the  formation and execution of the state budget and the functioning  of the monetary and credit system remain within the Duma's  competence.    The deputies understand that the committee's work may  have a real effect not only on the economy but also on policy.  It is therefore no accident that 43 Duma members--that is,  practically one in 10--expressed a desire to work on this  committee. Among them are such notables as Academician Nikolay  Petrakov, commentator Vasiliy Selyunin, and Aleksandr Pochinok,  who headed an analogous committee in the previous parliament.  All factions and deputy groups are represented in the committee,  plus a good number of independent deputies. Most are  professionals: economists, finance specialists, banking  professionals, and entrepreneurs.    "At the very first meetings," remarks M. Zadornov, "we  agreed  that we will try to leave our political leanings and  disagreements outside working meetings, and will be guided  exclusively by the principles of professionalism and pragmatic  assessment of the situation."    [Nizamutdinov] And where do you intend to start?    [Zadornov] By placing all work into the framework of the  law.  I mean not just our committee or the Duma as a whole--I mean the  work of all organs of state authority in general. For instance:  Russia has entered the year 1994 without an approved federal  budget. We have had the same situation for the past two years.  The state budget was approved on a quarterly basis, in parts,  with great procrastination and delays. Meanwhile, the current  law on the budget system says that the federal budget is  approved for a calendar year, and this is to be done in  advance--in October of the preceding year. In other words, a  practice of constant violation of the law has already developed,  which produces a chain of negative consequences not only in the  economic and social but also in the political sphere. A  fallacious practice has developed of using the budget as an  instrument of political struggle, behind-the-scenes  manipulation, and all sorts of abuses. It is unimportant here  who is right and who is wrong--it is the economy as a whole that  suffers. That is precisely why our committee considers it a  priority task to return to the procedure set forth in the law.  We have already sent the government a request to submit to the  Duma a draft budget for the current year, and stand ready to  consider it immediately.    [Nizamutdinov] Every normal family tries to plan its budget;  even more so the state...    [Zadornov] Precisely. But that is the problem--for at least  half a year the government works practically without a program.  There are no development plans even for two or three years  ahead--medium range--let alone long range. The government simply  follows events, adopting documents post-datum and dealing with  problems on an emergency basis--be it the miners, agrarians, or  individual regions.    [Nizamutdinov] But if there is no, as you say, normal  program, how can we talk about reforms?    [Zadornov] What does this mean: "reforms"? Unfortunately,  over the past two years we have developed the mass habit of  substituting political cliches and incantations for real  analysis. The new stereotypes have taken hold not only in the  absolute majority of the mass media, but also among many  specialists. "Gaydar's departure from the government means a  departure from the course of reforms." But this is not so! My  opinion is: There are different types of economic policy, each  with characteristic features. Gaydar's policy in its pure form,  as it was proclaimed at the end of 1991, ceased to exist very  quickly. It was basically abandoned in May 1992; the economic  policy shifted in the direction of compromise; a balancing act  and concessions to individual sectors or regions came on the  scene. This has been going on over the entire last year. Now we  should wait before we start talking about changing course. Let  the reshuffled government present its program; let it support it  with concrete budget drafts, a list of priority state programs,  and proposed volume of centralized financing--then we can  evaluate the course, the type of economic policy chosen by the  government. To think that a reformist policy means tight money  and a conservative one means handing it out is too simplistic an  approach. Is it possible to get by without investment? And debts  have to be paid, too. But if this is done sensibly, as a  one-time thing, inflation fluctuations will remain within  allowable boundaries and it will be possible to attenuate them  later. A clearly pronounced inflationary policy is a completely  different matter. But it is too early to talk about it now.    [Nizamutdinov] If the government announces such a policy,  nevertheless, what will the Duma do?    [Zadornov] The disposition of forces in the Duma, its blocs  and alliances, have not taken a final shape yet. The LDP  [Liberal Democratic Party] has its own niche; the Agrarians are  pursuing their own goals, which, despite conventional wisdom,  far from always and far from in everything coincide with the  position of the Communists. The picture is the same on the other  side of the political spectrum. There will still be a regrouping  of forces. I think there will be quite a few supporters in the  Duma for a considerable increase in expenditures, and thus a  mutual understanding may develop between the government and the  parliamentary majority. Well, we will have to give people the  opportunity to find out for themselves that attempts to give in  to the demands of individual sectors or regions will not bring  positive results. I think, however, that freezing prices and  issuing colossal credits is no longer possible now. In any case,  in our committee so far the prevailing intent is to follow the  road of nursing the budget back to health, gradually easing the  tax burden--first and foremost for enterprises in the production  sphere, making the long overdue changes in the legislative base  that regulates the financial and monetary and credit sphere.    [Nizamutdinov] Does nursing the budget back to health mean  cutting its deficit?    [Zadornov] Cutting the budget deficit is a general task, not  a goal in itself. We cannot build the whole economic policy on  this basis. For instance, over the entire last year Boris  Fedorov maintained a special position in the government. His  actions were aimed at containing the deficit by any means  possible--sometimes even not quite proper means, not allowing  additional money emission. We have to give him credit: he  accomplished principally important steps in the direction of  changing the type of our economy--removing import subsidies,  which used to be immense, and suspending the practice of  preferential credits that had been used for who knows what  purpose. But at the same time other important directions--for  instance, credit policy--did not get the proper attention. These  are the issues--investment, taxes, insurance, banking  activities, including the Central Bank--that we will be dealing  with in addition to budget issues.    [Nizamutdinov] You mentioned the Ministry of Finance and the  Central Bank. How are your committee's relations with these  institutions developing?    [Zadornov] It is too early to tell yet. The previous  parliament had a confrontational relationship with the Ministry  of Finance. We intend to establish normal working contacts,  regardless of who will head the ministry and the Central Bank.  After all, it is the Duma that sets the limits on the Central  Bank's credit emission, and considers and approves the budget;  therefore, normal relations are in our mutual interest.</p>

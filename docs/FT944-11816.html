			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Ministers set to hack into jungle of red tape Ministers are poised to use the powers in the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act, which was given royal assent yesterday, to sweep away what they see as outdated regulations imposing unnecessary burdens on business. Mr John Major, prime minister, told last year's Conservative party conference that the move would strengthen the formidable arm of Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, in hacking through the jungle of red tape. Developing this theme yesterday, Mr Heseltine said the act's arrival on the statute book was a step in the government's drive to remove excessive burdens from business. He also highlighted the opportunities the act provides for the private sector to compete in new areas for the delivery of public services. But more than ministerial rhetoric will be needed to convince some leading opponents of bureaucracy that the act will make an impact in Britain's high streets. They fear that officials dealing with environmental health and trading standards will still be able to impose requirements which result in businesses closing down. The government has tried to remove anxiety about the activities of over-zealous environmental health officers with an amendment giving businesses a right of appeal against an immediate closure order. Any business would be able to continue trading until the outcome of the appeal. Ministers have yet to decide which body will handle such appeals. Tory backbenchers would prefer them to be dealt with by magistrates, but the government fears that this would lead to renewed charges of inconsistency in enforcing regulations. Ministers point to variations in the decisions of magistrates in different parts of the country when dealing with what appear to be similar cases. A clause approved by MPs early on Wednesday authorised the government to establish by order (rather than by primary legislation) a model standard appeal mechanism. The order-making power conferred on ministers by the act will enable them to repeal more easily laws which they believe have outlived their purpose. The government resisted an attempt, backed by Lord Simon of Glaisdale, the former law lord, to make the act subject to renewal every three years. Constitutional safeguards agreed by the government mean that although the power in the act to make deregulation orders comes into immediate effect it will be subject to special scrutiny by parliament. The act also opens the way for a less bureaucratic system of restrictions on heavy lorries in residential areas of London at night and weekends. Deregulation provisions due in January 1995 simplify procedures under the monopolies and mergers legislation, and help facilitate the operations of building societies. The government aims to introduce changes in the insolvency service to allow official receivers to contract out their functions. Editorial Comment, Page 15</p>

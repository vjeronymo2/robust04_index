Wu Jianmin, the spokesman, made the remarks when asked to  comment on a meeting between the king of Thailand and Li Denghui  of Taiwan.    He said the essence of Li Denghui's holiday-making diplomacy  is to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan", which is  resolutely opposed by the Chinese people, including the people  of Taiwan.    He hoped that the countries concerned should strictly abide  by the joint-communiques and the promises they have made when  setting up diplomatic relations with China.</p>

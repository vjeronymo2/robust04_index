			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Sales decline as Tarmac slumps to Pounds 21m CONTINUING HIGH overheads set against declining sales were largely to blame for yesterday's poor results from Tarmac, the quarry products, construction and properties company. Pre-tax profits slumped from Pounds 190.7m to Pounds 21m following exceptional charges of Pounds 45m, including a Pounds 12m charge against the Channel tunnel and Pounds 10m for falling land values. Provisions of Pounds 18m for future rationalisation in the industrial and building products divisions were also made, while there was an exceptional profit of Pounds 6m on the sale of founder warrants in Eurotunnel. Turnover fell 11 per cent to Pounds 3.23bn, slightly ahead of the construction industry's estimated 10 per cent decline. Operating profits dropped to Pounds 117m (Pounds 267m) while operating margins fell from 7.4 per cent to 3.6 per cent due to the volume declines and price competition. Quarry products contained the decline in operating profits to Pounds 52.9m (Pounds 80m) despite price competition. Construction also performed well, increasing operating profits slightly to Pounds 40.8m (Pounds 40m) and maintaining market share. Capital expenditure was cut from Pounds 110m to Pounds 40m while depreciation increased slightly to Pounds 68.3m (Pounds 60.3m). Net cash outflows were contained to Pounds 10.3m due to improved working capital controls, including a Pounds 125m reduction in the housing division. The interest charge fell to Pounds 49.4m (Pounds 76.4m) due to lower financing costs, principally in the US, but net debt increased to Pounds 456.9m (Pounds 411.6m) mainly due to exchange rate swings. The debt/equity ratio increased from 39 per cent to 51 per cent, if auction market preferred shares are treated as debt, or from 26 per cent to 33 per cent if treated as equity. Earnings fell to 0.2p (16.7p). The company is recommending a cut in its final dividend to 2.5p (8.25p) to make a total of 5.5p (11.25p). There was a retained loss for the year of Pounds 38.6m (Pounds 59.9m retained profit). Shareholders funds fell by Pounds 226.3m due to the uncovered dividend and to a Pounds 149m downward revaluation of the company's mineral reserves. See Lex</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Chemicals sector at risk EUROPE'S chemical industry risks following the dinosaur into extinction, the chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, Britain's largest chemicals group, warned yesterday. Sir Denys Henderson told the Society of Chemical Industry in Rome that the sector had to take more account of changes in the economic environment and adapt more quickly. Recent half-year results had been dismal. 'Very little has happened to persuade me we are making significant progress to solve the serious problems of over-capacity, falling prices and miserable margins that afflict our industry,' he said. Mergers like that between Renault and Volvo were imaginative, but massive businesses were not always the answer, said Sir Denys. He suggested possible routes for European companies included alliances with chemicals groups elsewhere or with the oil sector. Alternatives might involve partnerships, though with smaller equity stakes than previously acceptable to the chemicals industry. Such partnerships were common in the mining sector, an area where Sir Denys had gained expertise as a non-executive director of RTZ, the world's largest mining group.</p>

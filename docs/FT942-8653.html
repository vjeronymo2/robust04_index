			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: National Power seeks clarification National Power indicated yesterday that an early sale of power plants was unlikely as it revealed profits for 1993-94. Mr John Baker, chief executive, said that although a quick disposal was possible, everything pointed to potential buyers and the company itself waiting for clarification on three key issues. These were the flotation of the government's 40 per cent share in the company, probably next February, a review of emission standards by the government's pollution inspectorate and a long-term review by the power industry of the electricity trading pool. National Power agreed a deal in February with the electricity regulator by which it would endeavour to sell 3,000MW of capacity. Mr Baker said the company was reviewing a range of options including assets swaps with overseas companies, sales of individual stations and a demerger involving several plants. Mr Baker said it would be difficult to effect a subst-antial change to the company ahead of the flotation of the government's stake next year. Meanwhile, National Power is to ask its shareholders at the forthcoming annual meeting for approval to buy back up to 10 per cent of its shares. Buying back shares is likely to be an increasing trend in the power industry among companies with low debt. National Power finished the year with gearing of 13 per cent. However, Mr Brian Birkenhead, finance director, said the buy-back was just an option. Seeking permission from shareholders did not mean the company intended to take it up. There were no immediate plans for a buy-back. The company is also considering taking part in an auction this spring by the government in which companies will be given the chance to buy back their debt. National Power's government debt is Pounds 350m.</p>

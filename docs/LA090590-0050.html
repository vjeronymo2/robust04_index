			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRIENDS HELPING WELLS FACE THE STRUGGLE;  </P> <P> POP MUSIC: THE FORMER MOTOWN STAR IS FIGHTING THROAT CANCER AND A SLIDE INTO  POVERTY. COLLEAGUES ARE RALLYING BEHIND HER.  </P> <P> Singer Mary Wells, best known for such exhilarating '60s Motown hits as "My  Guy" and "The One Who Really Loves You," was seething with frustration because  she's having trouble getting her point across -- once again.  </P> <P> Communicating is now difficult for the veteran performer because a recent  tracheotomy robbed her -- at least temporarily -- of her power of speech.  </P> <P> The operation was done last month, when doctors determined that Wells, who'd  been having throat discomfort for months, has cancer -- a tumor in her larynx.  It's unlikely she'll ever sing again professionally.  </P> <P> At the moment, the 47-year-old singer either writes her thoughts on paper or  mouths words, requiring others to read her lips -- which is difficult for the  inexperienced and woefully frustrating for Wells.  </P> <P> Mouthing her words, Wells, currently residing in a downtown Los Angeles hotel,  said Monday, "I can't get used to this. You can't imagine how hard this is for  me."  </P> <P> Thanks to such striking hits as "My Guy" and "You Beat Me to the Punch," Wells  was one of Motown's key early stars.  </P> <P> Along with the Temptations, the Supremes, the Miracles and the Marvelettes, the  Detroit native helped define the label's pop-R&amp;B sound. After her heyday  she parlayed those hits into a career mostly on the oldies circuit.  </P> <P> Though far from rich, Wells was living comfortably this year in a three-bedroom  Van Nuys townhouse with Curtis Womack, brother of singer-songwriter Bobby  Womack and father of her 4-year-old daughter.  </P> <P> But when her throat started to go bad a few months ago, her life fell apart. No  longer able to do concerts, Wells found her income drying up. The same with her  savings. She and Womack subsequently broke up. Last month, while Wells was in  the hospital, her landlord evicted her for nonpayment of rent, she indicated.  </P> <P> That's not all.  </P> <P> Wells has no health insurance to help pay the mounting medical bills. She  alerted her friend Joyce McRae, a trustee of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation in  Washington, D.C., whose many functions include helping struggling musicians.  </P> <P> "I found out about Mary's illness while she was still in the hospital," said  McRae, who was with Wells during the interview. "I called everybody in the  media I could think of to put the word out that Mary needed financial help."  </P> <P> So far there have been contributions from Diana Ross ($15,000), Rod Stewart  ($10,000), Bruce Springsteen ($10,000) and the Temptations ($5,000). All have  been sent to the foundation, specifically earmarked for Wells.  </P> <P> Wells has even received a pledge of future support from Berry Gordy, the  founder of Motown. Like many veteran Motown singers, Wells reportedly hadn't  been on good terms with Gordy for years. But when ex-Supreme Mary Wilson, who  also has had battles with Gordy, contacted him, Gordy promised to help  financially.  </P> <P> "He said he'd do whatever he could to help Mary," Wilson said in a separate  interview. "That's good of him because he's under no obligation to her."  </P> <P> Wells looked healthy and robust during the interview. If she didn't have the  tube in her throat, you wouldn't suspect anything was wrong.  </P> <P> Aside from the frustration about communication, she also seemed to be in an  upbeat mood.  </P> <P> The singer started an intensive six-week radiation treatment plan last week at  the Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer Hospital at USC.  </P> <P> If treatment is successful, she may be able to avoid having her larynx removed.  Currently, she and her daughter are residing in the hotel, which is 10 minutes  away from the center.  </P> <P> It's not clear how much money Wells will need. "Medical and housing expenses  will be high," McRae said. "Mary can't work now. A lot of veteran R&amp;B  musicians like her live from day to day. When they get ill, they can't work and  they have no income."  </P> <P> Wells has recorded for various record companies since leaving Motown, but with  little commercial success. Her last album, recorded in 1988, was released only  in England. She recorded her last major U.S. album for Epic Records in 1981.  </P> <P> One of the sad ironies of Wells' situation is that the veteran singer was on  the verge of making a record that might have revived her recording career. The  singer said she'd been contacted by Springsteen to sing a duet with him on the  album he's currently recording here in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Wells said the financial and emotional support that came immediately from her  colleagues has altered her negative opinion of a business she often feels used  her up and cast her aside.  </P> <P> "People say this is a cruel business -- and it is," she said, again mouthing  the words. "But a lot of people in the business do have hearts."  </P></p>

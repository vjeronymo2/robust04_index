Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of  Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), said it contains few new  elements. The draft should have included more of the original  policy objectives of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa,  especially in seeking a higher quality of living for Japanese,  he said.    Nagano suggested that spending should have been expanded to  reform the nation's industrial structure, such as providing  appropriations for agriculture.    Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of  Corporate  Executives (Keizai Doyukai), said drastic cuts in expenditures  should be sought through a complete review of outlays for  individual ministries and agencies.    Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and  Industry, urged the government to strictly check expenditures in  implementing the budget. But Inaba welcomed an increase of more  than 4 percent in the proposed public works spending for its  economic stimulation effects.</p>

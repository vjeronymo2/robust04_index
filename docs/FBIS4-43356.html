			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Erich Hauser: "Kinkel Appeals for Patience"] </F>   [Text] Luxembourg, 14 July -- It might not necessarily be  possible for the Central and East European countries to join the  European Union [EU] by the year 2000. With this statement,  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at a news conference in Luxembourg  warned the governments in Prague, Warsaw, Bratislava, Budapest,  Bucharest, and Sofia, which have associate membership agreements  with the European Union, against too high expectations from  Bonn's imminent EU presidency. Nevertheless, the Federal  Government will do everything to lead the six associated  partners "closer to the European Union," and knows that Paris  and Madrid, which will take over the EU presidency in the first  and second six months of 1995, respectively, will do the same,  Kinkel said.    As far as the plans for nominating a successor to EU  Commission President Jacques Delors are concerned, Bonn and  Paris will "not ignore the opinion of the smaller member  states." The fact that he will not comment on the plans of the  two governments to nominate the Belgian Jean-Luc Dehaene at the  upcoming EU summit on Corfu can be interpreted as "meaningful  silence," Kinkel added cryptically.    At the summit meeting at the end of next week, one will also  have to clarify whether two representatives of the Parliament of  Europe and the governments of Austria and the three Scandinavian  EU membership candidates will be involved in a "preparatory  group" for the revision of the Maastricht Treaty, the minister  said. Only Germany, Spain, Belgium, and the Netherlands have so  far come out in favor of the participation of the Parliament.  According to the four membership treaties, which will be signed  on Corfu in a ceremony, the candidate countries will be entitled  to participate in all EU Council sessions and in the EU  Ambassadors' Committee with a "seat and vote."    Italy has raised objections in the EU Council of Ministers  against preparing an EU associate membership agreement with  Slovenia. Rome and Ljubljana must first settle compensation  claims of Italian "expellees."</p>

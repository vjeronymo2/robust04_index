			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Investors hold breath at signs of a turn Although there was no sign of Black Monday panic on world financial markets yesterday, the Federal Reserve's decision to increase US interest rates may have marked a turning point. 'The Fed's move has had quite a significant psychological impact,' according to Mr George Magnus, chief international economist at S G Warburg Securities. 'It might take time for investors to get their confidence back.' The long rally in equity and bond markets has been fuelled by low interest rates. Investors, dissatisfied with the returns from cash, have moved into other financial assets. In 1993, US investors poured money into overseas equities, in particular emerging markets. Mr Michael Hughes, managing director of BZW Global Economics and Strategy, said the rise in US short-term rates was not sufficient to cause investors to move money out of US equities and into cash. But 'it does mark the end of the emerging market bubble. Those markets which are dollar-linked, such as Hong Kong, have taken a lot of loose hot money.' The Hong Kong stock market fell 6.1 per cent yesterday and later indicative trading in London pointed to a further 3 per cent decline. If US investors are tempted to take profits, Mr Hughes believes, it is likely to be from emerging markets, but they may only divert money to Europe. However, it is too early to tell whether US private investors, who have been pouring money into mutual funds, will take fright at the shift in investment conditions and attempt to redeem their holdings. That could trigger a sharp sell-off in equities. Another key question is whether the Fed's move will influence the Bundesbank. The dollar rose sharply against the D-Mark on Friday and some analysts argue that fear of a weakening D-Mark will prevent the Bundesbank from cutting rates. Indeed, Mr Norbert Walter, chief economist of Deutsche Bank, was quoted as saying in Washington that the German authorities might even raise rates if the D-Mark weakened substantially. Such a move would be a threat to European bond and equity markets, which have been anticipating lower rates. However, in a research note, Mr Gavyn Davies, chief international economist at Goldman Sachs, said that domestic fundamentals, in particular declining inflation pressures, were still likely to dominate in Europe. It was possible for interest rates to fall in Europe while rising in the US - as in 1983-84. Mr Hughes believes that the Bundesbank pays more attention to the real (inflation-adjusted) rather than the nominal exchange rate. On a real basis, the D-Mark may have become overvalued during the 1992-93 exchange rate mechanism crises and thus the Bundesbank may be happy to see a decline in the nominal rate. The threatened market meltdown did not take place yesterday, but investors and analysts are being forced to reconsider their views.

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Arts: Modern Czech music goes 'underground' - Music in London A celebration of Czech music such as the London South Bank has mounted - the three-week-long 'Czech Festival', now halfway through its course - is bound to follow a well-marked route-map. Dvorak, Smetana, Janacek, Martinu, Suk: these are the obvious attractions of the Czech musical landscape, and there is no sense in not paying all of them properly dutiful attention. But, all to their credit, the series organisers have attempted to round out the experience by dotting in a few less frequently-visited stopping-points on the schedule. The programme of operas associated with the Terezin concentration camp (on which John Allison reported last Saturday) was one such. Another was the Monday-evening recital by Agon, the Prague-based new-music ensemble, only 10 years old and paying its first visit to Britain. This was a snatch of Czech cultural history in demonstration. From the start, Agon's declared 'underground' outlook and taste for the gamut of postwar Western modern-music styles and pursuits were evidently much frowned on, turning the composers who wrote for the group into a sort of Prague musical 'salon des refuses'. Even now that political changes have led to the dismantling of the country's state-dominated musical machinery, it remains (one gathers) obstinately outside the Prague musical scene. Monday's programme, a showcase of some of the wildly varied musical manners Agon has been investigating, explained why. Indeed, the concert provided a good deal more illumination into Czech cultural politics in the dying years and then aftermath of Communism than actual listening pleasure. Whether by intention or design, the outlook seemed to be as much purgative as exploratory: with the exception of the opening work, Jan Rychlk's African Cycle (1961), a rather delightful short outburst of naive-primitivist energy, everything that followed was designed to Stretch Horizons with a vengeance - and with a problem for the listener for whom these particular horizons may have been stretched to breaking point. In Zbynek Vostrak's Secret Fishing (1973), this involved Stockhausen-ish doodlings for four separate instrumental groups. In Rudolf Komorous's York (1967), it meant post-Dadaist whimsy. Peter Graham's Get out of whatever cage you are in (1992) was a noisy happening on (as the title suggested) John Cage-style chance-principles. Martin Smolka's Rain, Roofs (1993) slammed out a series of chords which were then allowed to disintegrate, at wearisome length. The cacophony of The Fire is Mine (1993) by Petr Kofron, Agon's conductor, eventually drove me out of the hall: the point of this anarchic exercise in noise-for-noise-sake was plain enough - but it was clearly intended for an audience entirely different from Monday's venturesome Purcell Room handful.</p>

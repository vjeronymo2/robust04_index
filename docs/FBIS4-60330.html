			<p>BFN     [Text] The Senate was assured this morning that there will  be no unilateral capping or freezing of Pakistan's peaceful  nuclear program. Speaking on the admissibility of the identical  adjournment motions, the federal interior minister, retired  Major General Nasirullah Khan Babar, said there is no reality in  the report that the American deputy secretary of state during  his recent visit put forward proposals for capping of nuclear  program. He said the present government has more than once  indicated clearly that there will be no such unilateral action.  He assured that the Pakistan People's Party government will  never be a party to any design that will limit our national  objectives. He said India is fully aware that Pakistan has a  deterrent power and that is the reason that Pakistan is safe  against any offensive from the adversary.</p>

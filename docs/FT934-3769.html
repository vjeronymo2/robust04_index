			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (12): Lighter vehicles will be cheaper, cleaner - John Griffiths on trends in the motor industry The motor industry has been making great strides in improving the efficiency and performance of the petrol and diesel engines which power most of the world's cars. A current petrol engine, with multi-valves, fuel injection and electronic management consumes about one-third less fuel than a simpler, similarly-sized and carburettor-fed unit of the 1970s. But this improvement is barely reflected in the actual number of road miles that a typical modern car can cover per gallon of fuel compared with its 1970s equivalent. Weight penalties imposed by safety and environmental legislation are offsetting much of the efficiency gain; yet more is being negated by consumer preference for comfort and convenience features, from multi-speaker audio systems to air conditioning. Such weight increases are far from marginal. On the safety front, for example, side impact protection bars, airbags and seat belt pre-tensioning systems in the last two to three years have begun adding considerably to the weight of the body structure. Conforming with ever-stricter exhaust emissions standards has meant introducing catalytic convertors into the exhaust system, with a variety of plumbing to allow the system to operate correctly such as exhaust gas recirculation, sensors and electronic management. Such systems are destined to become heavier and more complex yet, as additional equipment is installed to bring the catalytic convertor up to operating temperature more quickly. Consumer preference is imposing possibly the biggest burden. Electric windows and sunroofs, central locking, memory-adjustable seats and the like have led to a proliferation of electrical motors and other heavy hardware. The scenario envisaged by motor industry engineers in the early 1980s was that improvements in combustion technology would permit a 'virtuous circle' to develop in terms of the whole vehicle. Smaller, lighter engines could be built for no loss of power. These in turn would allow smaller, lighter components to be introduced elsewhere in the car. Because these would require less power to propel them, engine size could again be reduced without loss of on-road performance. And because the weight of all the mechanical elements of the car would be much reduced, the body shell itself could be made lighter and less complex because it would be subject to lighter loads and stresses. As a consequence, fuel consumption would have diminished sharply. Instead, car weights, size-for-size, have increased - and left the industry searching for some form of engineering 'quantum leap' to improve net fuel economy. That leap may be imminent: in October commercial production began at the world's first plant for the volume production of aluminium car body structures. Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) has invested DM120m (Pounds 50m) in the plant, at Soest in Germany, to supply the Volkswagen group's Audi car plant at Ingolstadt. They will form the skeleton of the new luxury Audi 300 saloon, of which Audi hopes to sell 15,000 a year from next spring. The Alcoa plant has capacity for 100,000 structures a year, and other future Audis can be expected to have aluminium instead of steel bodies, with even mainstream, very high volume cars such as the Volkswagen Golf not ruled out as a longer term prospect for production in aluminium. The concept offers substantial weight savings over steel, and thus better fuel consumption - but at substantially higher raw material cost. Mr Eric Winter, manager for automotive products at Alcoa's technical centre in Pennsylvania, says Alcoa is talking to 'a number of automakers' about similar projects in Europe and North America. Mr Franz-Josef Paefgen, head of body development at Audi, leaves no doubt of his own conviction that the system provides the industry's needed 'quantum leap' - which is exactly how he describes it. A car's body, he declares, typically accounts for between 20 and 30 per cent of total vehicle weight. The energy efficiency implications, he stresses, are important because a 10 per cent lighter vehicle yields a 7 per cent reduction in fuel consumption. The body of the aluminium car, says Mr Heinrich Timm, manager of Audi's fundamental concepts activities, is 40 per cent lighter than its steel counterpart would have been. In terms of the energy efficiency of car manufacture, another significant advantage of the aluminium structure is that it has only about one-third the number of body parts that a steel monocoque contains. Thus not only does it require far fewer joints than the 3,000 spot welds which keep a typical steel-bodied family car together - a self-piercing riveting process is being used for the first time ever to assemble a car 'body in white' (the basic shell structure), instead of spot welding. The welding of aluminium is in any case difficult and requires high energy inputs. The riveting system, developed by Henrob, a small specialist company based at Flint in North Wales in partnership with Audi, is mechanical, quiet, generates no fumes and consumes relatively small amounts of energy. Rivets, however, do have to be manufactured and purchased. And there is one energy disadvantage not suffered by steel: the completed bodyshell has to be heated to 2100C for 30 minutes to give it the required strength. Other lightweight materials are being investigated in pursuit of greater efficiency, prominent among them magnesium and plastic composites. Like aluminium, magnesium suffers from the drawback of requiring a much higher energy content than steel in its manufacture - although this is more than offset in the case of aluminium by the ease with which it is recycled. Recycling is also the biggest problem facing plastic composites. Thermoplastics can be melted down and used again, but only in lower grade applications (from a body panel to a coffee pot, for example). With other composites it is difficult to do much more with them than chop them up and burn them as an energy source. Meanwhile, the steel industry is fighting back. Working with some vehicle makers, they have begun the development of car body engineering that they say could make steel bodies up to 30 per cent lighter. The aim is to improve the rigidity-to-weight ratio of the body structure, thus identifying which parts could be strengthened in order to allow more of the body to be lightened. Development of more energy-efficient engines and transmissions continues. However, it is all too easy for laudable goals to be in conflict. Two-stroke engines such as those developed by Western Australia's Orbital Engine Company, are a case in point. Two-strokes have no valves and thus none of the heavy and complicated components needed to operate them. The Orbital is half the size of a conventional engine of similar capacity and saves about one-third the weight of a conventional unit. Size for size the engine is 10 per cent more powerful and 12 per cent more economical than its conventional rivals. Ford has a fleet of around 20 Orbital-engined Fiesta cars operating in Europe as prototypes. But despite these obvious advantages in terms of energy efficiency, Ford is having increasing difficulty with exhaust emissions of the units and its hopes of using the engines in production cars of the mid- to late-1990s have been receding. The problem is the amount of nitrogen oxides the engines emit. With electrically-powered and other 'alternative' fuelled vehicles also encountering increasing technological difficulties, there is an upsurge in popularity of the diesel engine in some parts of the world. The diesel is changing its image rapidly from noisy, dirty and slow to a smooth and capable performer for most volume car applications - and with fuel economy overall at least 20 per cent better than that of a petrol equivalent. More significant, as traffic congestion increases, is that the diesel is at its most economical in stop-start urban conditions, when economy of a petrol engine is at its worst. As drivers have become aware that the performance penalties of 'driving diesel' are rapidly failing, so diesels' market share is rising in most countries. In the UK, where only a few thousands diesels were sold a decade ago, diesels now account for more than one in five cars sold - and the proportion is still rising.</p>

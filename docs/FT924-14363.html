			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: A Cohen again cuts dividend AS AN END to the recession was not apparent and further cost reductions were unlikely to make any impact until next year, A Cohen is again reducing its dividend in 'the interests of financial prudence'. Following the cut of 13.1p in last year's final, the current interim payment is being reduced from 6.6p to 3.4p, costing Pounds 55,000 (Pounds 107,000). For the first half of 1992 this maker of non-ferrous metal ingots saw its pre-tax profit fall from Pounds 555,000 to Pounds 496,000, on turnover down from Pounds 41.2m to Pounds 38.1m. Earnings per share were 1.18p (8.97p). The company said that although there were modest improvements in some sections they were offset by worsening conditions in others.</p>

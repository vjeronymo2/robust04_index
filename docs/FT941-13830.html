			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / LDP aid sought for reform plan Members of Japan's ruling coalition today meet the opposition Liberal Democratic party in an attempt to revive political reform plans, crippled by a revolt in the alliance's own camp. Proposals for the most radical reorganisation of Japan's scandal-tainted democracy for more than 45 years were voted down at their final hurdle in the upper house of parliament on Friday. A defiant Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who has staked his job on reforming the political and electoral system, vowed over the weekend to soldier on. Mr Hosokawa also said he would, as planned, meet Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, for the US-Japan summit on February 11, to conclude talks on opening Japan's market to imports. The government would make 'serious and vigorous efforts' to launch economic stimulus measures before the US summit, said Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister. Fears that an urgently needed economic stimulus package will be delayed beyond its expected arrival in the next few days are expected to trigger a fall in Japanese share prices today. Mr Hosokawa hopes to persuade the LDP to form a joint panel of the upper and lower houses of parliament to agree to a watered-down version of his four reform bills. This will be discussed today by directors of the lower chamber's steering committee, from the government and LDP. Such a panel would need a two-thirds majority for a new scheme, before it could pass the amended plan to both houses for adoption by simple majority. However, the chances of success are overshadowed by the fact that an unknown number of LDP politicians oppose the reform plan's proposed abandonment of Japan's unique multi-seat constituency system. The surprise vote against the plans, at what had appeared to be the climax of a five-year national debate, provoked a stream of support for political reform in the weekend press. The next stage is unclear. Several Japanese political observers yesterday predicted that Mr Hosokawa might resign after the US summit and then hand over the reins of the coalition to Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister, or to Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary. However, this would be only an interim leadership, according to Mr Minoru Morita, a popular political commentator, who believes the present drama is an early step in a political realignment that will take many years.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Aden, Yemen, June 10 (AFP) -- Northern heavy  artillery gunners shelled the southern stronghold of Aden on  Friday, a day after the collapse of the latest ceasefire in  Yemen's civil war.    Shells crashed into the Khormaksar district, near the  airport  used by southern warplanes, an AFP correspondent said.  Ambulances rushed to the scene, but there was no immediate  casualty toll available.    The bombardment cut off electricity supplies to several  districts of the capital of the south's breakaway state.  [passage omitted]</p>

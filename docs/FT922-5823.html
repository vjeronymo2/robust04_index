			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Observer: Plane words The power of the press. Observer reported yesterday that John Major was travelling around central Europe in an ancient chartered aircraft. Within hours his aides were promising things would be different in future. They revealed that Downing Street is negotiating with the RAF to provide a permanent customised jet to fly Major and his entourage around the world - Britain's equivalent of Air Force One. There is only one snag. The Treasury has yet to approve the several million pounds necessary to provide the prime minister with an aircraft befitting an international statesman.</p>

			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / International Company News: Skoda plans to raise DM1.2bn syndicated loan SKODA Automobila, the joint venture between Volkswagen of Germany and Skoda, the Czechoslovak car manufacturer, is planning to raise a DM1.2bn (Dollars 857m) syndicated bank loan under the umbrella of the International Finance Corporation. The deal will be co-arranged by Credit Suisse First Boston, JP Morgan, Deutschebank and Dresdnerbank. It will mark the first time an eastern European corporate borrower attempts to raise a significant sum on western markets and should set a benchmark for similar blue chip foreign-controlled companies in the region. Mr Hans Meisner of the CSFB banking department in London said the terms of the loan were being negotiated and should shortly be placed privately among banks. Under a joint-venture agreement Volkswagen bought 31 per cent of Skoda for DM620m and is committed to lift its participation to 70 per cent by 1995.</p>

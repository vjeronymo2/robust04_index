			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Letter: The other Charlie at Revlon Sir, In your article 'Revlon to sell 20m shares in move to pay down debts' (May 27) you described Charles Revson as 'Revlon's eccentric founder'. The only inaccuracy in this description with which I would venture to take issue is that he might more correctly be described as co-founder. Some of your lady readers may recall the name of one of Revlon's more famous scents  -'The Two Charlies' - a recognition of my late husband Charles Lachman's role. He provided the initial capital and was the chemist who, with a painter's eye for colour, mixed the nail varnish from the chemicals and other ingredients he had devised, in a bath tub in Florida with an intrigued Revson looking on. Charles Lachman was retiring and modest, always giving full credit to the energetic marketing genius of Charles Revson, and he stood back in later years from the corporate affairs of Revson. Nevertheless, without his foresight, chemical training and financial backing Revlon could not have been founded as it was - he took quiet pride in the fact that the 'L' in Revlon stood (and still stands) for his surname, Lachman.

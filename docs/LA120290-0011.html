			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KUDOS TO DUO OF DEVOTED SOCIAL WORKERS  </P> <P> A few weeks ago, in response to President George Bush's "read my hips" remark,  a local news commentator said, "Sometimes I think I'm watching theater of the  absurd." The Nov. 16 View section evoked a similar response in me.  </P> <P> Beneath the story about Kwasi Geiggar and Mal Neely's determined, compassionate  struggle to help troubled teen-agers was a story about $250-$14,000 holiday  dresses ("All Aglitter for the Holidays").  </P> <P> Who can unashamedly buy a $8,200 "French peach silk chiffon gown" when Geiggar  and Neely are understaffed, some children won't have holiday meals, American  soldiers won't have holidays at home, and recession knocks?  </P> <P> Moreover, why do American women have to make themselves look like presents to  be valued in our society?  </P> <P> Los Angeles, wake up. Trade your holiday clothing funds for a donation to  Geiggar and Neely's Camp Returnee program and you'll have an easier time  looking in the mirror, even without your holiday duds.  </P> <P> SYBIL KISKEN  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

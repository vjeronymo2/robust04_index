			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by </F> correspondent Franz-Olivier Giesbert in Paris-- live]    [Excerpts] [Giesbert] Good morning, Mr. Leotard.    [Leotard] Good morning.    [Giesbert] We have just heard a song sung by your brother,  Philippe Leotard, who was advertising Scotch whisky. There are  rumors that he was recently found wandering on a road in his  pyjamas. Do you have news of him? Is it good news?    [Leotard] I do not know what you are talking about. I simply  know that he is very talented. I have just heard him singing.  He makes me dream. He writes, and I believe that this is a  good thing. It is his role and I like it. It is his role, not  mine.    [Giesbert] In a way, he is the anti-Francois Leotard.    [Leotard] You know, we are very fond of each other. You will  not manage to drive a wedge between us.    [Giesbert] What I mean is that you do not present the same  image.    [Leotard] He is a poet, he makes people dream. I do not make  people dream. That is all, that is how things are. We do not  have the same goals, the same job.    [Giesbert] Would you like to be in his shoes sometimes?    [Leotard] Naturally. I believe everyone would like to be  someone else at times.    [Giesbert] Would you like to have a drink and write?    [Leotard] Naturally, wouldn't you like that yourself?    [Giesbert] The conference on science and defense, in which  Europe No. 1 is participating, starts today. Would you like to  make soldiers who are listening to us this morning dream by  describing some of these gadgets which are being designed by the  army -- such as high-powered microwave weapons to jam hostile  electronic systems?    [Leotard] As you probably know, we will celebrate the 50th  anniversary of the Liberation. Four years ago it was the 50th  anniversary of the defeat -- France's defeat by the Nazis. We  lost in 1940 because we did not have the same weapons as others.  It was because we were not ready for the invasion, for the war.  I believe that my role, like that of my predecessors and that  of my followers, is to give the Armed Forces the means they need  or the means they will need. One could smile or be worried when  hearing about this new equipment. My role is to make sure that  the Armed Forces have the necessary weapons for all possible  contingencies. I believe that the French people must know that  as far as technological knowledge in this field is concerned, we  are the best in Europe. This represents a lot of know-how,  top-class scientists, superior research centers, and the will  not to wage war. This is a will to defend the country, to defend  certain values, to be present in the world, but we will not  attack anyone.    [Giesbert] Are we defending peace through force, as [French  writer] Romain Rolland said?    [Leotard] Absolutely!    [Giesbert] Francois Mitterrand announced on 10 May that  nuclear tests will not be resumed and the right-wing majority in  parliament expressed outrage. Let us try to consider this issue  in detail. The first point is that experts are apparently  divided on whether or not to suspend tests before computer tests  are possible.    [Leotard] In fact, France must obtain as rapidly as possible  -- but this will take several years, possibly seven, eight or 10  years -- the ability to simulate [tests], that is, the  possibility to study the effects of a nuclear explosion in a  laboratory. This is essential for our country if it wants to  remain a great power. To achieve this the scientists, all the  scientists, are telling us -- as it is their responsibility to  do so -- that we must be able to carry out some tests to  experiment.    [Giesbert] You are saying all the scientists; some say some  scientists.    [Leotard] I have not once met a single scientist saying the  opposite. Not once, not a single scientist.    [Giesbert] Are those who disagree not scientists?    [Leotard] Generally speaking, they are politicians. This is  different. On the whole, French scientists say that to secure  this capacity we need some tests. I believe that we must  remember what the history of this venture has been since 1960.  General de Gaulle developed the French nuclear deterrent against  a general opposition. Therefore, I believe we must continue on  this path.    [Giesbert] Mr. Leotard, if all other countries halt nuclear  testing do you seriously believe that France will be able to run  counter to the international community for long? This will seem  rather strange.    [Leotard] Not everyone has stopped testing. As you know,  since the moratorium was declared, China has continued. Other  countries have obtained this capacity of simulating explosions  before us and did so better than we did. I believe that France  should not allow itself to be left behind otherwise it will lose  part of its independence and of its defense capabilities.    [Giesbert] Let us now consider European issues. By laying  the foundations of a Franco-German army, Helmut Kohl and  Francois Mitterrand took a real political risk. They laid the  foundations of a European defense policy and we have the feeling  that this is moving much slower under a [French] right-wing  majority.    [Leotard] I do not believe that this can be said. As you may  have seen in the [defense] white paper, we expressed a deep  European conviction.    [Giesbert] We are still waiting for the decisions.    [Leotard] They have been made. You just need to consider the  expansion of the Eurocorps.    [Giesbert] These were often decisions made by Francois  Mitterrand or by Socialist governments.    [Leotard] Don't say that. It is not true. [passage omitted]    [Giesbert] Mr. Leotard, concerning Bosnia, last year you  were  ready to take things to the bitter end. Today you are, let us  say, more realistic. What is behind this U-turn? The  government, the ministry, the military?    [Leotard] No. I always said that air strikes should have  been carried out when there were no UN soldiers on the ground.  This was before the summer of 1992. As soon as UN soldiers  were deployed on the ground the basic responsible attitude was  to avoid endangering their lives unnecessarily. That is all. I  never changed my mind on this issue. I believe that we must be  very firm on this new doctrine which is currently perverting  Europe, namely ethnic cleansing.    [Giesbert] Do you really believe that France will carry out  its threat to pull out its forces from the former Yugoslavia?    [Leotard] I always said, and I repeat, that no one is being  forced to do absurd things. I would like you to know that we  have begun the process of withdrawing of a certain number of  battalions that we have there. First, the one in Glina, in  Krajina, and then the one in Bihac. Before the end of the year,  there will be about 2,500 fewer French soldiers on the territory  of the former Yugoslavia. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Convertible for British Land A handful of borrowers ventured back into the international bond market, testing the waters with an assortment of Eurobond and equity-linked deals, including fairly substantial offerings from British Land and Abbey National. British Land raised Pounds 150m through a Euroconvertible bond with a range of special features. The bonds are undated, with a coupon of 6 per cent and a conversion price of Pounds 5.10 per share, a premium of 23 per cent. Swiss Bank Corporation bought the deal and is distributing it predominantly among Swiss and other continental European investors. British Land has the right to redeem the bonds at par after 14 years, or after seven years if its average closing share price during the preceding 30 days has been at least 130 per cent of the conversion price. British Land may also allow the bonds to be exchanged at any time after two years into irredeemable convertible preference shares: there is a further option allowing the company to exchange the convertible preference shares back into convertible bonds. 'By going into the preference shares, the bonds are convertible into non-equity capital, and by reversing back (into bonds) it would cease to be non-equity capital but would enjoy the tax treatment accorded on interest,' said Mr John Weston Smith, finance director at British Land. He said the company had wanted to lock into undated, low interest financing. He indicated that just over a third of the funds would be used to reduce bank debt and the rest as part of the company's purchase programme in association with the Quantum Fund, George Soros's hedge fund. British Land Quantum Property Investment Fund was formed last June by British Land and Mr Soros. The British Land share price which had opened at Pounds 4.14, fell back to Pounds 4.05 on the news and closed at Pounds 4.07, although SBC said the stock had come off in line with the overall market. The bonds were launched at par and closed at 97.00-97.50 - at fees. The other main deal of the day was Abbey National's L250bn, 10-year issue with a 9 per cent coupon, which is intended to have particular appeal for retail investors in search of high-yielding paper. The Eurolira sector of the international bond market saw a rush of activity in January, when several borrowers launched deals with coupons in the region of 7.7 to 7.8 per cent. Abbey National's coupon of 9 per cent is a reflection of how much the Eurolira sector and Italian bond market have fallen back in the recent bond market shake-up. With a re-offer price of 99.625 per cent, the bonds yield 9.06 per cent, according to Morgan Stanley, the joint lead manager for the deal, substantially higher than the yields of 8.3 to 8.6 per cent available in the secondary market. Growing demand for bonds in Asia has prompted Moody's Investors Service, the international credit rating agency, to set up its first regional office in Hong Kong, ahead of its rival Standard &amp; Poor's, Reuter reports. Edward Young, who will be director of the new Asia-Pacific office, to open in a few months, said as Asia's private wealth continues to grow, investors are calling for more research on fixed-interest issues launched in the region. The need to finance badly needed infrastructure in Asia will continue to expand the region's debt market, he added.</p>

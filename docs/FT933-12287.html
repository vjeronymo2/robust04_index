			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Travel: Tried Cyprus? - Practical Traveller VINEYARDS, olive groves and orange trees; mimosa along the motorways; monasteries where monks make wine and nuns make honey; Byzantine churches and beach resorts - this is Cyprus, the third largest island in the Mediterranean and divided in two since 1974 when the Turks invaded and occupied a third of the northern part. 'It's a small country, how can you divide it?' asked a home-sick Greek Cypriot border guard re-settled from the north as we, in the Greek and southern half of Nicosia, stared at the rolled wire and bare walls of the buffer zone that cuts the city in half. Tourists can cross the border; they need a passport and must return by sunset. The best way to get around is by car, although there are inter-city and village buses, as well as service taxis which run every half-hour between the main towns and can be shared. Nicosia, the capital, seems to be neglected by all but a few tour operators as a place to stay. This is a pity, because it is a delight. Coastal towns in Cyprus do not only have beautiful beaches - they have chunks of history all around them. Limassol, the island's largest resort and wine-making centre, has the recently-excavated ruins of ancient Amathus, the castle of the Knights of St John, dark-sand beaches, a glitzy tourist strip and five-star beach hotels. Just outside the town, the spectacular amphitheatre overlooking the sea at Curium (or Kourion - there are many ways to spell names in Cyprus) is still used for concerts and plays. A short drive from the harbour at Paphos you find restored third-century mosaics in the House of Dionysus, the rock where Aphrodite rose from the sea, and the grotto where she bathed. The practical traveller in Paphos might also like to know that contact lenses can be bought there for two-thirds of their UK cost. 'People come to Cyprus,' a guide told me, 'for the good weather, the beaches, a lot of culture and the antiquities. But to see the real Cyprus, you must go into the villages where old ladies wear black and men sit around in coffee shops. It's still a traditional way of life there.' Houses in small villages, as yet untouched by tourism, are now being restored and are available for holiday rental, though the Cyprus tourist authority is treading cautiously and taking local peoples' feelings into account. Not everyone wants an influx of visitors. If they want to, visitors can help with grape-picking, wine- and bread-making. A car is essential for this kind of holiday. The Cyprus Tourist Office in London (tel: 071-734-9822) offers excellent free booklets on the history of the island, special interest holidays, accommodation, nature trails in the Troodos mountains, and a diary of events. More than 50 UK tour operators feature holidays in Cyprus: for a complete list and information about activity holidays, contact Greystone International Publishing (0708-757423) and ask for its free Explore Cyprus booklet.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Observer: Capital idea The sudden exit of yet another senior figure from Invesco MIM - Peter Knapton, in charge of the UK wholesale business - leaves the fund management group with an even greater gaping hole on the UK side of the now mainly American business. Since the middle of last year almost half of the staff at director level on the UK side have gone. By all accounts, the Devonshire Square office has been an even more unhappy shop since the departure the other week of finance director Ratan Engineer and half a dozen other colleagues. It is felt that Norman Riddell, the new boss of the European operations, has been keeping rather too low a profile amid all the unpleasantness. Now Invesco is holding its breath to see what sort of fine Imro will impose at the end of the self-regulatory body's long-running investigation. But when Invesco next has some cash to spare, the only sensible way to restore the tattered UK business - if that is what the Georgia-based executive chairman Charles Brady decides he wants to do - is by acquisition. Observer does not know how well Riddell gets on with his former stablemates at Capital House, the Royal Bank of Scotland subsidiary which he set up and subsequently left to join Invesco, but it would be an obvious port of call if and when RBS shows any inclination to sell. Trouble is, there is little point in an acquisition until the Invesco name becomes somewhat less of a liability.</p>

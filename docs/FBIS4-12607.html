			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Italicized passages recorded] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the  Yemeni Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of  the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], accompanied by Dr.  'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, member of the YSP Political Bureau and  secretary of foreign relations, arrived in Amman today on a  two-day visit to Jordan during which they will meet with His  Majesty King Husayn and senior officials. The visit comes  within the framework of their tour of the region.    Upon arrival at Amman Civil Airport, Salim Salih Muhammad,  member of the Yemeni Presidential Council, spoke to reporters  about his visit Jordan. He said:    [Muhammad] First, we carry the greetings of the Yemeni  people and of their political leadership and parties to His  Majesty King Husayn and the fraternal Jordanian people. We also  carry our great appreciation for the efforts exerted by our  Jordanian brothers and by His Majesty King Husayn, including  both the efforts that preceded the signing of the accord  document and the efforts that followed, represented by the great  role played by fraternal Jordan within the military committee,  as well as its political efforts aimed at solving the existing  political crisis.    Our current tour comes within the framework of efforts  to inform our brothers in Jordan and the Arab brothers of the  nature of the present situation. It also comes within the  framework of a request for help, especially from fraternal  Jordan, to overcome problems and certain difficulties we are  facing. We specifically ask fraternal Jordan to continue this  role because, in our view, it is a role that does not concern  the Yemenis alone, but concerns all Arabs. It is an honorable  pan-Arab role.    We reiterate our thanks to fraternal Jordan, to His  Majesty King Husayn, and to the Jordanian Government.    [Announcer] On Yemeni efforts to implement the Yemeni accord  document, Salim Salih Muhammad said:    [Muhammad] The dialogue is still going on. What is  important to us now is to obstruct the military course -- a  course that is frightening to us -- and to reinforce the other  course -- the course of dialogue -- in order to begin  implementing this document that sets the practical and sound  solutions to correct the Yemeni situation. Moreover, it is now  important to us to build the new Yemen, which secures rights and  duties for all its people.    [Announcer] On the presence of other Arab mediation efforts.  He said:    [Muhammad] We do not view mediation efforts as separate  efforts but as concentrated Arab efforts. Therefore, we welcome  all our Arab brothers' support for the ongoing efforts inside  Yemen. At the same time, we particularly welcome the Arab  efforts represented by the roles played by the two fraternal  countries, Jordan and Oman.    [Announcer] On the practical steps that should be taken in  order to overcome the crisis in Yemen, Salim Salih Muhammad said:    [Muhammad] At the Amman meeting held in this good land  during the holy month of Ramadan, certain issues were defined in  terms of beginning to implement the provisions of the accord  document, starting with the security issue, which worries the  Yemenis and really needs immediate implementation in order to  bring things back to normal in Yemen. Afterward, we will get  into the priorities according to a fixed timetable. This is the  normal course in order to get the crisis and Yemen out of the  dark tunnel.</p>

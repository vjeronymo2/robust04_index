			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 5 TASS -- Both Moscow and Paris  favour a further development of Russian-French cooperation,  specifically, in the military-technical and conversion spheres,  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and French Defence  Minister Francois Leotard, now on a visit here, announced today  at their meeting in the Russian Foreign Ministry.    Welcoming the French defence minister, Kozyrev pointed out  that Russia and France, the military and the diplomats of the  two countries, had traditionally maintained close ties. The  Russian Foreign Ministry is maintaining the same relations with  the Russian Defence Ministry and Minister Pavel Grachev. "We  even agreed with our minister to create `allied  military-diplomatic troops'," Kozyrev joked. This does not  mean, however, that Russian imperialism is being revived, he  continued and urged not to believe such allegations. "What is  being revived is the normal statehood of Russia," Kozyrev  stressed.    "Our talks in Moscow are an integral part of the overall  efforts, aimed at the development of bilateral relations and  cooperation and the revival of the Russian-French alliance in a  new setting," he said.    The ministers discussed problems dealing with the  strengthening of stability on the European continent, the  Bosnian settlement and the staging of peace-keeping operations,  including on the territory of the former USSR. The conversation  was held in an atmosphere, which reflected the relations of  partnership taking shape between Russia and France.</p>

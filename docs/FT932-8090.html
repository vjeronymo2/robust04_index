			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Saatchi surprises City with rights issue to raise Pounds 73m SAATCHI and Saatchi, the world's fourth largest advertising group, yesterday sprang a Pounds 73m rights issue on the City. Shareholders are asked to pay 130p, a 24 per cent discount to Tuesday's closing price of 172p, on the basis of 10 new shares for every 27 held. About Pounds 36.5m of the cash will be used to reduce bank debt (average net debt was Pounds 194m in December 1992), Pounds 19m will be used to acquire minority interests in European advertising subsidiaries, Pounds 10.5m will be used to strengthen media buying businesses and to develop businesses in growing markets in Asia, Latin America and east Europe, Pounds 7m will be used to acquire new information technology. The targeted minority interests are 50 per cent of SSAW Italy; 20 per cent of Grupo BSB Spain; and 37 per cent of Scholz &amp; Friends Germany. Mr Charles Scott, chief executive, said yesterday the group's 20-bank syndicate fully approved the rights issue. He was confident that institutional investors would support the call for additional cash. For Mr Scott, the rights issue continues the process of putting the group back on a sound financial footing. The rights issue is fully underwritten by SG Warburg and UBS Ltd. The largest institutional investor is the State of Wisconsin Investment Board with 8.99 per cent. Currently, 50 per cent of the group's shareholders are in the US, 40 per cent in the UK. Of that number, half are private individuals. Since 1990 the group has sold seven non-core businesses and is now concentrating, Mr Scott said, on organic growth of its main business, global advertising. However, there are some doubts about future trading in the US, where an important clients, Mars, has consolidated its media buying outside the group. In March 1991 Saatchi achieved a recapitalisation, which removed the threat of having to redeem Pounds 211m of Euro-preference shares. Saatchi's share price has moved from the equivalent of more than Pounds 60 in 1986, to 95p in December 1991, touching 245p in May 1992. Saatchi's share price yesterday dropped to 161p but finished the day down just 2p at 170p. Lex, Page 20</p>

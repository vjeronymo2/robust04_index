			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] An incident between a Venezuelan Army unit and Zulia  University students has intensified the wave of violence  reported over the past few days in the capital of Zulia. As we  were the first to disclose, an Army jeep escorted by a National  Guard jeep knocked down two University of Zulia students and two  high school students who were immediately taken to the Maracaibo  University Hospital.    The incident took place when the jeep was transiting  University Avenue and the students attempted to stop it and set  it on fire. The Army troops increased their speed and the  incident ensued, resulting in four students being injured. The  two university students most seriously hurt received traumatic  injuries and were transferred urgently from the University  Hospital to El Varillal clinic in Zulia, where they are  undergoing emergency surgery.    Due to this circumstance, the rectorial council of the  University of Zulia decided to suspend classes indefinitely and  the Secretariat of Education in Zulia ordered the suspension of  classes at the largest high schools in the Zulian capital. Angel  Lombardi, rector of the University of Zulia, commented on the  situation.    [Begin Lombardi recording] After consulting with the deans,  various authorities, and the student leadership, we decided that  it would be wise to suspend all academic activities today and  tomorrow. During these two days the University Council will  assess the situation. We believe our decision might help to  reduce the violence of the past few days, but I agree with the  assertions that I have heard. I believe that on Friday there was  reason for indignation--Friday was a day of indignation and  anger--over a death which was truly unnecessary and very  regrettable. [end recording]    Classes have been suspended because the disturbances over  the  past few days ended in the burning of 15 vehicles and losses  estimated at 200 million bolivares. On Tuesday, the largest  demonstrations were staged in Cabimas, where a vehicle was  burned. In Maracaibo, high school students staged riots despite  the suspension of classes. They burned tires and closed streets,  but no major incidents were reported.</p>

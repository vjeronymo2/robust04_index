			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Pavol Janik: "What Is the IQ of CIA?"] </F>   [Text] Apparently the question needs to be openly raised  about the average IQ of CIA staffers and collaborators,  particularly in Slovakia. The question is highly topical. It  seems that, to this day, U.S. official quarters are not properly  informed [nezorientovali sa] about the Slovak issue, which  testifies either to the incompetence of its intelligence sources  or to the provision of deliberately incorrect information to the  U.S. political leadership by U.S. secret services.    After all, we are familiar with this situation from the era  of so-called socialism when, in some of its stages, particularly  in the fifties, political institutions were evidently  manipulated by the state police. One cannot but hope that the  former communist countries with the Soviet Union in the lead do  not serve as an example for the contemporary United States in  this respect. That also applies to the unerring selection of  evident dummies for the vitally important security structures of  the state.    The present state of affairs is borne out by the continuing  practice of U.S. institutions to issue official information,  according to which the situation in Slovakia is similar to that  in the warring countries of the former Soviet Union.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / International Company News: Australis Media confirms it is in talks with News Corporation Australis Media, Australia's would-be pay TV operator, said yesterday that it was holding talks with Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, but declined to be drawn on the nature of these discussions. Australis holds one of the two commercially-available satellite licences for the Australian market and has pledged to deliver the nation's first pay-TV service early next year. But it has come under increasing pressure from the big existing media operators - notably Mr Kerry Packer and Mr Rupert Murdoch  -who have formed consortia with local telecommunications groups and are holding out the promise of rival cable-based subscription services in the not-too-distant future. There has been speculation that this pressure will lead Australis to team up eventually with the joint venture set up by News and Telecom, the large government-owned telecommunications group, currently installing a national cable infrastructure. The three companies could then pool their programming, subscriber management and delivery resources. News, through its ownership of Fox film studios, could contribute programming, and also subscriber management. Confirmation of the talks with News was given by Mr Rodney Price, Australis' chairman, at the company's annual meeting in Sydney yesterday. However, he also disclosed that the company had just secured a partnership agreement with Sony Pictures, MCA/Universal, and Paramount for the provision of general entertainment programming. Mr Price repeated the group's determination to launch a pay-TV service in the new year.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In determining which surrogate value to use for each factor of production that was not sourced from a market-economy country, we selected, where possible, from publicly available, published information that is: (1) an average non-export value; (2) representative of a range of prices within the POI if submitted by an interested party, or most contemporaneous with the POI; (3) product-specific; and (4) tax-exclusive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the exception of corn cobs and furfuryl, we used Indonesian import prices taken from the Indonesian  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Foreign Trade Statistical Bulletin_Imports,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> November 1993. For furfuryl and corn cobs, we relied on a December 5, 1994, U.S. State Department cable from the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia. We were unable to find public information on corn cobs. In the case of furfuryl, the publicly available data that we found was inconsistent ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  attachment three of the concurrence memorandum to this proceeding).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We used Indonesian transportation rates taken from a September 18, 1991, U.S. State Department cable from the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia to value inland freight between the source of the production factor and the furfuryl alcohol factories. In those cases where the respondent failed to provide any information on transportation distances and modes, we applied, as the best information available, the furthest distance and the more expensive mode of transport available from the surrogate information we had selected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To value electricity, we used public information from  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Electric Utilities Data Book for the Asian and Pacific Region,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (January 1993) published by the Asian Development Bank. For other energy inputs, we relied on values for Indonesia published in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Energy D&eacute;tente,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and Indonesian  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Foreign Trade Statistical Bulletin_Imports,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> November 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To value labor amounts, we used labor rates published by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs, U.S. Department of Labor, in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Foreign Labor Trends_Indonesia,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We adjusted the factor values, when necessary, to the POI using wholesale price and consumer price indices published by the International Monetary Fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To value factory overhead, we calculated percentages specific to the furfuryl alcohol industry based on a December 2, 1994, U.S. State Department cable from the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For general expense percentages, we used the statutory minimum of 10 percent of materials, labor, and overhead costs calculated for each factory. For profit we used the statutory minimum of eight percent of materials, labor, factory overhead, and general expenses. We did not have Indonesian values for either general expenses or profit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We added packing based on Indonesian values obtained from a December 2, 1994 U.S. State Department cable from the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> All Other Rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MOFTEC and CCCMMC have identified two PRC exporters of furfuryl alcohol to the United States during the POI. Both have responded in this investigation. Accordingly, we have based the All Other Rate on the weighted average of the margins calculated in this proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

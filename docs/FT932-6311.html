			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo eases as volume swells to 750m shares LATE futures-led selling erased early gains as a strong yen appreciated further against the dollar, the market ending mixed in active trading, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The Nikkei average finished 43.36 easier at 20,852.63, after a session high of 21,105.91 and low of 20,786.47. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 13.99 at 1,653.71, however. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 2.84 at 1,263.10. Volume reached 750m shares, against Wednesday's 481m, as active early foreign buying was replaced later by profit-taking and arbitrage-related selling. Advances outscored declines by 698 to 379, with 104 issues unchanged. Brokers said the 225-issue Nikkei average is relatively insensitive to recent foreign exchange fluctuations, market participants regarding the yen's advance against the dollar as temporary. The broader Topix index, they added, is more representative of current market sentiment, having outperformed the Nikkei during recent sessions, and is less susceptible to the arbitrage unwinding that often hits equity prices during late activity. Financial sector issues, which equal about 30 per cent of the first section on the Tokyo stock exchange in terms of market capitalisation, drew considerable amounts of buying by individuals yesterday. The sector, overall, has largely underperformed the market and some investors speculate that bank shares will form a sizeable portion of the forthcoming capital-weighted stock index futures index. Fuji Bank appreciated Y140 to Y2,270, Mitsubishi Y100 to Y2,780 and Sumitomo Y90 to Y2,250. Fanuc, the leading Japanese machine tool maker, retreated Y80 to Y4,100, partly due to its projection that pre-tax profits will decline by about 9 per cent in the current financial year. The car sector declined, Toyota by Y60 to Y1,670, Honda Y40 to Y1,350 and Nissan Y24 to Y775. Pharmaceutical issues retreated on profit-taking, Yamanouchi by Y40 to Y2,420 and Daiichi Y10 to Y1,710. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 177.96 up at 23,080.88 in volume of 35.9m shares. Roundup A NUMBER of the region's markets set record closing highs yesterday. HONG KONG was lifted by reports that the Sino-UK airport committee would meet next week to discuss financing for the project. The Hang Seng index finished at an all-time peak, 97.52 or 1.33 per cent ahead at 7,447.24. Turnover increased to HKDollars 6.3bn from Wednesday's HKDollars 5.4bn. HSBC Holdings strengthened HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 74.50, Hang Seng Bank advanced HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 59 and Bank of East Asia rose HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 38.25. SINGAPORE also set a new closing high, with investors encouraged by data showing a 7 per cent growth in GDP for the first quarter. The Straits Times Industrial index climbed 17.27 to 1,885.91. Cycle and Carriage rose 45 cents to SDollars 7.45 on rumours that the Jardine group, of Hong Kong, might make a takeover offer. AUSTRALIA advanced to a 3 1/2 -year high, helped by strength in US markets and gold stocks. The All Ordinaries index moved ahead 31.7, or 1.85 per cent, to 1,749.1, while the gold shares index put on 49.5, or 2.65 per cent, at 1,918.8. Turnover amounted to ADollars 516.06m. National Australia Bank continued to perform well after last week's positive results, gaining 15 cents at ADollars 10.10. Among gold issues, Placer Pacific forged ahead 24 cents to ADollars 3.74 and Newcrest added 10 cents at ADollars 4.48. NEW ZEALAND, meanwhile, continued to push ahead, recording another 33-month high in spite of remaining in negative territory for most of the session. The NZSE-40 index closed 1.88 firmer at 1,642.42 in turnover of NZDollars 33m. There was strong activity in Carter Holt Harvey, mainly from overseas investors, but the shares ended 3 cents down at NZDollars 2.99. KARACHI was boosted by Wednesday's supreme court decision, which came after the close, to restore the government of Mr Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister. The KSE index moved forward 29.01 to 1,171.26 and rising issues outnumbered declines by 214 to 58. SEOUL was firmer on strong overseas interest in large-capitalisation stocks. The composite stock index rose 7.31 to 737.22 in turnover of Won1.01 trillion, compared with Won726.6bn on Wednesday. BOMBAY weakened for a fourth consecutive session following the easing of restrictions on short-selling earlier in the week. The BSE index dropped 31 to 2,220.</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / AEEU vows to fight drain on subscriptions BRITAIN'S largest manufacturing union - the AEEU engineering and electrical union - has called a meeting of all its full-time officials to discuss how to minimise the impact of new labour laws. THe union says they will threaten 80 per cent of its annual income. 'The very future of our union is at stake,' Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary, said yesterday. 'We are about to enter a battle for survival.' The union's fears stem from the provision in the government's Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act which says employers cannot deduct union contributions from their employees' wages unless in the past three years those concerned have signed an authorisation to allow this. The legal threat to the existence of the so-called check-off arrangement could damage further already weakened unions, which receive an estimated 80 per cent of their income from membership subscriptions collected for them by employers. The AEEU, which is meeting on Tuesday, is the first union to mobilise its officials to combat the problem. 'We are bound to lose some members as a result of the new legal provision,' said Mr Laird. 'We know already of some small engineering companies which have announced they are withdrawing check-off facilities. This new law is designed to emasculate the unions.' As much as Pounds 20m of the AEEU's annual income derives from the subscriptions collected from 80 per cent of its 800,000 members under the check-off arrangement. The union fears that as there is no legal obligation on employers to operate check-off, some may use the new statutory requirements as an excuse to withdraw the arrangements. Under the law, workers covered by check-off before August 30 this year are each required to give their specific approval for the arrangement within 12 months. This means every member on check-off must sign the necessary form of authority before August 30 1994. Union officials are allowed to collect the necessary authorisations and give them to the employer. The AEEU will tell its officials at the meeting on Tuesday that it wants the signed forms with employers no later than the end of next June. An alternative to check-off is for union members to pay subscriptions through direct debit transfer from their bank accounts. At present only 2 per cent of AEEU members do this and Mr Laird wants to raise this figure to 10 per cent. The other option is to return to the traditional system under which union stewards collect subscriptions at the workplace directly from the members, although Mr Laird says this can be disruptive and inefficient. The Engineering Employers Federation said yesterday it had not offered any advice to its members on what to do about the new law.</p>

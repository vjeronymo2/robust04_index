			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We disagree with TIMET. Consistent with the Kazakh Government's questionnaire response, our analysis of Census data reveals that no shipments of titanium sponge have entered the United States from Kazakhstan during the period of review. While TIMET provided public information on imports of titanium sponge from Russia and Ukraine in those ongoing administrative reviews, it provided no information on shipments in this case. Absent evidence to the contrary, we conclude that there were no imports, including imports under TIB procedures, of titanium sponge from Kazakhstan during the review period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Results of Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on our analysis of the comments received we have not changed the final results from those presented in the preliminary results of review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise, entered or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of these final results of review, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act: the cash deposit rate for entries of titanium sponge from Kazakhstan will be 83.96 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice also serves as a reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective orders (APOs) of their responsibility concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Timely written notification of return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: March 31, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Susan G.

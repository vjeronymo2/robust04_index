			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Royal's US gap The hunt is on for a new boss for the ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND's US banking business following the announcement that George Graboys is retiring as president and chief executive of the Royal Bank's Rhode Island-based subsidiary - Citizens Financial Group. Graboys, who has headed Citizens for the last decade, is the latest in a series of top level retirements at the Royal Bank of Scotland Group. It is just over a year since George Younger took over from Sir Michael Herries, as chairman, and earlier this month George Mathewson replaced Charles Winter as group chief executive. Picking the right replacement for Graboys, who has overseen a five-fold growth in Citizens' assets to Dollars 4bn, is important because so many UK banks have run into difficulties in the US banking market. Under Graboys, Citizens has remained profitable throughout the deep US recession and remains one of the best-capitalised banks. Although Herbert Cummings, an executive vice president of Citizens Financial and Kenneth Hogberg, the chief financial officer, are potential candidates for the top job, it is likely that the successor will come from outside the bank. Graboys is to retire in December when he will have reached the age of 60.</p>

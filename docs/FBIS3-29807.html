The visiting delegation of the Communist Party of Uruguay  headed by him was interviewed by KCNA here on February 16.    Pedro Balbi told the reporter that during the visit to Korea  his delegation had the honour of being received by the great  leader President Kim Il-song, who has established the unity of  the leader, the party and the masses and is victoriously leading  socialism of Korea.    Giving his impressions of Korea, the Uruguayan party leader  said:    "I was struck with admiration at the tremendous achievements  of the Korean people in socialist construction.    "The monumental edifices of Korea are so wonderful that they  enjoy admiration from the world people.    "What impressed me most is that your country is training the  rising generation to be fine personnel prepared ideologically,  intellectually and physically.    "During our visit, we saw the staunch mettle of the Korean  people determined to defend and exalt socialism.    "This hardened our confidence in socialist victory."    Roberto Catenachio, a member of the delegation, said  socialism of Korea was built by the Korean people through  self-reliance.

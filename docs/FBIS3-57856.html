A spokesman of the Vienna-based organisation said the IAEA  was "waiting for one of the two sides to get in touch with us."    Contacts between North Korea and the IAEA have been  suspended  since Pyongyang, which is suspected of working to develop  nuclear weapons, refused to let IAEA inspectors into all its  nuclear facilities.    In December, the IAEA rejected a North Korean offer to allow  partial inspection of its facilities.    The IAEA said it had insisted on being allowed to see all  North Korea's nuclear facilities and was "ready to resume its  inspections at any time."    Pyongyang said it was willing to let IAEA inspectors view  five of its seven nuclear facilities.    But at the two others, a nuclear reactor and a uranium  reprocessing plant, both at Yongbyon, North Korea said IAEA  inspectors would only be allowed to put new film in the cameras  already installed to monitor work at the facilities.    It was a request to visit these two sites, which Pyongyang  says are military facilities with no nuclear role, which sparked  North Korea's decision in February to suspend inspections of  existing sites and threaten to withdraw from the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty.

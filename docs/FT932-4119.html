			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Plasterboard blow Preliminary results from Meyer International, the builders merchant, were in line with market expectations and had little real effect on the market, but comments from the company about downward trends in the plasterboard industry produced a sharp slide in BPB shares. The latter, the UK's leading plasterboard manufacturer and one of Europe's top producers, plunged to 219p before settling a net 14 off at 221p in exceptionally heavy turnover of 4.8m after Meyer directors told industry analysts that BPB's most recent plasterboard price rise was not sticking. The price rise, 11 per cent and the third introduced by BPB in the last 18 months, was said by analysts to have been too much and too early. 'It is disappointing, but not tragic,' said one specialist. Other analysts, however, muttered darkly about problems in France, where the building sector is suffering badly, and also mentioned that BPB's monopoly position in plaster supply is threatened by new capacity at Lafarge and Knauf. BPB announces results on July 1, with analysts looking for profits of Pounds 50m to Pounds 60m, compared with last year's Pounds 38m. Meyer also took a bearish view of prospects in Germany, triggering a slide of 9 to 478p in Redland. Meyer lost 7 to 375p.</p>

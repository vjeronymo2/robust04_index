Our Bloemfontein news staff reports  that the soldiers, carrying their baggage, have been seen on the  way to the city. They refused to talk to reporters, and it's  not known whether they intend leaving permanently.    The commander of the peace force, Major General Gabriel  Ramushwana was unavailable for comment.    Members of the Transitional Executive Council, TEC, visited  the place today, but it is not known whether the wage dispute  that resulted in a strike by members of the force has been  resolved.</p>

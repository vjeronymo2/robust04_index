			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Norway's PM optimistic on EU: Oslo may reach membership compromise on control of energy NORWAY has held out hopes for a compromise on the difficult question of aligning its laws on oil and gas licences with the proposed new European Union energy directive. Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister, said she was optimistic of negotiating an agreement by next spring on Norwegian membership of the EU. This would allow the issue to be put to a referendum in Norway next autumn, as part of the proposed accession of Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden on January 1, 1995. In an interview in London with the Financial Times, she stressed that Norway would join the EU only if the other countries of western Europe adjusted some terms of membership to Norway's special needs. The EC needed the 'political will' to accept that Norway's geographic and economic conditions required adaptation in the fields of fisheries, agriculture and energy. 'We will join only if we feel we are welcome - if other countries see that the scene in Norway is different (from elsewhere in the EU),' she said. Mrs Brundtland's minority Labour government is itself split on the question of membership. About 60 per cent of Norwegians are against participation in the Union, according to recent opinion polls. This makes Norway by far the most sceptical of the four European Free Trade Association (Efta) countries negotiating to join. A crucial part of the negotiations centres on the question of Norway's control over its oil and gas resources. Norway has been allowed to take part in EU discussions on a proposed directive to increase competition in the energy sector which would require changes in the country's present laws on oil and gas field licences. However, it has been unhappy about proposals under which Statoil, the national oil company, would no longer have an automatic right to 50 per cent participation in exploration of oil and gas fields. Additionally, the EU wants Statoil to give up its role managing the state's financial participation in the country's energy resources. Mrs Brundtland said, however, that a compromise was possible here. 'If we open for Statoil to be put in an equal situation as far as licences are concerned, then that could be acceptable if we could keep the logical situation that Statoil manages the present state participation. We are looking to see if we can find solutions.'</p>

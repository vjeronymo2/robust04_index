			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Letter: High money changing charges reflect badly on European banks Sir, Could I add a few comments related to your excellent editorial concerning the British clearing banks charges on current accounts ('A PR coup for the banks', September 2). After retiring from a career in international finance I decided to bum in Europe with my son on a budget of Dollars 40 a day each. This called for an examination of all expenses and, in my view, the bank charges for changing money was one of the two worst rackets in Europe (the second is the inability to obtain free tap water). Canadian chartered banks are not philanthropic organisations, yet the spread between buying and selling for major currencies is about 3 per cent for small amounts; generally speaking, there are no extra charges. In England and in most of Europe the spread is about 10 per cent). In addition, most European banks, including British ones, charge a commission which can vary from 2 per cent to 6 per cent and some change offices, especially in Amsterdam but also one in Britain's Victoria station, have an 8 per cent commission. To top it all some banks will accept Visa traveller cheques, but will have another fee to cash an American Express traveller cheque and vice versa. Not a bad business to be in. This is the time when I appreciated my credit card and the ability to withdraw money in any currency at a fair price, but I cannot help but feel that the banks are not improving their reputation with all the young travellers who had no choice but to use their services. This is the case for a common European currency, if there ever is one. Francois P Jeanjean, 447 Crestview Road, Ottawa, Ontario, K1H-5G7 Canada</p>

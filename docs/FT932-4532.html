			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Sumed pipeline plans expansion THE Egypt-based Sumed oil pipeline plans to expand its capacity to pump Gulf oil to Mediterranean markets and increase its market share there, Reuter reports from Cairo. Mr Mohammed Mae'bed, chairman, said three pumps would begin operating at a booster station south of Cairo in March 1994, taking the pipeline's capacity to about 2.3m barrels of oil per day (bpd) from 1.6m bpd now. The Dollars 120m (Pounds 77.9m) expansion had originally been scheduled to finish in September this year. But oil traders said the increase could aggravate the pipeline's problem of congestion as plans to develop storage at the pipeline's Red Sea and Mediterranean terminals were at an earlier stage. 'The problem area is discharging at Ain Sukhna (in the Red Sea),' one trader said. 'People are fed up with the delays, and boosting the pumping capacity and the throughput without corresponding storage isn't going to solve that. In the short term, it's not a good thing.' Sumed officials say the pipeline is already operating above its nominal capacity of 80m tonnes per year but there are frequent snarl-ups at Ain Sukhna. In November last year tankers were waiting up to 10 days to unload and the delays pushed the price of Iranian crudes up on spot markets. The 320km pipeline, set up in 1974, carries mainly Saudi and Iranian crudes. Mr Mae'bed said Sumed was considering adding another 4.5m barrels storage to its current 2.4m barrels at the two terminals. The company's board would discuss this month a feasibility study by Bechtel Corp of the US.</p>

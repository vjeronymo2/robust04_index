			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROSECUTORS IN CAMARENA CASE WANT LIMITS ON QUESTIONING  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors are trying to prevent defense lawyers in the Enrique  Camarena murder trial from cross-examining a prospective government witness who  is reputed to have killed 35 to 50 people while working as an interrogator for  Mexican law enforcement agencies.  </P> <P> The killings, carried out by Jesse Najar Zuno, were disclosed recently in  documents that prosecutors turned over to lawyers for four men who are on trial  in Los Angeles for the 1985 slaying of Camarena, a U.S. Drug Enforcement  Administration agent who was based in Guadalajara, Mexico.  </P> <P> The documents stated that in his capacity as an interrogator and trainer for  the Federal Security Directorate -- Mexico's equivalent of the FBI -- and other  government agencies from 1974 to 1987, Najar "killed 35-50 persons" but the  documents offer no further details.  </P> <P> Najar is expected to testify against Ruben Zuno Arce, a Mexican businessman who  has been indicted as one of the plotters of the Camarena murder.  </P> <P> Najar has worked as a DEA informant since October, 1986, and has been paid  $32,440 by the agency for information and expenses since then, according to the  government documents. He is one of 18 informants prosecutors say they plan to  put on the witness stand.  </P> <P> In February, the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles notified Najar's lawyer,  David Reed of Beverly Hills, that his client would be subpoenaed to testify at  the Camarena trial. The letter stated that Najar was not considered a suspect  in Camarena's death and would get immunity in return for his testimony.  </P> <P> The Feb. 1 letter from Assistant U.S. Atty. Manuel A. Medrano, the lead  prosecutor in the Camarena case, indicates only that Najar will be questioned  about Zuno's alleged role in the case. Zuno has proclaimed his innocence.  </P> <P> Reed has declined to discuss the killings attributed to his client.  </P> <P> Jury selection in the case began Tuesday before U.S. District Judge Edward  Rafeedie and testimony is expected to begin next week.  </P> <P> A motion filed by prosecutors Medrano and John L. Carlton this week asked  Rafeedie to issue an order prohibiting defense lawyers from making any  reference to the killings attributed to Najar in opening statements to the  jury, or even allowing them to cross-examine Najar about the killings.  </P> <P> The prosecutors say that defense lawyers should be prohibited from raising the  killings because it could unfairly undermine his credibility as a witness. The  killings, they stress, had nothing to do with the Camarena case.  </P> <P> Zuno's lawyers said they would ask Rafeedie to deny the request, but declined  to elaborate on their position Thursday.  </P> <P> However, two UCLA criminal law professors who have no connection with the  Camarena case said they thought the prosecutors' request should be denied  because they consider the killings an appropriate subject for  cross-examination.  </P> <P> "I'm astounded that the government would seek to prevent cross-examination on  the killings," said Prof. Robert Garcia, who was a federal prosecutor in New  York from 1983 to 1987.  </P> <P> "The government is wrong when it says this does not go to truthfulness or  veracity," Garcia said. He noted that the judge has discretion under the  Federal Rules of Evidence to determine whether past acts of violence affect a  witness' credibility.  </P> <P> The professor also said that if Zuno's lawyers were not allowed to  cross-examine Najar about the killings it could improperly infringe on his  constitutional rights to confront a witness against him.  </P> <P> "The government's claim is that it is unduly prejudicial" to ask about the  killings, Garcia said. "Where is the prejudice in letting the jury know the  truth?"  </P> <P> Prof. Peter Arenella of UCLA said the issue facing Rafeedie is whether a jury  would be so "distracted and inflamed" by testimony about the killings that it  would not be able to fairly judge the credibility of Najar's testimony.  </P> <P> "The relevance of questioning him concerning his (alleged) killings of 35  individuals while in the employ of the Mexican government is clear," Arenella  said. "One implication from such an admission is that this is an individual who  would be willing to do anything for the right price."  </P> <P> Charles Weisselberg, a USC law professor, took a slightly different view.  </P> <P> He said the act of killing someone does not necessarily indicate that the  individual would testify untruthfully. "I think the court will have to figure  out the circumstances of the alleged killings, which would take a lot of time,"  he said.  </P> <P> "The defense would be within its rights to ask about each of the killings," to  determine if there was anything about the nature of the killings that impugn  Najar's credibility.  </P> <P> Najar's lawyer said that he thought the government may have grounds for keeping  the defense from asking about the slayings because killing someone doesn't make  the person a liar. He said he could not reveal how the federal prosecutors  obtained the information about the killings.  </P> <P> Camarena was abducted on a Guadalajara street in February, 1985. He was  tortured and killed by drug traffickers and his body was found a month later at  a ranch 65 miles outside that city.  </P> <P> Thus far, 22 people have been indicted in the United States and three have been  convicted in Los Angeles in connection with the murder.  </P></p>

Procter &amp; Gamble's agreement to buy the German-based Betrix business from debt-laden Revlon also continued the consolidation of the international cosmetics and toiletries industry. P&amp;G chairman and chief executive Edwin Artzt said the acquisition, part of a US dollars 1.14bn all-cash package also involving the sale of Max factor and other important brands, is a good fit with the company's strategic game plan, making it a global player. US chemicals group Monsanto advanced its restructuring, selling its animal feed ingredients business to Mitsui and Nippon Soda of Japan. Monsanto said the disposal would allow it to focus more tightly on its core strengths and better position it for future growth. Istituto Mobiliare Italiano continued the expansion of its international activities with the purchase of a 51 per cent stake in US securities firm Mabon Nugent. This is the first significant acquisition by an Italian company in the US financial sector since Banca Commerciale Italiana failed to buy Irving Trust in 1988. The purchase of Canada's De Havilland by Alenia (Italy) and Aerospatiale (France) marks another step in the attempt by European aircraft manufacturers to reduce their dependence on the Airbus product range.</p>

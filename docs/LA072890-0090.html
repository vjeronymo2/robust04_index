			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL / SHRINE GAME;  </P> <P> THEY MADE CHANGE FOR BETTER  </P> <P> When UCLA-bound linebackers Bruce Walker and Nkosi Littleton were in the eighth  grade, they probably didn't imagine being teammates in tonight's (6 p.m.)  Shrine all-star football game at the Rose Bowl.  </P> <P> That's because basketball was their game. They played together on a  recreational all-star team, along with Artesia High's Ed O'Bannon, in the  South-Central Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> Walker and Littleton both chose to attend Verbum Dei because of its basketball  history.  </P> <P> For one year, they were committed to basketball. Then it became clear that  their size would suit them better on the football field.  </P> <P> Soon, Walker, who filled out to 6-feet-4 and 250 pounds, transferred to Compton  Dominguez High and gave football a try. Littleton, who grew to 6-2 and 220,  switched to Carson High and did the same.  </P> <P> "They both have enough talent to do whatever they want to do on the football  field," said Ken Sutch, who coached Paramount to its second consecutive  Southern Section Division III title last season. He will coach the South  tonight, along with Jim Barnett of Trabuco Hills.  </P> <P> "Littleton is so good that sometimes you don't know he is here," Sutch said.  </P> <P> "It's like when you have an (A-student) and all you can keep telling him is  'nice job'.  </P> <P> "And Walker, all I can say is when he plays, it's phew! He is fast, big, strong  and aggressive. He is just one dominant player."  </P> <P> UCLA football fans are glad that Walker and Littleton have changed sports.  </P> <P> "All of my life, I wanted to play basketball, until I realized that football  could lead me to better things," said Littleton, who was a consensus  All-American for the Colts from his inside linebacker position last season.  </P> <P> Like Littleton, Walker knew that football could prove to be special for him. He  gave up basketball after his sophomore year.  </P> <P> "I liked football because it gave me an opportunity to let off a lot of  frustration," said Walker, who also was a unanimous All-American linebacker  last fall.  </P> <P> "Once I knew that football was my sport, I tried to concentrate on doing things  that would help me in the long run."  </P> <P> It did not take long for both players to make their presence felt. Littleton  helped Carson win the 1988 City 4-A Division championship as a junior and led  the Colts' defense last fall. Carson made it to the City finals, losing to  Dorsey, 26-15. Littleton made 143 tackles, including 66 unassisted, and  recovered four fumbles during the season.  </P> <P> Although Walker decided to give up basketball, Littleton continued to play and  was a two-year starter for the Colts.  </P> <P> "I'm going to miss playing basketball," Littleton said. "I think I will always  watch basketball before I watch a football game."  </P> <P> While Littleton was a two-sport star during his prep career, Walker was a  two-way standout in one sport.  </P> <P> In playing nearly every minute of every game last season, Walker, who also  started at fullback, made 105 tackles, including 65 unassisted; recovered four  fumbles; had one interception; gained 1,363 yards in 170 carries, and scored 15  touchdowns.  </P> <P> "I like carrying the ball, but outside linebacker is (where) I'd rather play  now because I think I can go farther there," Walker said.  </P> <P> Walker and Littleton did not plan together in choosing UCLA.  </P> <P> "We did not really talk to each other much during recruiting," said Walker, who  will room with Littleton in the fall. "We both had to make our own decision. I  found out that Nkosi was going to UCLA before I made my decision."  </P> <P> Said Littleton: "We went on our Washington recruiting trip together, and we  called each other once or twice, but we never talked about going to school  together."  </P> <P> Littleton considers tonight's game as a sign of things to come.  </P> <P> "When we are on the field together, it is like we both know that no one can  come our way," Littleton said.  </P></p>

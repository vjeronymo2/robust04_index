A decree sent to state labour offices said the authorities must prove to their satisfaction that no German nationals or residents are available to fill the jobs before granting work permits to foreigners. The decision came as unemployment figures for February showed that 3.5m people were now out of work, bringing the jobless rate to 7.5 per cent in the west and 14.5 per cent in the east. At the same time, however, the number of visas given to non-EC nationals climbed by 50 per cent to 1.35m.

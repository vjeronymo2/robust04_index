			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Forces defy fresh Bosnia peace efforts Moslem forces yesterday tried to push forward around Tuzla, the biggest Bosnian government stronghold in the north-east, as an upsurge of fighting defied renewed international efforts to end the war in Bosnia. Sarajevo radio said the Bosnian army had advanced on Mount Majevica, high ground overlooking Tuzla, one of six UN 'safe areas' in Bosnia. The radio also said the centre of Tuzla and the north-west part of the Tuzla airfield came under Serb fire. Serbian radio, quoting military sources, confirmed heavy fighting in the region. The Bosnian army push is seen as a move to strengthen the land links between Sarajevo, Tuzla and Zenica, the three main government strongholds in Bosnia. Some European observers felt the international community's failure to come out clearly in favour of a specific peace plan has fuelled the renewed fighting. In particular, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, has been criticised for agreeing on Friday to a deal giving the Moslems and Croats 51 per cent of the territory and then appearing to contradict this position on Sunday by acknowledging the possibility that the Moslem-Croat Federation might win as much as 58 per cent of the land. The Moslem-Croat offensive may also have been encouraged by the US Senate's vote last week, urging the US government to lift the Bosnian arms embargo. . General Sir John Wilsey, joint commander of British Forces in the former Yugoslavia, told reporters yesterday that 'uncertain political messages make things difficult for us on the ground.' In Belgrade, Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy, met Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic and called for the urgent implementation of a plan, agreed on Friday in Geneva at a meeting of the foreign ministers from Russia, the US, and the EU. Mr Churkin said Mr Milosevic 'very strongly supported' the immediate cessation of hostilities, but was leaving it to the Bosnian Serbs to decide on the other aspects of the plan. The agreement calls for a four-month ceasefire and for the Bosnian Serbs to keep 49 per cent of the war-torn country with the remaining 51 per cent allotted to the newly created Moslem Croat federation. Mr Nikola Koljevic, vice-president of the self-styled Serbian state, offered the possibility that the Serbs may consider the settlement, although Bosnian Serbs have previously rejected the deal, demanding 70 per cent of Bosnia. Speaking to a Serbian newspaper, he said: 'The Serb side is ready to change the borders (on the basis of the 51:49 split) inasmuch as this creates a functioning state. As long as this would mean that the international community would consider trading quantity for quality.'</p>

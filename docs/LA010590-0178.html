			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> POLICE SHOWS TAKE CHARGE ON TV THIS WEEKEND  </P> <P> If you believe in the old saw, "There's never a cop around when you need one,"  then tune in this weekend. Cops -- and cop shows -- abound, the most  unconventional of which is CBS' "Max Monroe: Loose Cannon," premiering tonight  and starring former Los Angeles deejay Shadoe Stevens.  </P> <P> Stevens has an unusual background. His real first name is Terry, which was  disclosed in a CBS biographical sketch that says the Jamestown, N.D., native  had his own show on a local radio station, "Spin With Terry," when he was just  11. At 10, he had built his own radio station, drawing the interest of  officials at station KEYJ.  </P> <P> Hitting the radio big time as a disc jockey in Los Angeles in the early 1970s,  at KROQ-FM and then KMET-FM, Stevens subsequently became the voice of the  national broadcast "American Top 40" and moved into television, most recently  as announcer (and sometimes square occupant) of "Hollywood Squares."  </P> <P> He also has been a successful producer of commercials through his company,  Shadoevision.  </P> <P> On Saturday and Sunday, the irreverent young cop genre gives way to the stylish  "old cop" genre.  </P> <P> On Saturday comes Telly Savalas as "Kojak" in the latest of the rotating "ABC  Mystery Movie" dramas. He is investigating the killing of a police officer  suspected of being on the take.  </P> <P> On CBS Sunday, Richard Crenna returns for a third TV-movie turn as New York  police Detective Frank Janek in "Murder in Black and White." He is  investigating the murder of a police commissioner. Diahann Carroll co-stars as  the victim's widow.  </P> <P> Crenna first created the compelling character in 1985 in "Doubletake" and  continued the role in "Internal Affairs" last season.  </P></p>

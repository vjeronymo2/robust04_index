			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: British Gas reopens supply talks with Norwegian committee TALKS ON supplies of Norwegian natural gas to Britain have been reopened by British Gas with Norway's Gas Negotiating Committee (GFU), Statoil, a GFU member, confirmed yesterday, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. Negotiations between British Gas and GFU were broken off last November over the price that Norway put on deliveries. But British Gas has said that there will be a shortfall of domestic gas supply in the mid-1990s. The British government cleared the way for foreign gas deliveries just after talks ended between British Gas and GFU when it ratified a 15-year deal between GFU and National Power thought to be worth about Pounds 150m. Under that contract, Norway will supply 2.2bn cubic metres of gas annually. According to Statoil, talks with BG were reopened in a meeting just before the British elections. The starting point for a potential commercial deal is 5bn cu m of gas annually believed to be worth about NKr4bn (Pounds 350m). The supply is equivalent to just under 10 per cent of current UK gas demand. Statoil insists, however, that Norway has limited quantities available before late-1996 when the giant Troll gas field is scheduled to come on stream. 'Besides supplying a consortium of European buyers, Troll will serve as a modulator, or a swing producer, allowing associated gas from fields also containing oil to come on stream,' Mr Snorre Jensen, a Statoil executive said. Statoil made clear, however, that talks were reopened on the initiative of British Gas, and not because GFU is willing to reduce prices. Mr Jensen said that several meetings were being planned for this year aimed at restarting negotiations. GFU also comprises Norsk Hydro and Saga Petroleum. But all three members have their individual commercial interests to defend in recommending possible sources of gas supply for approval by Norwegian energy authorities. Saga Petroleum, for example, has pitched hard for the development of the Midgard field in Haltenbanken, off the coast of mid-Norway in the northern Norwegian Sea.</p>

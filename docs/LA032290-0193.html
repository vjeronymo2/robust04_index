			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CENSUS NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> HOMELESS PROVE HARD TO FIND IN ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> Full of great expectations, John Inmon set out early Wednesday morning to count  the homeless of Orange County. Trouble is, he discovered, you can't count them  if you can't find them.  </P> <P> Outfitted in luminescent white vests, Inmon and two partners poked through  parks in Tustin, probed railroad tracks stretching along the county's southern  flank, peered beneath bushes and pointed flashlights under freeway overpasses  -- all as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's ambitious, nationwide effort to  count the homeless.  </P> <P> But after more than two hours spent doggedly searching the usual spots where  the homeless congregate, the census takers came up empty-handed.  </P> <P> It was, Inmon admitted, "sort of disappointing not to have found anyone."  </P> <P> Some census officials said Wednesday that it appeared the homeless had been  avoiding being counted.  </P> <P> "We went under bridges and overpasses and it just looked like those places had  been cleaned out," said Gene Glenn, Fullerton census field operations  supervisor. "You could see signs that people had been living there, but it just  seemed like they had picked up and left."  </P> <P> Lisavette Barden checked underneath several freeway overpasses for the census  effort and came away with a similar impression.  </P> <P> "It seemed like people split when they saw us," she said. "We'd see their  things still lying there, but they'd be gone."  </P> <P> Fear certainly played into the formula, authorities said. Ken Hulett, a field  researcher for the Fullerton census office, said he cast his flashlight beam on  two homeless people under a freeway bridge and drew an unmistakable response.  </P> <P> "At first they raised their hands," he said. "I guess they thought we were  cops."  </P> <P> Stu Wakley, 38, was standing in front of the YMCA in Santa Ana, talking with  some of his buddies from the streets while the census was being conducted.  Wakley has been homeless for almost two years. His life began unraveling when  he was injured during a construction job two years ago.Now he spends most  nights in deserted parks throughout the county.  </P> <P> "I think counting the homeless in the census is important so the government  will know where the problems are," Wakley said. "That way, they can work on  building affordable housing."  </P> <P> Johnny Solorio, a 39-year-old homeless man in Santa Ana, also held out hope  that the census might mean a change for the better.  </P> <P> "Maybe if they know how many people are out here, maybe they can help get us  all jobs," said Solorio, a bearded, 6-foot-3 man with a barrel chest. "It might  be a positive wave to come through."  </P> <P> But for Solorio, it wasn't what one would call a good night.  </P> <P> Taking swigs out of a bottle of liquor, Solorio began using a golf club to  fence with a companion wielding a baseball bat. Games became serious when  Solorio swung wildly and hit the other man in the face, gashing his forehead.  </P> <P> As blood gushed from the wound, a crowd of other homeless men gathered around  and berated Solorio.  </P> <P> After a few minutes of desperately attempting to apologize, Solorio gave up and  left, promising never to return to the street corner.  </P> <P> Many of the homeless are "professional hiders," people who have learned that  survival on the street means sinking out of sight when darkness falls, said  Emily Lietz, census director in Buena Park. And the census count may have  suffered because of it.  </P> <P> Every morning since she opened the Buena Park office in October, Lietz has seen  a homeless man appear as if out of nowhere on a bench outside her window. That  is, except on the day of the census.  </P> <P> At one point, Lietz resorted to sending out an employee to look for the man,  but "we couldn't find him in the night," she said. He only reappeared after the  sun came up Wednesday when the counting was over.  </P> <P> Joe Montes, director of the Fullerton census office, spent three hours  searching the streets with a survey crew. They returned without finding  evidence of a single homeless person.  </P> <P> As other field enumerators began trickling in, it became obvious that most  others had experienced no better luck. The next three teams said they turned up  no one on their searches. A fourth team's announcement that a homeless man had  been found under an overpass elicited cheers from tired workers.  </P> <P> By 6:30 a.m. Wednesday, two more teams had checked in with a total of 13 more  homeless found under bridges, overpasses or sleeping in vehicles in mall  parking lots.  </P> <P> "This is awfully discouraging," said Lou Porchia, Fullerton field operation  manager. "How can we count these people if they don't stand up? If they're not  there, you can't count them."  </P> <P> As the most ambitious effort of its type ever, the homeless census had its  glitches.  </P> <P> At the Anaheim Interfaith Shelter, a 10-unit complex, three sets of census  takers rolled by during the night, according to Chaundra Perry-Howard, 26, who  has lived in the 10-unit complex since she separated from her husband.  </P> <P> Perry-Howard said the census process was a breeze. "They just asked a couple of  questions, filled out the form, and I guess now I'm counted. . . . Homeless is  not just bums in the park, it's also being too proud to go home to Mom and  Dad."  </P> <P> Dan Cantor, night supervisor at Laguna Beach's 24-bed Friendship Shelter, said  he was surprised by the arrival of the census takers Tuesday night.  </P> <P> "I had heard about the census, but no one warned us they were coming," Cantor  said. "Two people just arrived here about 9 p.m."  </P> <P> Cantor rounded up most of the shelter's occupants, who gathered in a meeting  room at the back of the two-story structure that once had been an apartment  house.  </P> <P> "We had some people at the Laundromat, a few others were just out," Cantor  said. "Judging by this, I can't say they got an accurate count. I don't think  most of my clients knew about it. They really don't read the papers."  </P> <P> David Mahoney, a Westminster resident who helped out as a census taker, said he  had expected the homeless "to know what's going on" with the census, but most  "had no idea what we were talking about. I thought there would be a little more  reception because of TV ads. But I guess that doesn't matter since they don't  have a TV."  </P> <P> Not everyone subsisting on the streets was so out of touch with the plans of  the U.S. Census Bureau. Numerous homeless people were able to recite all the  reasons for the survey -- to gauge the nation's population, to determine how  federal monies should be distributed. And some suggested it might benefit their  lives if they participated.  </P> <P> "It's a great idea because if they are going to allocate money for the homeless  and they need to know what's out there," said Anthony Wallace, a 27-year-old  homeless man. "They are going to be surprised by the figure."  </P> <P> By dawn Wednesday, Kenneth Nash and his team of enumerators in North Orange  County had counted just one homeless person as they shuttled to various parks  and business districts.  </P> <P> As the first rays of sunlight embraced the landscape, the census takers saw a  man in a car stir and sit up. They recorded his race and approximate age, but  did not bother disturbing him further.  </P> <P> Later they found another man sleeping in a nook of a railroad bridge and  several empty sleeping bags. They returned to the office after finding just  three homeless people.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed we didn't see them," Nash said. "I know they're out there. .  . . We'll have to do something different next time. I don't know what."  </P> <P> Contributing to this story were Times staff writer Carla Rivera and  correspondents Len Hall, Greg Hernandez, Tom McQueeney, Laura Michaelis,  Michelle Nicolosi, John Penner and Leon Teeboom.  </P></p>

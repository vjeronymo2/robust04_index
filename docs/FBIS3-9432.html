			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandra Fandrejewska and Pawel Reszka: </F> "Government--Solidarity--OPZZ; Fax War"]    [Text] "Solidarity--`S'--has sent a fax to the prime  minister. In the fax, we wrote that this was not what we had  expected from the experts' talks," we learned from the spokesman  of the National Section of the Independent Self-Governing Trade  Union [NSZZ] "S." On the previous day, a fax was sent to the  prime minister by the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ].  Ewa Spychalska wants to know whether the experts of the  government and "S," who have been holding talks since Tuesday  [23 March], are to present the Council of Ministers with drafts  of new legal solutions that would satisfy the union's demands.  The OPZZ does not agree to such a procedure. During a  demonstration in Krakow yesterday, "S" Chairman Marian  Krzaklewski stated that he had not received any "good  information" on the experts' talks: "The first agreements are  already being violated."    The decision to set up a team of experts was made by Prime  Minister Waldemar Pawlak and "S" Chairman Marian Krzaklewski at  a meeting on 18 March.    Doubts arose almost immediately after this first meeting.  Pawlak and Krzaklewski did not leave the conference room  together to meet with journalists. At a press conference, the  "S" leader stated that the team of government and trade union  experts is supposed to translate the union's demands into the  language of legal solutions. The Council of Ministers is  supposed to make a political decision: either approve or reject  these solutions. In a statement to journalists, the prime  minister stressed that problems concerning all employees should  be resolved in a "multilateral agreement, representing all  milieus and unions." He believes that the experts of the  government and "S" should work out a "mechanism for forwarding  problems to the Trilateral Committee and to multilateral teams  so that they can be further discussed."    The OPZZ felt alarmed at this "information noise," said Ewa  Spychalska on Tuesday. She sent a fax to the prime minister; she  wants the prime minister to explain what the team of experts  should address. If the results of its work, in the form of  drafts of new legal solutions, should be forwarded to the  Council of Ministers for acceptance, the OPZZ will protest. "S"  also expected something else from the talks of the experts, and  it, too, sent a fax to the prime minister requesting  explanations.    "We do not want a substantive discussion with government  experts; we do not want them to teach us lessons about the  reasons of the government. We merely want them to help our  experts change the demands into concrete legal solutions. Then  the Council of Ministers will make a political decision whether  it accepts or rejects the proposed changes," explained National  Committee Spokesman Piotr Zak. Referring to the statement by Ewa  Spychalska about the necessity of multilateral negotiations, he  added that "S" is not interested in talks in which one party,  the Democratic Left Alliance, divides into two parties: the  government and the OPZZ, and then it jointly makes decisions on  behalf of the people.    The Government Press Office has avoided any comments on the  "fax war" and the tasks of the experts' team. Its employees  merely quote a sentence from the joint communique issued after  the Pawlak- Krzaklewski talks.    "The results of the talks between the chairman of the NSZZ  `S' and other trade unions, not unlike the results of the work  of the experts, will be presented and discussed at a session of  the Council of Ministers." However, no one is willing to try to  interpret this provision.    Yesterday, there were strikes at enterprises in the  Warmia-Mazurian Region; for example, the Municipal Heat Energy  Enterprise cut off the supply of heat to the buildings of  self-governmental and state administration for four hours. The  "S" of the Malopolska Region staged demonstrations. A few  hundred people took part in these protests. "S" will make  decisions on further forms of the protest after Easter.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / How to Spend It: Designs on new designers IT IS NOW some five years since Zeev Aram of Aram Designs, appalled at the way British industrialists seemed not to know what a fund of creative talent was emerging from our art schools, determined to make it easier for them. Alone - 'like Richard the Lionheart' as Joycelyn Stevens put it in his opening address - he has spent each of the last five summers scouring art schools from Plymouth and Brighton to Glasgow and Edinburgh. The best and most promising work he brings to London, lays out at his own expense in his centrally placed showrooms in Covent Garden and hopes that some of the great and good might find the time to see what the brightest and the best of the young designers are up to. To say that he has been disappointed is an understatement - few of the industrialists seem able to make it to Kean Street in Covent Garden. Whilst foreign companies trawl our art colleges like hungry crocodiles, snapping up our young designers as they emerge ready-trained at the taxpayer's expense, many British companies seems reluctant even to come and look at what they are doing. So, this is a plea for all those industrialists who are in dire need of new ideas and innovative products to make it to Kean Street before the exhibition closes on October 8 and take note of all the talent that is about. The range of designs is vast - from Jeni Lennox's seductive velvet shoes to Oliver King's award-winning microwave. There are marvellously simple objects such as Stephen Huane's radiator key (sketched below right) - a little tube attached to the key catches the water that leaks from the radiator as you bleed it. Pictured top right are Suzanna Watson's hat boxes - not amazingly innovative, perhaps, but fun, sturdy (they are made of bent plywood with soft kid leather tops and turned handles) and a better way of storing hats than the average cardboard box. Photographed near right are Jeni Lennox's cupboards - as Zeev Aram puts it: 'She has brought a fresh approach to a boring subject and used a wonderfully basic material like lacquered MDF with ash frames to produce three pieces of storage (hanging space, drawers and shelves) that are simple and work well.'</p>

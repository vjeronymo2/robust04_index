			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PLAN FOR BAYFRONT ESPLANADE OKD BY AD HOC GROUP  </P> <P> An ad hoc group of local and Navy officials agreed Friday on a conceptual plan  governing construction along San Diego's downtown bayfront that calls for  low-intensity development along the bay, several open-space sites and a  continuous pedestrian esplanade along the entire shoreline.  </P> <P> The Broadway Complex Coordinating Group agreed to protect views of the bay by  regulating the bulk of proposed bayfront developments to encourage construction  of slender towers instead of wide, low-scale buildings. The height and size of  buildings would increase further inland, with the greatest amount of  development occurring along the Broadway corridor. Surface parking would be  discouraged in favor of underground parking.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Exciting Planning Potential'  </P> <P> "The bayfront in Centre City San Diego offers opportunities that few, if any,  cities can match," the report said. "An exciting planning potential exists  because the future of a substantial portion of the bayfront will be determined  by current efforts."  </P> <P> But the report also cautioned that the development "will require unparalleled  cooperation and coordination" among government agencies.  </P> <P> The plan was approved by representatives of 15 organizations with interests in  the development of downtown, including the Navy, the San Diego City Council,  the San Diego Unified Port Commission, the county Board of Supervisors, the  Chamber of Commerce and the Centre City Development Corp.  </P> <P> The plan now will be reviewed by the city's Centre City Planning Committee,  which is developing a master plan for all of downtown. It needs ultimate  approval by the City Council and the Port Commission, which owns much of the  coastal land involved.  </P> <P> The area covered by the agreement -- from Laurel Street on the north to 8th  Ave. on the south, and inland to Harbor Drive -- includes the massive Broadway  complex of hotels and office towers proposed by the Navy and an about 10-acre  "Paseo Park" at the foot of Broadway. The exact dimensions of projects proposed  for the various parcels in the plan are not part of the conceptual plan  approved Friday.  </P> <P> Another open space is envisioned as part of the redevelopment of the Solar  Turbines site. Space at the County Administration Building, the G Street Mole  and south of the Convention Center also would be preserved.  </P> <P> Also preserved through specifically prescribed height limits would be views  from the water of the County Administration Building tower.  </P> <P> Broadway, dubbed by the plan as "the ceremonial street in downtown," would be  designed and landscaped to link the bayfront with the proposed new Civic Center  on downtown's eastern edge, and Balboa Park via Park Avenue.  </P> <P> Harbor Drive would be narrowed to one lane of traffic south of Grape Street and  developed as a pedestrian esplanade connecting open space and plazas. Pacific  Highway, in contrast, would become the major bayfront thoroughfare for  vehicles.  </P></p>

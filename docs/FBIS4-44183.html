			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister and FDP Chairman Klaus </F> Kinkel by Nikolaus Brender and Gerhard Fuchs; place not given --  live; correspondents are not identified individually]    [Text] [Correspondent] Mr. Kinkel, ever since you assumed  office the Free Democratic Party [FDP] has suffered losses -- in  Lower Saxony, in Hamburg, at the European elections, and in  Saxony-Anhalt. Now the Bundestag elections are due in October.    [Kinkel] We will not lose there. I am sure we will have  good results. However, there is no doubt that we have suffered  bitter defeats -- particularly yesterday, the defeat in  Saxony-Anhalt. There are no extenuating circumstances. You can  imagine that I am not happy but, as party chairman, I would have  wished for a bit more luck.    [Correspondent] Mr. Kinkel, are you absolutely sure that you  will still be leading the party into the Bundestag election  campaign as chairman? The secretary general of the biggest land  association, the one in North Rhine-Westphalia, has called for a  special congress, where one, as he said, also has to talk about  the people at the head of the party, because of the  above-mentioned election defeats. As a result, there can no  longer be any taboos. Could the taboo be Kinkel? Does Kinkel  have to go?    [Kinkel] No. I have just returned from Paris, where I made  my first trip in connection with Germany's forthcoming European  Union presidency. I visited the French prime minister and  foreign minister.    [Correspondent] But there you will not win any elections.    [Kinkel] But I only have just heard that the North  Rhine-Westphalian Land association made this demand this  morning, which has meanwhile probably been rescinded again.    [Correspondent] Count Lambsdorff sees the FDP in existential  danger. This morning the other honorary chairman, Mr. Genscher,  said that strategic mistakes have been committed in the FDP.  You are the chairman of the party.    [Kinkel] Yes, as chairman one has indeed to take the blame  for everything, even though one is not responsible for  everything. However, I do not want to evade anything. I have to  share responsibility even though, if we look at Saxony-Anhalt, I  would say in all modesty that a lot there was homemade.  However, we in Bonn, the federal party, also made mistakes.    By the way, I would still like to answer the question I have  not answered yet. Yes, I will certainly lead the FDP into this  year's Bundestag election campaign.    [Correspondent] Will this be the last election campaign, as  a result of which you may no longer be represented in parliament?    [Kinkel] No, I repeat again that I am very sure that the FDP  will be in the Bundestag. There are two arguments in favor of  that. The one is a functional argument: As a result of the  successful coalition with the Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU], we have made a coalition  statement in favor of continuing the coalition, and Mr. Kohl and  Mr. Waigel will simply not manage on their own. This means, the  FDP is needed for functional reasons, and it will make it clear  with its issues in the Bundestag election campaign that it is  needed and that it would be bad if there were no liberal force  in the German Bundestag anymore.    [Correspondent] Well, the CDU/CSU is certainly not  presumptuous enough to expect to win the absolute majority  itself. No, it needs the FDP. Nevertheless, one probably has  to note that what the CDU/CSU has been gaining in the polls over  the past few weeks -- that is, what Kohl is winning -- is lost  by Kinkel. Will you still win enough votes to enter a coalition  on 16 October?    [Kinkel] We will certainly win enough votes. We will  primarily conduct an election campaign for second votes and, of  course, we also have to win from the others. There is no doubt  that we must win back from the Greens the votes we have lost;  naturally, we will also try to win votes in other fields.    By the way, it is not true that Kohl won votes only from our  reservoir. I have to repeat again that I assume that the  CDU/CSU will win the most votes in the Bundestag elections and I  am quite confident that we will contribute so much that it will  be enough to form a coalition again.    [Correspondent] Mr. Kinkel, it is said that you lack profile  not only outside the party but also in the party. The entire  party is accused of not having a liberal profile anymore. Are  you not able to accomplish that yourself?    [Kinkel] I would not accept this statement. At the moment  we are in a slump, there is no doubt about it. I repeat again  that I do not want to whitewash anything.    However, today we once again analyzed our situation very  carefully. We have worked out a new strategy. We know our  issues. We need not change anything about that. And we will  conduct the election campaign with issues that we believe are  attractive to the voters. This state is excessively regulated.  We will say that the citizens are required to pay too many  taxes. We want to cut taxes. We want to say clearly that we  have to restructure our social system -- not cut back social  services but restructure our social system. Demanding 90 social  services from 40 different institutions cannot be correct. Our  alternative is citizen's money. And, above all, we want to  support very strongly the medium-sized industries.    However, we also want to show that we were, are, and will  remain the party of openness to the world, of tolerance, and of  the rule-of-law state, and we do not want to become narrower.    [Correspondent] Let us talk about economic issues. At one  time there was the slogan that the FDP is the party of the  high-wage earners. You retracted this statement, but now you  have to live with the rather strange comment that yesterday's  election showed how many high-wage earners there are in  Saxony-Anhalt, namely 3.7 percent. Does this not have a  profound effect? Was this slogan incorrect and one that you  need to get away from again?    [Kinkel] Well, the thing was that the stuff about high-wage  earners was contained in a draft of our program and was not  meant in the way it was presented by the media. However, it was  something that was easy to misunderstand. I admitted it at the  congress, and so did the secretary general. We said that we had  not paid enough attention to this, and we put it right.    What we meant was something completely different. We meant  that the FDP is committed to supporting those people who perform  most in this country. Of course, they are the ones who have to  fill the baskets in the economy, so to speak, but they are not  the only ones. There are also those who perform in their fields  as skilled workers, as engineers, as nurses and show  above-average dedication, enthusiasm, readiness to take a risk,  etc. We have committed ourselves to that and we will continue  to do that, because without these people who are capable of high  performance we will not be able to make progress, above all in  our economy.    [Correspondent] How can you get away from the image that the  FDP basically is just an economic party?    [Kinkel] Well, I believe that this image has been pinned to  us a bit recently. However, I also admit that perhaps we did  not draw our contours sharply enough. At the news conference  after our Presidium and Executive Committee meetings today I  clearly said that we have to differentiate ourselves more  strongly, above all, from our own coalition partner. We will do  so increasingly with a view to the forthcoming Bundestag  election. We also have to differentiate ourselves from the  other parties. Perhaps we have indeed not been able to do so  sufficiently in the recent past. However, this is also a bit  due to the fact that the two big parties have come very close  together in ideological terms and also in some other respects so  that our position in the middle has certainly become a bit more  difficult and we have certain interfaces with the big parties,  but, above all, also with the Greens. And this is our main  opponent. We have to tackle this and we have to ensure that we  get voters who have moved over there back to us again.    [Correspondent] Mr. Kinkel, I would like to come back to a  previous issue again: Genscher speaks of strategic mistakes.  Count Lambsdorff says that the party must not deteriorate to  become an economic party. The North Rhine-Westphalian FDP tries  to enforce a new course. And you say: Let us continue.    [Kinkel] No, I am not saying this. This morning we were all  together in the Presidium and in the Executive Committee. It is  not the case that everything is just falling out of the clouds.  We discussed the matter openly and this is also in my interest.  But the statements that you mentioned do not contradict each  other. The North Rhine-Westphalian FDP does not want a  different course, it wants us to analyze the situation carefully  and gain enough profile to win the next elections. I can only  agree with that. This is no problem.    I certainly do not have any disagreements with Count  Lambsdorff and with Mr. Genscher. We have to try together to do  what is possible to get out of the slump. And in this we have  to make joint efforts for this purpose. Cheap advice is not  enough. We must stick together and bring our party together.  In the end we will add things up, and here I always point out  that I myself have been a long-distance runner and that I am not  so easily upset.    Of course, I also accept responsibility for the difficult  times and difficult defeats that we are experiencing at the  moment. You know, praise and condemnation are very close  together in the case of a party chairman. Just think that,  until recently, Mr. Scharping was the bearer of the nation's  hopes. Within three weeks he has acquired such an image that I  really pitied him.    As a party chairman, I know full well how quickly one is  praised and how quickly one is condemned.    [Correspondent] But, Mr. Kinkel, with just an appeal that  the party stick together you will probably not be able to  convince the voters.    [Kinkel] Quite correct.    [Correspondent] The issue certainly is the party's strategic  position and in this connection your party colleague Gerhard  Rudolf Baum says: We must make sure that the enlightened  citizenship, the liberal citizens, do not completely move over  to the Greens. I ask you once again: How are you going to  prevent that?    [Kinkel] Well, we have to stress, to stress more strongly,  to work out more clearly that we are -- I repeat -- the party of  tolerance, of openness to the world. After 1945, thanks to the  FDP, this country was ruled not from the fringes but from the  center -- with a sense of perspective and with reason. This was  certainly to the credit of the FDP, which essentially  contributed to the reconstruction after 1945 and also really  deserves credit for contributing to reunification. In contrast  to others, who constantly claim what they could do so well and  present their visions, we showed in practical work in the  Federal Government, in the laender, and in the communities after  1945 that we actually can do it.    It would be ridiculous to assume that we have suddenly lost  this ability. We will certainly manage to show that we have not  before the Bundestag elections and before the next three Landtag  elections, but I say once again: It is easier to criticize than  to make things better.    Quite clearly, we have not managed to persuade the voters  that we are a party that is needed, a party that one must vote  for to ensure that it is in the parliaments because it is simply  indispensable. I believe it would be an enormous loss if the  FDP were to disappear from the German Bundestag. It will not.  You know that every time the death knell has been sounded for  us, the situation was usually very favorable for us.    [Correspondent] Please, tell us how you want to achieve  that. Belief is not an issue for such a television program, nor  is it an issue for politics. How do you want to show your  profile over the next four months?    [Kinkel] Well, first of all: We are needed for functional  reasons. We will oppose a grand coalition and a red-green  coalition. This will be our functional element. And Mr. Kohl  and Mr. Waigel say that they need the FDP and that they want to  continue the coalition with us. This is the first thing.    Then we have the issues. We will have to stress those issues  with which we believe we can win voters. There are 10 or 11  issues, which we set down today again. I can give you a brief  overview.    [Correspondent] The most important ones, please.    [Kinkel] Taxes: We say the solidarity surcharge must be  reconsidered after three years with the goal of abolishing it.    [Correspondent] This is already known.    [Kinkel] This is one issue. We also have other issues  related to taxes. I will leave them out now.    We say this state is excessively legislated, excessively  interlaced, excessively bureaucratized. We must reduce all that.    [Correspondent] The justice minister is from the FDP.    [Kinkel] Well, the justice minister is not solely  responsible in this regard.    [Correspondent] Quite correct, there are a few others who  are also responsible.    [Kinkel] Third, we say that we are suffocating because of  our social system, as I said before.    We say the medium-sized industries are the engine of our  economy and must be strengthened, above all in the new laender.    We say we need tax preferences -- value-added tax  preferences  for the new laender so the products that are produced there can  be sold at more favorable prices.    We say we are the party of tolerance; we make sure that  minorities are not discriminated against in this country. We  make sure that foreigners can feel comfortable in this country.    Above all, we are also the party of foreign and European  policy. It was Foreign Ministers Scheel and Genscher and, in all  modesty, also Kinkel for more than two years, who have worked  particularly hard for Europe and have shaped this country's  foreign policy practically during the entire postwar period.    [Correspondent] Mr. Kinkel, there are also critics in your  party, who say that, if you want to be successful, you must get  away from cozying up to the CDU/CSU, away from cozying up to  Kohl. Is this something that you also see in this way?    [Kinkel] We have a coalition with the CDU/CSU. Here it is  very difficult to follow a course that, on the one hand,  implements the coalition issues, the material issues and, on the  other hand, permits some kind of different profile, as some  people want. I am accused of cozying up to the chancellor. I  have said again and again: Ask him how accommodating he finds  me. I am far less accommodating than most people. Of course, I  have to show my own profile, and I will do this.    [Correspondent] But the public does not notice it. In which  field do you dare to enter into a conflict with the chancellor?    [Kinkel] Well, I have dared to enter into conflicts with the  chancellor in many fields. Just think of the last conflict, a  massive conflict, that I dared to enter with him, which was the  conflict over constitutional issues.    This week we will have a big constitutional debate,  regarding  which we have said very clearly that we will not be bound by the  coalition discipline and will introduce minority rights as a  regulation for the Basic Law, that we will, above all, also  support forms of living together that differ from the family.  We have stated clearly that we want to include the objective of  reunification in the preamble. Thus, we will differ very  greatly. This is, for instance, an issue where we will differ.    Or take citizenship, dual citizenship, a naturalization  control law -- all these are issues where I differ very much  with the chancellor, where you may not perhaps [words indistinct]    [Reporter, interrupting] ...where you have not enforced your  views, however.    [Kinkel] Well, we have 11 percent in the German Bundestag.  Mr. Kohl, together with Mr. Waigel, has a few percent more. I  can only say: Give us a bit more power and we will enforce our  views.    [Correspondent] You could have done it with the Social  Democratic Party [SPD] -- dual citizenship, for instance.    [Kinkel] Well, that is not the point. The point is that we  have done successful work with the CDU/CSU since reunification  and we want to continue it. Therefore, I need not think about  the SPD at the moment, about what I can do together with it.  Instead, I am thinking about how I can manage to bring about  this coalition again and how we can tackle those issues that we  have not yet managed to solve.</p>

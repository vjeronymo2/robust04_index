			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Free-fall rouble tumbles further The rouble tumbled further against the dollar on Moscow's small-scale currency exchange yesterday, with no floor in sight for the battered currency, Reuter reports from Moscow. The rouble changed hands at Rbs161.1 to the dollar on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange after 155.7 at the last trading session on Thursday and 130.2 earlier this month. 'The central bank is intervening less in the market and the rouble has been falling ever since,' said a trader at Russia's Vneshtorgbank.</p>

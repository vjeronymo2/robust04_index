Chumak, candidate of </F> technical sciences, and Lieutenant Colonel A. Manachinskiy,  candidate of military sciences]    [Text] Foreign military specialists view army aviation as a  means that permits sharply increasing the mobility and striking  power of army formations and units, effectively countering enemy  close air support helicopters and aircraft, suppressing enemy  air defense and supporting air delivery of supply items to  forward defense areas and to advancing formations and units.    Employment of reconnaissance helicopters, which detect and  report precise coordinates of targets, is considered to be an  important condition for successful performance of missions. On  receiving such data, combat helicopters covertly move out to an  attack position, quickly gain the altitude needed for detecting  and delivering a strike against the target, execute a launch and  immediately take cover or return to their basing areas.    Below are data on successive operations of a helicopter and  on time spent (in seconds) in an attack on armored vehicles.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Climb                                 |5-14                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Determine distance to target and leve-|5-12                                  |  |l off helicopter                      |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Aim, launch and guide ATGM            |12-16                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Descend (land)                        |4-8                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------         To improve helicopter survivability in the zone of dense  fire  of ground troops' air defense weapons, the following are  envisaged in its design:     -  armoring the cockpit, which permits withstanding the  direct hit of 23-mm projectiles;    -  self-sealing coating of fuel  tanks;    -  redundance of vital helicopter systems;    -  special glazing  of crew cockpit and dulling of blades, which blocks the  appearance of revealing glints of light;    -  cooling of exhaust  gases, hampering the craft's detection by IR gear and enemy use  of heat-seeking guided missiles.       The West continues to search for means of combating combat  helicopters. First and foremost, this concerns means of  acquisition, above all radars. A helicopter's radar  cross-section exceeds the corresponding indicator for an  aircraft, but its detection is hampered (especially during a  hover for the time of launching an ATGM). The reason lies in the  absence of any kind of significant Doppler component of a signal  reradiated by an essentially stationary object. It is very  difficult to discriminate such a signal against the background  of local clutter. Therefore, NATO countries are working to  create radars capable of detecting helicopters from the  reflection of the sounding radio-frequency signal from main  rotor blades (the AN/TPS-36A radar, for example). Experience  shows that rotating metal or plastic blades form a  characteristic and rather strong reflected signal.    The Doppler characteristic of the main rotor, determined by  the number of blades and their rotation rate, is a distinctive  "portrait" of the helicopter. Its analysis permits not only  detecting, but also rather confidently classifying an observed  object. Thus, the Helicapture radar developed by the Israeli  firm Rafael permits detecting and identifying moving and  hovering helicopters. The acquisition range is 9 km, range  accuracy is 300 m, and azimuth accuracy 2.5. The radar  antenna is installed on a light tripod. The radar weighs 130 kg.  It can operate in a circular or sector scan mode and includes  solid-state transceiver, signal processing unit, computer and  control system.    The signal processing unit helps suppress parasitic  reflections from local features and helps determine helicopter  type. Target data are shown on the display. The letter H  (Helicopter) lights up if the helicopter type is known and the  letter U (Unknown) if it is not. The relatively light weight  permits installing this radar on a motor vehicle. Radar  operation can be controlled remotely, which provides safety for  attendant personnel when antiradar missiles are guided to the  radar.    Another Israeli firm, ELTA Electronic Industries, developed  a  modernized version of the EL/M-2106 radar, designated the  EL/M-2106H. The helicopter acquisition range is 8-10 km and that  of an aircraft with a radar cross-section of 2 m[.sup]2[/] is  over 16 km. The radar antenna's high scan rate reduces response  time and ensures timeliness of target designation for a SAM or  AAA system. The new radar can have a fixed or self-propelled  design. The latter version provides for operation in movement.    France is continuing further development of radars which are  part of short-range SAM systems and AAA systems. They include  Rodeo-2 and Rodeo-3 radars and pulse-Doppler radars functioning  in the 2-3 GHz band. Their characteristic feature is the  capability of simultaneously tracking two selected targets  during a circular scan of air space.    The Swedish firm Ericsson is creating the HARD (Helicopter  and Aircraft Radar Detection) radar family, which has a low  probability of being intercepted by the enemy. Thus, its  specialists were developing the HARD-3D LPI 3-D mobile  low-flying target acquisition radar permitting acquisition and  tracking both of flying as well as hovering helicopters at  ranges of 9-10 km and of aircraft at ranges of 10-12 km with a  probability of 0.9. The phased array radar created on a  solid-state base operates in the 8-12 GHz band and permits  acquisition, identification and tracking (both in place as well  as in movement) of 12 airborne targets at altitudes up to 4,000  m. The transmitter has a peak power of 30 watts. The HARD radar  can be interfaced with the RBS-70 short-range SAM system or be  part of an AAA system.    In the United States, the firm Lockheed-Sanders created the  P-STAR (Portable Search and Target Acquisition Radar)  pulse-Doppler radar intended for acquisition of low-flying  targets, including helicopters (40-60 GHz band). Helicopters,  including hovering ones, are acquired with the help of a special  Doppler frequency analyzer. The main array is supplied with two  secondary arrays supporting suppression of sidelobe  interference, which permits acquiring targets rather  confidently. The liquid-crystal air situation display, which is  located up to 100 m from the antenna system, is used for  informing the Stinger shoulder-fired SAM system team about  low-flying aircraft or helicopters at ranges up to 20 km. The  radar is equipped with an IFF system.    The French firm of Thomson-CSF created a family of  pulse-Doppler radars, the TRS 2620 and 2621, as well as the TRS  2630 Griffon, intended for acquiring hovering helicopters (see  table).

Helicopters are  detected based on modulation of the echo signal caused by  rotation of rotor blades and also by vibrations of the fuselage  and main rotor hub. The frequency is changed both by a program  and based on results of an analysis of the jamming environment.    The radar uses modern signal forming and processing  equipment: Solid-state semiconductor transmitter, dual frequency  conversion receiver, digital devices for processing the received  signal, and a pulse compression circuit. There is a capability  of tracking six targets with operator involvement or eight  targets with introduction of the automatic tracking mode.    The radars are equipped with an IFF system which  interrogates  up to four targets in a 20 sector. The interrogator antenna  is made in the form of a planar array. The TRS 2630 Griffon is  the family's most modern version. Because a planar array is  used, a lower radiation pattern sidelobe level is achieved:  33-35 db for near lobes and 40 db for far lobes. The sounding  signal represents a sequence of 17 pulses and the operating  frequency can take on 12 values. A frequency change is possible  with each rotation of the antenna for one or eight pulse chains  (in accordance with the program loaded into the computer).    The echo signal processing gear includes a 12-channel  Doppler  filter. In case of intense jamming the radar can shift to a  passive operating mode in which a special analyzer detects the  emission source (jammer) and measures its azimuthal coordinates  and operating parameters. Transition to the passive mode is  possible in a limited sector. A programmed change in radar  emission frequency is made in accordance with data of the  jamming analyzer.    Two models of the TRS 2620 radar and 48 sets of the TRS 2630  Griffon will be delivered to the French Army under a program for  modernizing France's Samantha air defense assets. In addition,  an order for acquisition of 22 sets of TRS 2620 radars has been  received from the Finnish Army command and an order for eight  from Latin American countries.    The question of selling this radar to South Korea in the TRS  2630 B100 version, distinguished by increased emissive power  (transmitter peak power will be 700 watts), is being considered.    In studying the problem of supplementing the radar with  alternative information sources on rotary-wing airborne targets,  foreign specialists arrived at the conclusion of the possibility  of using acoustic sensors. In this case helicopter detection is  not limited by line-of-sight conditions, flight regimes, or  weather conditions.    Operation of acoustic sensors is based on the fact that each  type of helicopter creates a specific subsonic emission whose  characteristics depend on the speed of rotation and geometry of  the main rotor as well as on flight speed.    Use of the acoustic band permits detecting helicopters at  extremely low altitudes and considerable distances, and  identifying them based on characteristics of acoustic vibrations  created by helicopters of different types. Such sensors, which  have a sound detector and computer in their makeup, can function  at any time of day and in all weather conditions without a  deterioration of their characteristics.    The Swedish firm Swetron already has developed the  ground-based Helisearch acoustic system, which permits detecting  a helicopter, determining direction and range to it and  identifying the type of craft.    The British firm Ferranti developed a similar system,  Picket.  It has a microphone unit and portable signal processing and  indication unit. The helicopter detection range is at least 6  km, and information output on a target is updated every two  seconds. The helicopter's azimuth, distance to it and flight  mode (moving or hovering) light up on a panoramic display. It is  believed that six Picket systems deployed with overlapping  sectors of responsibility are capable of monitoring a zone with  an area of at least 500 km[.sup]2[/].    Self-propelled antiaircraft [SP AA] guns,  distinguished by high mobility and rate of fire (up to  3,000-6,000 rounds per minute) with a very slight reaction time  (6-12 seconds), can be used very successfully to cover troops  against combat helicopter strikes on the battlefield and on the  march. They are capable of moving right in troop battle  formations, conducting reconnaissance of the enemy in movement  and firing from short halts.    SP AA gun mounts with automatic and semiautomatic laying  systems equipped with pulse-Doppler radars, which support the  conduct of battle against diverse airborne targets in any  weather, around the clock and in a difficult electronic  environment, have been developed abroad at the present time.  They are armed with 20-40 mm guns and are capable of bringing  fire on helicopters at ranges of 2-4 km. But this is not always  sufficient, inasmuch as ranges at which combat helicopters  launch ATGM's already have reached 3-4 km, and in the future  will increase to 6-8 km. Western developers believe that  increasing the range of fire of SP AA guns is simplest by  switching to calibers of 57-mm, 76-mm or more.    Italy already has developed the Otomatic 76-mm SP AA gun  with  a unit of fire of 100 rounds. Fire usually is conducted in  bursts of 4-5 rounds. The gun's fire control system includes a  target acquisition radar with IFF device, millimeter-band  monopulse tracking radar, opto-electronic aiming system, two  control consoles and a digital computer. Evaluation testing  showed that the effective range of fire of the SP AA gun is 6 km  and reaction time is five seconds. The chassis of the Palmaria  self-propelled howitzer was chosen as its base. The combat  weight of the SP AA gun is 46 tonnes.    But experts note that an increase in caliber of antiaircraft  guns also has negative consequences: The gun's rate of fire  drops, the unit of fire decreases because of increased  projectile weight, and errors occur more often in firing at long  distances.    These circumstances prompted developers to seek an  opportunity to correct the projectile's flight path in the  target area. A solution was found by fitting it with an impulse  correction motor consisting of six small explosive charges  contained in the projectile body. By starting the appropriate  motor it is possible to change the projectile's path within  limits of 10 in any direction relative to the velocity  vector by commands from a ground fire control system. The  command receiver is contained in the base of the projectile, and  its antenna, in the form of a four-element crossed array, is on  the stabilizer fins.    It is assumed that such a projectile, supplied with  proximity  and impact fuzes, will permit successfully combating helicopters  at ranges of 8-10 km. It is also reported that its cost is 5-10  times higher than usual, but in the opinion of foreign  specialists, with a 50-percent target kill probability, this is  a fully advantageous alternative to SAM systems.    Work also is being done to create a projectile guided by a  laser beam. It has a sensor for determining angular deflection  from the line-of-sight, which is used to control operation of  gas switches of the steering mechanism and change the flight  path.    It is believed that the projectile's guidance along a laser  beam in combination with a proximity fuze will ensure a target  kill probability of 0.5-0.7.    One new approach to increasing the destructive capacity of  antiaircraft projectiles when fired against combat helicopters  with rather powerful armoring is the use of fragmentation  projectiles with a tungsten core.    It is proposed to use tank guns to combat  helicopters. Tank tube angle of elevation is sufficient for  bringing fire on a helicopter hovering above the ground for  launching ATGM's, and the burst of a large-caliber projectile  (105-mm or 120-mm) several meters from the target is guaranteed  to destroy it.    But artillery systems are incapable of solving all problems  of antihelicopter warfare. Thus, despite swift reaction, an SP  AA gun cannot always open fire in time if a helicopter  approaches the strike target covertly over the shortest  distance, taking advantage of terrain relief features. In such  cases, it is desirable to have a means of engaging the target  beyond its line-of-sight limits. Such a task is accomplished  within the scope of the U.S. FAADS forward area air defense  program, which envisages creation of the FOG-M SAM system with  the capability of over-the-horizon combat against low-flying  airborne targets and moving armored ground targets.    The SAM system has a missile with TV camera, and a  fiber-optic two-way data transmission cable channel will be used  for its guidance. In addition to a television head, it is  planned to outfit the missile with a thermal imaging head  operating in the 3.5-4.2 micron band.    Foreign specialists are considering the question of creating  a general-purpose SAM system for air and antitank  defense on a platform that rises into the air. They believe that  such a system will permit increasing the effectiveness of  combating helicopters and other low-flying targets, with a  simultaneous reduction in vulnerability of combat teams because  of the possibility of its covert employment from behind natural  cover.    The foreign press reports that the United States is  conducting research aimed at creating an antihelicopter  mine (AHM). It will receive information on targets from  acoustic detectors, which are to be set up in pairs on likely  avenues of helicopter approach. This will permit detecting the  helicopter and determining its coordinates by triangulation.  When a helicopter approaches a certain line, a mine is fired at  a signal from the sensors. Its IR homing head determines the  most advantageous detonation conditions, as a result of which,  it is asserted, total destruction of the helicopter ensues. In  addition, according to the developers' thinking, the threat of  encountering such a weapon at extremely low altitudes should  force helicopters to go higher, where air defense weapons will  be able to operate effectively against them.    The firms of Textron Defense Systems and Texas Instruments  in  the United States and Ferranti-Eliant Techsystems in Great  Britain took part in developing the antihelicopter mine concept.    The Textron Defense Systems mine, which weighs 182 kg, has a  jamproof ground sensor acoustic array which detects, classifies,  identifies and tracks a rotary-wing target. All-around fragment  coverage of the target area in the azimuthal plane with an  increased casualty radius permits the mine to act against  low-flying helicopters. Judging from available information,  helicopters may be engaged at altitudes up to 200 m.    The mine can be used in the forest and in limited areas  because of a change in trajectory of the impact core formed when  the charge is triggered.    The mines are laid using the MLRS, the Volcano cluster  mining  system, and manually. There are provisions for switching off the  mine in case friendly forces pass through the area where  emplaced. Remote switch-on and switch-off are supported by  reliable two-wire communications.    Ferranti-Eliant Techsystems developed an antihelicopter mine  weighing 10 kg with a diameter of 180 mm and a length of 335 mm,  which is capable of killing targets flying at speeds up to 350  km/hr and at heights of 100 m and higher. The two-mode passive  acoustic-IR sensor is jamproof and guarantees precise aiming.  Identification of nationality is performed by a passive,  nonemitting means.    Deployed on the terrain, the AHM mine operates autonomously,  but can be supplied with control and monitor modules supporting  its remote arming and shut-off.    In addition to ground assets, air-based systems  can combat helicopters. The ATAS (Air-to-Air Stinger)  antihelicopter system has already been developed. It includes a  launcher accommodated aboard a rotary-wing craft and designed  for 2 or 4 Stinger guided missiles. Their employment is being  worked out in OH-58C and D, AH-64A Apache and AH-1 helicopters.    A standard launcher weighs 43 kg with two missiles and 100  kg  with four. The first model of the ATAS system was demonstrated  in late 1979 and early 1980 aboard a Lynx helicopter.    A helicopter can be armed with guns. Thus, the M230 Chain  Gun  30-mm aircraft gun (installed on AH-64A Apache helicopters)  provides acceptable accuracy of engaging the airborne enemy at a  distance up to 3 km; the 20-mm gun (on the Huey Cobra)  successfully engages targets at a distance of up to 1.5 km; and  the fire of the 7.62-mm machinegun installed aboard a helicopter  is effective at a range up to 1 km.    A program for equipping helicopters with air-to-air missiles  was begun in France in 1986. The Mistral SAM is being considered  for these purposes. It is planned to install it on Gazelle,  Tiger and AH-64A Apache helicopters.    In 1988 the British firm Short Brothers together with the  U.S. firm McDonnell Douglas developed an air-to-air missile  launcher which will be accommodated on the AH-64A Apache and  serve for firing the Hellstrike missile against airborne targets.    The firm Westland is refitting the Lynx helicopter as a  reconnaissance version in which the TOW ATGM will be replaced by  an air-to-air weapon system. The Stinger shoulder-fired SAM  system (General Dynamics) or Hellstrike with turret-mounted  machinegun or gun (Short Brothers) are being considered as  models. The Swedish firm Bofors is studying the possibility of  accommodating RBS-70 missiles on helicopters.    The U.S. Army is showing interest in developing a  general-purpose system for combating airborne targets and tanks  (HTDM-Helicopter Team Defense Missile). It is presumed that  OH-58 reconnaissance helicopters and the AH-64A Apache combat  helicopter will be equipped with it.    The foreign press reports that the question of using  drones for detecting helicopters is being considered.  NATO specialists believe that installing television cameras and  forward-looking IR gear on drones substantially improves the  speed of receiving video intelligence and permits sharply  expanding the number of its users with minimum costs. Commanders  and staffs at all levels will be able to monitor in real time  individual axes or zones that are most dangerous from the  standpoint of helicopters and make an adequate decision in the  shortest time.    In addition, because of the absence of a pilot aboard, the  drone can operate under conditions of increased risk beyond the  front line.    A number of firms are engaged in developing new target  detection sensors for outfitting the latest unmanned means,  designated HELTK (Helicopter Killer). The Brave 200 drone was  chosen as its base. It is to be supplied with a millimeter-band  radar and processor, which will enable it to independently  detect and identify a helicopter under conditions of powerful  ground clutter.</p>

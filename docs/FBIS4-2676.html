According to the Japanese prime minister, he was very  pleased  with his fruitful talks with President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li  Peng, and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji during his recent visit to  China.    Today, Tsutomu Hata, Japanese deputy prime minister and  concurrently minister of foreign affairs, met with Wang Xiaoxian  at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Hata said: We must ensure  good Sino-Japanese relations because they are very important for  peace and stability in Asia and the world as a whole.

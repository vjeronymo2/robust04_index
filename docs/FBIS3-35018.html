[name later  changed to YI'UD, also an acronym for Independent and Democratic  Israel] The name was the idea of Yoram Pomerantz, once Refa'el  Eytan's very close spokesman who found himself in the street  after years of working side by side with Raful [Eytan's  nickname]. The breakaways later recalled that the name had  belonged to Lova Eli'av's movement in the elections. Gonen  Segev said he could live with the name. He did not think it  sounded pompous, and he did not think bad luck was passed on  with the name.    A name takes getting used to, he says, just as one gets used  to the name of a new baby.    On Wednesday [2 February] morning, there was still Tzomet;  on  Wednesday afternoon, there was YA'AD. The same Wednesday, mock  elections were held at Blich High--the school whose voting  patterns have become almost equal to a political forecast, to a  nationwide poll. In those elections, Tzomet received 30 percent  of the votes--about 37 seats--with the Labor party leading by a  mere five seats.    Tiny YA'AD did not participate in the elections at all, and  its electoral power as of now is a matter for speculation.    On Wednesday night, six hours after the faction's  establishment, Gonen Segev had to be optimistic. He still  maintained his optimism on Thursday morning.    [Ringel-Hoffman] I understand you are still fully satisfied  with your decision.    [Segev] I certainly am. The odd sheet by some accountant  which Tzomet waved at the Central Committee meeting in  Ari'el--which was supposed to satisfy everyone--will not change  our minds.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Can you and should you break up a party  which has such important tasks in such a critical period--not to  mention the very flattering polls--over some paperwork  irregularities?    [Segev] They are not just irregularities. This is a party  which prevented the audit committee's work for a whole year,  which operated without a budget, in which funds were thrown  every which way, a movement which has become wasteful and  splashy...    [Ringel-Hoffman] Wasteful and splashy?    [Segev] You should see the new Tzomet offices on Derekh  Petah Tiqva. They look like bank offices. What luxury and  elegance.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Do you use these offices?    [Segev] No.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Who sits there?    [Segev] I do not know, all kinds of functionaries I don't  even know.    [Ringel-Hoffman] There must be some people you do know  there.    [Segev] Doron Shmu'eli and other Doron Shmu'elis.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Are you referring to the director general  of Tzomet, who is the butt of most of your criticism?    [Segev] Yes.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Back to my question: Irregularities exist  in every party.    [Segev] Tzomet is not just another party. It is a movement  whose main issue was integrity and proper administration. And  that is not what happened. A whole party has been operating  without a budget for a year and a half, and when someone  suggested checking what was going on there, the chairman  dismissed the matter.    [Ringel-Hoffman] I thought the fate of Eretz Yisra'el, for  instance, was the main issue.    [Segev] Breaking up the party was not my objective, but when  I ran into a stone wall, when information on irregularities kept  piling up, I had no choice. As for Eretz Yisra'el, I am not  abandoning the struggle for it, but a depraved Tzomet can cause  more damage than a split Tzomet.    [Ringel-Hoffman] That is a hypothesis. What is certain is  that Tzomet has been damaged.    [Segev] When I made the decision, I meant to rectify, not to  ruin. I think that instead of asking me whether Tzomet should  have been broken up, you should ask why the movement chairman is  prepared to allow it the break up just to prevent a probe of  irregularities.    [Ringel-Hoffman] How do you explain it? Why do you think  Raful is backing Doron Shmu'eli?    [Segev] I do not know.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Can you speculate?    [Segev] Perhaps Shmu'eli's failure would be seen as his own.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Perhaps he is truly convinced that you are  exaggerating. Anyway, he claims he made a probe possible.    [Segev] Really? And why did half of the audit committee  members quit? What made me quit? What made them doctor things  for three weeks?    [Ringel-Hoffman] What things are being doctored?    [Segev] All kinds. When they say there is a deficit, and  then they say there is no deficit, paperwork should be made to  suit the statement. When they say that a certain branch -- let  us say, the Or Yehuda branch -- received 30,000 shekels, and  then it transpires that it received 90,000 shekels, things need  to be fixed, some secretariat resolution has to be arranged,  because someone had to approve the money. And all this is being  done with funds which do not belong to me, or to Raful, or to  Shmu'eli. These are public funds.    [Ringel-Hoffman] You are not the first to argue against  Raful. Tzomet has a history of those who leveled criticism at  the chairman. You yourself said on one occasion that no one will  suspect you of being unintelligent. Then how come it took you  so long to find out what your predecessors said years ago?    [Segev] As long as the criticism was about questions such as  "whether or not he got himself a Volvo, whether or not he got  himself a car phone," it seemed nonsense. He was a cabinet  minister, there were work constraints, and that was it. The  distance between that and the other irregularities is very big.  And I was not aware of those irregularities earlier.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Eight months ago you noticed that something  was wrong.    [Segev] Raful is an electoral asset. He stands for many  things to many people. As long as things I saw did not clash  with my conscience, it was very convenient for me. What  happened now was that Raful crossed the red line, as far as I  was concerned. The outer limit of my conscience's ability to  bend. A major part of Tzomet's votes had been granted because  of its clean image.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Perhaps because, as Raful says, you are in  a hurry?    [Segev] I repeat what you cited me as saying: No one has  ever accused me of being a moron. What is easier than sitting  quietly, shutting up until the next elections, and letting Raful  go on and do my work for me? So maybe I would not be No. 2, but  I would certainly be placed in the first slots on the party  list, and I would definitely make it to the next Knesset.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Perhaps now you have loftier ambitions,  something beyond a mere Knesset member.    [Segev] But that is precisely what I am now. I am still  just a Knesset member, and in a small faction to boot.  Furthermore: I am not the electoral asset Raful is, and I will  have to work much harder. What do people think? That having  quit, I will be deputy Knesset speaker? A cabinet minister?    [Ringel-Hoffman] Perhaps you will be really minister.    [Segev] I have heard about the idea, and my qualifications  are no worse than at least of some of today's ministers. But to  be minister, I have to join the coalition, and to join, I have  to accept certain guidelines. I do not think that is going to  happen.    [Ringel-Hoffman] What is your problem? What keeps you  from joining the government? Was it what you thought should  have been done when this government was composed?    [Segev] First, the Golan Heights question. The announcement  that the question will be resolved through a referendum is a  delusion. What matters here is the timing. A referendum held  today, before an agreement with Syria is signed, will most  probably reject the concept of withdrawal from the Golan in  return for peace. The outcome of a referendum held in order to  ratify a signed agreement will be different. I know no mother  or father who will vote against an agreement that presents the  question as either ratification or war.    As for Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza, I am against a Palestinian  state, and hence, also against creating the infrastructure for  the establishment of such a state at a later stage. I believe  that construction in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza should be  accelerated, and it should be understood that these settlements  on the confrontation line bodily block terrorism.    [Ringel-Hoffman] You are not getting carried away? Bodily  blocking terror?    [Segev] If Jews in these settlements are attacked, Jews in  Tel Aviv are not.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Jews are attacked there and Jews are  attacked in Tel Aviv, Bat Yam, Jerusalem.    [Segev] I am not talking about knifings. That was a unique  phenomenon.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Let us go back to the possible coalition  between you and Labor.    [Segev] A political party should check the extent of its  impact. Tzomet with its eight Knesset members could have made a  difference, and the negotiations with the Palestinians would not  look as they do today. YA'AD, with three Knesset members,  cannot make a difference.    [Ringel-Hoffman] So what?    [Segev] So the chances of my joining the coalition are  almost nil.    [Ringel-Hoffman] And the contacts with Nisim Zvili?    [Segev] There have been no contacts, except for a friendly  chat at the 'Erev Hadash [afternoon TV program] table.    [Ringel-Hoffman] And what about Rafi Elul?    [Segev] If a "shalom" in the Knesset cafeteria means  contacts, then there have been contacts. And there are still  contacts. What can I do if every two words in a corridor on one  of the Knesset floors turns into "contacts" right away.    [Ringel-Hoffman] It is a sensitive issue that interests the  public. The health portfolio, for instance?    [Segev] Not true.    [Ringel-Hoffman] One last question on this matter: If the  faction joins the government despite everything, is it  self-evident that of the three of you, you will be the one to  receive a portfolio?    [Segev] Does it look self-evident to you?    [Ringel-Hoffman] It looks that way.    [Segev] Then I think it is self-evident to them, too.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Rumor has it that Raful is going to meet  with Yitzhaq Rabin.    [Segev] If it is in line with his policy, he is welcome. It  can be another example of his integrity.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Now Rabin can play with both of you.    [Segev] He will not play with me, because as I have already  told you, I am not on the court.    [Ringel-Hoffman] It is believed that outside the coalition,  YA'AD will very soon become a passing episode in Israeli  politics. On the other hand, it may be the movement's fate even  if you do join the coalition.    [Segev] We have two and a half more years before the  elections. Why should I look into the future? I believe a lot  can be done in that time.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Do you believe in the faction's survival?    [Segev] It has been just six hours since we quit. We are  one-third of the Tzomet Secretariat, and in addition, there have  been whole branches, or nearly whole, such as the Jerusalem  branch, the Rishon Leziyyon branch, which expressed support for  our move. We will hold a founding convention, and then we will  be wiser.    [Ringel-Hoffman] When?    [Segev] By the end of the month. I hope more people will  join us then.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Knesset Member Modi [Eli'ezer] Sandberg  will definitely not join you. He has worked with you for quite  a while, and he ended up staying in Tzomet. What happened to  him?    [Segev] I cannot answer for him. I can tell you that before  he went away, he deposited a letter with me saying that if my  allegations are proven to be true, I have his support. What he  decided afterward is his own business. Everyone has a different  makeup. Both physical and mental.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Does your saying "physically different  makeup" refer to the elasticity of his spinal column?    [Segev] I have not examined his spinal column. I meant that  everyone has his own reasons. I know he came under a lot of  pressure. I did not pressure him, I do not think pressure is  necessary. In any event, I remain his friend.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Are you holy or what?    [Segev] No. But I am not mad with him. I am disappointed  in him.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Remaining his friend?    [Segev] Beyond work, there is also friendship on a personal  basis. I do not think Modi has betrayed me. I think things  will be very tough for him in Tzomet, and if he changes his  mind, he will have to enlist at least one more Knesset member to  secede and move over to us. When we talked this morning I told  him that his reconciliation attempts are pathetic.    [Ringel-Hoffman] I was told he is a sharp lawyer with an  ability to plan several moves in advance. Perhaps his pathetic  reconciliation attempts are the result of his belief that you  don't stand a chance without Raful? He even came on television  and said that Tzomet was going to look into the matter.    [Segev] I heard him. Appearing on television the way he did  and saying the things he did shows either a politician's art or  a lawyer's craft. I just think that lying in front of the  nation like that is a bit too early for such a young politician.    [Ringel-Hoffman] And you remain his friend.    [Segev] Unless he does what he did on television that will  change my mind about our friendship.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Is Tzomet a one man's movement?    [Segev] Raful's administrative techniques have caused and  will cause it to be a one man's movement, even if the party has  other worthy people.    [Ringel-Hoffman] The relations between you and Raful used to  be amicable.    [Segev] No. They were correct working relations.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Did he encourage your growth?    [Segev] I had a good position, but I did the work by myself.  I don't know what you mean by encourage.    [Ringel-Hoffman] I was referring to the stage when Yo'ash  Tzidon left Tzomet and you replaced him as No. 2.    [Segev] He did not help me. I waged the struggle by myself.    [Ringel-Hoffman] People in Tzomet are saying you cannot be  No. 2 unless Raful helps you.    [Segev] I do not know. He may have directed some moves in  the secretariat about which I had no knowledge.    [Ringel-Hoffman] When did your relations begin to  deteriorate?    [Segev] About a year ago, when elections to the secretariat  were held. I received 180 out of about 230 votes.    [Ringel-Hoffman] And then?    [Segev] And then people close to him claimed it is a sign  Modi Sandberg and I wanted to take over the secretariat and  later the movement.    [Ringel-Hoffman] And Raful panicked?    [Segev] I do not know.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Then why do you think something happened at  that time?    [Segev] A certain line in Raful's behavior could be detected  then.    [Ringel-Hoffman] What do you mean?    [Segev] I mean there is Raful and there are the other  Knesset members.    [Ringel-Hoffman] And Raful, the party leader, envied their  success? Can you cite an example?    [Segev] For instance, the Gaza plan. It was an idea I  conceived and worked on for a long time. At that time, there  was talk about three autonomies -- Gaza, Khan Yunus, and Rafah  -- and about increasing the Jewish population among them, plus a  comprehensive economic plan. I presented this plan to Raful, I  presented it to Tzomet, I even presented it to Rabin. And then  one day I heard Raful discuss it on television, presenting the  plan and not saying a word about who had conceived and  formulated it.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Listen, one last question: What about the  members of Tel 'Adashim [moshav in which both Eytan and Segev  live]? What are they saying there?    [Segev] I do not know yet. So far I only had one phone call  from there, from a man who votes Labor; he congratulated me.    [Ringel-Hoffman] Will there be a split? Will there be a Tel  'Adashim B?    [Segev] No, it will not happen.</p>

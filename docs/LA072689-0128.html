			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE / CHRIS PASLES: PHILHARMONIC SEES DONATIONS SOAR  </P> <P> Other arts organizations may grouse about the difficulty of raising money in  this county's highly competitive market, but not the Orange County Philharmonic  Society. At the society's meeting in Newport Beach Monday night, executive  director Erich Vollmer reported that contributions were up 64% from 1988 to  1989.  </P> <P> By far the bulk of the rise from $406,067 in 1988 to $667,257 in 1989 came from  contributions from individuals, corporations and private foundations.  Government support rose a modest $641 from the $52,657 figure in 1988.  </P> <P> Vollmer credited the increase to "hard work."  </P> <P> "We really had a challenge, and the board met it," Vollmer said Tuesday. "I  think it's also an indication that we were wise in creating the position of  director of development. It was long overdue." Eve R. Henderson was appointed  development director in October.  </P> <P> "This is a case where no one person deserves the lion's share of the credit,"  Vollmer added. "It was truly a group effort. It was nonprofit at its best."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the society ended the year with a small deficit of $16,588 in a  $2.3-million budget. "That's piddling, after what we dealt with last year,"  Vollmer said. The amount was left over from a debt of $46,910 that resulted  from co-sponsorship of the New World Music Festival at the Performing Arts  Center and UC Irvine in the summer of 1988.  </P> <P> Vollmer added that 54,806 people attended 22 society-sponsored concerts at the  Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, for what officials said was  an 86% hall-occupancy rate.  </P> <P> In other society news:  </P> <P>  -- Edward D. Halvajian of Laguna Beach was elected president for 1989-90.  </P> <P>  -- Underwriting two series will be the Lexus division of Toyota (Series A:  Great Orchestras) and the E. Nakamichi Foundation (Series D: Virtuoso).  </P> <P>  -- The society also received the top rating, a 4, from the California Arts  Council for the fourth year in a row.  </P> <P> Repertory for the 1989-90 season at the Orange County Performing Arts Center  also was announced.

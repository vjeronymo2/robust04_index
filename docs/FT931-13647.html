			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: DTI report clears Suter chairman - Inspectors strongly criticise David Abell and fellow directors SHARES in Suter, overshad-owed for five years by the DTI investigation, yesterday rose 6p to 125p as the report finally seemed to clear Mr David Abell, chairman, of breaching section 204 of the Companies Act in relation to concert parties. However, the implications of the report for Suter are by no means clear cut. Mr Abell and his non-executive directors are strongly criticised, and questions are raised about whether Mr Abell is too powerful within the company. The inspectors, Mr David Evans and Mr Brian Worth, reserve their strongest criticisms for the 1986 and 1987 purchase by Mr Abell and Suter of shares in Metal Closures. The inspectors question Mr Abell's evidence that a memorandum dated January 7 1987 detailing purchases of shares in Metal Closures should have been dated January 8, the same day Suter started buying shares. 'We look upon this memorandum with a great deal of scepticism and cannot accept it was sent on 8 January 1987,' the report said. The inspectors said they found Mr Abell's explanations for why he bought shares in Metal Closures for himself and for Suter 'confusing'. They also said they found Mr Abell's statements in the memorandum and in later evidence were 'inconsistent'. Suter's non-executive directors at the time are strongly criticised, especially Mr John Rimington, who remains on the Suter board. The inspectors accused Mr Rimington of ignoring advice from Robert Fleming, Suter's financial adviser, which advised that Mr Abell should sell his private shares in Metal Closures for no profit. 'There was no meeting of the non-executive directors and the matter was not discussed at a board meeting. The minority view of Rimington prevailed because that was the course desired by Abell,' the report said. The inspectors said they had been told Mr Abell's investment activities were not controlled by the board. Mr Abell was therefore able to buy, on behalf of Suter, up to 15 per cent of another company without main board authority. 'We believe that the non-executive directors failed in their duties to their shareholders by allowing their assets to be managed in this manner, the report said. In the case of James Neill Holdings, in which Mr Abell and Suter bought shares in 1984, Suter failed to disclose a 5 per cent stake - as the Companies Act then required - for at least a month after the trigger had been passed. With Francis Industries, which Suter acquired in 1984, the inspectors found no evidence of parties acting in concert. But two share purchases, from Geneva-registered companies Brolliet and Sterling Trust, are unclear because these companies refused to divulge the ultimate beneficiaries of the shares. Other individuals singled out for criticism include Mr Michael Somerset-Leake, senior partner of Mr Abell's stockbroker CGS, and controlling shareholder of Winchmore, in which Mr Abell also held a stake. In the case of Metal Closures, Mr Somerset-Leake is criticised for 'buying what was tantamount to a personal stake' when he knew Suter was starting to build a holding. 'As seen in other companies, Somerset-Leake and his clients were avid members of Abell's 'fan club',' the report claims. The inspectors recommended laws on concert parties should be tightened up to cover relationships such as that between Mr Abell and Mr Somerset-Leake, where no legally binding obligation exists but their actions are similar to a concert party situation.</p>

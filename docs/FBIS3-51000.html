			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Army Commander Division General Lino Cesar Oviedo  made it clear yesterday that the Armed Forces commander-in-chief  appoints officers to their respective posts. Oviedo stated that  the chain of command stipulates that the Armed Forces  commander-in-chief conveys appointments to the 1st Army Corps  commander who advises the 3d Cavalry Division, headquartered in  Curuguaty.    On 9 January a report was published based on information  gleaned from the Army's weekly, which states that the  commander-in-chief of the Paraguayan Armed Forces -- namely,  engineer [President Juan Carlos] Wasmosy -- received orders from  Army Commander Gen. Oviedo on the appointment of officers to  various posts.    Asked if there was any mistake in the text, Gen. Oviedo  confirmed that the president appointed the officer in question,  following a resolution of the office of the Army Command. The  Army commander emphasized: "Resolutions are different from  instructions. I give instructions, but this was not the case."    Oviedo hinted at the fact that the NOTICIAS report was  misleading. He said that, following orders, he installed the  chosen officer.    On a different theme, the Army commander denied that  officers  and troops are being kept in subhuman conditions in the 3d Army  Corps. He pointed out that this could not happen because the  barrack facilities are in perfect condition.    Incidentally, the Army commander's schedule next month  includes a visit to the barracks of the 3d Army Corps, which is  headquartered in the town of Mariscal Estigarribia.</p>

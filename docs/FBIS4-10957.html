			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Armando J. Pernia] </F>   [Text] Ministry of Finance adviser Jose Igancio Moreno Leon  said yesterday that 3 percent of the revenues from the new taxes  will be devoted to financing a new autonomous tax collection  agency, with the aim of curbing the serious tax evasion problem,  since with current taxes the treasury could obtain double the  resources if a "new tax consciousness" is created.    Moreno Leon participated in a conversation, organized by the  Central Information Office, with the economic editors of the  different media outlets in order to explain the basic lines of  the economic policy of President Caldera's administration.    The official pointed out that the center of the growth  strategy is achieving a voluntary consensus agreement in which  all sectors would agree on establishing voluntary controls on  prices, the exchange rate, and business profit margins.    This agreement includes changing the system of workers'  benefits to adopt the Chilean model; that is, creating pension  funds administered by their own financial system. This will  permit the state to pay the 350-billion-bolivar debt it owes the  Pension and Retirement Fund.    "The idea is that the workers should have savings with good  earnings, but without generating cash-flow problems for the  companies due to the retroactive nature of the benefits," Moreno  Leon explained.    According to the government's financial adviser, the  administration's major effort is focused on trying to reduce the  400-billion-bolivar deficit which is expected for this year as a  result of overestimating oil income by 105 billion bolivars; oil  prices were calculated at $15.50 per barrel and are now very  unlikely to reach $12.    This is the justification for the tax on bank transactions  and the reform of the Income Tax Law. "We really are not  creating new taxes, except in the case of the bank transactions,  because the sales tax replaces the VAT [value-added tax].  However, by modernizing the management of spending, we will  achieve that goal."    According to what Moreno Leon said, tax administration is  really in a bad way, since Venezuela is among the 10 countries  with the lowest collection of taxes in the world, at the level  of Uganda, due to the evasion associated with corruption. Thus,  he stressed that the salaries of finance officials should be  increased, the laws should be "ironclad" so that there would be  no room for evasion, and those who do not pay taxes should be  harshly punished with prison terms, "since that attitude is  comparable to a crime against the public patrimony."    He announced the creation of an Institute of Advanced  Studies  that will make it possible to train professional officials in  tax management with a true awareness of the role they fulfill.    The proposed modification of the Tax Code states, for  example, that if a taxpayer is challenged and his guilt is  shown, he should serve a prison term and pay the tax, a fine,  and additional interest for the delay. On this point, Moreno  denounced as unheard of the decision of the National Racetrack  Institute executives not to turn over to the treasury more than  3 billion bolivars resulting from a tax on bettors' winnings,  "in order to continue to finance their administration which has  been inefficient and possibly corrupt."    With respect to the position of COPEI [Social Christian  Party] on the Special Powers Law proposed by AD [Democratic  Action], on not authorizing the approval by the executive branch  of the income tax reform due to the elimination of exemptions,  Moreno Leon replied that meetings have been held to explain the  matter to the COPEI technical experts.    "I have arguments to show that the elimination of the  exemptions is just, because those who benefitted from that  indiscriminate system were the large taxpayers and not the small  ones. That is why we have set a minimum exoneration limit of up  to 750,000 bolivars in income," Moreno Leon explained.    In sum, the government's aim is to lower inflation to 30  percent, and this would bring a reduction in the interest rates  and stabilization of the exchange rate, based on a general  agreement that would not be like the Mexican one, imposed by one  party, but would come from the necessary consensus of everyone  in the face of the crisis, one would hope.</p>

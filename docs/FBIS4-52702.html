			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Slams S. Korean Puppets' Development of </F> Chemical Weapons" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  comments on the South Korean puppets' development of chemical  weapons.    The news analyst cites data on the production of chemical  weapons openly promoted in South Korea after the  "civilian"-veiled warmaniacs took office.    He says:    Last year the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique made public an  official "decision of the government" to possess chemical  weapons, stressing the need to build up its own strong  biochemical warfare capacity.    The decision of the "civilian"-veiled warmaniacs to overtly  possess chemical weapons, mass-destruction weapons which are  banned worldwide, shows their war frenzy has gone so far as to  ignore international law.    They are developing and stockpiling large quantities of  chemical weapons such as nerve, corrosive, toxic, choking,  disabling and irritant agents.    Army corps and divisions of the South Korean puppet army  have  chemical warfare units, which continuously hold chemical shell  firing drills. 15 chemical attack units are deployed along the  front. [sentence as received]    The production of chemical weapons and preparations for  chemical warfare which the South Korean puppets are feverishly  hastening, taking advantage of the U.S. imperialists' chemical  warfare preparations show the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique is  a group of rare warmaniacs in the world.    The South Korean puppets are desperately trying to plunge  fellow countrymen into the scourge of nuclear weapons and toxic  gas. They will inevitably be denounced and spurned by the  nation and the world.</p>

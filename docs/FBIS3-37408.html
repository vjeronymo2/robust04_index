			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russia has granted the Republic of Crimea the most  favoured nations status, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov told a  press conference on Wednesday, highlighting the results of his  talks in Moscow.    "All the decisions taken in Moscow will be implemented and  all of the necessary preliminary agreements have been reached,"  he said. The goal we have pursued for several years -- the  economic unity of Russia and Crimea -- has been attained, he  added.    Meshkov said that the problem of making the Russian ruble a  legitimate payment unit in Crimea has practically been solved.    "The technique and methods of doing so is Crimea's affair,"  he said. He also added that it was vitally important for the  Crimean economy to have the ruble as a payment unity by the  beginning of summer.    "No one should shun benefit," he stated.    "In Crimea reforms will develop the traditional way, and the  systems of civil laws will be levelled up to create a legal  foundation for uniting the Crimean and Russian economies," he  told Interfax-Ukraine. "We cannot neglect the processes which  are going on in Russia and which will occur in Ukraine," he said.    To quote the Crimean president, Russia is well aware of  Crimea's economic problems and has a favorable attitude to  Crimea. "Unfortunately, this cannot be said about the officials  representing the Ukrainian economy," he said. He noted,  however, that Russia's positive attitude to Crimea did not mean  a demonstrative rupture of economic ties with Ukraine. On the  contrary, we'll have more opportunities for broadening our  relations," he said.    He announced that Crimea's trade and economic mission will  be  established in Moscow to coordinate relations with Russia. He  suggested that the missions of Russia and of Crimea's neighbors  -- the Krasnodar and Stavropol territories and the Rostov-on-Don  region -- would be set up in Simferopol. He said that only God  Almighty was higher than the level of the Moscow talks.    Commenting on the appointment of Yevgeniy Saburov to the  post  of Crimea's premier, he said that this particular appointment  was extremely advantageous.    He noted that he did not call Kiev to give an account of his  talks in Moscow to the Ukrainian president. He said, however,  that a delegation of the Crimean Cabinet, led by Acting Prime  Minister Anatoliy Franchuk, had arrived in Kiev. The  preliminary results of the talks are positive, he said.</p>

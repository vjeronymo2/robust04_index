			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> NOT JUST TALKIN' TRASH;  </P> <P> PERMIT: ONE FIRM HAS BEEN HAULING VENTURA'S GARBAGE FOR SIX DECADES, BUT A  NEWCOMER IS PETITIONING CITY HALL FOR A PIECE OF THE ACTION.  </P> <P> A garbage war has begun to heat up in the city of Ventura. On one side of the  scrap is E.J. Harrison &amp; Sons, a family that has monopolized the business  of collecting the city's trash for the past five years.  </P> <P> But seeking to unseat the Harrisons at the top of the garbage heap in the city  is another Ventura trash collection company, Rubbish Control Inc.  </P> <P> Next week the city will vote to award a company owned by the Harrisons, Gold  Coast Recycling, exclusive rights to buy Ventura's recyclable waste for the  next five years.  </P> <P> E.J. Harrison's three sons own one-third of Gold Coast and one of them, Jim  Harrison, is the company president. On July 30, the council is scheduled to  vote on whether to renew E.J. Harrison &amp; Sons' trash-hauling permit. E.J.  Harrison has hauled the city's trash the past six decades.  </P> <P> But Rubbish Control Inc., which deals primarily with customers in  unincorporated areas of the county, although it has some customers in the city,  wants a bigger piece of the action.  </P> <P> After exchanging letters with city officials asking for a permit to expand  operations in Ventura, Rubbish Control took the matter directly to the City  Council on Monday.  </P> <P> "We want the right to compete," said Rick Chaidez, an attorney for Rubbish  Control. "We want a part of the recycling business, and we want to force  Harrison to drive prices down."  </P> <P> In the past year, Rubbish Control officials have sent six letters to City  Manager John Baker requesting a meeting to discuss the possibility of obtaining  a permit to work in the city.  </P> <P> Baker responded last July that the city had just finished its yearly review of  its trash permit, and that the newcomer would have to wait another year before  being considered for the permit.  </P> <P> Since then, Rubbish Control officials said they have tried repeatedly to meet  with city officials, but the requested meeting never took place.  </P> <P> "The monopoly and control of the refuse/rubbish business in the City of Ventura  held by the Harrison family seems out of control," Chaidez wrote Baker in a  July 6 letter. "Is there really an intent on the part of your office and other  city offices to allow competitive bidding?"  </P> <P> Terry Adelman, Ventura finance director, said city officials never met with  Rubbish Control because the garbage haulers failed to provide the city with  information needed to begin considering an application.  </P> <P> "We told them that we needed the information to see if there is a reason to  meet, and they never presented that," Adelman said.  </P> <P> But at Monday's council session, Baker told Chaidez that he has asked his  secretary to schedule a meeting sometime next week.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Rubbish Control owner Morteza Yassani said Baker's secretary has  yet to contact him.  </P> <P> Rubbish Control officials also contend that Harrison is abusing its privilege  by charging whatever it wants and that a new company in the city would benefit  the community.  </P> <P> "Our prices are more competitive," said Gloria Whitcomb, Rubbish Control office  manager. "We average $6 less per commercial bin."  </P> <P> But a price comparison on bids made by both companies in August to haul rubbish  from county buildings within the city of Ventura shows that E.J. Harrison  charges $5 less for a weekly pickup of a commercial-size bin.  </P> <P> Jim Harrison said that the threat of losing the city contract if his company  fails to deliver quality service and prices is incentive enough for his company  and that competition will not necessarily benefit the city.  </P> <P> "In the past, wide-open competition hasn't worked well," he said, adding that  the city had six competing garbage companies as recently as the 1960s.  </P> <P> "The ideal situation is a partnership between the city and the refuse hauler,  like the one we have right now."  </P> <P> City Council members said Tuesday that they are happy with Harrison &amp; Sons  but are open to new proposals.  </P> <P> "My feeling is that the future is with the Harrisons," said Councilman Gary  Tuttle, who sits on the county regional sanitation board. "They provide good  service, competitive rates, and they are a local family. We know them and  that's important to me."  </P> <P> On the other hand, Tuttle said, "the threat of new competition means continued  good service and good rates."  </P> <P> "I grew up with the Harrisons," Councilman Jim Monahan said. "I know they are  honest, legitimate folk. But we could probably benefit from a little  competition in the commercial refuse sector."  </P> <P> Many local businesses seem to agree. In a survey conducted earlier this year by  Rubbish Control among Greater Ventura Chamber of Commerce members, more than  75% of the 692 respondents said "we feel there needs to be another rubbish  hauler."  </P> <P> Adelman said the survey will be considered when the city decides on Rubbish  Control's permit in upcoming weeks. But, he added, the city will also consider  that Rubbish Control is already operating in the city -- and without a permit.  </P> <P> "We told them that we're looking for upright citizens and the fact that they  are violating the city code will definitely be a consideration that the council  will take into account when it makes a judgment," Adelman said.  </P> <P> Rubbish Control officials freely acknowledge that they service about six  commercial accounts in the city, including Kinko's on Stanley Avenue, Ventura  Carpet on Palma Avenue and the House of Paper on Palma Avenue.  </P> <P> "We're not trying to take away anybody's business," said Yassani, whose company  has operated in Ventura County since 1968. "We just go in when businesses call  us because they are unhappy with Harrison."  </P></p>

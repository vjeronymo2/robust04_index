			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Arts (Openings): Bayreuth The festival opens tonight with 'Parsifal', but the main interest this year is a new production of 'The Ring', staged by Alfred Kirchner and conducted by James Levine. Its most controversial aspect may well turn out to be the designs of German illustrator Rosalie. John Tomlinson returns as Wotan, and Wolfgang Schmidt is the new Siegfried. Last year's 'Tristan und Isolde' is revived with Siegfried Jerusalem and Waltraud Meier.</p>

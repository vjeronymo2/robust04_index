			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REWARDS FROM GREEN AT N.Y. FEST  </P> <P> As the JVC Jazz Festival moved into its final weekend, one of the most  rewarding concerts was performed Friday before a small audience at the intimate  Weill Recital Hall by the 27-year-old pianist Benny Green.  </P> <P> After attracting interest for several years through appearances and recordings  with Betty Carter, Art Blakey and others, Green today is moving rapidly into  the front rank of young, bop-inspired acoustic improvisers. Never on record has  his technique been so impressive, nor his use of it more felicitous than on  this occasion.  </P> <P> He opened with a somewhat bland treatment of "Namely You," then warmed up with  a tender "Come Sunday" and "Starcrossed Lovers" by Ellington and Strayhorn. It  was during Bud Powell's "Celia" that his true self-image appeared. He attacked  the fast-moving bop theme voraciously, playing it simultaneously in parallel  lines with both hands.  </P> <P> Later he applied this doubled-up process to improvised lines, executed with  astonishing dexterity. His affection for the bop era was faithfully recalled in  his treatment of Monk's ballad "Ruby My Dear."  </P> <P> Green is a student of the veteran pianist Walter Bishop Jr., who was in the  audience. Bishop can take pride in his bright young protege.  </P> <P> Later, next door at Carnegie Hall, Stan Getz made one of his now-rare  appearances (since a bout with cancer two years ago he has paced himself  carefully). With Dexter Gordon, Zoot Sims and Al Cohen gone, the ranks of the  great tenor saxophonists are thinning; Getz is the last of a vital creative  breed.  </P> <P> Any concert that offers an opportunity to hear Getz play Billy Strayhorn's  "Blood Count" is, ipso facto, richly rewarding. He applied his nonpareil sound  and wrenching emotion to this work, as well as to Mal Waldron's "Soul Eyes" and  Johnny Mandel's "El Cajon" (dedicated to the late Al Cohen).  </P> <P> Getz was matched by the consistently swinging Kenny Barron, who has been his  pianist off and on since 1974; by Alex Blake, who on one tune doubled his bass  lines with vocals a la Slam Stewart; and by the young, occasionally obtrusive  drummer Terri Lyne Carrington.  </P> <P> The rest of the concert involved two additional musicians, playing  synthesizers. One of them, Eddie del Barrio, wrote or co-wrote several of the  tunes for the latest Getz album. On these numbers Blake switched to electric  bass and Getz, who had dispensed with the mike entirely on some of the quartet  pieces, was amplified. With the exception of Mike Lang's engaging "Lonely  Lady," these were sextet experiments in largely overall sound while reducing  the impact of Getz's solos.  </P> <P> It was a pleasure to see him return, for an encore, with just Kenny Barron, for  a duo version of Benny Carter's "People Time" that brought out the tonal beauty  of which he is a master.  </P></p>

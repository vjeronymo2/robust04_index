			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURGERY EXPECTED FOR HONECKER  </P> <P> East German leader Erich Honecker, rumored to be suffering from cancer, will  travel to Switzerland for surgery, a West German newspaper said Sunday in a  report attributed to Western intelligence services.  </P> <P> The Welt am Sonntag paper said Honecker will travel to Switzerland immediately  after celebrations Oct. 7 marking the 40th anniversary of the founding of the  German Democratic Republic (East Germany). The newspaper gave no other details  about the report but attributed it to Western intelligence sources.  </P> <P> Speculation that Honecker has cancer was fueled in early September when  security sources in Bonn said he had undergone an unsuccessful gall bladder  operation.  </P> <P> The 77-year-old leader resumed his duties last week after a five-week absence  from office, during which he underwent surgery. East German officials rejected  claims that the operation was not successful and said Honecker was in good  health.  </P></p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / DTI seeks more scrutiny of insolvency fees The Department of Trade and Industry is considering how to scrutinise more effectively the fees charged by insolvency practitioners. The move is in response to public concern over insolvency fees charged in several recent high-profile corporate collapses. Senior officials at the department plan to hold talks with professional bodies and regulators covering the insolvency sector during the coming weeks to decide how best to respond to criticism. The discussions will focus on efforts to improve the transparency of fees charged and ways to motivate creditors to consider whether practitioners are achieving value for money. Last July the Commons social security committee called for an independent monitor in larger insolvencies to help determine whether practitioners' actions and fees were appropriate. Government ministers rejected the suggestion of an independent monitor and are opposed to any legislative change or extensive involvement by civil servants in monitoring insolvency practices more closely. However, officials are trying to develop ways to encourage creditors to take more seriously their role in approving practitioners' work programmes and fees. The result of the discussions might be codes of conduct or other voluntary measures issued by the professional bodies during the coming months. Touche Ross, the accountancy firm which is working on the liquidation of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, reported this month that its fees since appointment at the end of 1991 exceeded Pounds 98m. Last month the Commons social security committee criticised Buchler Phillips, a specialist insolvency firm, in a report which highlighted that it had barely recovered assets to pay for its fees in its work on the estate of the publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell. Other substantial professional fees have been incurred over the handling of the companies in the Maxwell business empire and on the administration of Polly Peck International. The profession argues that the fees reflect the work firms have had to do and are generally a small proportion of the total asset recoveries made as a result of their efforts. The renewed scrutiny comes at a time when the Joint Insolvency Monitoring Unit, the new regulatory body for the profession, is also turning its attention to fees during its random inspections of practitioners. Ms Kay Linnell, the head of the unit, said inspections would consider how reasonable charge rates were and the accuracy of time records. 'I do think there are reasons for concern,' she said.</p>

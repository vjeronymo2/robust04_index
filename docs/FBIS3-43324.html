Among issues raised were the  1994 appropriations bill and the validation of powers for  hearing the reports of parliamentary audit missions. The  ceremony offered an opportunity for deputies to recall the  country's political and social situation. Here is our report:    [Begin unidentified reporter recording] The October 1993  session which closed on 3 January was not characterized by  intense activity, as was the case in the past owing to the  country's general political climate and the failure of the  government to present the 1994 appropriations bill in a timely  maaner. To date the bill has not yet been presented at the  National Assembly. It would have provided answers to queries  from deputies by explaining how the people's confidence in the  state is going to be stimulated and enabling the effective  revamping of the country's economic activities. All that the  National Assembly had to do was to place on record a bitter note  of the situation in view of the serious budgetary legislation  lapses for the 1994 financial year.    Second Deputy Speaker Maneng Makong stressed that the  monetary reform which had at the time been considered inevitable  has just experienced a boomerang that has been sharply felt  among all the social strata. He also spoke of the actions taken  by parliament both inside and outside the country. The National  Assembly was not indifferent to the unfortunate bloody coup  attempt in Burundi and the death of President Felix  Houphouet-Boigny of Cote d'Ivoire. Turning to the crisis in this  transition period, the second deputy speaker observed that  people had confused democracy with anarchy and democratic  process with revolutionary process. To resolve this crisis,  Zairian politicians must strive to draft the constitution of the  Third Republic within the shortest possible time. Mr. Maneng  Makong concluded with biblical verses as a way of appealing to  the conscience of all politicians. [end recording]</p>

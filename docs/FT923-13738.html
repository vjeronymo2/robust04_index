			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Property: A Name who is trading down - Michael Hanson visits a Lloyd's member who is selling his nine-bedroom mansion JOHN REW had just returned from Venice, where he and three other members of London Rowing Club took part in the Vogalonga - the three-hour 'long row' around the lagoon by 1,500 gondolas and boats. He sat in his elegant drawing room at Thornhill Park, Dorset and recounted how he has been sticking his oar into Lloyd's since 1980. As publisher of Chatset's annual Lloyd's League Tables, he has been forecasting the present calamity at the insurance giant for some time. Three years ago, he prophesied that 'storm cones should be hoisted' over London's Leadenhall Street, and in his annual review this January he wrote: 'We are now looking across an abyss of dramatic proportions.' A year ago, Lloyd's declared a net loss of Pounds 510m for 1988, made up of a Pounds 1bn loss by one-third of the syndicates and a Pounds 500m profit by the rest. Rew and his joint editor, Charles Sturge, predict that by the time the results for 1991 are known in 1994, Lloyd's will have lost Pounds 3.9bn. Rew further predicts that as many as 6,000 Names at Lloyd's - a third of the members - could be wiped out this year. In many cases, most of their assets are represented by their houses, which will be difficult to realise quickly. Having said all this, Rew denies that the sale of his own house is necessary to meet his own losses: 'Certainly, I've got losses, but I'm not selling the house to pay those. I'm on 35 syndicates, and I do have some sizeable losses, but luckily I changed from giving bank guarantees to depositing securities with Lloyd's, which can be sold.' He bought Thornhill Park, at Stalbridge, near Sturminster Newton in Dorset, shortly after the youngest of his five children was born in 1970. Now that the oldest children have left home and the youngest is about to read law in London, the nine-bedroom house is too large for him and his wife. 'We have been thinking of selling the house for a couple of years,' he says. 'The trouble is finding something to replace it. I would be happy with a boathouse on a river somewhere, but I think we need something larger than that.' Rew comes from a long line of oarsmen: his grandfather rowed at Henley in 1860, his father rowed in the 1924 Olympics and his uncle rowed in the 1928 Olympics. He took up rowing again in 1987, after a break of 25 years, to encourage his three sons to row. Thornhill Park was used as a setting for the film Far from the Madding Crowd. It stands on a knoll with panoramic views over the Blackmore Vale to the Dorset Downs. It was the home of Sir James Thornhill (1675-1734), the artist who decorated the dome of St Paul's Cathedral, the Painted Hall at Greenwich Hospital and many of the saloons and staircases in the great mansions of his day. By 1725, he had made enough money to buy back the Dorset family estate that his father's extravagance had frittered away before he was born. Here he built the present house, which though less grand than some of the other country houses he designed, such as Moor Park, Hertfordshire (now a golf clubhouse), is still a fine Palladian building, listed Grade II* for its architectural and historic interest. He also designed the obelisk in the park to mark the accession of George II in 1727 (and not, as the agents suggest, that monarch's marriage to Queen Caroline, which took place in 1705, when they were still living in Hanover). Over the past 20 years, the Rews have restored most of the house to its original glory, especially the magnificent saloon on the first floor that Thornhill used as his studio and gallery, but parts of the house are still unrestored. It is for sale with 185 acres, including an entrance lodge and a cottage, garages, stables, a squash court and a swimming pool. Offers over Pounds 1m are being sought by the London and Sherborne offices of Knight Frank and Rutley (071-629-8171 or 0935-812236) acting jointly with Symonds and Sampson of Dorchester (0305-264172).</p>

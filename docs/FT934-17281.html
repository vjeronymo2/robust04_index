			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Sherwood Group shows 5% fall to Pounds 7.76m SHERWOOD GROUP, the socks and lace manufacturer, yesterday reported its first decline in interim profits since its flotation in 1986. Pre-tax profits fell 5 per cent to Pounds 7.76m (Pounds 8.18m) for the first six months of 1993. Mr David Parker, chairman, blamed recession in continental Europe for depressing profit margins on lace sales. Operating profit in lace fell from Pounds 5.59m to Pounds 4.64m, while turnover rose from Pounds 37m to Pounds 39.9m. The company is increasingly dependent on overseas sales: 48 per cent of total turnover of Pounds 69.7m (Pounds 66m) now takes place outside the UK. Nevertheless the interim dividend goes up to 1p (0.9p), a measure of 'the board's confidence in the future', said Mr Parker. Earnings per share fell from 5.3p to 4.8p, partly reflecting the issue of shares for the Pounds 19.6m acquisition in May of Lepel, the Italian lingerie maker. Mr Parker said that the acquisition would be earnings enhancing over the full year. Garment sales tend to be substantially higher in the second half and the acquisition would further add to the skewing of sales and profits towards the second half. Analysts said that pre-tax profits for the full year should be about Pounds 21m, beating 1992's Pounds 16.9m. 'Wherever we can cut costs, we will,' said Mr Parker. 'But margins will remain under pressure in the second half too.' Some 300 jobs had been cut this year, although another 210 people were taken on with Lepel. The company is also concentrating on higher margin products. It is reducing production of curtain lace to concentrate on clothing lace using Textronic machines which create a three dimensional fabric. Investment is falling from an 'exceptionally high figure last year' of Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 9.5m for the full year.</p>

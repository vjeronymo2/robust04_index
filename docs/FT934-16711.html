			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: UK water It will take more than a few overseas contracts to convince that North West is among the winners in the UK water sector. Potential earnings from its Mexico City contract are a drop in the ocean compared with profits generated by its regulated utility business. The performance of the shares in the run-up to next year's regulatory review suggests that the market sees the balance of risk and reward closer to home. A poor unregulated business in the shape of Biffa has not stopped Severn Trent outperforming on the strength of its main water operations. With one of the biggest capital expenditure programmes in the second half of the decade, North West is certainly exposed to the outcome of the review. South West and Anglian are in a similar position. If Ofwat allows the companies to earn a generous rate of return on new investment, high spending might translate into high profits. But investors nervous of regulatory risks are more likely to favour companies with relatively low spending plans and strong financial ratios. Severn Trent fits the bill, as do Southern, Wessex and Welsh. With the regulator's opening shot still a month away, though, placing bets now can be based on little more than gut feel. Importantly, the government has not yet responded to Ofwat's appeal for relaxation of new water and sewerage standards. Without a political decision on that, the companies' level of capital spending remains uncertain, let alone the rate of return they might be allowed to earn on that investment. Until the rules become clearer, there is a strong argument for investors hedging their bets.</p>

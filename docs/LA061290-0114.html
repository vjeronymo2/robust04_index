			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> OFFICIALS SEEK FAIR RENT FOR POST OFFICE  </P> <P> Ojai officials are preparing to ask their senators, congressmen and the U.S.  postmaster general to assure that the U.S. Postal Service will pay fair-market  rent for its office in downtown Ojai.  </P> <P> City Manager Andrew Belknap said he fears that the Postal Service has proposed  far lower rent than is fair over the next 11 years as a ploy to be able to move  the main post office from downtown.  </P> <P> Jack Fay, president of the Ojai Civic Assn., which owns the bell-towered  building that houses the post office, says the fixed-rate offer of $56,600 a  year until 2002 is "unfair and one-sided."  </P> <P> Fay and Belknap have prepared a letter protesting the proposed contract,  calculating that the fixed rent would fall far short of the pace of inflation,  giving the Postal Service an unfair windfall of $180,000 over the next 11  years.  </P> <P> Belknap is asking Ojai Mayor Nina Shelley to sign the letter with the City  Council's approval today. Copies will be sent to Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.)  and Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), and Reps. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) and  Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley).  </P> <P> The dispute dates back to 1986 when the Postal Service informed the association  that it was planning to build a larger post office on the west side of town.  Residents protested the move, circulating petitions and printing up T-shirts  pleading, "Save Our Post Office."  </P> <P> With help from Lagomarsino and Gallegly, the association received the Postal  Service's promise that it would keep the main branch downtown and build an  annex elsewhere.  </P> <P> Postal officials signed an agreement with the association in 1988 to enter into  a long-term lease based on the building's fair-market value.  </P> <P> Postal officials believe their current offer of fixed rent meets that  agreement.  </P> <P> "The Civic Assn. finds this explanation unconvincing, and I share their  skepticism," Belknap wrote to the City Council.  </P> <P> "It could be an attempt to present a lease so one-sided that the Ojai Civic  Assn. will not sign it, thus freeing the facilities branch to resurrect their  plan to build a completely new facility."

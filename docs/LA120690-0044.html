			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SHOP UNTIL YOU DROP -- THEN STOP FOR A BITE;  </P> <P> TIMEOUT: IN OR NEAR THE MALL OF YOUR CHOICE THERE IS SOMEPLACE TO SIT YOURSELF  DOWN, HAVE A SNACK AND CATCH YOUR BREATH.  </P> <P> You finally found a parking space. You actually got a salesperson to help you.  </P> <P> You fought your way to the cash register.  </P> <P> Good.  </P> <P> One down, the rest of the list to go.  </P> <P> After a couple of hours of this exercise we call Christmas shopping, you are  going to need a cup of coffee or tea, or a straitjacket.  </P> <P> Take heart. There's help nearby, at least with the munchies.  </P> <P> In or near the mall of your choice there is someplace to call timeout, sit  yourself down, catch your breath and have a bite to eat.  </P> <P> And that's important.  </P> <P> The three rules for Christmas shopping, from a world-class shopper, are:  </P> <P> * Make lists.  </P> <P> * Make a budget -- and stick to it.  </P> <P> * Make yourself stop when you are tired.  </P> <P> There is nothing more dangerous than shopping on empty, according to former  Studio City resident Suzy Kalter Gershman, now the American Express shopping  consultant in New York City and author of the book series "Born to Shop," which  tells you where to get the best bargains in cities around the world.  </P> <P> "You will exhaust yourself and your pocketbook if you don't take a break when  your feet refuse to stand for any more," she said, adding that most expensive  mistakes are made when you are just too pooped to think about what you are  doing.  </P> <P> "Just try to look at Christmas shopping as a game of endurance in which you  have to pace yourself," she said. "Tired and broke are not good ways to  experience the holidays."  </P> <P> If you shop at Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park, Antelope Valley Mall or the  Sherman Oaks Galleria, the obvious, but not necessarily best, choice for your  "sit and snack" might be the food halls. It's fast-food and about as relaxing  as the "1812" Overture, but at least you don't have to move your car.  </P> <P> At the Sherman Oaks Galleria, there are several places nearby where you might  go for an afternoon aperitif, or some coffee and a sweet, if you are willing to  stash your packages in the trunk and drive a couple of blocks.  </P> <P> Both L'Express, near Kester Avenue on Ventura Boulevard, and Le Cafe, down the  street near Van Nuys Boulevard, offer tea and sympathy. The pastry chef at  L'Express has gotten raves for good reason. Le Cafe has outside seating, if the  weather is good.  </P> <P> At Topanga Plaza, there are several excellent options to the food halls, and  two are on the premises.  </P> <P> The California Pizza Kitchen offers designer pizza and hearty salads, along  with lighter fare. The Red Robin is gourmet fast-food served in pleasant  surroundings.  </P> <P> If you can face another crowd, head over to the Cheesecake Factory in the  Trillium on Canoga Avenue. The food and ambience are impressive. So,  unfortunately, is the waiting time, although between 3 and 5 p.m. you'd  probably breeze right in.  </P> <P> The Glendale Galleria and Northridge Fashion Center are busy places as well,  but they don't have the food hall situation.  </P> <P> In the Northridge mall, Anna Miller's Pies is an OK place to sit for a few  minutes and collect your thoughts, and there is Coco's at the northeast end of  the mall, in a separate building.  </P> <P> If you are willing to give up your parking place in exchange for getting out of  the fray, there are a string of restaurants south on Tampa Avenue, including  Marie Callender's and the pleasant El Torito.  </P> <P> Glendale has a number of excellent places for a quick stop inside the mall,  including La Petite Boulangerie and Cafe Le Pafe, which have homemade pastries  and aromatic gourmet coffees and teas. There is also a Good Earth, near  Mervyn's, where you can get organic munchies.  </P> <P> Not far from the mall, if you are willing to hoof it, there is Fresco on Brand  Boulevard, where you can sit down to white linen and gourmet goodies.  </P> <P> At the newly redone Fashion Square in Sherman Oaks, there are several good  choices, including the salads and soups at California Crisp, and everything at  Paradise Bakery.  </P> <P> But if you are willing to car hop, you can trundle down to La Serre or the  Bistro Garden at Coldwater for some pastries or other goodies and enjoy all the  ambience at very little cost. Since meals aren't being prepared, your  selections will have to run to sweets or sandwiches, but it's a great way to  visit these gourmet greats without shelling out the lunch or dinner prices.  </P> <P> One of the more relaxed malls in our area, where the crowds are almost always  in the acceptable range, is the Promenade in Woodland Hills. This upscale  shopping area, which will be renovated after the Christmas rush, curiously has  no place to enjoy a gourmet goodie, except for the tiny lunch room at I  Magnin's. There is also Magic Pan and Anna Miller's.  </P> <P> The surrounding area, however, is lush with possibilities. There is the  pleasant, publike Bob Burns in a free-standing building just west of Saks. And  across the street is the Marriott Hotel, which offers a number of dining rooms  in which to rest and recover.  </P> <P> Heading north from the center there is the aforementioned Cheesecake Factory,  and next door to that is the Hilton Hotel, a pleasant place to pop in for a  drink.  </P> <P> The most important thing is not where you go, but that you take the time to do  it.  </P></p>

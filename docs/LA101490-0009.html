			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPENSES FOR 'THAT BIG DAY' ARE A DISGRACE  </P> <P> In February of this year, our family and friends joined us in celebrating our  son's bar mitzvah. After ably demonstrating his mastery of Biblical Hebrew and  its interpretation, my wife and I blessed him as our parents had blessed us a  generation ago.  </P> <P> We then hosted a quiet and dignified luncheon for our guests at which we could  actually hear ourselves talk and reminisce. There was no band, no disc jockey  and certainly no clowns or Laker girls. And they weren't missed. When a  well-meaning cousin asked what our "theme" was, we simply said, "Religion and  family."  </P> <P> The responsibility of bringing perspective to the bar mitzvah celebration and  limiting the vulgar aggrandizement plaguing the process lies with the parents.  Moreover, we are absolutely confident that, far from cheating our children, our  son (and his sister after him) will reflect on the true meaning of that sacred  day and will always warmly recall the love, tradition and spirituality we  shared, undistorted by the fleeting and faddish grotesqueries apparently  coveted by so many others.  </P> <P> DENA AND DAVID GINSBURG  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

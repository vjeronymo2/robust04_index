			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 24, IRNA -- A morning daily here  Sunday [24 April] referred to the role Russia played in the  Bosnian tragedy and said if Russia allowed itself to be used as  an excuse for Western duplicity in Bosnia, it would damage its  "already fragile relation with Muslim countries."    "The United States introduced the Russian trump card exactly  at the juncture when the world public opinion demanded UN-NATO  action to end Serbian aggression against Bosnia," wrote "TEHRAN  TIMES" in its editorial.    The United States and its allies, said the article, insist  that there can be no peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina unless the  Russians are allowed to participate in NATO's plants to end the  Serbs atrocities.    The West had to find a way of wiggling out this mess without  accepting any blame and this was where the Russian factor came  into play, noted the paper.    The daily wrote that the U.S. intended to show that Russia  was an important military power deserving of being included in  resolving the global conflicts.    However, added the paper, when the U.S.-led UN forces  attacked the Iraqi Army, the opposition of the all powerful  Soviet Union was totally ignored by the U.S. and its allies.    Russia, for its domestic reasons, needed to pretend that it  was still the same "menacing bear" it used to be before its  disintegration, said the daily.    It added that the Russian officials should realize that by  promoting the Serbian cause they are playing into the hands of  the Western "political puppeteers" who plan to sit this war out  and blame their inaction on Russia's opposition to the use of  force against the Serbs.    The paper noted in conclusion that Russia should realize  that  if it continued playing the role of an excuse for the West, it  would face "irreparable" damages in its relations with Muslim  countries and their more than one billion collective population.</p>

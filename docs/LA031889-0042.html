Consider using dwarf  citrus in large containers for a decorative touch and a tasty harvest of  full-sized fruit.  </P> <P> Spring is the time to start a regular fertilizing program for all areas of the  garden.  </P> <P> This is a good time to plant star jasmine for fragrant blooms at the base of a  fence or wall.  </P> <P> Sow vegetables such as lettuce, radishes, corn and carrots in successive  plantings to lengthen the harvest time.  </P> <P> Rake up and dispose of old camellia blooms and leaves, to prevent the spread of  petal blight.  </P> <P> Watch for aphids that attack new rose growth.  </P></p>

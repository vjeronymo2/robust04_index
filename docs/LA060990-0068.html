			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> RIVAL BENSONHURST FIGURES CALL TRUCE  </P> <P> Black activists and white Bensonhurst leaders declared a cease-fire in the war  of words and marches that followed the racial slaying of a black teen-ager in  the Brooklyn neighborhood last summer.  </P> <P> The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has led weekly processions through the community, and  Assemblyman Frank Barbaro, who represents Bensonhurst, stood on the steps of  City Hall to announce the truce. They were joined by Moses Stewart, father of  the slain youth -- Yusuf Hawkins -- and a score of religious and political  leaders on both sides of the dispute. The accord calls for an end to the  marches by black activists. Bensonhurst officials will in turn meet today with  members of Stewart's family to express condolences.  </P></p>

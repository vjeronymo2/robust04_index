			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> The British Broadcasting Corp. issued new guidelines Wednesday aimed at keeping  gratuitous sex and violence -- as well as supporters of Irish nationalist  guerrillas -- off the air. "Scenes of violence, sex, great distress or  inclusion of bad language are all considerations which can affect the most  suitable placing in the schedules," the new guidelines say. "A good rule of  thumb is to avoid taking the audience by surprise except for a very good  reason." Violence should never be gratuitous, dead bodies should not been shown  unless there are "the most compelling reasons for doing so" nor should there be  undue focus in the news on the bloody aftermath of a terrorist attack.  Producers were told that while sex had been more explicit on television in  recent years, they were more limited than film makers in what they could show  because their programs were viewed by families at home. British television  shows nudity, but only after 9 p.m. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Indictment Sought Against Andreotti </F> for Mafia Ties"]    [Excerpts] (ANSA) Palermo, May 21 -- Palermo prosecutors  have requested the indictment of former Prime Minister and now  life-senator Giulio Andreotti for complicity in association to  commit Mafia-style crimes, judiciary sources disclosed Saturday  [21 May]. The indictment request filed today was the first  formal move by magistrates toward putting Andreotti on trial  since he was first placed under investigation more than one year  ago.    Andreotti, a Christian Democratic veteran and for decades  one  of the most powerful politicians in Italy, in March 1993 was  first notified he was under investigation on suspicion of Mafia  links. Magistrates at the time asked that Andreotti's  parliamentary immunity from prosecution be lifted.    The prosecution's case reportedly rests on testimony  provided  by six former Mafia members who decided to turn state's  evidence, including Tommaso Buscetta, who 10 years ago first  gave investigators a description of the workings of Cosa Nostra  in Sicily but refused to talk about the links between  politicians and organized crime. In more recent times other  former Mafia bosses, specifically Gaspare Mutolo, Antonino  Marchese, Leonardo Messina and Baldassare Di Maggio reportedly  gave a clearer picture of these links.    Andreotti's defense counsel, Odoardo Ascari, in a statement  today said that, one year after the first suspicions were  voiced, no one has yet stepped forward to confirm the alleged  "contributions" Andreotti gave to the Mafia by using his  political connections to rig trials against organized crime  bosses in Sicily.    According to judiciary sources, magistrates have been  investigating possible connections between Andreotti and the  Mafia slaying of Salvo Lima, Sicily's most powerful Christian  Democrat, on March 12, 1992. Lima, a member of the European  Parliament at the time, led Andreotti's supporters on the island.    Some former bosses have claimed that Cosa Nostra was able to  rig trials by turning to Lima, and that Andreotti himself met  some top organized crime chiefs in private.    Andreotti has repeatedly claimed he has never met Mafia  bosses and could not do so even if he wished to because he is  always under heavy police escort. But Palermo assistant public  prosecutors Guido Lo Forte and Roberto Scarpinato today said  investigations have shown that Andreotti "sometimes eluded his  bodyguards."    The fact that the prosecution has requested Andreotti's  indictment indicates it believes sufficient evidence exists for  a possible conviction. [passage omitted]    Later today, it was learned here that three additional  mafiosi who have become "pentiti," penitents or state's  witnesses, have furthered the case against the life senator.  The three were identified as Gioacchino La Barbera, Santo Di  Matteo and Salvatore Cancemi. Barbera was said to have reported  to investigators a conversation between Mafia dons Nino Gioe and  Leoluca Bagarella on the feasibility of murdering Andreotti or  one of his sons because of the powerful political figure's  betrayal of Cosa Nostra. Barbera was quoted as saying, "They  complained about the conduct of Lima and Ignazio Salvo and put  up the explanation that these two could do nothing because  Andreotti had, by now, changed policy in a direction less  favorable for Cosa Nostra."

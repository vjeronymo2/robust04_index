			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Mandela's Call for Peace Prelude to `Tough Action' -- A  page-16 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 1 March  comments on two "major initiatives" to persuade the Freedom  Alliance (FA) to participate in the April election. The first  African National Congress (ANC)-National Party (NP) initiative,  "which includes a move to extend the election registration  deadline -- offers the FA an opportunity to reappraise its  foolish and dangerous boycott tactic." The second initiative  comes from Nelson Mandela, who has said: "`I will go down on my  knees to beg those who want to drag our country into  bloodshed...not to do so'." THE STAR believes Mandela's  willingness to "adopt the position of supplicant begging for  peace should not deceive his political opponents. It is not a  sign of weakness, but a move by a strong man to prepare for  tough action by showing that he has done his best to reach a  compromise and avoid violence. Like the threat to restore the  pre-colonial Zulu monarchy, Buthelezi's latest ploy -- of  seeking a postponement of the April election in Natal and  preserving the status quo there for the immediate future -- has  no chance of success. By introducing yet another demand, he  risks demonstrating beyond doubt that he will do anything to  avid the verdict of the people at the polls. Unless he changes  tack, his political epitaph will be that of a spoiler."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Need for Buthelezi `Conciliatory' Approach -- "It took a  great deal of humility for Mandela, hardly a humble man, to say  at an election rally on Sunday that he would be willing to `go  down on my knees' before Buthelezi to plead with him to join the  process," notes Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 1 March  in a page-8 editorial. This permits Buthelezi "the opportunity  to re-enter the political mainstream with dignity, perhaps even  with the aura of a statesman." "What is required of Buthelezi  at this stage, however, if he desires a reasonable deal, is that  he adopt a more conciliatory attitude towards the process even  if he remains dissatisfied with the offer on the table."  However, the chances of Buthelezi adopting that approach "seem  doubtful," given "the new obstacles he has identified. First he  said Inkatha would be unprepared for an April election even if  all its constitutional demands were met. He then noted that the  king's demands for an autonomous realm were paramount. The  portents are not good."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   `Good Riddance' to Homelands -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in  English on 1 March in a page-8 editorial believes the collapse  of the political infrastructure in Venda and Bophuthatswana "was  to be expected considering the manner in which these homelands  were created. It is a well known fact that the National Party  created these tin pots states dictated by the political fraud  that they were giving black political status in their `own  homes'. The so-called independent black states also deprived  millions of people of their South African citizenship." It is  well to bid the homelands "good riddance" since the lives of  many have been "wrecked and millions of rand have been wasted on  the homelands."  <H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>   `Colonels' Conspiracy' Threatens Country -- Gerald Shaw  writes in his "Political Survey" column on page 6 of Cape Town  CAPE TIMES in English 25 February: "A military coup is not on  the cards; neither is a civil war, we may hope, but there are  elements in the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] and the  Inkatha Freedom Party whose efforts to upset the apple cart  should be taken seriously." Shaw writes that according to the  weekend newspaper RAPPORT, "the new conspiracy -- let us call it  the Colonels' conspiracy -- is taking shape in extreme secrecy,  with generals Viljoen and Groenewald and other Volksfront  leaders apparently not in the picture." Now the "claim for the  restoration of the Zulu kingdom's 1834 boundaries, however it  originated, is ripe for exploitation by the dark forces on the  Right, and so is the drive to rally traditionalist Zulus behind  King Goodwill Zwelithini and declare a Natal/kwaZulu UDI  [unilateral declaration of independence]. This conscious  exploitation of Zulu national pride has added an explosive  element to a readily combustible mixture."  <H6>  CITY PRESS </H6>   Stop Promises of Afrikaner Homeland -- "While we support the  efforts being made to bring Inkatha and the rightwingers on  board the election train, we must question the wisdom of  promising some Afrikaners a volkstaat [homeland]," declares a  page-14 editorial in Johannesburg CITY PRESS in English on 27  February. "Whatever the motives of the ANC are in this regard,  we believe they are playing dangerous games by making the  rightwingers even remotely believe they can have their own  homeland." "Afrikaners, like it or not, are now part of a  heterogeneous but unitary South Africa."</p>

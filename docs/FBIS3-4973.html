			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- Yohei Kono, head of the  leading opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), said Thursday  [3 March] the cabinet of the ruling coalition may be nearing the  end of its political reform mission since it cannot agree on  economic reform.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, however, defended  differences of opinion as "awkward" but underlined the unity of  the coalition during questioning at a meeting of the special  committee on political reform in the House of Councillors.    "It is fate that we make our decisions while maintaining and  worrying about the delicate balance between the eight parties,"  said Hosokawa.    "Even though it is a bit awkward, each party believes in  upholding the unity of the coalition," he said.    Hosokawa's remarks and the challenge from Kono and the LDP  came in the wake of the prime minister's decision to give up  reshuffling his cabinet.    "The prime minister said he wanted to form an economic  reform  cabinet, but he couldn't do this since they couldn't reach a  consensus (within the coalition) on economic reform," Kono said.    "If political reform is realized, the mission of the cabinet  will be completed," said Kono.    He further criticized the coalition, saying, "this is not  the  time for a power game. They should be thinking more about the  welfare of the nation and the lives of the people."    Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said  it  was "very regrettable" that cabinet reform had apparently been  intended to remove him from his position as top government  spokesman.    Takemura has openly differed with Hosokawa over economic  policies including a bombshell proposal by the prime minister to  install a 7 percent national welfare tax in place of the current  3 percent consumption tax as part of the budget package for the  next fiscal year.    Takemura acknowledged there were reasons for the talk of his  removal, saying, "rather than handing in my resignation, I will  continue to do my best with a new attitude."    Takemura told reporters he decided not to attend a general  meeting of his party, Sakigake (Harbinger), so as to draw a  clear line between his roles as party leader and chief cabinet  secretary.    "I will be more careful so as not to be misunderstood," he  told a news conference.    Asked about his future relations with Hosokawa, Takemura  said  he and the premier had held discussions on seven or eight  occasions and reaffirmed that they will remain friends as before.    "We agreed to maintain our friendship and I have no  apprehensions about this."    He also noted he will try to stay more in touch and exchange  views more often with Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and  Komeito, the two forces that backed Hosokawa's plan for a  cabinet reshuffle centering on the removal of Takemura as chief  of staff.    Social Democratic Party (SDP) chairman Tomiichi Murayama,  head of the coalition's largest faction, told the party's  central committee that he wanted to see the SDP assume  responsibility for strengthening the coalition administration.    "What is urgently needed is to get the budget through the  Diet, since we have responsibility to respond to the people's  expectations," Murayama said.    Keigo Ouchi, head of the Democratic Socialist Party, sounded  an optimistic note in calling for coalition unity, "we have  avoided antagonism within the cabinet and the government.    "The storm is over and clear weather is coming, but it is  important to maintain a singleness of purpose in the coalition  parties from now on."</p>

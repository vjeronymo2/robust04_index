			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA maintains that the District may use any administrative Procedures it has under State law to implement and enforce the requirements of part 55, such as a variance. However, as stated in the preamble to part 55, as onshore, a variance will not shield a source from enforcement action by EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Permits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pursuant to &sect;55.6:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) VCAPCD will require that the Applicant send a copy of any permit application required by 40 CFR 55.6 to the Administrator through the EPA Regional Office (Attn: A&hyph;5&hyph;1) at the same time as the application is submitted to VCAPCD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) VCAPCD shall send a copy of any public comment notice required under &sect;&sect;55.6, 55.13 or 55.14 to the Administrator through the EPA Regional Office (Attn: A&hyph;5&hyph;1) and the Minerals Management Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) VCAPCD shall send a copy of any preliminary determination and any final permit action required under &sect;&sect;55.6, 55.13 or 55.14 to the Administrator through the EPA Regional Office (Attn: A&hyph;5&hyph;1) at the time of the determination and shall make available to the Administrator any materials used in making the determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) VCAPCD shall provide written notice of any permit application from a source, the emissions from which may affect a Class I area, to the Federal Land Manager of that area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The District will request EPA guidance on any matter involving the interpretation of section 328 of the Act, the delegated sections of the OCS air regulations or any other provision of 40 CFR part 55 to the extent that implementation, review, administration or enforcement of these provisions has not been covered by determinations or guidance sent to the District.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Pursuant to its authority under the Clean Air Act, EPA may review permits issued by the District under this agreement to ensure that the District's implementation of Rule 72.1 is consistent with the time frames and requirements of the federal regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Exemptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pursuant to &sect;55.7:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) VCAPCD shall transmit to the Administrator (through the Regional Office), the Minerals Management Service, and the U.S. Coast Guard, a copy of the permit application, or the request for exemption if no permit is required, within 5 days of its receipt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) VCAPCD shall consult with the Minerals Management Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Coast Guard to determine whether the exemption will be granted or denied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If VCAPCD, the Minerals Management Service, and the U.S. Coast Guard do not reach a consensus decision within 90 days from the day the VCAPCD received the exemption request, the request shall automatically be referred to the Administrator, who will process the referral in accordance with 40 CFR 55.7(f)(3).

			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE DISTRICT GETS GRANT FOR $315,607  </P> <P> The San Diego Community College District has received $315,607 from the  controversial foundation established several years ago to help pay educational  expenses. The district covers 100,000 students at City, Mesa and Miramar  colleges, and at 10 continuing education centers.  </P> <P> The grant brings the total money from the San Diego Community College District  Foundation during the past four years to $1.03 million. The foundation,  established by a previous Board of Trustees, annually gives the district half  the interest earnings from its $7-million endowment. The other half can be used  for operating expenses but has been kept in the endowment the last two years to  increase interest income in future years.  </P> <P> The foundation is now the subject of a legal battle between the district and  disgruntled faculty members who allege that the foundation has illegally used  revenue belonging to the district to set up courses that compete with the  district's own courses. The new board and chancellor of the district have said  they want to put past battles over the foundation behind them, but concede that  legal action may continue indefinitely.  </P></p>

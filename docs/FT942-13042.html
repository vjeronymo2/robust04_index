			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Insurer to step up direct selling General Accident, one of the UK's largest insurance companies, is to step up its direct sales operation following research indicating that as many as six out of 10 customers are prepared to buy home and motor insurance by telephone. The company is to recruit an extra 110 staff to the Glasgow offices of its telephone sales operation, General Accident Direct, and increase spending on advertising. Direct insurers, which sell through media advertising and telephone sales, account for about 20 per cent of the motor insurance market, according to industry figures. GA's research, carried out by NOP, shows that 53 per cent of women and 63 per cent of men are happy to arrange insurance by telephone, indicating that the market share of direct writers and new telephone brokers could rise rapidly. A number of leading UK insurance companies have recently set up telephone operations, but the industry still depends on independent brokers and other retailers for many of its sales. Direct Line, the market leader, already insures more than 1.4m motorists, more than 7 per cent of the UK market, and is increasing its share of the home insurance market. 'We sense that the market is poised to go the same way in home as it has in motor,' said Ms Avril Scanlan, the manager of General Accident Direct, reporting a rise in the number of telephone enquiries for home insurance. Ms Scanlan said that after sharp price rises, home insurance had become a 'high-profile item on people's shopping lists'.</p>

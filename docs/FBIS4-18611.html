			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 6 (AFP) -- French Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur left here Wednesday [6 April] for China hoping  to set the seal on renewed friendly relations between the two  countries.    Balladur's visit comes three months after Paris and Beijing  finally made up following a row over French warplane sales to  Taiwan in 1992, which cost French firms hundreds of millions of  dollars in lost trade with China.    His three-day visit to Beijing starting Thursday -- the  first  by a French Government leader since 1978 -- is aimed at bringing  French companies back into the Chinese market.    Balladur said Tuesday it was in France's interest to have  close and friendly relations with China, which he said was one  of the world's great powers.    But he remained cagey in the run-up to his three-day visit  to  Beijing about whether he would raise the issue of human rights  with Chinese leaders, despite pressure from two French  humanitarian groups to do so.    Press rights campaign group Reporters sans Frontieres urged  Balladur to intervene on behalf of 24 imprisoned Chinese  journalists, and the Support Committee for the Tibetan People  called for help to suffering Tibetan and Chinese people.    Balladur, speaking Tuesday on French television, said France  could not remain indifferent to human rights issues but when  questioned he said he had no further comment on the arrest of  leading dissident Wei Jingsheng.    Balladur's visit is the latest in a line of visits by  Western  leaders renewing relations with Beijing after its violent  suppression of the pro-democracy movement in 1989.</p>

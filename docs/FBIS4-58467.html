			<p>BFN     [Text] London, May 3, IRNA -- A UK parliamentary group,  known to be actively involved in supporting anti-Iran  terrorists, renewed its campaign of smears against the Tehran  government Tuesday by trying to widen the offensive into an  international conspiracy.    In a letter to THE TIMES, president of the so-called  Parliamentary Human Rights Group, Lord Avebury, supported the  paper's call for a "tougher policy" against Iran but made no  mention of his links with mojahedin terrorists.    The close association of Lord Avebury and others, including  the London-based United Nations Association Director, Malcolm  Harper, in supporting the fomenting of anti-Iran terrorist  activities come as an embarrassment for the UK in making fresh  smears against Iran.    A new propaganda campaign was launched last week by Foreign  Office Minister, Douglas Hogg, claiming that the Iranian  intelligence service had connections with the IRA, who are  waging an armed struggle against British rule in Northern  Ireland.    Hogg himself has been accused by the friends and family of  human rights solicitor, Patrick Finucane, of being at least  partially responsible for the 1989 assassination of the Belfast  lawyer by loyalist terrorists.    One of the focuses of Lord Avebury has been to promote the  image of mojahedin terrorists and to present the Iraq-based  grouplet as a `legitimate' opposition movement under the banner  of `The National Council of Resistance of Iran.'    Last month, he was photographed by an MKO publication  meeting  one of its leaders, Maryam Rajavi, for two-hours at her  residence in France. He was quoted "praising" the policy of the  terrorist group.    In the same publication, a review was made of numerous armed  attacks and bombings carried out by the terrorist group in Iran  over the past year. The group has been responsible for hundreds  of innocent lives since failing to overturn the 1979 Islamic  revolution.    A report published by the so-called parliamentary human  rights group in March, entitled `The Tehran Murder Machine,'  like Amnesty International reports, is understood to be largely  based upon the propaganda disseminated by the terrorist group.    Lord Avebury's letter to THE TIMES Tuesday was also seen  containing many of the crudities of the MKO literature both in  language and in allegations.    Other political groups, including the Labor Party, which in  the past have supported the MKO, have generally distanced  themselves from their known associations with the terrorist  group, since its headquarters were moved to Baghdad in the late  1980.    Many MKO members are still harbored by the UK, and even  allowed to parade their literature that has included explicit  instructions on making bombs and explosives that apparently have  been ignored by the British campaign against terrorism.</p>

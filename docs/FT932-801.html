			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / International Company News: Abnormals boost net at BHP BHP, the Australian resources company, more than doubled net earnings for the year ended May, following strong contributions from all divisions and a hefty turnround for abnormal items. The company yesterday reported a 132 per cent increase in attributable profit, to ADollars 1.19bn (USDollars 804m), on an 11.5 per cent revenue lift to ADollars 16.7bn. The dividend is being held at 40.5 cents a share. The bulk of the earnings upturn came from abnormal items. In 1991-92, BHP wrote down the value of its investment in the Foster's Brewing group by ADollars 312m, but in the latest year it recorded a ADollars 203.8m tax benefit. Excluding abnormals, BHP reported a 19.8 per cent earnings rise to ADollars 991m. The results were helped by a weaker Australian dollar, which averaged USDollars 0.71 on BHP sales, compared with USDollars 0.77 in the previous year. The steel division emerged as the company's best profit improver, lifting profit before abnormals by 28 per cent to ADollars 242.5m. BHP said a full-year contribution from New Zealand Steel, higher domestic sales, and lower costs helped. The petroleum division lifted profit 21.1 per cent to ADollars 461.4m, reflecting higher production and lower exploration expenditure. The minerals division remained BHP's biggest absolute contributor, in spite of a marginal 3 per cent profit increase, to ADollars 672.9m. Record output helped to overcome lower prices, BHP said. The service companies lifted their profits contribution by almost 75 per cent to ADollars 75.8m, mainly reflecting increased dividends from the Foster's Brewing investment. The result followed an increase in depreciation provision, from ADollars 1.22bn to ADollars 1.38bn, largely resulting from full ownership of New Zealand Steel and the opening of several new operations. Interest expenses eased marginally, from ADollars 558.9m to ADollars 556.5m, and tax took ADollars 596m, against ADollars 738.7m previously.</p>

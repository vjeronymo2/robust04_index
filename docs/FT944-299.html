			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Macho managers are bad for health, say guidelines Employers should renounce the macho management style of the 1980s and attempt to understand their employees' feelings, according to official guidelines to be published early in the new year. The Health and Safety Executive says many employers need to pay more attention to their relationships with employees to prevent stress-related ailments in the workplace. The guidance is the first official health and safety advice to deal with occupational stress. 'In the 1980s in this country, many employers shared the unfortunate attitude that admitting to stress was admitting to a personal weakness,' says the HSE. 'But we all have a threshold - even the tough guys have a threshold which, when crossed, can become a negative factor. We want to promote the preventive approach through education. 'There are certain features in the workplace that can aggravate stress, such as noise and bad lighting. But a very important feature is having good communications and a sympathetic approach.' About 80m working days are lost every year because of stress, according to Department of Health figures published at the Confederation of British Industry conference last month. Mental health troubles, such as headaches, irritability and indecision, are estimated to cost the UK economy Pounds 3.7bn annually. The HSE guidance, mainly aimed at small to medium-sized businesses, comes after a former social worker last month successfully sued his employer for negligence over his heavy workload. Mr John Walker was the first person in the UK to win an action against his employers after his workload drove him to a nervous breakdown. Mr Walker is now seeking Pounds 200,000 damages from Northumberland County Council. Stress at work has risen alongside the fear of redundancy, according to a survey of 426 private and public sector companies. Research by the white-collar union MSF, published last week, showed that 43 per cent of employees feel poorly treated by their employers. The Institute of Personnel and Development recommends that managers develop an occupational health strategy to deal with stress. In a study to be published in February, the IPD advises employers to monitor stress levels and counsel employees to cope with their work-load. Mr Doug Gummery, policy adviser, said: 'Stress is a symptom of either a very unhealthy organisation or a healthy one going through a period of rapid change or growth, which must be managed properly if the organisation is going to come through.'

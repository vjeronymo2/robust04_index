			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Recovery continues at MS Intl RECOVERY continued at MS International, the Doncaster-based engineer, in the six months to October 31 with pre-tax profits of Pounds 250,000, against Pounds 175,000. Mr Michael Bell, chairman, said that the figures demonstrated that the company was 'firmly established on the recovery path'. Turnover was 8 per cent lower at Pounds 13.8m (Pounds 15m) reflecting the depressed economy. Earnings per share were 0.6p (0.4p) and the interim dividend is held at 1p. The company said that the defence-related industries had made an encouraging start to the year and there had been a marked improvement at MSI-Hughes. Net borrowings over the period fell from Pounds 782,000 to Pounds 203,000 in spite of making the penultimate payment of Pounds 500,000 to the purchaser of the Laurence Scott companies.</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JURORS HEAR TAPE OF WIFE ACCUSED OF KILLING  SPOUSE  </P> <P> Jurors on Wednesday heard a tape recording in which a Tarzana woman accused of  murdering her millionaire husband told police that she loved him, didn't mind  that he had a mistress and had no financial motive for killing him.  </P> <P> "I do not think you could find two people in the United States who . . . loved  each other more than my husband and I did," Carole Evelyn Mellinger told  detectives on Jan. 24, a few hours after fatally shooting her husband,  Brainerd, 69, in the den of their hillside home.  </P> <P> The tape was played for jurors in Van Nuys Superior Court.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Ann Korban, who introduced the tape during  cross-examination, contends that Carole Mellinger was angry because her husband  had been having an affair for 12 years and because she feared that his plans to  sell his business would decrease the value of his estate. Korban said she  played the tape to highlight inconsistencies in Mellinger's testimony.  Mellinger was expected to continue testifying today.  </P></p>

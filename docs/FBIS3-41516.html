			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhu Baoxia: ``State Gives Go-Ahead to </F> Green Foundation'']    [Text] The central government is to set up a foundation to  provide low-interest loans to major environmental projects, it  was announced yesterday.    The foundation is meant to be a stable source of  low-interest  finance to fight widespread pollution, with no extra burden on  the State budget, said Xie Zhenhua, director of the State  Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa).    Xie told an expert meeting in Beijing yesterday that the  country s environment had been deteriorating in all but a few  places for years.    One of the major factors in the growing problem has been a  lack of cash, Xie said.    In the 1980's, the State invested 64.7 billion yuan (about  $11.3 billion at the old exchange rate) on environmental  projects, 0.6 percent of gross domestic product over the decade.    Experts say at least 75 billion yuan ($8.6 billion at the  current exchange rate) more is needed in the next six years, if  the State is to contain worsening pollution.    Xie stressed the government should be just one source of  cash  and more channels must be found to guarantee quick, sustainable  environmental protection.    The repayable foundation system is one of the more feasible  and effective approaches to attract cash, he said.    It aims to provide cash mainly to industrial  pollution-control projects which will be repaid from the  resulting savings the factories make.    The foundation will be built with cash from the State  budget,  grants and loans from international organizations, foreign  governments and individuals and domestic donations.    Its draft programme being discussed at the expert meeting  which ends today suggests a national environmental protection  investment company be set up to organize fundraising and loans.    The company, which is subordinate to Sepa, will be  responsible for collecting funds, selecting projects and  supervising the use of loans.    Priority would be given to cross-province pollution control  and environmental projects outlined in international and  bilateral agreements.    The company will also invest in pollution-control projects  in  major State-owned enterprises to set an example for other  industries.    Xie said Sepa is set to start pilot environmental projects  in  21 provinces and cities, including Beijing, Guangzhou, Liaoning  and Heilongjiang.    The national environmental foundation programme was based on  an experiment first introduced five years ago in Shenyang, a  heavy industry city in Northeast China's Liaoning Province.    Shenyang, with over 5,000 industrial enterprises, has long  been one of the country's most seriously-polluted cities.    The Shenyang Environmental Protection Investment Company  (Sepic) has loaned 162 million yuan (over $28 million) to local  factories since 1988 to help technical renovation designed to  control industrial pollution.</p>

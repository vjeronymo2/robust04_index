			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Trade and the Environment: US speeds phasing out of CFCs PRESIDENT George Bush said yesterday the US will accelerate by five years the phasing out of substances depleting the earth's ozone layer, agencies report from Washington. International plans call for an end to production of ozone-damaging chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by the year 2000; Mr Bush said the US would complete this by 1995. He said the US was acting unilaterally but urged other nations to follow suit. The announcement comes a week after the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) released a study showing the protective ozone layer in the Northern Hemisphere was being destroyed more quickly than had been thought. The Nasa report said aircraft and satellite studies showed that chlorine monoxide, a chemical which destroys the ozone layer, reached record levels over parts of Canada, the US and Europe during some days in January. In some measurements the chemical was found to be as high as 1.5 parts per billion, a level that one scientist called 'alarming'. Mr Bush said current US production of ozone-depleting chemicals was already more than 40 per cent below levels allowed under the Montreal Protocol, the international agreement in which industrialised nations had pledged to halt production of CFCs by 2000. In the near term, Mr Bush called on US manufacturers to reduce production of CFCs to 50 per cent of 1986 levels by the end of this year. In a statement announcing Mr Bush's action, Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House press secretary, cited the recent studies indicating that CFCs are depleting the ozone layer more quickly than had been believed. 'The president announced that, with limited exceptions for essential uses and for serving certain existing equipment, all production of these substances in the United States will be eliminated by December 31, 1995.'</p>

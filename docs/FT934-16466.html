			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / The time has come to cut Japan down to size The Japanese stock market is posing one of its periodical challenges to the practice of setting performance benchmarks for international equity portfolios. Tokyo's market capitalisation has bounced back and is once more threatening to impose its own unrealistic values on global fund managers. Benchmarks are usually based upon stock market indices, and indeed the global stock market index series - such as the FT-Actuaries World Index - were constructed primarily with this purpose in mind. A fund manager's starting point can therefore be, say, the World ex-US Index, which he must track or beat. But once before, in the late 1980s, the Japanese bubble threatened this approach. At the peak in late 1989 the Tokyo market was worth 45 per cent of the world market capitalisation. What was worse, it amounted to more than 60 per cent of the global market outside the US, a degree of concentration which threatened to destroy the whole purpose of international diversification for US pension funds. A lesson was learned. If you follow the index-based approach too slavishly you can wind up overexposed to the overvalued markets and underexposed to the cheap ones. It was enough to encourage dabbling with alternative weighting schemes, such as GDP weights. But then, to everyone's relief, especially to that of western fund managers who were underweight in Tokyo, the Japanese bubble was deflated. By mid-1992 the Japanese market was down to a 24 per cent World Index capitalisation weighting. It was still a bit high for comfort, but was not wildly out of line with the Japanese share of GDP of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development area (about 20 per cent). Given that the Nikkei Dow Average is still at only just over half its peak level, there the matter might have rested. But in the past year a new bubble has blown up, this time involving the yen. Unhedged UK investors could have achieved a return of 60 per cent over the past year, in the unlikely event of matching the performance of the Tokyo index, and in sterling terms Tokyo is within 20 per cent of its end-1989 peak. Thus Tokyo has zoomed back, to represent nearly a third of the world market. To US eyes, it amounts to half of the non-US capitalisation. To be fully weighted could be dangerous, but to have been underweight in the past year has been agonising. None of this would matter much if Japanese companies were powering ahead. Then heavy investment in them might look sensible. But many are facing a currency shock that could prove disastrous and will certainly be uncomfortable. The average return on equity in manufacturing has collapsed to about 2 1/2 per cent, and the average p/e ratio for Tokyo stocks is no longer (as it was in the late 1980s) 40 or even 60 but more like 90. Here is how the problem appears to UK pension funds. A manager following a median benchmark will know that the typical exposure of his peer group funds to overseas equities is 24 per cent. Tokyo represents 35 per cent of the World ex-UK capitalisation. So about 8 1/2 per cent of his portfolio ought to be in Japanese equities. However, the actual exposure of UK pension funds is only half as much. They are strongly angled instead towards continental European equities where they have nearly 10 per cent of their portfolios compared with a 'neutral' 4 per cent. Our manager with a median benchmark can safely stay on half a full Tokyo weighting and not run much of a risk of performing very differently from his peers. If he had an index-based benchmark, he would be under greater pressure to adopt the full exposure. The new Tokyo problem is the result of curious circumstances. In theory, when a currency soars the domestic stock market will tumble because profitability is undermined. But Tokyo is underpinned by support from public pension funds. The optimists see a big jump in profits in 1995 as pay levels are cut and the Japanese corporate sector starts to shed surplus workers. It would require a revolution in employer-employee relationships. How this will work out is the subject of various opinions, but in the meantime those fund sponsors being pulled by benchmarks into heavy exposures to the Tokyo market are being braver than perhaps they realise.</p>

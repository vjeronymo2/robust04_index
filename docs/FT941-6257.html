			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Hunting in Argentina's bargain basement - International companies are finding strong takeover targets Mergers and acquisitions in Argentina once meant finding a local company to take over the business of a multinational fleeing the country's political and economic chaos. But a successfully-completed Dollars 20bn privatisation programme, rapid economic growth and pro-business government policies have put Argentina firmly back on the international business map. Recently there has been a rash of takeover announcements by foreign companies and more are expected. Procter and Gamble bought food giant Bunge y Born's 78 per cent stake in Compania Qumica, which makes detergents, for Dollars 52.5m. RJR Nabisco signed a letter of intent with the owners of biscuit-maker EM Terrabusi to buy out their controlling stake in the company, which has a market capitalisation of Dollars 280m. Chile's CNTI bought SAIAR, Argentina's leading maker of household water heaters, for an undisclosed amount. Chilean investors have become aggressive buyers of Argentine companies, buying into industries ranging from ceramics to large portions of the privatised electricity sector. In most cases, target companies are too small or badly-managed to survive alone in Argentina's liberalised market. Often they are family-owned businesses with succession difficulties, or face insurmountable financial or technological problems. Buyers are attracted by an economy expected to grow 5-6 per cent a year to the end of the decade. Furthermore, the performance of most local companies can be rapidly increased with strong management, capital and technology. The Exxel Group, a Buenos Aires-based buy-out company, has bought paper, soap and electricity companies and shows what strong management can achieve. Mr Juan Navarro, Exxel president, says that at one of his acquisitions, 'we cut overheads by 35-40 per cent, increased output by more than 60 per cent in six months and cut 10 per cent of the staff'. Multinationals usually look for branded mass consumption goods, with little debt, where they can add value rapidly. The food industry is a leading acquisition target. Argentina's pampas, those vast grasslands and wheat prairies, make it a large-volume, low-cost agricultural producer. As well as RJR Nabisco, food groups such as Nestle and Cadbury-Schweppes have been buying companies in Argentina recently. Results for the trailblazers have been impressive. In 1991, when US tobacco and food giant Philip Morris acquired Swiss chocolate maker Suchard, the Argentine subsidiaries of both companies came together just as the economy began an unexpected recovery. Mr James Stewart, Philip Morris's local general manager, says: 'We used the retained earnings from Suchard to finance (later) acquisition of an ice cream company and the Tang powdered drink company.' He says revenues from the food business have risen fivefold and income 8.5 times since 1991. The US investors who bought a bankrupt Pepsi bottler in 1989 have been even more successful. The investors, led by Mr Charles Beach, paid a nominal sum for the bottler Baesa, but invested more than Dollars 200m to build it into a company with listings in New York and Buenos Aires and a market capitalisation of Dollars 940m. Mr Beach had seen the potential of a market with rising incomes and repressed consumption. Argentines drink fewer soft drinks than consumers in other developing countries. Mr Rafael Farace, Baesa's finance director, said 'promotion, marketing, efficient production, innovation and distribution were the keys of our success'. Sales grew to Dollars 268.8m last year from Dollars 31.5m in 1990. Margins rose by a third to 41 per cent. Pepsico has awarded Baesa franchises in Chile, Uruguay, southern Brazil and southern Argentina, and helped finance the expansion by paying Dollars 35m for 26 per cent of Baesa. As well as food, attention has focused on the underdeveloped but highly promising financial services industry. The petrochemicals industry, until recently given up for dead, is showing signs of recovery. Argentina has a large number of small car parts companies, many of which are in need of consolidation and radical reorganisation. Inevitably, buyers arriving late at the party are having to pay higher prices for less attractive companies. Argentina has few companies that turn over more than Dollars 100m a year, and most are owned by families that usually surrender control only as a last resort. Putting a price on a company is hard at the best of times, especially as accounting standards are lax. Furthermore, rapid economic change makes past performance a poor guide to a company's value. Investment bankers say prices have more than doubled in three years to an average 10-15 times earnings. However, analysts believe British food and beverage group Cadbury-Schweppes has paid too much for Stani, a local sweet company it bought last October. Mr Stephen Ward, Cadbury's managing director for the Americas, will not disclose the price, but says Stani was a good buy: 'Stani gets high marks for leadership, management, with strong brands and a good position in the marketplace.' Despite rapid growth, Argentina, with a population of only 32.6m, is not a big market. However, international companies striving for a global market presence cannot ignore it. The growing pace of trade with Chile and economic integration with Brazil through the Mercosur customs union make the regional dimension increasingly important. Mr Ward says Stani is a 'stepping stone' for Cadbury's expansion in the region.</p>

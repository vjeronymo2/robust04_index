The line our population is defending is that of  finding solutions within socialism, within the social justice  and equality that the work of the Revolution guarantees.    Administrations at the level of centers, enterprises,  branches, and ministries made a noteworthy contribution to the  parliament in the workplace assemblies. In a majority of cases,  they provided serious information and elements that contributed  to the quality of the analyses made.    For its part, the workers movement is obliged to think about  how to get this method, this work style, to take permanent root  within its union organizations. The main thing is that  ideological influence, organizational work, or a thrust toward  defense or cultural development cannot even be conceived if the  unions do not participate in solving the economy's real problems.    There is no room for pessimism. What we are doing, including  these Parliament in the Workplace assemblies, is our own victory  alternative. An editorial carried in today's, 28 March, edition  of the weekly TRABAJADORES says the initial step has been taken.</p>

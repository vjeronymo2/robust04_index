			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Bundesbank will not follow the Fed's lead AMERICA'S money markets barely flinched in response to last week's congressional testimony by US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. His Humphrey-Hawkins report gave few new clues about when interest rates might rise, and long-term rates hardly moved. What was new, and potentially important, was Mr Greenspan's emphasis on real, inflation-adjusted, interest rates as an indicator of inflationary pressures. According to the Fed, the relationship between monetary aggregates, inflation and output appears to have broken down. It fears that slow growth in its favoured M2 broad money indicator may paint an overly sanguine picture of future inflationary trends. But Mr Greenspan did not explain how real interest rates will fill the gap. Real rates, he said, should not move too far from the long-term 'equilibrium rate' consistent with steady non-inflationary growth. He also noted that short-term rates, deflated by post consumer price inflation, have been close to zero for nine months, as the left-hand chart shows. But does this mean that short-term real rates are currently too low? And what is their long-run equilibrium level? Mr Greenspan left the markets guessing. Europe's money markets are, meanwhile, having similar difficulties guessing when the Bundesbank's next interest rate cut will arrive. Current parities in the exchange rate mechanism may not survive much longer without a substantial cut in German rates. The troubled state of German manufacturing industry, and an inverted yield curve, both argue for lower rates. But last week's news that German broad money grew by an annualised and seasonally adjusted rate of 7.1 per cent in June, taking it outside the bank's target range of 4.5-6.5 per cent for 1993, appears, for now, to rule out further cuts. The Bundesbank, unlike the Fed, has not publicly suggested that the relationship between broad money and inflation has broken down. Nor should it, according to Mr Thomas Mayer of Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt. Mr Mayer has re-estimated the Bundesbank's own monetary model to test the sagacity of its monetarist policy rules. He finds that, despite the monetary turbulence that has engulfed Germany since monetary unification in July 1990, the bank's old policy rule still holds: a one percentage point increase in money supply above that justified by long-run growth still leads to a one percentage point rise in the price level. Even if broad money growth falls to 6.5 per cent this year and 6 per cent in 1994, inflation will remain well above 3 per cent throughout next year, despite the bank's 2 1/2 per cent target. So should the Bundesbank ignore industry's complaints and raise interest rates, rather than cut them? The bank's problem is that it is battling to control aggregate inflation in an economy in which the non-traded and traded sectors are moving in very different directions. Monetary growth is accelerating because the government is borrowing from the banks to finance its budget deficit. High interest rates and harsh words from the Bundesbank have failed to stop this public profligacy, which in turn is fuelling non-traded price inflation: consumer prices rose, over the past year, by over 4 per cent. The Bundesbank's only option, short of abandoning its inflation objective, has therefore been to use high interest rates and a strong D-Mark to enforce a fierce offsetting credit squeeze on private industry. Not surprisingly, producer prices fell by 0.4 per cent in the year to June. Mr Greenspan's short-term real interest rates provide a powerful illustration of the Bundesbank's dilemma. The short-term real rate, based on consumer price inflation, has dropped sharply this year, as the right-hand charts shows. But the relevant real interest rate for industry - adjusted for producer price inflation - has barely fallen. If the Bundesbank cares about traded goods price inflation and the long-term health of German industry, then it should relieve its suffering by cutting interest rates now. But if the bank still believes in its monetarist analysis then it is hard to see how it can credibly do so.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Working Life: If you can stand the heat - Eating Out Eating in the kitchen usually evokes images of a rushed breakfast or childhood banishment from the dinner table. It's just the opposite, however, at Toronto's stately King Edward Hotel, part of the UK-owned Forte chain. Executive chef John Higgins has set aside a corner of the King Eddy's main kitchen for The Chef's Table, at which he serves a sumptuous seven-course dinner. But the Chef's Table is more than a gastronomic adventure, Higgins completes each dish and decorates the plates in front of his guests. In his thick Glaswegian accent, he introduces each course with an explanation of the ingredients and his reasons for choosing them. Guests are invited to stretch their legs between the sorbet and main course, with a guided tour of the kitchen. Don't expect the decor of an upscale restaurant. A Sterling Vineyards poster hangs incongruously from the door of a steel fridge. The white-tiled walls are filled with past guests' appreciative grafitti scrawled in gold marker pen. Conversation at the spacious, round table is occasionally interrupted by a loud bell at the nearby room-service station. Higgins decides on the menu, often just a few hours in advance of the meal. Wines (one for each course) are chosen by the hotel's restaurant manager Andrew Laliberte. He makes a point of including at least one selection from Ontario's fast-improving vineyards. One recent dinner began with smoked Atlantic salmon marinated in chopped ginger, and served on a mashed potato well filled with capers, seaweed and parsley. The second course was Quebec foie gras garnished with Ontario asparagus spears, followed by pan-seared portobello mushrooms with scallops escargots on a garlic tomato broth. The main course was spiced, roasted venison cutlet with grilled yams. Dessert consisted of a poached pear on a pool of strawberry and rhubarb glaze, decorated with crisp almond tuille. Higgins tries to tailor his menu to suit the group. On one recent occasion, when most of the guests were South Africans, he introduced an imaginative new flavour to gazpacho with biltong flakes. The table is often booked by companies eager to make an impression on customers or out-of-town visitors. Perhaps not surprisingly, recent appreciative diners have included senior managers from McDonald's, the hamburger group, and one of North America's biggest doughnut chains. The Chef's Table is available only for groups of six to ten. Advance reservations are essential. The cost is CDollars 100 per person, plus CDollars 50 or so for wine, depending on selection.

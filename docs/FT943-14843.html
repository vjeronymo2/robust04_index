			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Landmark ruling on SIB to buttress all regulators The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, cannot be sued for damages for disclosing restricted information obtained from private individuals, a High Court judge ruled yesterday in a sweeping judgment which will affect regulators all over Britain. The UK courts have never been asked to rule on a point of law about the remedies available to those who feel aggrieved by the way regulators carry out their duties. Mr David Mayhew, solicitor for Clifford Chance, the SIB's counsel, said the ruling will also buttress the Bank of England, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the Office of Fair Trading, among others. Afterwards, SIB officials expressed considerable satisfaction at the result. One said: 'This was about the propriety of the exercise of our powers. We have very strong powers to do things and this case was a test of whether we use them properly.' Mr Justice Lightman threw out the action seeking Pounds 7m in damages from the SIB in a case brought by Melton Medes, a trading conglomerate accused of breaching pension fund investment rules. The plaintiffs had argued that the SIB had disclosed 'restricted information' in violation of section 179 of the Financial Services Act to the pension scheme beneficiaries who are asking the company to restore a similar amount to the scheme. Had the scheme beneficiaries not obtained the information, they would not have pursued their case against Melton Medes for restitution to the scheme, they argued. In his ruling, Mr Lightman said the law clearly stated that individuals had no private right of action if they felt aggrieved. The intent of section 179 was to protect the special interests of informants and 'to control in the public interest the use of information acquired rather than to subject SIB in this respect to private law actions'. The only remedy open to Melton Medes is to seek a criminal prosecution of the SIB or a judicial review of its conduct. The judge denied the plaintiffs' request for leave to appeal his ruling and awarded indemnity costs to the SIB. Mr Lightman, in his ruling, also said Melton Medes had failed to prove its allegation that the SIB had disclosed restricted information. It had alerted pension scheme beneficiaries to the existence of information which could aid their case that existed elsewhere, but this did not constitute restricted information. He said that, if the SIB were unable to disclose non-restricted information, it could not carry out the purpose for which it had been created. Melton Medes ruling, Page 8</p>

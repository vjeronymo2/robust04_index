			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, at a meeting of </F> Afghan war veterans on the fifth anniversary of the conclusion  of the war, in the Kremlin Palace of Congresses in Moscow on 15  February -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Aleksandr Shkirando, master of ceremonies] The  first speaker, in accordance with military rank, will be Pavel  Sergeyevich Grachev, Russian Defense Minister and Hero of the  Soviet Union, who for many of those here is, above all, a  comrade-in-arms who gave over four years to the war in  Afghanistan.    Pavel Sergeyevich, a great deal has been said over the past  five years about the Afghan war. Many appraisals have been  made, mainly negative ones. But, you know, even we journalists  cannot speak confidently about the results and figures. After  all, it is a matter of concern to many that the numbers of our  losses, the numbers even of those who took part in the war, are  still unknown. Maybe today, after five years, you, as Defense  Minister, will lift that veil for us.    [Grachev] Yes, after five years, we shall lift the veil, at  last, from the tragedy that occurred several years ago.    Esteemed comrades and friends in battle. One of the most  dramatic pages in our history is now in the past -- a war that  lasted a long nine years and 51 days. A war that even today  does not allow our memories to rest and evokes pain in our  hearts.    Today's assessment of those events is well known. But no  matter who describes the Afghan war and how he describes it, our  casualties cannot be devalued, nor our wounds and illnesses, or  the grey hairs of our mothers and wives.    We Afghan veterans, and there are 545,000 of us, performed  our military duty honorably, and we are beyond reproach. The  servicemen in Afghanistan during that war were soldiers of whom  the vast majority did not spare themselves and displayed true  courage, heroism and loyalty to the military oath, to the  people, to the Motherland. Nearly 200,000 of them have been  decorated with Orders and medals; 76 became Heroes of the Soviet  Union, including 26 posthumously. Today their names are known  to the whole country.    It is not our fault that the army had to pay with its own  blood for the mistakes of the political leaders. So today, 15  February, we are marking the anniversary not of the withdrawal  of the troops, not of any jubilee. Today is a day of  recollection and a day of mourning for us. A total of 13,833 of  our comrades-in-arms did not return from the Afghan war. The  lamentable number of the overall losses in Afghanistan is also  well known -- 14,454 people. Eternal memory and glory to them,  the officers and men, generals, manual and office workers,  security men, MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] personnel,  advisers, doctors, nurses, and journalists. We shall remember  them, bowing our heads low, for as long as our hearts shall  beat. I call on you to honor the bright memory of those who  died with a minute's silence. [crowd rises and observes moment  of silence]    Please be seated. Friends in battle, Afghan veterans. We  paid a terrible price in that war. While carrying out combat  operations on the territory of Afghanistan, 23,258 people were  wounded, 26,798 people were injured, maimed or shocked, and over  400,000 suffered illnesses of varying degrees of severity --  mainly infectious ones. We have no right to forget that in  Russia alone 4,500 people maimed in Afghanistan live alongside  us. Over 7,000 people in Russia, Russian families, are in  mourning for sons, brothers or fathers. It is our sacred duty,  the sacred duty of Russia, to do everything possible so as not  to leave the mothers and widows of those who died, and the  orphaned children alone with their grief. I think that today we  are once again obliged to pose the questions of the social  protection, psychological and moral support of Afghan veterans  in society, with full regard for their acuteness.    Unfortunately, even today, someone is trying to depict the  Afghan veterans as a ruined, lost generation. Such statements  can only be made by people without honor or conscience. The  Afghan veterans do not expect handouts or charity from anyone.  Most of them have found a worthy place in society. They are  working, studying, bringing up children, helping their friends  in combat and, doing their utmost -- I'm not afraid to use a  lofty word -- to build up and to help to reconstruct the country.    But society must value them properly. It is necessary to  step up the efforts to search for our servicemen and bring them  home -- the prisoners of war, whose numbers are still put at  293. Practical, real business is essential in each specific  case and in each destiny.    I am addressing these words not just to the people of  Russia,  but also to the Afghan veterans who are today the citizens of  other Commonwealth states. They number 320,000. Today our  armed forces comprise some 30,000 officers and ensigns who trod  the fiery roads of Afghanistan. They are a particular class of  servicemen, and I want to give them a special mention. Today  the Afghan veterans form the real nucleus of the new Russian  Army. The armed forces are proud of them and draw on their  experience of life and combat. They bring into the teams of  servicemen a spirit of comradeship, mutual help and true service  to the Fatherland. Their role is extremely high in educational  and patriotic work and in dealing with welfare matters.    As for the Afghan veterans' movement as a whole, we see in  it  a healthy force aimed at strengthening morale and the combat  spirit of the army and navy, building up new armed forces,  uniting and regenerating Russia.    Dear Afghan veterans. Dear members of the families, near and  dear ones. I wish you on this day cheerfulness, optimism, joie  de vivre, good health and happiness - to you and those who are  close to you. Thank you.    [Shkirando] Thank you, Pavel Sergeyevich, The figures you  have given are higher than those that were known previously, and  it is, in general, surprising that it has taken five years to  establish at least that truth. But, clearly, it is the fate of  this war, as it is the fate of those who died there or who went  through the war, that we find out the truth only years later. I  personally am sure that this is not the whole truth either and  that it has not been stated in full.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Outright win seen for Menem Argentinians will re-elect President Carlos Menem next May without the need for a damaging second-round run-off, leaving the opposition vote divided among rival factions, according to an opinion poll published yesterday. The poll adds weight to an important victory earlier this month for the president's Peronist party in Buenos Aires province. Governor Eduardo Duhalde, the second force in Mr Menem's party, overwhelmingly won a plebiscite allowing him to seek re-election, strengthening the Peronists' claim that their policies still carry majority support. Yesterday's poll, published in the government-leaning La Nacion, showed the Peronists capturing 43.5 per cent of the vote, with the two main opposition forces, the centre-left Frente Grande and the Radical party, mustering only 20.7 and 18.9 per cent respectively.</p>

(Isa Slamet Sudarga),  deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, said  Indonesia hopes the Security Council will not only end such  atrocities against the Palestinians, but also make efforts to  find a peaceful and comprehensive solution to the Middle East  conflict.    Therefore, along with Palestine, Indonesia called on the  Security Council to take concrete actions to ensure that Israel  performs its duty to protect Palestinian citizens in accordance  with the Geneva Convention. Indonesia also fully supported the  resolution adopted by the Organization of Islamic Conference  which called on the UN Security Council to discuss the massacre  so as to end the Israeli oppression and safeguard the safety of  Palestinians through the presence of international observers.</p>

The demonstrators marched with slogan-boards reading "No to  `sanctions' against North Korea" and "Yes to peaceful solution  to nuclear issue."    On June 17, the organisations distributed a notice on the  schedule of the demonstration and a statement on the situation  under the title "Korean peninsula at crossroad of war or  peace--peaceful solution is way out."</p>

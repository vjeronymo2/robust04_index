			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Free-enterprise Marxists support mountain kingdom's monarchy Few parties with the name Marxist-Leninist have ever won a free election. But five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Nepal Communist party (United Marxist Leninist) has accomplished this rare feat. The communists are on the verge of forming a government after success in last week's general election. The red flag has been hoisted in a country with a constitutional monarch who held power until as late as 1990. Marx would have been impressed with how quickly Nepal has apparently moved from feudalism to socialism. Yet all is not quite as it seems in the mountain kingdom. Despite their ideologically correct name and the portraits of Marx and Lenin which adorn the party offices, the Nepali communists bear little resemblance to Bolsheviks. Almost the first thing Mr Man Mohan Adhikari, the party leader, did after his election victory was to call on King Birendra and pay his respects, telling him he had nothing to fear; the communist party would 'firmly support monarchy in Nepal as a symbol of unity' and 'pursue free-market economic policies'. The communists are much more nationalist than the purer forms of socialist doctrine would permit. Mr Adhikari made much on the campaign trail of the conservative Nepali Congress party government's allegedly close ties with India. But he is hardly the first communist to stoke the fires of patriotism. The party has to approach government with caution. With only 88 seats in the 205-member parliament, it plans to rule as a minority government. It will rely on tacit support from allies either in the Congress party or the right-wing royalist grouping, the Rastriya Prajantra party. The prospects seem uncertain. The election was called after arguments erupted within the party between the three at its head: Mr G. Koirala, 71, the former prime minister; Mr K. Bhattarai, party president, 70, and Mr Ganesh Man Singh, 80, party supremo. After decades of campaigns against royalist domination culminating in demonstrations that ended royal rule in 1990, the three men had trouble adjusting to running the government. By this summer, the country had had enough of the party's record of in-fighting and nepotism. So when Mr Koirala precipitated a general election, voters took the opportunity to vote his party out of office. Mr Adhikari, who at 72 is of the same generation as his Congress counterparts, started his political career in the Indian independence movement before moving to Nepal, where he spent several years in jail for his attacks on the monarchy. For years, his party was split between pro-Soviet and pro-China factions and received funds from North Korea. As late as 1989 it supported the coup against Mr Mikhail Gorbachev. But the international decline of communism and the advent of parliamentary politics in Nepal after 1990 prompted the party into some long-overdue revisionism from which it has emerged as more social democrat than socialist. A western diplomat in Kathmandu says: 'I think we could work with these people. They are not guerrillas.'</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMMIGRANT AID  </P> <P> In your article you discussed the new wave of Soviet immigrants coming to  settle in Los Angeles (Part I, Feb. 19). The nonprofit agency which I direct,  United Community and Housing Development Corp., has been actually involved in  placing both Soviet Jewish and Armenian immigrants in "on-the-job-training"  positions where they can transform their skills, background, and training to  the American way of being employed.  </P> <P> We also have offered "English as a second language," classes on a technical  level.  </P> <P> Both of these programs are funded through the Los Angeles Community Development  Department. Our new location for these services is 5455 Wilshire Blvd., Suite  2100, and the telephone number is (213) 936-6101.  </P> <P> STANLEY TREITEL  </P> <P> Executive Director  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

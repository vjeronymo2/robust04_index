			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Jean Burner] </F>   [Text] Vienna, Jan 19 (AFP) -- Several countries in East  Europe can expect to see fragile growth this year after five  years of recession, but unemployment will also rise, experts at  the WIIW economic research institute here said.    Poland, which in 1993 was the only country in the whole of  East Europe to achieve growth, of about four percent, should  continue to recover. Its gross domestic product (GDP) should  grow by 4.5 percent in 1994.    This performance should be followed by that of the Czech  Republic with growth of two percent and of Slovenia with one  percent.    However, experts have calculated that in Poland, despite the  growth, GDP at the end of 1993 was 14 percent below the figure  for 1989 which was the last year of state-direction of the  economy before the collapse of communism in East Europe.    Czech GDP was 25 percent below the figure in 1989.    Hungary, the favoured country for Western investment, would  again experience zero growth this year, but Slovakia, Romania  and Bulgaria would go through their fifth consecutive year of a  decline in GDP of about two percent.    But this would represent a sharp improvement from a decline  of about six percent in 1993.    The institute here was less optimistic about former members  of the Soviet Union, chief among them Russia and Ukraine. It  said that GDP in Russia would decline by seven percent and in  Ukaraine by 12 percent. In 1993 their GDP figures had fallen by  15 percent.    Most of the countries in East Europe would also improve  their  performances on inflation. The Czech Republic might reduce its  inflation rate from 21 percent to 11 percent, Poland from 39  percent to 28 percent, Slovenia from 30 percent to 20 percent  and Slovakia from 23 percent to 18 percent.    But in Hungary inflation would rise slightly from 24 percent  to 25 percent.    In the Balkans, it would fall to 55 percent in Bulgaria from  75 percent, and to 200 percent in Romania from 300 percent.    The main indicator weighing on the outlook was unemployment.  Privatisation, and increase in the number of bankruptcies and a  strengthing of corporate financial discipline, would increase  unemployment further despite a general improvement in the  economic situation.    Poland, leading the way to growth, would have an  unemployment  rate of 18 percent representing more than three million people,  at the end of 1994. Bulgaria, Slovenia and Slovakia would have  an average rate of about 18 percent. The rate of unemployment  in Hungary and Romania was likely to stabilise at about 12  percent.    The Czech Republic, owing to an ingenious system of early  retirement and strong growth in the private sector, should  achieve the best result with a rate of seven percent.    Another worrying aspct of these economies was the trade  deficit which appeared in 1993 and was likely to increase this  year, the economists said.    The institute said that it expected the overall deficit for  the seven countries to total 7.2 billion dollars from 6.8  billion dollars in 1993.    Hungary and Poland, which in 1992 had achieved spectacular  surpluses, would be the most affected. Hungary was likely to  report a deficit of 2.7 billion dollars and Poland of 1.9  billion dollars.    Exports to industrialised countries were likely to increase  slightly but imports would again rise strongly.</p>

The conferees discussed topics related to developing  and strengthening industrial cooperation between the two  countries, and drafting the necessary decisions and  recommendations that will then be referred to the Joint  Industrial Committee. [passage omitted]    In a statement to AL-THAWRAH, Nasri Khuri said: Today's  meeting of the technical subcommittees is one of a series of  meetings and contacts that these committees are holding to form  the framework of cooperation and coordination between the two  fraternal countries under the provisions of the Treaty of  Fraternity and Coordination and on the basis of the agreements  signed and ratified in accordance with the constitutional  procedures in both countries.    Several committees were formed under the provisions of the  Economic and Social Cooperation Agreement. These committees  are: The "Joint Industrial Committee," which in turn has formed  five technical subcommittees, which are holding their meeting  today; the "Joint Agricultural Committee," which held its  meeting earlier and agreed to establish a subcommittee for  marketing agricultural products, and which will hold its second  meeting on Saturday; the "Joint Electricity Committee," which is  scheduled to meet today, Sunday 13 February; the "Joint Water  Committee," which is discussing several matters relating to  joint waters and which has already held two meetings; the "Joint  Health Committee" and the "Joint Transport Committee," which  also held their meetings.    The Joint Economic Committee, which has prepared a general  idea of how to implement the Economic and Social Cooperation  Agreement, will hold its meeting in the middle of next month.    There is also a "Joint Tourism Committee," a "Communications  Committee," a "Committee for Facilitating Border Procedures,"  and a "Committee for facilitating Bases for Certificate of  Origin." We are now in the process of forming a "Joint  Committee for Labor and Social Affairs" and a permanent  committee for planning. All these committees are operating  under the supervision of the Higher Syrian-Lebanese Council and  they submit their results to the Economic and Social Cooperation  Agreement committee, which consists of all the competent and  concerned ministers from both sides in the two fraternal  countries, in order to make the necessary decisions on them  prior to submitting then to the Followup and Coordination  Commission.    We must point out here that within the framework of the  Treaty of Cooperation and Coordination between the fraternal  countries there is a "Joint Committee for Foreign Affairs," and  a "Joint Committee for Defense and Security." This is in  addition to the "Economic and Social Committee." These  specialized committees, which are stipulated in the treaty, will  begin holding their meetings in a periodic and organized manner  in the near future in order to put the provisions of the  cooperation and coordination agreement into practice and actual  implementation.</p>

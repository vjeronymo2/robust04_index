			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / International Company News: Incentive advances 45% to SKr395m in first half Incentive, the Swedish industrial and investment group controlled by the Wallenberg family, yesterday reported a 45 per cent increase in underlying first-half profits to SKr395m (Dollars 50.6m). The performance, reflecting improved market conditions and greater efficiency, was achieved on a 21 per cent rise in sales to SKr6.96bn. Mr Mikael Lilius, president, said all the group's businesses - embracing medical technology, power, construction, transport, materials handling and cameras - had contributed to the upturn, helped by healthy North American and Asian markets and a European market 'characterised by definite recovery'. Orders rose 63 per cent to SKr9.99bn while group companies 'continued to capture market share in most segments', he said. A shift in group strategy in the last three months has seen the emphasis move away from mature engineering business towards high-technology growth. Gambro, a medical equipment specialist with annual sales of SKr10bn, has been added to the group's business portfolio, while a 43 per cent stake in Esab, the world's leading supplier of welding equipment, has been sold to Charter, the UK industrial group. Incentive gained its majority shareholding in Gambro through a SKr8bn bid for Cardo, the investment group, which was finalised in June. Since then it has sold about SKr1.8bn worth of equities from Cardo's SKr2.7bn portfolio. The intention is to float what remains of Cardo when market volatility subsides. After including SKr1.4bn in proceeds from the Esab sale, Incentive has driven net debt down by SKr3.2bn from SKr12.1bn at the end of June. A SKr700m-SKr800m capital gain from the Esab disposal will be included in the company's second-half figures.</p>

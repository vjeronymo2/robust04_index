			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Muhammad 'Amirah in Jericho] </F>   [Text] Jericho Mayor Jamil Sabri Khalaf has tendered his  resignation to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat without  stating the reasons. Although President 'Arafat rejected the  resignation and asked Khalaf to remain in his post until general  elections are held next month, Khalaf has decided to stay at  home.    Lieutenant Colonel Munthir Irshayd, the Palestinian  Administration official in Jericho, who was appointed to this  position by 'Arafat after the implementation of the first phase  of self-rule, has denied Israeli media reports about the arrest  of the mayor.    In an exclusive statement to AL-DUSTUR, Irshayd said such  Israeli rumors are part of Israel's psychological warfare and  that the man (Khalaf) chose to stay at home without any coercion  or pressure.</p>

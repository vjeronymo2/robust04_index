			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Government given rough ride on the VAT see-saw Government hopes and fears see-sawed in the Commons last night on the eve of the crucial vote which will determine whether the increase in value added tax on domestic fuel from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent will have to be reconsidered. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, swept out of the chamber after hearing Mr David Sumberg, Conservative MP for Bury south, confirm that he will vote for reconsideration when the five-day Budget debate ends tonight. A succession of Tory MPs warned of the dangers of proceeding with the increase but Mr Sumberg was the only one to announce that he would vote for a Labour procedural motion to reopen the issue. Mr Sumberg suggested that VAT on domestic fuel could be kept at 8 per cent by forgoing some of the income tax cuts planned for the future, or through new tax measures. He said he would vote for Labour's procedural motion because it would give the country, the House and, most important, the government the chance to think again. Mr William Powell, Conservative MP for Corby, said he had still to make up his mind on whether to vote against the government. He recognised that his constituents shared his hatred for the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel although he did not believe that a further period of uncertainty, which a government defeat would bring, would be in their interests. Sir Rhodes Boyson, the former minister and Conservative MP for Brent North, described VAT on domestic fuel as a 'bad tax' which might prove as unpopular as the abandoned poll tax. Meanwhile, shadow chancellor Mr Gordon Brown, campaigning in the Dudley West by-election, highlighted a ministerial move to extend VAT to transport relating to entertainment, recreational activities and car parking at airports. This received little publicity when it was announced last week, although Labour estimates it will raise Pounds 45m. While the measure does not affect the VAT zero-rating of public transport in general, Labour believes it is 'the thin end of the wedge'. 'For the first time it introduces the principle of VAT on transport,' Mr Brown said.</p>

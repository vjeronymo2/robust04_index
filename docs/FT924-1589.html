			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Beyond the recession WHEN OECD countries are suffering from slow growth or outright recession, prophets of doom gain an all too attentive audience. It is precisely at times like these, when pessimism is so easy to find, that the more optimistic alternative perspective must be remembered: the recession will end; when at last it does, prospects for sustained economic growth are excellent. The OECD's latest Economic Outlook argues that there are three primary reasons for the recession and the unexpectedly weak recovery. In the US, Japan, the UK and a number of other countries, the principal problem has been the need to adjust to the rise in private indebtedness of the 1980s. In continental Europe, the difficulty has been high real interest rates, which have been largely the result of German unification; and, finally, job losses have fallen more widely across OECD economies, notably in services, and look likely to be more permanent than in previous recessions. This understanding has come with hindsight. Of foresight there has been too little. There has, in fact, been a consistent tendency to underestimate the recessionary forces. For this reason the OECD's analysis of the risks must be taken seriously. The greatest danger is that the recessions in Japan and Germany, both still at a relatively early stage, will prove deeper and more prolonged than most forecasters expect. That is not a comfortable prospect, but also not the end of the world. The recovery under way in the US suggests that there is life after debt, even if  -as Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, argues - past sins may condemn an economy to a long time in purgatory before it gets there. When recovery arrives, there is also much to suggest reasonably good long-term prospects. OECD inflation is running at only around 3 per cent. Unemployment may still be rising, but at the same time 'the gaps between real wages and productivity levels which opened up in the 1970s and were often cited as a leading cause of rising unemployment in Europe, have now largely disappeared'. Above all, parts of the developing world are showing self-sustaining economic dynamism. In 1992, growth in the dynamic east Asian economies - Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia - is estimated to have slowed by 1 percentage point. But it was still 6 1/2 per cent. China's economy is expected to grow by 11 per cent, while growth in Argentina and Chile should exceed 7 per cent. The World Bank concludes, in its latest World Debt Tables, that 'for the commercial banks and some of their middle-income borrowers, the debt crisis that began 10 years ago is largely over'. There are, for example, huge flows of portfolio capital to developing countries, the gross amount rising from Dollars 7.6bn in 1989 to Dollars 27.2bn in 1992 - more than half of it to Latin America and the Caribbean. A new world is growing up around the OECD countries, one of new opportunities and new challenges. The task for the OECD will be to maintain and, indeed, enhance global co-operation. As the countries of east Asia, eastern Europe and Latin America advance, they need to be brought into the circle of co-operation and consultation that the OECD itself uniquely provides. The OECD should be defined as the grouping of advanced economies, wherever they are located. Japan's membership has already shown the way. Others must follow.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Five members of the Zapatist National Liberation  Army [EZLN] were killed in a clash with cattlemen in Comitan,  Chiapas. In San Cristobal de las Casas, EZLN forces demanded the  release of 21 civilians accused of being EZLN members from Cerro  Hueco Prison. Patricial Serrano filed this report:    [Serrano] Five EZLN members were killed during three clashes  in Comitan Municipality, Chiapas States. The incidents occurred  when EZLN members trespassed on the ranchers' properties to  rustle cattle. The ranchers reacted immediately to save their  property and the lives of their families.    Upon being informed of these events, Subcommander Marcos  confirmed from an undisclosed location in Lacandon jungle that  indeed two [number as heard] EZLN supporters were killed in  clashes with ranchers.    Meanwhile in San Cristobal de las Casas, the EZLN demanded  the release of 21 civilians from El Cerezo de Cerro Hueco Prison  who were arrested on suspicion of being EZLN members. From that  place, Subcommander Marcos also said that keeping these innocent  individuals in jail is an obstacle to peace talks with the  federal government. Marcos stated that the indiscriminate  arrest of civilians on unfounded charges that they are members  of the EZLN is an arbitrary action.    Ceremonies, parades, marches, and festivities were held in  Chiapas on Sunday to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the  death of revolutionary leader Emiliano Zapata.</p>

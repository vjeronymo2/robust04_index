			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Prime Minister Hussein Moussavi said that Iran is nearing military  self-sufficiency by building an advanced fighter plane and maintaining its  aging U.S.-built F-4 and F-5 fighters, Tehran Television reported. Moussavi  reportedly made the comment after inspecting Iranian air force facilities, but  the televised report, monitored in Cyprus, showed footage of only one  single-propeller trainer said to be locally built. He also said that Iran is  now able to repair its U.S.-made Hawk surface-to-air missiles without outside  help. Moussavi added that an Iranian-made passenger plane has been tested  successfully and could be used for flights between smaller provincial cities.  </P></p>

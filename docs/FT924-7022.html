			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (8): Eyes on consumers - Profile of Citicorp KOREANS can spend years cultivating relationships with their bank managers in the hope of eventually being able to borrow enough to buy a home. Korean banks prefer lending to the big industrial conglomerates dominating the Korean economy than to the ordinary consumer. Hence Citibank's decision to break into the consumer banking market. One of the few foreign banks to have set its sights on the retail business in Korea, after five years it has 12 branches in Seoul and Pusan, the second largest city, and has won a reputation for good service by keeping a relatively high proportion of account managers to customers. 'The business opportunities here are fabulous,' says Mr Howard Greene, Citicorp's country head of global consumer banking in Korea. Citicorp has been successful because it has focused on products which domestic banks failed to develop. In the mortgage business, Korean banks tend to advance up to Dollars 40,000 (about Won30m). Some of the more paternalistic employers - for example Posco, the iron and steel group - help their employees own a home by lending them money at a lower interest rate. But for many Koreans, the only way to scrape together enough is through a kye, an unregulated credit association run by relations and family friends who pool their money. Citibank said it would lend up to Dollars 200,000 for a mortgage, provided the borrower met its creditworthiness criteria. The US bank is now experimenting with drive-in automated teller machines, having spent months persuading the authorities to let it set up 24-hour touch-screen ATMs. Next year, it plans to overhaul its day-to-day banking products and services in what is still a predominantly cash society. Citicorp says it is targeting upper-middle class customers rather than those described by bankers as 'high net worth individuals'. Already, it is making a small profit on its retail operations: this year it expects to make Dollars 4m, with a further Dollars 9m in 1993, compared with a loss of Dollars 3m five years ago. It has set it sights on capturing between 2 and 3 per cent of the retail banking market. But even that tiny portion has worried some of the Korean banks who resent the competition in their own backyard.  --------------------------------------------------------------                 MARKET SHARE OF FOREIGN BANKS (%)  --------------------------------------------------------------                      1986   1987   1988   1989   1990   1991  -------------------------------------------------------------- Deposits              1.6    1.5    1.0    1.1    1.6    1.9 Won                   1.4    1.3    1.0    1.0    1.6    1.7 Foreign currency      6.0    3.2    1.1    2.5    2.3    4.2 Loans                10.9   10.2    8.5    6.8    6.0    6.5 Won                   5.9    5.8    5.6    4.5    4.2    4.8 Foreign currency     63.3   44.6   34.1   28.3   22.9   21.0 Total assets         10.8   10.5    9.4    8.7    8.1    5.8  -------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Bank of Korea  --------------------------------------------------------------</p>

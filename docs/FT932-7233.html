			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Spain's new challenges WHOEVER FORMS Spain's government after the general election on June 6 will need to face up to uncomfortable realities about the country's economic structure and its place in Europe. Mr Felipe Gonzalez's Socialist government has fervently desired full Spanish participation in greater European economic integration. Yet he has failed to put into effect the measures needed to ensure this aim. The time of reckoning has arrived. Mr Gonzalez, in power since 1982, starts the election campaign more or less level pegging in the polls against his conservative opponent, the untried Mr Jose Maria Aznar. Given that the prime minister presides over an economy in recession and a party weakened by factionalism and allegations of corruption, this is not a bad position for him. The country's budget deficit and large current account deficit, however, along with the latest official unemployment rate of 21.7 per cent, underscore that Mr Gonzalez has been unable to make use of previous years of buoyancy in the Spanish economy to solve some basic economic problems. Mr Aznar, for his part, has succeeded in modernising his Partido Popular and moving it towards the political centre. But the lack of detail in Mr Aznar's prescriptions has added to the difficulty of seeing his party as a credible alternative to the Socialists. Peseta devaluation With the left in disarray in every large European country, it is not surprising that Mr Gonzalez has lost some of his panache. Most strikingly, the three devaluations of the peseta since September illustrate the gap between the prime minister's rhetoric and the real world outside the Moncloa Palace. Spain has to come to terms not only with the short-term problems engendered by the European slowdown, but also with the longer term challenge of life in a wider Europe. The eastward shift in the continent's centre of gravity has brought new competition from former communist countries where wages are roughly one-fifth of Spanish levels. Unless Spain adapts to these circumstances, its ability to attract grants and investment from the rest of the EC will be badly constrained. The latest devaluation of the peseta on May 13 was a setback for Mr Gonzalez and his finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga. However, after several years with an over-valued currency, the overall fall of 15 per cent in the exchange rate against the D-Mark since autumn gives Spain the chance to bring its economy into better balance. Fresh priorities The goal to which the country aspires - economic and monetary union by the end of the century - has become less feasible even for the stronger EC economies, let alone Spain. If Spain now realises that it is unlikely to be among the first group of EC members that go ahead with Emu, this should be construed not as a failure, but as an opportunity. Above all, Spain should reverse its order of priorities. Its most pressing task is to construct and enact policies to correct flaws in the domestic economy and make Spain more competitive. The time to worry about participation in Emu will come after these policies are in place, and showing positive results. Because of the size of the unregistered economy, the official figures overstate the true level of unemployment. None the less, the recorded level of 3.3m represents a startling waste of resources in one of the EC's poorest countries. To realise its undoubted potential, Spain needs to make room for private-sector job creation. Crucial to this aim are measures to restructure and privatise public sector industry, to control public spending more effectively, and to make labour markets more flexible. Two measures long sought by employers, which Mr Solchaga has failed to push through because of party and trade union opposition, are particularly necessary: the ending of administrative controls over layoffs, and the break-up of rigid centralised wage bargaining. Unless Spain makes adjustments of this kind, it will have little chance of leaving the economic periphery and climbing into Europe's premier league. Voters do not yet seem fully convinced of the need for a change in priorities. As the election campaign gets under way, the politicians' task now is to show it is essential.</p>

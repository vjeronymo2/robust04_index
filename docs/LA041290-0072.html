			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EASTER IN GREECE;  </P> <P> AFTER 20 YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES, A NATIVE ATHENIAN STILL RECALLS -- AND  RECREATES -- THE HOLIDAY FEASTS OF IS HOMELAND.  </P> <P> The Eastern Orthodox Church celebrates Easter on the Sunday following the first  full moon after the vernal equinox -- and always after Passover. Seldom does  this Easter coincide with the Western Christendom holy day, but this year is an  exception. On Sunday, Easter will be observed by the entire Christian world.  </P> <P> Also known as the Greek Orthodox church, the Eastern Orthodox ecclesiastical  communion was formed when 15 Christian sects separated from the Roman Catholic  church before the Reformation. Today 3% of all Christians are Eastern Orthodox,  according to the Encyclopaedia Britannica.  </P> <P> Easter has been commemorated in Greece with worship and feasting for many  centuries and has become one of the country's most important holidays. The  celebration begins with an after-midnight dinner and continues with a  traditional feast later in the day.  </P> <P> Memories of these sumptuous meals remain vivid for native Athenian Cosmos  Kapantzos, though he has lived in the United States for more than 20 years. He  and and his wife, Diane, enjoy preparing the traditional feast to share with  family and friends.  </P> <P> And while many homes in the Southland may not be equipped to refrigerate and  roast a whole lamb, a leg or saddle of the meat may be substituted. With the  exception of kokoretsi, an appetizer prepared from ingredients not easily found  in Southern California, this Greek menu may be duplicated in a standard kitchen  with a day or two of preparation.  </P> <P> For Kapantzos, however, the task began weeks ago when he personally selected a  12- to 15-pound lamb at a small farm in Fontana. The lamb will be butchered  today, and Kapantzos will pick up the meat and store it in the walk-in  refrigerator at his Astro Burger restaurant in Hollywood until Easter morning.  </P> <P> On the day before Easter, Kapantzos will stud the lamb from the inside with  garlic and rub the internal cavity with Cavender's all-purpose Greek seasoning  -- a blend of salt, black pepper, cornstarch, garlic, monosodium glutamate,  oregano, beef flavor base, parsley and five other spices.  </P> <P> Next the lamb must be placed on a spit. "This is tricky," Kapantzos said. "The  cavity is first sewn together and then the carcass is wired to the spit in  several places to hold it steady during rotisserie cooking."  </P> <P> Once the lamb is firmly attached to the spit, it is studded around the legs  with more garlic and the whole body is rubbed with the spice mixture, Kapantzos  explained. The meat is then wrapped and stored in the refrigerator.  </P> <P> The same day, Kapantzos will also begin preparation of the kokoretsi, an  appetizer made of lamb organ meats that are spiced and skewered onto another  spit, then wrapped in the cleaned intestines. He said it takes about half a day  to prepare this delicacy, which also is seasoned with the Greek spice blend.  </P> <P> A few of the organ meats from the lamb are reserved to prepare mageritsa soup,  which will be served for an Anastasi (Resurrection) dinner that breaks the  Lenten fasting. This traditional dish is seasoned with fresh dill and  avgolemono, an egg-and-lemon sauce.  </P> <P> The actual celebration begins with Resurrection Mass on Easter eve. At  midnight, one candle, symbolizing the resurrected Christ, is lit by a priest in  the darkened church. This flame is then passed to light individual candles held  by each member of the congregation, until the entire church is aglow.  </P> <P> Parishioners leave the church and return home, carefully carrying their lighted  candles. The head of the house enters first and makes a sign of the cross  overhead on the door's threshold before extinguishing the candle.  </P> <P> Bowls of warm mageritsa soup are served, accompanied by bread and wine. During  this meal that breaks the Lenten fast, diners tap red-dyed eggs end to end  while greeting one another with "Christos anesti" ("Christ is risen") and  "Alithos anesti" ("Indeed He is risen").  </P> <P> The eggs are hard-cooked before being dyed for use in this traditional game.  The object is to tap one's egg against everyone else's without breaking it to  be assured of good luck for the coming year.  </P> <P> After the Anastasi dinner family members go to bed for a few hours sleep.  Kapantzos, however, must be up at 5 a.m. and on his way to the restaurant to  bring back the lamb and kokoretsi.  </P> <P> About 7:30 a.m. he lights the initial charcoal for cooking the appetizer and  meat. Coals must be added throughout the rotisserie roasting, which will use  about 30 pounds.  </P> <P> "In Greece the spit often is still turned by hand," Kapantzos said, "with those  attending the feast each taking a turn." He has lightened this task, however,  with an electric-powdered rotisserie, modified to hold an additional spit for  the kokoretsi.  </P> <P> The lamb is cooked by indirect heat. Coals are spread in troughs along each  side of the grill, and there is a drip pan under the meat. The kokoretsi is  cooked by direct heat over one of the troughs.  </P> <P> It takes at least four hours to cook the kokoretsi; a little longer for the  lamb, depending on the heat of the coals. A brush made of fresh herbs --  oregano, parsley, dill and mint -- is used to baste both with a mixture of  lemon juice, oil and Greek spices throughout roasting, whenever either appears  dry.  </P> <P> Guests arriving during the afternoon nibble on an assortment of appetizers:  spinach- (spanakopitas) or cheese-filled (tiropitas) filo dough triangles; feta  and kasseri cheeses; dolmades (stuffed grape leaves); olives; green onions;  radishes, and bread. Ouzo, an anise-flavored Greek cordial, is sipped by  adults.  </P> <P> After the kokoretsi is cooked, it's sliced from the spit and served as an  additional hot appetizer.  </P> <P> Finally, the lamb is ready for serving. Guests gather around to watch the  carving and sample the crisp skin before taking some of the moist,  mild-flavored meat.  </P> <P> To accompany the lamb, there are Oven-Roast Potatoes, Peas With Dill, and a  creamy sauce ofyogurt, grated cucumber and garlic called tzatsiki. A salad of  greens, black olives and feta cheese -- sprinkled with olive oil, vinegar and  oregano -- and Greek bread (plain or sesame) or sourdough round out the buffet.  Resina, a resin-flavored wine, is the traditional beverage.  </P> <P> Later there are desserts -- Galactoboureko, a custard and filo pastry;  koulourakia, buttery twist cookies that can be baked at home but are also  available at Greek markets, and an egg-studded bread called tsoureki. Strong  Greek coffee is the accompaniment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Food styling by Minnie Bernardino and Donna Deane  </P> <P> RELATED STORY: H30  </P> <P> Directions for making traditional baked filo appetizers.  </P> <P> GREEK EASTER MENU  </P> <P> ANASTASI DINNER  </P> <P> Mayeritsa  </P> <P> Bread  </P> <P> Red Eggs  </P> <P> Koulourakia  </P> <P> Wine  </P> <P> EASTER FEAST  </P> <P> Appetizers  </P> <P> Kokkoretsi  </P> <P> Tiropitas -- Spanakopitas  </P> <P> Feta and Kasseri Cheeses  </P> <P> Dolmathes  </P> <P> Olives, Green Onions, Radishes  </P> <P> Bread  </P> <P> Ouzo  </P> <P> DINNER  </P> <P> Roast Lamb  </P> <P> Oven-Roast Potatoes  </P> <P> Greek Salad  </P> <P> Peas With Dill  </P> <P> Tzatsiki Sauce  </P> <P> Wine  </P> <P> DESSERT  </P> <P> Galactoboureko  </P> <P> Tsoureki  </P> <P> Red Eggs  </P> <P> Koulourakia  </P> <P> Greek Coffee  </P> <P> </P> <P> MAYERITSA  </P> <P> (Easter Soup)  </P> <P> 3 to 4 lamb neck or shank bones  </P> <P> 1 cup coarsely chopped carrots  </P> <P> 1 cup coarsely chopped celery  </P> <P> 1 medium onion, coarsely chopped  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons butter or margarine  </P> <P> 1 bunch green onions, finely chopped  </P> <P> 1 cup finely chopped parsley  </P> <P> 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh dill  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons flour  </P> <P> 1/2 cup rice  </P> <P> Avgolemono Sauce  </P> <P> Place bones, carrots, celery and onion in 6-quart sauce pot.

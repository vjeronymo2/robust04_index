			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Poor relation bites back / A look at a friendly society's unprecedented move to swallow a life office Friendly societies are not usually associated with aggressive tactics. This week, however, a friendly society announced plans to take over a life office  -the first time this has happened. Family Assurance, the third-largest friendly society in the UK, said it intended to pay out Pounds 1.75m for Templeton Life Assurance, which is part of the Templeton Marketing Group. The society wants to expand its pensions business and Templeton Life, which has Pounds 230m under management, markets and underwrites life assurance and pension policies. Members of Family Assurance are being called to a special general meeting on May 26 and, if they agree to the takeover, the acquisition will take place on July 1 so long as there is final approval from the Friendly Societies Commission. Friendly societies flourished in the 19th century, before the introduction of state benefits. Their aim was to provide self-help and sickness aid to artisans, workers and their families. In recent decades, however, the societies have come to be regarded as poor cousins of the large insurance companies. Their best-known product is the 10-year, tax-exempt savings plan where interest in the fund rolls up gross of tax. But in return for tax exemption, the government has capped the maximum contribution into these policies at Pounds 200 a year, or Pounds 18 a month. Given the competition from unit and investment trusts and the life offices, friendly societies looked like facing a slow death until the Friendly Societies Act of 1992 threw them a lifeline. This allowed them to incorporate - in other words, to set up subsidiaries through which they could offer financial products such as personal equity plans, unit trusts and general insurance. It is this act which has made it possible for Family Assurance to launch its take-over. This might be good news for friendly societies but is it good for consumers? What can the societies offer that organisations more experienced in providing these financial products do not? Societies argue that, since they are owned by their members, they can meet the needs of their policyholders and remain efficient without having to worry about profit-hungry shareholders. Although they do not have the track record of established life and unit trust companies, they say they can offer competition in a market which, although well populated, still needs it. Certainly, they do offer an alternative to those wishing to make small regular savings. It would be difficult to find a unit or investment trust allowing a minimum monthly payment of less than Pounds 20 - often it is Pounds 50. But most friendly societies set a minimum of only Pounds 9. You might expect the returns from the tax-exempt policies to be much higher than the alternatives, but the costs of adminstering schemes with such low premiums bites into the returns. Tunbridge Wells Equitable - which came out well in a recent survey in Money Management - the FT's sister publication - says the maturity value based on Pounds 18 a month in its 10-year tax-exempt with-profits policies is Pounds 2,410 if the fund earns 6 per cent, and Pounds 3,220 if it earns 12 per cent. The corresponding figures for its taxable with-profits policies are only slightly lower at Pounds 2,400 and Pounds 3,080. If you were to pay Pounds 18 a month into a Halifax account, you would get Pounds 2,626 after 10 years at present interest rates. The surrender value of the tax-exempt policy after five years would be Pounds 980, whereas Pounds 18 a month into the government's five-year, save-as-you earn scheme, described last week, would pay Pounds 1,332.</p>

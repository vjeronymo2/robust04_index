			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Clarification by the Party of Democratic Kampuchea </F> Delegation Attending the Roundtable Commission Meeting"; dated  15 June -- read by announcer]    [Text] 15 June 1994    I. On 27 May 1994 at the roundtable meeting of Cambodian  leaders in Pyongyang under the lofty chairmanship of His Majesty  King Norodom Sihanouk, His Excellency [H.E.] Khieu Samphan, on  behalf of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK], suggested  that the meeting discuss and agree upon a minimal policy program  to be used as a political basis for national reconciliation.    In this spirit H.E. Khieu Samphan said in parts seven and  nine of his address:    To achieve genuine national reconciliation and to rally  national forces in accordance with the will of our nation and  people, all of us should compromise and make mutual concessions.  This is the issue to be discussed now and later on. As His  Majesty the King has repeatedly stated: How should the PDK be  included into a national government and into a national army,  which includes all Cambodian sides? Furthermore, in a situation  in which there is a national government and a national army  including all Cambodian sides, how should the PDK hand over  zones under its control to the national government and merge its  troops with the national army?    To solve these problems, we should set up a minimal policy  program that all of us agree upon in order to establish a  national government and a national army that includes all sides.  We should have such a minimal policy program so that all of us  can stand on a concrete basis of consensus while we are working  on national reconciliation and also later when the national  government and the national army start doing their work.    II. The PDK holds that there should be a minimal policy  program agreed upon and set up by all parties to be used as a  necessary basis on which all national forces can rally and  cooperate. Without a minimal policy program agreed upon and  accepted by everyone as a basis for all, all sides will continue  in their respective political directions, which are different or  even contradictory. This way, national reconciliation cannot be  achieved. Experiences from ancient and modern history, at home  and abroad, have clearly testified to this. Even experiences  following the September 1993 election are already clear enough.    III. It is obvious that this minimal policy program should  be set up in accordance with the essence and spirit of the joint  communique of the roundtable meeting in Pyongyang on 28 May  1994, part two, which says:    The roundtable meeting unanimously agreed on its constant  loyalty to, support and defense of a unified Cambodia without  partition of territory, without secession, and with its  territorial integrity, with the land and maritime borders and  waters that the international community recognized and respected  between 1963 and 1969, and with respect for Cambodia's ideals of  peace, solidarity, national union, independence, and progress.    The essence of articles 2 and 52 of the Constitution is also  clear. Article 2 says:    The territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia can in  no way be violated within its borders as set out in 1:100,000  maps made between 1933 and 1953, and which were internationally  recognized between 1963 and 1969.    Article 52 says: The Royal Government of Cambodia pledges to  defend the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity  of the Kingdom of Cambodia and to implement a policy of national  reconciliation to defend national union and preserve the  nation's good traditions and customs. The Royal Government of  Cambodia shall defend its legitimacy and ensure public order and  security. The state gives priority to the living standards and  well being of its citizens.    The essence of the king's address on 31 October 1993 is  clear. The magic medicine to cure our Cambodia's serious  sickness is nothing else but national reconciliation, national  union, an awakening, and the resolution of all nationalists to  achieve the sacred national union, the way our nation did in the  Angkor era, and more recently during the royal crusade for  Cambodia's full independence in 1952-1953.    The aspiration of the entire Cambodian nation and people is  national reconciliation and peace. This is the political  essence that should be taken into account in setting up a  minimal policy program.    IV. How the details of the minimal policy program should be  worked out is up to all sides to discuss. This minimal policy  program, once agreed upon by everyone, must be strictly observed  by all Cambodian sides. Foreigners too have to abide by this  minimal policy program.    As H.E. Khieu Samphan has pointed out in his address at the  27 May 1994 roundtable talks, for decades the succession of  problems affecting Cambodia were not created by Cambodians.  These problems were the result of direct foreign interference  and aggression. People are aware of the disastrous  consequences. Although these are the roots of the Cambodian  problem, as long as Cambodians do their best they will be able  to solve the problem. Such action is a response to the request  and profound aspiration of the entire Cambodian nation and  people, who want to see unity among all national forces --  forces that are genuinely reconciled and united without any  political discrimination whatsoever.    V. The PDK proposal for all Cambodians sides to agree with  one another on a minimal policy program in line with the above  spirit reflects the PDK's responsible spirit and its sincere  desire to achieve genuine and lasting national reconciliation in  accordance with the profound aspiration of our nation and people  so that we have peace and live normally and have a chance to  quickly rebuild Cambodia.    The PDK is striving to work to achieve national  reconciliation so that there are enough national forces working  together to continue solve the nation's problems, both large and  small. This is in order for our Cambodia to gradually move  toward peace, independence, national union, sovereignty, and  territorial integrity. The PDK has no other objectives than  these.</p>

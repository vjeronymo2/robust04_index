			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RANDY LEWIS: THE NIGHT SAMMY DAVIS JR. OVERSHADOWED OL' BLUE EYES  </P> <P> Sammy Davis Jr. was one of those famous folks whose celebrity overshadowed his  talents, especially during the last half of his life when his  cigarette-puffing, head-swaggering manner had become its own parody.  </P> <P> I have to confess to being among those who always figured Davis would go down  in entertainment history -- if he went down at all -- as a crony of Frank  Sinatra and Dean Martin, rather than for anything he had accomplished on his  own as a song and dance man.  </P> <P> It wasn't until I saw him at the Pacific Amphitheatre in 1987, when he was  sharing a bill with his Rat Pack pal Frankie, that I caught a real glimpse of  why Davis had earned and not just befriended his way onto the showbiz Mt.  Olympus.  </P> <P> Before that night, I, probably like most of my post-World War II peers, had my  opinion of Davis shaped through his talk show and telethon gigs, not to mention  those always penetrating interviews with Army Archerd on Oscar nights.  </P> <P> As a singer, he was known to us in the rock generation chiefly through his only  No. 1 single, the diabetic-seizure inducing "Candy Man."  </P> <P> So I had come to the Pacific prepared to endure Davis as part of the price of  getting to hear Sinatra again, knowing full well that Frank still could be, on  a good night, the best pop singer in the world.  </P> <P> That tepid August evening, however, turned out to be a bad one for the Chairman  of the Board as he rambled somewhat disjointedly between songs and never took  his eyes away from a TelePrompTer that scrolled all his lyrics.  </P> <P> But it was a great night for Sammy. Instead of giving us one of those  exaggerated Vegas lounge-act performances that had seemed to typify him, Davis  came across as a sharp, canny vocalist whose innate rhythmic sense made it  perfectly clear why he had jumped to the stages of vaudeville virtually as soon  as he could walk.  </P> <P> Naturally, he did give us his overblown signature tune, "I Gotta Be Me," but he  infused a surprising amount of freshness and character into it, and into such  familiar material as "Begin the Beguine," "Satin Doll" and even "The Girl From  Ipanema." In selections from "Porgy &amp; Bess," he reminded us why he had been  such an appropriate choice to play Sportin' Life in the film nearly three  decades before.  </P> <P> Afterward, I felt a little sheepish realizing that I'd expected nothing more  from the first half of the concert than a stroll down memory lane with Sammy,  Friend of the Superstars. I left that night with the happy realization that as  a musician, Sammy Davis didn't have to be anybody's junior.  </P></p>

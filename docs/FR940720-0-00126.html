			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 4:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Reservoirs do not, as implied, store all spring runoff and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summer inflows. Water is normally released during summer, not winter months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Diversion dams and canals have limited capacities to divert flows. They  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot ``completely divert all flows .&blank;.&blank;. into irrigation ditches'' under flood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service agrees with the statement that reservoirs do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> store all spring runoff and summer inflow. While most water is released  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the spring and summer, a fall and winter release does occur in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Middle Rio Grande Valley when conditions permit (Beal and Gold 1988, Borland  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Gold 1989). Under flood conditions, the irrigation diversions do not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the capacity to divert all flows. Under non-flood flows they do have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity to divert all flows. United States Geological Survey (USGS) records  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantiate the occurrence of no-flow periods downstream of the various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> irrigation diversion dams.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 5:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulation is unsupported by any hydrological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> study as to the statements that irrigation uses have depleted the water flow.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Not a single source of information is cited for comments regarding hydrology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the river. Depletions of water in the system may be the result of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction of wildlife watering impoundments by the Forest Service and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bureau of Land Management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It can be readily documented by examining USGS flow gage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records that river flows decrease when the irrigation season starts. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, the Service reviewed Bullard and Wells (1992), which provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information on the hydrology of the middle Rio Grande. This reduction in flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is most noticeable in mid-summer after the spring to early summer peak flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has passed. Wildlife impoundments are often very small (less than one acre in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> size) and are considered to be insignificant in the amount of water they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deplete from the drainage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 6:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Economic considerations should be given more weight when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communities may be affected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(a)(1) of the Act identifies five factors that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered in making a determination of whether a species should be listed as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threatened or endangered. Section 4(b)(1)(A) of the Act requires that listing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinations be based solely on the best available scientific and commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data, and prohibits the Service from considering economic factors (50 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 424.11(b)). However, because economics are considered in the designation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat, the Service will conduct an economic analysis in the process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of evaluating proposed critical habitat for the Rio Grande silvery minnow.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 7:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service needs to ensure public input before listing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rio Grande silvery minnow. The Service is required to notify counties and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other affected parties to solicit their input prior to listing a species under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act. The Service failed to meet this obligation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On February 19, 1991, about 80 pre-proposal letters of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inquiry were mailed to various governmental agencies, knowledgeable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals, and the New Mexico Congressional delegation. On March 20, 1992,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Service held a meeting in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with various interested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governmental and private entities to explore existing or potential flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in water delivery schedules that might avoid dewatering of the Rio Grande  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the range of the Rio Grande silvery minnow. The Service also published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notices of the proposal in 5 local newspapers and mailed copies of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule to 148 different government agencies, private organizations, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interested individuals, including all counties having lands that border the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area being proposed for critical habitat designation. Two public hearings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were also held. The Service has fully met or surpassed the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Endangered Species Act for public notification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 8:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service held public hearings only to fulfill a legal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligation and will not pay attention to any public comment. The Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should have held public hearings in El Paso and Las Cruces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service disagrees. All comments are carefully evaluated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the Service makes a determination on whether to proceed with a final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. Numerous notifications of the proposed rule and extension of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment period were distributed, and Service biologists traveled to several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas, including El Paso and Las Cruces, to present briefings on the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule and accept comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 9:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service should establish a coordinating committee composed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of interests below Elephant Butte Reservoir whose task would be to develop a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full-scale report on the existing data available on the Rio Grande silvery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minnow and how the river could be managed for the benefit of all, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Rio Grande silvery minnow.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After the species is listed the Service will consider,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through the recovery planning process, establishing a coordinating committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to develop a report on the Rio Grande silvery minnow and how the river could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be managed for the benefit of all, including the Rio Grande silvery minnow.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 10:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During periods of dewatering of the river, the ditches  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide habitat for the species. The Service should consider exploring with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, the counties, and other agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the multiple use of riverside drains for the species and the preservation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bosque habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service agrees that during periods of drought, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in the dewatering of the mainstream Rio Grande, the various irrigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ditches and drains may provide a temporary place of refuge for the Rio Grande  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> silvery minnow. However, these areas do not contain suitable habitat for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long-term use by the species. Few Rio Grande silvery minnows are found in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ditches and drains. Those that are found are believed to represent Rio Grande  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> silvery minnows that became entrapped due to the diversion of irrigation water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the mainstream. The Service intends to investigate, with all interests,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the potential use of the riverside drains for recovery of the species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

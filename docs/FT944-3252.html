			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Stanhope It is ironic that as city property prices start to rise, Stanhope, the part owner of Broadgate, should be faced with the possibility of falling. But its banks are running out of patience. Stanhope's assets match its Pounds 148m of loans, following property revaluations, but it has no income and carries Pounds 7m of overheads. It has had over a year to get refinancing, but Mr Stuart Lipton, chairman and major shareholder, has failed to capitalise on reviving confidence in property and cheap long-term finance. Hence a last-minute scramble for survival ahead of Monday's deadline. The banks face a difficult choice. They can knock more than Pounds 30m off the value of their debt, by selling to bidders British Land or PosTel, and crystallise losses against a company with net value and an attractive asset. Or they can opt for receivership, which would pare Stanhope's overheads and facilitate the eventual sale of Broadgate, co-owned by Rosehaugh's receivers. Those banks which wanted out could sell their debt. The downside is that receivership can damage asset values, and would add to the banks' reputation of taking receivership as the easy option. There is an alternative. Roll over the debt, get equity funding to cover administrative costs, and wait for Broadgate values to rise. The trouble is that the main proponent of this is Mr Lipton, whose credibility has suffered from an inability to turn ideas into reality. Given the harsh alternative of receivership, it is not surprising the banks are pausing for thought.</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PILOTS ON THE LAM WITH THE PUBLIC TRUST  </P> <P> ALPA is the Air Line Pilots Assn. Alpo is the respected purveyor of dog food.  But it is understandable if you're starting to confuse the two, because just  the other day, ALPA began feeding us a line that's hard to swallow.  </P> <P> It began in New York City, where crime is common, and where there occurred a  hit-and-run accident. It quickly became a violation of the public trust, a  crime that affects us all in this nation of frequent flyers.  </P> <P> This was a crash that killed two people and involved only one vehicle -- it was  silver with big letters that say "USAir." After this Boeing 737 drove off the  LaGuardia Airport runway and broke into pieces in the East River, its two  drivers -- pilot and co-pilot -- disappeared from the scene of the accident.  They vanished just after the co-pilot had reportedly mentioned to a Port  Authority police officer that the pilot had been "mumbling" and "acting  irrationally."  </P> <P> For a day and a half, the pilot and co-pilot were unavailable to the  investigators, unavailable to their USAir bosses and unavailable to relieve  themselves in a jar so that the public could know if they had abused any  substances prior to this apparently avoidable wreck. They were unavailable, it  turns out, on the instructions of their union, ALPA, which represents the  people in which we place our ultimate trust.  </P> <P> Public trust . . . every time we climb aboard an airliner, we trust the company  to provide equipment that's in top condition and personnel who are skilled and  experienced.  </P> <P> In the case of USAir Flight 5050, the airline company gave its passengers a  shocking mix -- a new pilot who had held that rank just 2 1/2 months, and a  very inexperienced co-pilot who had made one practice takeoff on an 737 with a  training pilot at his side, and who was being allowed to fly a Boeing 737  loaded with passengers for the first time on this rainy night.  </P> <P> What happened after their vehicle crashed is even more shocking.  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration said it couldn't find the pilots: "For  these two pilots to have been sequestered for more than 36 hours after an  accident that took two lives, and to do so with no explanation, is highly  questionable," said FAA Administrator James B. Busey IV.  </P> <P> The National Transportation Safety Board said it couldn't find the pilots: It  was "inexcusable" for the pilots to avoid prompt urine tests that could be  pharmacologically conclusive, and the delay "seriously impedes our  investigation and unnecessarily creates an environment of suspicion," said the  board's acting chairman, James L. Kolstad.  </P> <P> USAir said it couldn't find the pilots: "We strenuously urged the ALPA  representative to make (the pilot) . . . available," said USAir vice president  Patricia Goldman, adding that the union had refused to disclose his  whereabouts.  </P> <P> And ALPA said in a statement to reporters that the pilots had followed the  union's advice in "post accident procedures with regard to their actions and  whereabouts." ALPA added: "There was nothing unusual in the crew's performance  . . . and the crew has cooperated completely with the investigation."  </P> <P> "Nothing unusual." "Cooperated completely." So it is that you sense the  blurring distinction between ALPA's dogma and Alpo's dog meat. How dare they  try to feed that stuff to a public hungering for assurances of safe travel.  </P> <P> We've seen ALPA's members sacrifice to ensure our safety. Most recently, the  pilots of Eastern Air Lines have sacrificed their years of seniority -- their  careers -- to strike in the name of air safety against union-busting air  conglomerator Frank Lorenzo.  </P> <P> For now -- this is hard to believe, but it's true -- pilots and co-pilots are  not required to submit to a drug test even after a crash.  </P> <P> Had the USAir crash happened this coming December, the pilots would have been  required to undergo drug tests before employment, after crashes and at random  (ALPA opposes random testing). But even though the Transportation Department  announced its rule change a year ago, it wrapped its new rule in its old red  tape. Hence the delay.  </P> <P> This year there have already been more fatal commercial airline crashes (12 so  far) than in any year in the last two decades. Deregulation has given us a  bait-and-switch airline industry that advertises bargain rates but says they're  all out of them when you call, and airlines that price-gouge unsuspecting  little folks who must make last-minute trips.  </P> <P> It all makes one wonder where the corner-cutting stops.  </P> <P> It's time for government to get reinvolved in the airline industry -- and  especially to take a new, hard look at an unrepentant union that seems  unimpressed with the fact that it also represents our public trust.  </P></p>

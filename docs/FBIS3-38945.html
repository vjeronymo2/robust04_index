			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>   [Text] Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind today refused to  rule out sending more British troops to Bosnia if there was  retaliation for United Nations air strikes. He also insisted  there had been no change in Government policy over Bosnia. He  ridiculed the idea that he and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd  had been overruled by the Prime Minister in agreeing to the  ultimatum on air strikes to protect Sarajevo.    Mr Rifkind was speaking after the NATO allies served a  10-day  notice on the Bosnian Serbs around Sarajevo that air strikes  would be launched on behalf of the UN unless they withdrew. The  ultimatum, following 12 hours of talks in Brussels, paved the  way for the first military action in NATO's history.    It was reinfoced by President Clinton who said: "NATO is now  set to act. Anyone, anyone, shelling Sarajevo must recognise  this fact and be prepared to deal with the consequences.    "No one should doubt NATO's resolve," he told a White House  briefing.    Sarajevo was quiet overnight, apart from isolated bursts of  small arms and machinegun fire. A ceasefire in the city,  negotiated by the British commander of United Nations  peacekeeping forces, Lt Gen Sir Michael Rose, was due to take  effect by noon (1100 GMT).    The NATO ultimatum, after tortuous negotiations and detailed  consideration of all military and political implications for the  West, requires a withdrawal out of the Bosnian capital of all  heavy artillery by at least 13 miles, or the handing-over of  weaponry to UN forces. It also threatens air strikes immediately  if any shelling resumes in the wake of last weekend's street  market massacre which killed 68 civilians. One effect of the  ultimatum in Sarajevo was a promise by the Bosnian Serb army  last night to withdraw its big guns from around the city.    Mr Rifkind stressed that the UN had not taken sides against  the Serbs and that the ultimatum to stop firing around Sarajevo  applied to the Bosnian government forces as well. He said  Britain and France already provided most of the UN forces in  Bosnia. But he added: "There is clearly a possibility that the  UN may require some extra forces in order to monitor the  ceasfire between the Muslims and the Serbs in Sarajevo.    "We obviously would want to see what other countries are  doing, who was pulling their weight and who wasn't. That would  have to be the basis of any future position."    He admitted the situation in Bosnia was now dangerous for  British forces, but added: "It has been dangerous throughout."  He said: "The objective is to make the Serbs carry out their  promise and if they carry out their promise there will not be  any air strikes," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He  denied British Government policy over Bosnia had changed, after  initial emphasis on supplying humanitarian aid and not getting  involved in a civil war. "What we have accepted right from the  very beginning is that there are ways in which the use of  military force can reduce suffering in Bosnia."    The soldiers had prevented atrocities just by their  presence,  he said. "What we agreed yesterday was an extension of that  because what we are anxious to do is to end the kind of atrocity  we saw in Sarajevo last weekend."    Britain's Ambassador to NATO, John Weston, endorsed the move  on the Government's behalf after assurances that the decision  will not endanger three key goals:     -  The continuation of  humanitarian aid supplies to the besieged citizens of  Sarajevo.    -  The maintenance of the peace process.    -  The containment  of the 22-month conflict within the borders of the former  Yugoslavia.    Lord Owen, peace negotiator on behalf of the European Union,  said today: "The Bosnian Serbs told us before the artillery  shell dropped in the market place so tragically on Saturday,  that they were ready for what is called a `Sarajevo first'  policy of UN administration and demilitarisation.    "So I think there is a fairly good chance this agreement  will  now stick."    The three warring factions in Bosnia -- Serbs, Muslims and  Croats -- will be holding more talks on Geneva today to try to  find a negotiated peace.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS.  </P> <P> Bolsa Chica Field Trip -- The Sea and Sage Chapter of the National Audubon  Society is sponsoring a field trip to the Bolsa Chica wetlands on Sunday, Nov.  11.  </P> <P> It is a good time for birders to visit the wetlands, according to field-trip  chairwoman Nancy Kenyon, because "all the birds that winter here will have  arrived."  </P> <P> These birds include many shore birds and waterfowl, including ducks, gulls,  grebes, willets, dowitchers, killdeers and black skimmers.  </P> <P> "The skimmers are pretty spectacular," Kenyon said. "They are fairly large,  black and white, with bright orange beaks, and skim for their food along the  top of the water. Other birds, like terns, will be flying and diving."  </P> <P> Those wishing to take part in the field trip should bring binoculars, any bird  books they might have, and a jacket. Local bird expert Doug Willick will be the  trip leader.  </P> <P> "It will be about a 2-mile loop of the wetlands, all on flat ground," Kenyon  said.  </P> <P> She added that a special session during the trip will be devoted to beginning  birders.  </P> <P> "When we do a field trip to a very popular area like Bolsa Chica, we try to  include something for all levels," she said.  </P> <P> The public is welcome. Those wanting to participate should meet at the  ecological reserve parking lot, on the inland side of Pacific Coast Highway  between Golden West Street and Warner Avenue, directly across from Bolsa Chica  State Beach.  </P> <P> Bay Bugs -- Peter Bryant will be the guest speaker at the South Coast Audubon  Society's regular meeting on Nov. 7. Bryant will discuss the different types of  bugs to be found in the Back Bay area of Newport Beach. Bryant is the director  of the Developmental Biology Center at UC Irvine. The meeting will be held at 7  p.m. at the Orange County Marine Institute, 24200 Dana Point Harbor Drive, Dana  Point.  </P> <P> Mommy and Me at the Zoo -- The Santa Ana Zoo's program for parents and  preschoolers begins on Thursday, Nov. 15. It gives children ages 3 and 4 the  opportunity to learn more about animals through educational games, craft  projects and touching live animals at the zoo.

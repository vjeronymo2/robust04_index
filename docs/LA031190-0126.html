			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PENNSYLVANIA;  </P> <P> TRANSPLANT PIONEER, 12, LEAVES HOSPITAL  </P> <P> Stormie Jones, the world's first heart-liver transplant recipient, was  discharged from Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh 17 days after undergoing a  second liver transplant.  </P> <P> The 12-year-old girl from White Settlement, Tex., will remain in the city for  about two weeks for outpatient treatment, hospital spokeswoman Lynn McMahon  said. Stormie received her second liver transplant in a 10-hour operation Feb.  20. She had undergone a heart-and-liver transplant in 1984. The heart has not  caused any problems, but she needed a new liver because the first was damaged  by hepatitis.  </P></p>

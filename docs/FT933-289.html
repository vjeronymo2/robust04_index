			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (17): Mining giant survived the economic cave-in - US-owned SPCC, which produces two thirds of Peru's copper, welcomes the new business climate US-owned Southern Peru Copper Corporation is far and away the country's largest private company, responsible for two-thirds of all national copper output. SPCC is Peruvian mining's great survivor. Mr Charles Preble, SPCC's president, has seen it all since he arrived in Peru 28 years ago. 'In 1965 there were 12 foreign-owned mining companies, a host of small and medium-sized mines and plenty of exploration going on here,' he says. 'By July 1990, no one was exploring, there were just two foreign mining concerns left, while most of the small and many medium-sized mines had shut down.' SPCC escaped the nationalistic zeal of General Velasco's military government in the 1970s, probably because of the huge upcoming investment in its second open-cast mine, Cuajone. Financing for the venture involved 53 international banks, who would have pulled out had nationalisation been threatened. According to Mr Preble, however, it was during the 1985-90 presidency of Alan Garcia that conditions hit rock bottom. Hyperinflation, restrictions on profit remittances and a bloated state bureaucracy meant adverse conditions for all businesses, but the mining industry was also used as a 'milk cow' in the state's ever more desperate hunt for tax revenue. Top of Mr Preble's list of improvements under the Fujimori administration is the liberalisation of foreign exchange. 'This affects everybody, of course, not just the mining sector, but it's a big factor. Anyone looking for financing is going to have to be able to assure the institution he's dealing with that foreign exchange will be available. Opening an escrow account - which most financial institutions are going to require to insure loan repayment - is also now possible.' Until the Fujimori government slashed import tariffs, SPCC calculates that almost half of total cost of sales went in taxes. That has now 'decreased somewhat', with a positive effect on overall costs, says Mr Preble. Last year's sales topped Dollars 635m, with profits totalling Dollars 94m. The biggest remaining obstacle to mining sector expansion is the exchange rate. Peru's sol remains heavily overvalued and this year's predicted gains in parity have not materialised. Miners would also like to see a further reduction in the inflation rate, although the current two per cent to three per cent a month is a great improvement on two years ago. The labour panorama, too, has improved immeasurably. 'For unions to strike now, they must win over 50 per cent support in a publicly-supervised secret vote,' says Mr Preble. 'That's a tremendous change. For the last 25 or 30 years, less than five per cent of the labour force could call a strike.' Barring a two-day 'blip', SPCC has had no strikes since mid-1990. About 95 per cent of company workers have signed individual 'labour peace' agreements with the company, giving them bonuses for uninterrupted production. And SPCC management has recently signed a three-year contract with its employees: 'Probably the first time that's ever been done in Peruvian labour history,' says Mr John Youle, SPCC's vice-president. In late 1991, SPCC committed itself to fresh investments worth Dollars 300m for expansion of refined copper output and environmental improvements. The Dollars 90m capture acid plant for the Ilo smelter is now in the second phase of engineering and on target for completion by May 1995. A sewage treatment plant for Ilo town is three-quarters finished, while the basic engineering phase for electrowinning (copper-recovery) plants at Toquepala and Cuajone mines is now finished. Feasibility studies for a new tailings disposal system are also nearing completion. The new investment should allow SPCC, under last year's mining law, to sign a tax stability agreement with the government - a facility now available to any company investing over Dollars 2m. SPCC is among those bidding for the Mineroperu-owned copper refinery at Ilo, scheduled for privatisation late this year. Under a tolling contract with the government, SPCC must keep the state-owned refinery supplied with blister copper. Potential rival bidders include Japan's Mitsui, Montagu Mining in association with Britain's Midland Bank, and a consortium which includes Chile's Pudahuel mining company. SPCC says it welcomes the prospect of more foreign mining companies in Peru. The inauguration last month of Newmont Mining's gold-mining operation in Cajamarca is an encouraging sign, says Mr Preble. So is the fact that there are now geologists 'all over the hills - so many of them it's like a big old tea-party when they get together.' 'All this is not just because Peru's got attractive rocks,' Mr Preble says. 'It's because of the new, positive investment environment.'</p>

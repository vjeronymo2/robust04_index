			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Poland copper strike averted UNIONS at KGHM, Poland's copper mining and smelting combine have lifted their threat of a 24-hour stoppage today after parliament approved an easing of wage controls for state-owned exporters at the weekend. The unions are to learn today what their new wages will be after being promised increases at the close of a five-week strike last month. KGHM's copper output in the first eight months of this year reached 255,000 tonnes, 1.3 per cent more than in the same period last year.</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YELLOW JACKETS STING GEORGIA, 33-22  </P> <P> Jerry Mays rushed for 207 yards and scored the go-ahead touchdown, and  defensive tackle Willie Burks' interception set up the clinching score as  Georgia Tech recorded a 33-22 victory over Peach Bowl-bound Georgia Saturday.  </P> <P> Mays, who had 39 carries, scored on a seven-yard run early in the third quarter  to wipe out a 14-13 Georgia halftime lead and put the Yellow Jackets ahead to  stay at 20-14.  </P> <P> Tech (7-4) won for the seventh time in eight games. It was its sixth in a row  at home. Georgia (6-5) will meet Syracuse Dec. 31 in the Peach Bowl.  </P> <P> Georgia Tech wrapped up the victory in the fourth quarter after Burks, a  6-foot-4, 277-pounder, intercepted a pass by Preston Jones, which was tipped by  Sean Smith, and ran 28 yards to the Georgia four-yard line. Two plays later,  Stefen Scotton scored from two yards out to give Georgia Tech a 26-14 lead.  </P> <P> The Yellow Jackets added another score in the closing minutes on a 22-yard pass  play from Shawn Jones to Mays as Georgia Tech dominated the second half.  </P> <P> Georgia Tech, which had lost three in a row to Georgia, capitalized on two of  the Bulldogs' five turnovers and were not hurt by four of its own.  </P> <P> Georgia Tech took a 10-0 first-quarter lead on a 25-yard field goal by Scott  Sisson and Scotton's one-yard run before Georgia came back with 14  second-quarter points.  </P> <P> Rodney Hampton, who had 96 yards in 16 carries before injuring his left ankle  late in the first half and leaving the game, scored both Bulldogs' touchdowns.  He scored on a four-yard run five seconds into the second quarter and added a  one-yard run midway into the second quarter.  </P> <P> Sisson added a 39-yard field goal just before halftime to cut Georgia's margin  to 14-13.  </P> <P> Georgia closed out the scoring with 38 seconds remaining when Preston Jones  connected on a 15-yard touchdown pass play to Sean Hummings.  </P> <P> Mays, a senior, finished the season with 1,349 yards.

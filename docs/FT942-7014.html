			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / People: Tucker moves up at the Bank Following the Bank of England's recent restructuring, Paul Tucker is to become head of the Bank's gilt-edged division on July 4. The high-flying 36-year-old has been a senior manager in the Bank's gilts and money markets division for the past two years, but before that he was personal secretary to the former Bank of England governor, Lord Kingsdown. Former colleagues describe him as well-respected and ambitious, and 'not afraid to ruffle a few feathers. He knows his stuff and doesn't suffer fools gladly'. Tucker will continue reporting to his former boss, John Townend, who will become a deputy director in charge of gilts, money markets and foreign exchange. Terry Smeeton, an old hand in the Bank's foreign exchange department, will be the division head in charge of foreign exchange.</p>

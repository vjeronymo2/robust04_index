			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / The Russian Crisis: Battle for survival begins - Wounds of Moscow confrontation will be deep and lasting WHEN Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, appealed last night for popular support to prevent Russia being turned into 'a giant concentration camp for decades to come,' he was right to be worried. Having traded threats with each other, Russia's leaders on either side of the barricades embarked on a struggle for their own survival. President Boris Yeltsin, warning that the 'fate of our children is at stake', last night said his opponents had overstepped all acceptable limits. He sacked his vice-president, General Alexander Rutskoi, and can be expected to punish his opponents by the full measure of the law if he wins. He urged popular support for democracy and market reforms, saying his opponents would not allow free elections. But he will probably pursue more oppressive policies at home if he wins the confrontation. Similarly, Mr Rutskoi said Mr Yeltsin must be held to account for the collapse of the Soviet Union, of the Russian economy, and of the army. He vowed to punish corrupt and unpatriotic officials whom he accused of selling Russia out to western interests. He threatened to try senior officers who continued to support Mr Yeltsin and expressed his contempt for most of Russia's mainstream politicians, including former allies such as Mr Arkady Volsky, the head of the industrialists' union, and his former ideologue, Mr Vassily Lipitsky. Mr Rutskoi praised 'patriots' in the National Salvation Front, whose members have advocated variously a restoration of the Soviet Union, a return to communism, and a more nationalist foreign policy. For the former Soviet republics, the issue is one of life-or-death. Having supported Mr Yeltsin, they could face a return to power of politicians who want to reconstitute the Soviet Union. Just as the failed 1991 coup precipitated the collapse of the Soviet Union, the outcome of this battle could determine whether Russia sticks together as one country. Russia's provinces, having waited on the sidelines to see which side would win in Moscow, could be forced to take sides. With local administrations supporting Mr Yeltsin and the heads of local councils supporting parliament, there will also be retribution against those local officials who have backed the losing side. Despite Mr Yeltsin's appeals for support, the increasing popular indifference to politics which allowed the president to dissolve parliament less than two weeks ago could also play against him. Just like the Russian army, the Russian people are haunted by the memory of the brutal civil war which ravaged the country seven decades ago. The army, which has vowed to stay 'neutral' in the current conflict, could begin to fall apart at the seams if its commanders take sides and if the troops refuse to obey orders. The events of the last 24 hours have pushed Russia to the brink of civil war. If President Yeltsin manages to restore order, the wounds of the confrontation - due in large part to the folly of politicians - will be deep and lasting.</p>

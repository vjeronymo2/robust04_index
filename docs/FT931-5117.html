			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Management: Abbey kicks the habit - An increasing number of employers are insisting on smoke-free workplaces On the first Wednesday morning of next month, Abbey National's 18,000 staff in the UK will collect their ashtrays and ritually dispose of them. From then on, not even senior managers in the privacy of their offices will be allowed a furtive puff, for the banking group has decided on a smoking ban for staff and visitors. Abbey National is the latest of a number of large employers to outlaw or at least restrict, smoking at work: an estimated 20 per cent of organisations have smoking policies. For others considering the move, impetus came from the recent case of the council worker in the north-west of England who won Pounds 15,000 compensation for the alleged effects of passive smoking at work. Veronica Bland, a 36-year-old non-smoker, claimed her health suffered due to colleagues smoking around her. Following the case, the Institute of Personnel Management and anti-smoking groups such as Action on Smoking and Health (Ash), were deluged by requests for advice from employers. This same pattern of legal action, publicity and movement by employers, and in some cases governments, towards restricting or banning smoking has been seen in the US, Australia and elsewhere in Europe. The out-of-court Bland settlement has no status as a legal precedent, but many companies feel they no longer wish to risk the possibility of future claims. Public opinion has been gradually turning in favour of smoke-free working environments and to be a non-smoking organisation fits in with the image many companies wish to project. Individual addicts may intend to take advantage of No Smoking Day on March 10 to kick the habit, but for organisations wanting to give up smoking, the cold-turkey approach is unlikely to be effective. Unless much preparatory work has been done before Wednesday, a more realistic timetable might be to aim for No Smoking Day 1994. A year's lead-in was what Abbey National found it needed to introduce its smoking ban. The group's experience provides other organisations with some useful lessons on the practicalities involved. Ted Murphy, Abbey National's group personnel manager, says the process has been evolutionary, with smoking banned in areas visible to the public for the past five years. A working party was set up last March to review the options for developing a smoking policy which would 'guarantee non-smokers the right to breathe smoke-free air but, where possible, take account of the needs of those who smoke'. A questionnaire found that 80 per cent of staff were non-smokers - much the same proportion as in the UK population as a whole. Of the smokers, only 20 per cent smoked in their working areas and, even among smokers, there was a preference for some restrictions on where smoking should be allowed. Nearly 60 per cent of all respondents thought there should be separate rooms for smoking. But Abbey National decided not to go the 'smoking dens' route, mainly because it would have been impracticable in some locations, particularly in very small branches. There is no point having a designated smoking area if it is not separately partitioned and ventilated - an exercise Abbey National's premises department considered impossible or too expensive for some locations. Other companies, particularly those in single buildings or occupying purpose-built premises, have found it easier to accommodate separate smoking rest areas. The principle of consistency has been applied throughout the hierarchy. 'If you're going to introduce a ban, it's simpler and cleaner to do it for all parts of the organisation. If you draw lines based on status, you create warps in the policy that, in the end, undermine it,' he says. The final task was to help those employees wanting to take advantage of the April deadline to give up smoking altogether. Katie Poate, Abbey National's occupational health nursing officer, points out the company is not saying do not smoke, 'but saying don't smoke at work'. A three-month warning of the ban has enabled many smokers on the staff to brace themselves for abstinence. Poate has given out a total of 450 packs advising how to give up and interest-free loans of up to Pounds 200 are available to those wanting to try hypnosis or nicotine patches. For those who do not manage to kick the habit by the deadline, at least there will be only three days to go until the weekend.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech given by Bo Yibo (5631 0001 3134) before the </F> National Congress of the Association of Industrial Economics and  the First Session of the Second Council of the National Congress  of the Association of Industrial Economics on 3 March: "Promote  Development With Improvement of Economic Results as the Key  Link"]    [Text]When speeding up development, we must stick to  seeking truth from facts, and proceed from reality in all  things. We must not try to blindly compete for higher growth  rates. In order to realize an organic combination of speed and  benefit, we must carry out the unified industrial policies of  the state and improve production structure, product mix, and  enterprise organizational structure. We must also try hard to  promote scientific and technological progress, raise the quality  of workers, strengthen the management of our enterprises, and  lower production costs.    In the past year, under the leadership of Comrade Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress, the economy of our  country has grown rapidly, reform has entered a stage of overall  progress, and the whole economic situation has been going well.  Since the beginning of last summer, in light of the conspicuous  contradictions and problems arising in the course of rapid  economic development, the party Central Committee and the State  Council have taken prompt measures to deepen the reform and  strengthen and improve the macroeconomic regulation and control  using mainly economic methods. We have achieved positive  results. While fully affirming our achievements, we should also  soberly recognize that many deep-level problems have not been  solved once and for all, and that the macroeconomic regulation  and control measures already implemented have worked on the  surface but have not yet solved the underlying problems. Our  ultimate purpose is a fundamental reform of the economic  structure and the establishment of a socialist market economy.  What merits our attention is that, due to the excessive scale  or unrestricted expansion of investment in fixed assets,  excessive price increases, and the excessive volume of currency  put into circulation, the inflationary pressure has not eased  and the macroenvironment as a whole is still rather tense.  These are, however, hardly unavoidable in the process of  establishing a socialist market economy. Practical experience  tells us that the process of marketization must be coordinated  with macroeconomic regulation and control capabilities. The  better the macroeconomic regulation and control, the fewer  problems there will be and the more easily they can be solved.  At present, the focus of macroeconomic regulation and control  is strict control of the scale of investment in fixed assets.  Our construction scope must correspond to the power of the  country, and be well within the limit. We cannot "adapt" to the  continuous expansion of the scale of construction by issuing  excessive currency. We are determined to carry out to the full  and put into practice in every aspect and every field of  endeavor the series of policies and measures of macroeconomic  regulation and control determined by the party Central Committee  with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core for a fundamental reform of  our economic system after long meticulous study. Things like  "lower-level authorities having their own ways in dealing with  policies from higher-level authorities" and each unit going its  own way without listening (to the central government) must be  totally eliminated. The interests of the whole should be taken  into account. The authority of the party Central Committee  should be upheld. This is the first point I want to make.    What should we do to correctly handle the relationship  between speed and benefit? On 2 February, at a symposium on  "Improving Economic Benefits in China," I gave a lecture  entitled "Organically Combining Speed of Development With  Economic Benefit" based on my practical experience. In this  talk I expressed some of my opinions and quoted Comrade  Xiaoping's words on his southern journey: "Development is the  last word." "Do not hinder the development pace if it is  possible to achieve it. Wherever conditions permit, you should  develop as fast as possible. So long as attention is given to  economic returns, quality and export-oriented economy, there is  not much to worry about." "China's economy should strive to  mount a new level in several years. Of course, I am not calling  for high speed beyond our ability. We should work in a  down-to-earth manner, stess economic returns and develop  steadily and proportionately." I think this has been Comrade  Xiaoping's consistent thought. The key to maintaining a  sustained, rapid and healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian  kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of our  national economy lies in an accurate and comprehensive  understanding of this thought, and carrying out an organic  combination of development speed and economic benefits.    It should be pointed out that in our economic work,  carrying out this guiding thought of Comrade Xiaoping has not  been entirely voluntary. Given that the rate of development is  now already sufficiently high, and people are quite  enthusiastic, I would like to emphasize that we should  concentrate our attention on increasing economic benefits.  Compared with advanced countries, our low industrial economic  benefits have as yet remained relatively unchanged. One-sidedly  seeking high output value and quantity without regard to quality  or variety; being concerned only with what one can produce  without regard to sales or market demand; seeking greater  production scope without regard to improving the economic  structure; seeking high investment volume, large production  scope and new projects without regard to whether they can be  sustained by national power and financial and material  resources--all these are in fact influences from the product  economic thought of the past. In some enterprises and some  places they have almost become a chronic ailment, bringing about  serious problems in the development of our cause.    Along with the development of the socialist market economy,  it is now high time to wake up completely. We should have an  accurate and correct understanding of the central authorities'  idea of seizing the opportunity and speeding up development. We  should not one- sidedly take it as allowing us to neglect  economic laws and blindly seek higher growth rates. I remember  what Comrade Xiaoping said in 1985 when the Seventh Five-Year  Plan was being discussed: "A 7 percent growth rate is not low.  A rate that is too high will bring about many problems and will  have a negative influence on the reform and social conduct. It  would be better to be steady. We must control investment in  fixed assets. The scope of construction should not be too  large. We must put management and quality first, and strive for  economic and overall social benefits. Such a growth rate is  good." The central authorities have set the rate of development  during the Eighth Five-Year Plan at 8 to 9 percent. I think  this is both active and safe. We should genuinely shift the  emphasis of our economic work onto the track of taking  improvement of economic benefits as the only link. Only such a  rate of development can be said to be both down-to-earth and  practical. Since an excessive scale of capital construction is  beyond the power of the country, we would finally be forced to  make adjustments and lose the opportunity for development, and  this would slow down our socialist modernization. When speeding  up development, we must stick to seeking truth from facts. We  must not try blindly to compete for higher growth rates. We  should combine speed with efficiency, quality, and the market in  light of the specific conditions in different enterprises and  localities. We must strive to reach achievable faster  development on the basis of raising efficiency.    In order to realize an organic combination of speed and  efficiency, we must implement the unified industrial policies of  the state, and improve the industrial structure, product mix,  and enterprise organizational structure. Imbalance in structure  has always been the major obstacle to the healthy development of  China's economy. It is also the major obstacle to raising  economic efficiency. In terms of industrial development, we  must concentrate on solving the problem of basic industries,  especially energy and transportation, lagging behind processing  industries; the problem of overdeveloped processing industries  being much too overdeveloped, and the underdeveloped processing  industries being much too underdeveloped; and the problem of the  low-level specialization and socialization of enterprises. We  should strive for a great improvement in economic structures,  and base the improvement of economic efficiency on continuous  structural improvement.    In order to realize an organic combination of speed and  efficiency, we must try hard to promote scientific and  technological progress, and raise the quality of workers.  Comrade Xiaoping's idea that science and technology are the  primary productive force is of great strategic significance.  Science, technology and education are the key to changing the  low economic efficiency of our industries and to the strategic  transformation of extensive management into intensive  management. We should conscientiously do a good job of training  in-service staff, raise their quality, create a generation of  new people who have ideals, morals, education and a sense of  discipline, and raise the quality of workers. While digesting  and assimilating imported technology, we should carry out a  strategy of upgrading technology, gradually moving from a policy  of adopting imported technologies to a policy of independent  research and development, so that we can shorten the distance  between China and the world's advanced countries in the field of  science and technology development.    In order to realize an organic combination of speed and  efficiency, we must strengthen the management of enterprises and  lower production costs. The end results of the materialized  labor in factories--products--will finally enter the market in  the form of merchandise, for which there are no national  borders. Higher quality products and lower prices will win in  market competition. Comrade Xiaoping has pointed out: "China  has many things that can be exported." "The key to sales in  foreign markets lies in improving quality. If our quality is  poor there will be no competitive power." To achieve this, it  will not do not to establish a modern enterprise management  system and it will not do not to have strict scientific  management; it will not do not to turn our eyes inward, practice  strict economy, and put a lot of effort into improving  productivity. In this sense we can say that management brings  about benefits.    In general, it is an arduous and complicated systems  engineering task to follow the path of development with an  improvement in economic benefits as the key link. We have to  continuously make explorations in practice, promptly summarize  our experiences and hold on to it persistently.</p>

			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> GUILTY VERDICT FOR KILLER OF 6  </P> <P> David (Moochie) Welch has been convicted in Oakland of the 1986 pre-dawn  rampage that left his former girlfriend and five other people dead. An Alameda  County jury found Welch guilty of breaking into the home of 17-year-old Dellane  Mabrey, his former girlfriend and the mother of their young son, and shooting  her to death with an Uzi assault rifle. Also killed in the Dec. 8 attack were  Sean Orlando Mabrey, 21; Dwayne Miller, 4; Kathy Walker, 34; Darnell Mabrey,  20, and Valencia Morgan, 3. Because the jury found that special circumstances  were involved, Welch faces the death penalty or life in prison.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Branko Vojicic: "Montenegro and `War Booty': </F> Plunder of Looted Croatian Riches"]    [Text] Podgorica--The Montenegrin public has still not been  told that Montenegro has returned part of its plundered "war  booty"--paintings and drawings that the former JNA [Yugoslav  People's Army], in its famous "liberation" raid on Dubrovnik,  "captured" at the summer house of renowned painter Milovan  Stanic in Mali Zaton. Specifically, since there was not a single  representative of the Montenegrin "fourth estate" present at the  transfer of the paintings and drawings, the local media have  remained mute and the public has been short-changed for the  umpteenth time concerning the details of this significant step  in normalizing relations between the Republic of Croatia and  Montenegro.  <H5>  What MONITOR Reveals </H5>   In light of this fact, the article "Paths of War Booty"  published by the independent Podgorica weekly MONITOR is of  interest. The article talks about how students from Niksic--in  military uniform and with passes--were transported to the  Dubrovnik front in organized fashion to "gather war booty."  Specifically, the weekly reveals that in early March 1992, while  the war was raging around Dubrovnik, 15 students, residents of  the "Vucinic Brothers" dormitory in Niksic, led by Radoman  Kovacevic, director of that institution, loaded six truck  tractors and two trailer trucks with goods from the "Mlini" and  "Kupari" hotel complexes and transported them to Niksic amid air  support and the protection of the military police. The operation  was organized by the successor to the army that shot its own  soldiers for stealing apples--the former JNA and current Armed  Forces of Yugoslavia [VJ]. MONITOR published a photocopy of  Radoman Kovacevic's permit "to take from the Mlini (hotel)  furniture, radiators, dishes, and kitchen supplies for the needs  of the Niksic dormitory," as well as a pass "authorizing  movement to and from Sutorina and Trebinje." This permit was  signed, "under the authority of the commander," by head of the  civilian administration agency, Colonel Drago Pipovic. The  stolen goods were transported by "Autoprevozno" of Niksic, which  properly billed the dormitory for its services in transporting  160 metric tons of "equipment, furniture, and miscellany" along  the Niksic-Kupari-Niksic route.    Scarcely four months had passed since the successful looting  expedition when a dispute broke out among employees of the  Niksic dormitory. The director was accused of having seized  everything, and it was alleged that the "war booty" was  extensive: expensive paintings (for some time they adorned  Kovacevic's office, but then they disappeared), large safes of  gold and foreign exchange, plus television sets, expensive  furniture, telephone exchanges worth hundreds of thousands of  German marks....  <H5>  Mercedes for a Fistful of Marks </H5>   "We do not know where such things are," it was said at a  special session (closed to the public) of that institution's  board, when several dormitory employees suggested that  "officially not a single specification arrived" and that the  dormitory has not benefited from it in the least.    On the contrary, the director rewarded the students who went  with him on the adventure--with free dormitory services until  the end of the school year. However, the director refuted the  charges by saying, "Although I have a moral right to enter  ustasha houses, there are no items in my possession!"    "The legal person did not provide evidence of the property  at  his disposal," because of which it was not possible "to exercise  control over the financial-material business dealing," concluded  the financial police, which has been involved in the entire case  ever since charges were brought by the minister of education  against Director Kovacevic, but not because of the plunder, but  rather because of the illegal rehiring of a former dormitory  secretary. Kovacevic was called before the examining magistrate  only six months later, but after that the whole matter sank into  oblivion.    It appears that the further investigation into Kovacevic was  halted by the former chief of the VJ General Staff, Zivota  Panic, with the cooperation of General Pavle Strugar and General  Radomir Damljanovic, insiders allege. Apparently they did not  want to raise questions concerning the thefts because all  indications are that they too had "lined their pockets." For  example, Strugar "bought" a Mercedes 190 brought in from the  Dubrovnik front for several hundred German marks, while  Damljanovic got a luxury Peugeot for a few marks more.    Recently, however, the "Kovacevic case" has been  "activated."  The court has authorized experts to gather evidence of the  director's "abuses in connection with procuring food for the  dormitory, trading a freezer for one automobile tire, giving  free housing to some students," and several other minor  irregularities. No one mentions the theft of "war booty."</p>

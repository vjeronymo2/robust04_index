			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chong Pyong-chin] </F>   [Text] North Korea conveyed to the United States a  document on its withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] on 15 June. On the same day, the United States  completed its draft resolution on sanctions against North Korea  to be presented to the UN Security Council. The situation with  regard to the North Korean nuclear issue has become increasingly  strained.    From the viewpoint that the coordination of opinion between  the ROK and the United States is more important than ever under  this situation, the government let all communication channels  between Washington and Seoul, and between the United Nations and  the Foreign Ministry become wide open. As long as our  government, which is one of the parties most directly concerned  with the North Korean nuclear issue, remains as a third party in  negotiations on the nuclear issue, the United States, a party  concerned with the negotiations, is sitting face to face with  North Korea in the place of our government while negotiating  with it on behalf of the United Nations and the IAEA which  represent the international community.    Nevertheless, some people's criticism is that the United  States shows an attitude of dealing with the North Korean  nuclear issue as a line in the chain of its own diplomatic  policy, and our government is not effectively responding to the  U.S. policy of approach toward the issue. As the North Korean  nuclear issue has lately brought about an excessive "sense of  simulated crisis [kasangjok wigigam]" on the Korean peninsula,  the aged doubt [haemugun pulsingam] that "the United States has  a passive opinion [sogukchogin kyonhae] on tensions on the  Korean peninsula because it wants to resolve the North Korean  nuclear issue in its own way" seems to be raised again. In  short, people note that the ROK and the United States have yet  to build a belt of consensus in which they can share even  specific interests [kuchejogin ihaekkaji kongyuhanun  konggamdaega hyongsongdoeji anko itta].    It is learned that the ROK and the United States have a good  system for pre- or post-coordination of their opinion and that  there is a relatively wide belt of consensus between the two.  Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Bill Clinton have held talks over  the telephone at every critical stage for every important issue.  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher have also held frequent talks in person or  over telephone. In addition, Nuclear Ambassador Kim Sam-hun has  paved way for pictorial cooperation between the two countries by  visiting the United States, and Robert Gallucci, U.S. ambassador  in charge of the North Korean nuclear issue, will visit our  country and Japan in the near future to round off the  cooperation system between the ROK, the United States, and Japan.    On the other hand, however, some people note that "the two  countries have held frequent talks for coordination of opinion  but seem to have failed to reach a complete agreement to share  even interests."    When North Korea declared its withdrawal from the IAEA, the  United States, a suzerain state of the agency, branded [kyujong]  North Korea's attitude as "an unforgivable act against the  international community," and some U.S. sections made without  hesitation such strong utterances as "they would not hesitate in  imposing even military sanctions." Meanwhile, our government  held an emergency meeting on measures against North Korea's  declaration. However, it said "it would adhere to its original  policy of using both dialogue and sanctions." Yi Hong-ku,  deputy prime minister and minister of the National Unification  Board, who presided over the meeting, made it clear that "UN  sanctions will be sanctions for dialogue." These facts cause us  to assume that the ROK and the United States have a different  awareness of the crisis on the Korean peninsula.    There have been more contradictions in cooperation between  the ROK, the United States, and Japan. When Ambassador Kim  Sam-hun visited the United States and held working-level talks  with the United States and Japan, he said "the three countries  are cooperatively coping with the North Korean nuclear issue."  However, when faced with the unexpected variable of North  Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA, they showed wavering attitudes  in reaching agreements and coordinating opinions. A ranking  official of our government prospected, "This fact [North Korea's  withdrawal from the IAEA] will not influence UN sanctions  against North Korea and, accordingly, it will take two or three  weeks, as scheduled, for the UN Security Council to formally  discuss sanctions against the North." The United States,  however, immediately prepared a draft resolution on sanctions  against the North and opened it to public on the following day.  They differed from each other in way of understanding the  matter.    In addition to the withdrawal from the IAEA, North Korea has  begun to show another card, that is, the withdrawal from the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Situation will all the more  require the partnership among the ROK, the United States, and  Japan, particularly between the ROK and the United States, in  coping with the North Korean nuclear issue.</p>

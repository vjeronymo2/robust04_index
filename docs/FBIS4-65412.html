			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Future UN Actions Need Clearer </F> Mandate"]    [Text] In a speech on Saturday [14 May] afternoon delivered  to Vesalius College at the Free University of Brussels, Foreign  Minister Willy Claes explained the Belgian view of UN  peacekeeping operations. The minister naturally referred to the  dramatic outcome of the Belgian participation in the UN  peacekeeping force in Rwanda. Claes believes that future UN  missions should be more clearly defined and the Blue Helmets  should be better armed.    After the end of the Cold War, "peacekeeping operations  seemed to be the answer to all kinds of crises, ranging from  humanitarian aid situations to the difficult implementation of  complex peace accords," Claes stated. Hence their  proliferation. "Peacekeeping operations normally begin  following previous authorization from all the parties  concerned," the minister said. "But the Security Council has  initiated a number of operations without the prior consent of  all the parties to a conflict." The minister referred to Bosnia  and Somalia. However, Claes stated that "there was no ambiguity  in the case of Rwanda: There was a political agreement and both  parties had given their express assent to the UNAMIR [UN  Assistance Mission in Rwanda] deployment."    The large number of peacekeeping operations is making it  increasingly difficult for the United Nations to obtain the  required number of soldiers. Another problem Claes raised was  the "chronic deficiency of the UN budget for peacekeeping  operations, due to the failure of a number of member states to  pay up on time." As a result, it is not certain that it will be  possible to provide the United Nations with its own standby  forces. Claes also believes that the UN Secretariat lacks a  structure with responsibility for military operations.    "The feeling at the moment is that the Security Council  should better assess a peacekeeping operation's chances of  success within the overall framework of efforts to restore  peace." The mandate for a peacekeeping operation must, the  minister believes, be "precise and flexible." He believes it  must describe the objectives of the operation and must be clear  regarding the different elements of the mandate, such as the  disarming of the militia in Somalia. Once defined, the mandate  of a peacekeeping operation must be correctly implemented.  <H5>  Rapid Review </H5>   According to Claes, the United Nations should be able to  rapidly review the mandate of a peacekeeping operation, when  necessary. This requires "a serious improvement in  communications between UN troops in the field and UN  headquarters." The mandate should also be limited in time.  With the exception of UN operations under Chapter 7 of the UN  charter, Blue Helmets may only use their weapons in  self-defense. This limits the ability to respond to direct  threats. "I believe we must stop the practice which only allows  UN soldiers to bear light arms: They must be sufficiently  equipped, not only with a view to their specific mandate but  also so that they are able to respond to changed circumstances  and effectively defend themselves."    After the problems encountered by U.S. soldiers during the  UN  operation in Somalia and after the death of Belgian Blue Helmets  in Rwanda, "governments are now going to find it much more  difficult to win domestic support for participation in  peacekeeping operations," Claes stated. "This also relates to  the difficult balance between national responsibilities with  respect to UN troops and the recognized authority of UN  commanders in the field. UN commanders must not be hindered by  the interference of national commanders. On the other hand,  national governments must remain responsible for assessing the  safety of their soldiers and must be able to withdraw them."  Claes said that "although the idea of the United Nations having  its own force may seem attractive, it is still a long way from  being realized."</p>

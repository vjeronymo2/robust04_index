			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Next Pounds 89m repayment of convertible bond NEXT, the fashion retailer, has redeemed the bulk of its convertible bond involving a payment of Pounds 89.2m. The company also announced yesterday that Mr David Jones, chief executive, had waived rights to options over 717,500 shares and was being offered new options over 200,000 shares. The repayment was expected as the bondholders had the right to demand redemption at 133.3 per cent of nominal value and the share price, at 109p up 1p yesterday, was well below the conversion price of 430p. However, holders of Pounds 1.9m nominal of the bonds did not ask for redemption and these remain in existence. Holders of a similar bond issued by Ratners, the jewellery retailer, are less certain of the company redeeming the bond on October 30 because of the group's financial position. Although Ratners has won an extension of borrowing facilities from its banks, the bond redemption would need a Pounds 58.5m payment. Ratners can only make this payment if it does not require new funds from the banks or breach its covenants. It said in August that if it traded in line with its business plan then it would be able to make the redemption. The bond, with a nominal value of Pounds 44m, can be redeemed at the holders request at 133 per cent of face value. The Ratners bonds are not being traded at present awaiting news from the company over redemption. Next, like Ratners and a number of other companies, issued its convertible bond in 1987 before the stock market crash and achieved a lower coupon - of 5 3/4 per cent - by including the bondholder put option. Another Next convertible was redeemed in January. When the bonds were issued the put option was not expected to be exercised but the market fall and recession cut the share price. The sale of Grattan, its mail order business, last year for Pounds 168m provided the cash for the redemption. Next bought and cancelled some of the bonds. As well as Mr Jones, two other executives have waived rights to options over 63,000 shares. These options were issued in 1987 and exercise prices were over 200p.</p>

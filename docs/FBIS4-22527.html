The director of the Volgograd  Shipyard is worried about his collective, and is seeking  like-minded people throughout the USSR (not once did he call it  the "former"), in order to save the people from below, in an  enterprising way, to save the state from ... the state.    "You know what a terrible sign it is: this year we  accepted no young specialists into production!" he noted.    [Nikiforova] So what is it, is this a managerial mutiny?    [Maksyut] Indeed, what nerves one must have to endure  something like this?! In the three years of reform, the yard has  lost 3,500 people. And what kind of people! Skillful hands.  Production is being cut back. Whereas in 1990 we produced 20  units, last year we turned over 3! The government is not  granting long-term loans, and short-term ones are no support for  serious production.    [Nikiforova] How is the enterprise getting by?    [Maksyut] It's a good thing that they need a fleet abroad,  we  are surviving by means of real currency. Last year we concluded  a contract to build ten dry cargo ships, we are turning over  four this year, and the rest over the next two years. Note this:  we are selling to foreign firms. The Germans and the Dutch need  ships, but Russia, it turns out, does not need them.    [Nikiforova] The yard has become a joint-stock company. In  the logical course of events, shipbuilding should get financial  replenishment.    [Maksyut] At first we too believed this. We took the second  variant of privatization, and bought up 51 percent of the shares  through the privatization fund. Because of the fact that Chubays  had to buy 80 percent of the shares for vouchers alone, though,  we got very little.    [Nikiforova] It turns out that ownership brings only  trouble.  What is the workers' attitude toward this?    [Maksyut] They are not in a very good mood. The average wage  is 71,000 rubles [R]. By general agreement, we decided not to  pay dividends so far -- nothing to pay them with. True, we found  the "thirteenth-month wage," we are subsidizing half the cost of  dinners in the dining hall. The exorbitant rise in prices is  forcing people to get themselves out of the mess, it is pushing  them to crime: it is a paradox, but people, owners of the  enterprise, have begun to steal more. From themselves! Laziness  is increasing. You have a top specialist getting 4-5-fold less  than, for example, an operator at a thermal power station.  Unless the government makes a sensible decision, the yard's  reserves are enough for two to three months. We, the members of  the rayon council of directors, warned the authorities of this.  They answered us: "Do not dramatize!" After all, though, the  people can go out on the streets without any notice. The  directors are restraining this today. But tomorrow?    [Nikiforova] Are there political forces -- parties,  movements  -- which would help the people to understand the situation?  Perhaps the trade unions will support the workers?    [Maksyut] Serious work must be done at the enterprises right  now -- to help rescue production and to preserve the work  places. But who will do it? The communist party knows how to do  this, but, unfortunately, it has removed itself from the working  people. The trade unions? Yes, perhaps. But they, in my opinion,  are the same everywhere -- they seek agreements rather with the  government than with the working people. Unless the trade  unions, together with the government, come out against  industry's landslide in the near future, there will soon no  longer be any need for them.    [Nikiforova] All the same, what is the way out?    [Maksyut] Let us ask the people.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   I did ask them. At one of the shops, the way out was  designated in few precise words: re-election of the president  and a change of government. "I used to live like a king on R132  pension, but now I live like a beggar on R80,000," concluded a  worker at the very large shipyard.</p>

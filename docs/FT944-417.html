			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Bangkok slashes tariffs Thailand is from January 1 to slash tariffs on nearly 4,000 kinds of imports, with the emphasis on raw materials and semi-manufactured goods for industry. The move will cut import duties from 100 per cent to a maximum 30 per cent by 1997. The new rates will reduce the average tariff on nearly all imports, excluding farm produce, from 39.24 per cent to 17.61 per cent when fully implemented. The deepest cuts in certain sensitive categories will have to wait until 1997. Mr Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, finance minister, said: 'We need this reform to create an effective link between the Thai and global economies.' The measures would cost the government Bt11.43bn (Pounds 291m) in 1995 and Bt6.24bn in 1997. The tariff system will also be trimmed from 36 different taxes to six. These will range from no tariff on medical equipment, 1 per cent on raw materials such as coal, and electronic parts, 5 per cent for machinery and computers, 10 per cent for intermediate goods, 20 per cent for finished products, to 30 per cent on goods such as silk and leather products, these last two thought to need fairly high protection. The petroleum industry bears tariffs ranging from 30 per cent on naphtha to 60 per cent on plastic pellets. These fall to 1 per cent for naphtha in 1995 and to 30 per cent on plastic pellets by 1997. Artificial and knitted fabrics will have duties cut from 60 to 40 per cent in 1995, and to 20 per cent in 1997. The government can afford to lower tariffs partly because of value added tax.</p>

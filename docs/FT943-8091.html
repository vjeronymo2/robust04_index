			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Mexican Elections: Uninspiring Zedillo keeps policy pledge - PRI man fails to move the crowds, but spells out what he would do Soon after Mr Ernesto Zedillo accepted the nomination as presidential candidate of Mexico's governing Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) nearly five months ago, he pledged to set out in detail the policies he would implement. While his campaign has disappointed many for its failure to inspire the crowds, no one denies he has kept his word in proposing policies. Over the past few months he has given 10 set-piece speeches on the most pressing issues facing Mexico, all but one of which listed 10 points of policy. The speeches covered poverty, foreign affairs, the environment, agriculture, health and culture, (though not, mysteriously, education). Three - on the economy, justice and security, and democracy - are likely to form the policy backbone of the new government he looks likely to run after the election on Sunday. On economics, Mr Zedillo, a former central banker and budget minister, proposes the same pro-market policies that have characterised the presidency of Mr Carlos Salinas. But with the economy apparently stagnant when he made the speech (a recovery, as new figures indicate, was in fact under way), Mr Zedillo felt compelled to explain how he would raise economic growth. The essence of his plan is a 25 per cent increase in public investment in his first year in office, a new state-financed fund for infrastructure projects, and a series of modest tax incentives for private investment and for new businesses. Mr Zedillo does not say whether he will finance the proposals with higher taxes, spending cuts elsewhere, or with a deficit, but he promises that economic growth will be twice as much as the 1.9 per cent increase in population. Mr Zedillo would commit his government to more competition in the financial sector, deregulation of the economy, especially at a state and regional level, further reforms of state-owned companies to make them more efficient, and to giving more money to development banks to subsidise interest rates for small and medium-sized businesses - none of which the Salinas administration would have opposed. On justice and security, Mr Zedillo, seeking to tackle what opinion polls indicate is one of the electorate's greatest concerns - the increasing crime rates and corruption of the justice system - goes further. Mr Zedillo has promised a total overhaul of the country's notoriously corrupt police force. While not clear on how he would do this, he talks about a new police academy, beefed up internal watchdogs to fight corruption, greater co-ordination between federal and state police, a special anti-kidnapping force, and a new data base on known criminals. His programme includes an ambitious but vague promise of an 'integral reform of judicial power'. This includes the establishment of a judicial civil service that would promote honesty and the independence of judges and magistrates; the right to appeal against decisions of public prosecutors; and speeding up the notoriously slow legal process. The legal and judicial reforms indirectly form part of Mr Zedillo's sweeping proposals for a more democratic Mexico. These have met with scepticism, in part because promising democratic change is a long tradition of PRI presidential aspirants that they have rarely lived up to. In what has gained most publicity, Mr Zedillo promised that if elected president he would not interfere in the internal affairs of the PRI and would not choose its candidates for office, including his successor. He would thus be giving up the so-called dedazo (whereby the president points out the candidate to succeed him) that has been the distinguishing feature of Mexican politics, and one of the key factors of presidential power. Instead, Mr Zedillo says before taking office he will propose ways for the PRI to choose its candidates democratically. If he does this, the PRI would change from being merely the electoral arm of the government in power, to something akin to a normal political party in which the rank-and-file have a greater say. Mr Zedillo also proposes beefing up the authority of Congress so that it can better scrutinise legislation, and devolving new powers and resources to the states and municipalities. He promises that he would have good relations with all political parties, and promote the spread of civic groups pushing for democratic changes. Mr Zedillo has been so clear in his democratic proposals that if he ignores them he risks heightening still further the cynicism about his party and the political system. If he is serious and wins on Sunday, he will have little more than three months to work on changing the PRI, before, as he has said, he leaves the party to take care of itself.</p>

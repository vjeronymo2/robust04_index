			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INNOVATIVE APPROACH  </P> <P> In an article (April 2) and subsequent letters, the merits and advantages of  Leimert Park were generously extolled. My father, Walter Leimert, developed the  area in the middle '20s, giving an entire block to the city.  </P> <P> Leimert Park was probably the first community on the West Coast to merge under  one project various developments . . . single-family homes, apartments and  business. Really an innovation at the time.  </P> <P> The homeowner association and building restrictions encouraged proper design,  implemented and maintained abundant tree planting (before the city had a park  department) and set the tone for community involvement. Illustrious architects  were encouraged to design model homes for the middle class. Life magazine  called Leimert Park the "City of the Future."  </P> <P> As a young man in the '40s, I participated in the latter stages of the  development. I am delighted that today Leimert Park is once again experiencing  recognition as truly a lovely place in which to reside and shop.  </P> <P> WALTER H. LEIMERT JR.  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

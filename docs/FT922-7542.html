			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Ocean Wilsons sets sail for sunny Bermuda A 150-YEAR-OLD Brazilian tugboat company is setting sail for the sunny climes of Bermuda. Ocean Wilsons (Holdings), a UK listed company linked to the business empire of the late Sir Walter Salomon, is planning a change in domicile to the offshore financial centre, citing tax and regulatory advantages. Shareholders are being asked to approve a deal in which a new holding company, Ocean Wilsons Holdings (Bermuda), will buy the current holding company in a one-for-one share swap. The London listing will be retained. Three main factors have determined the decision to go offshore. First, the company's profits come largely from Brazil and as a result, Ocean Wilsons has developed a significant problem of unrelieved advance corporation tax. This is deducted from dividends and can only be offset against corporation tax on UK-generated profits. Second, the company needs to deal with the regulatory regimes of both Brazil and the UK, causing a significant administrative burden. Finally, there is no withholding tax in Bermuda and this will allow the company to pay dividends gross to international investors. The company's roots date back to 1837 when two brothers called Wilson who were transporting coal by boat were forced to take shelter in the Brazilian port of Salvador. They liked what they saw and set up an importing/exporting business in the town. In 1908, the company bought its main trading partner, the Ocean coal company in south Wales. In the 1940s and 1950s, the company suffered two blows as first coal was nationalised and then South American debt problems forced it to start disinvesting from the region. But the Brazilian businesses attracted Sir Walter Salomon and clients of Rea Brothers, the merchant bank, made a successful bid for 51 per cent of the shares in 1958. The businesses in Brazil currently include a fleet of 56 tugs, shipping services, property and a Mercedes dealership. Elsewhere, the company has an investment portfolio which includes several stakes in Salomon-linked companies, such as Finsbury Growth Trust (formerly Scottish Cities Investment Trust). In addition, Finsbury Trust (formerly Scottish and Mercantile) owns 23.6 per cent of Ocean Wilsons and Salomon family interests own a further 18.9 per cent. Ocean Wilsons made pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.19m (Pounds 4.41m) in 1991 and earnings per share were 4.6p (4.85p). No final dividend is being recommended but if the deal goes through, the Bermudan company will recommend a gross payment of 2.66p, equivalent to last year's net 2p. If shareholders approve the deal at meetings on June 10, it is hoped that the new shares will be listed on July 13.</p>

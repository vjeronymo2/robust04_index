			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 24 (YONHAP) -- North Korea is willing  to reopen talks with the United States if the latter offers to  suspend joint military exercises with South Korea and tries to  solve the nuclear problem through dialogue, a Pyongyang official  at the United Nations was quoted as saying Wednesday.    KYODO news service reported from New York that the North  Korean official indicated his government would allow additional  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) if  the United States came to the negotiating table.    The official offered neither a confirmation nor a denial  when  asked if North Korea and the United States had been in contact  since the nuclear issue was referred to the UN Security Council.    "No comment," he was quoted as saying.    Washington canceled its scheduled March 21 high-level talks  with Pyongyang after the stalinist state refused to allow full  nuclear inspections by the IAEA.    The agency has referred the matter to the Security Council,  which is preparing a resolution on North Korea for next week.  Seoul and Washington, meanwhile, are seriously considering  resumption of their joint military exercises "Team Spirit" this  year.    The North Korean official expressed high hopes on the stance  of Beijing, which has openly declared its opposition to any  harsh action against Pyongyang such as sanctions.    "We have maintained friendly relations for over 40 years  since the Korean war," KYODO quoted him as saying. "We will  continue to strengthen these relations."</p>

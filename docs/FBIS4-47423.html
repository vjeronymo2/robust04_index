Belkin (Novosibirsk Medical Institute) </F> under the ``Discussion and Readers' Comments'' rubric; received  May 20 92; UDC 616.591-057-02:613.647]-07]    [Abstract] The configuration of an electric field (EF) in  the electric power linezone is totally different from that of an  alternating electric field (AEF): the former is arotating  electric field (REF) characterized by circular or elliptic  polarization, while the AEF has linear polarization. The article  presents data on the response of skin epidermisand cornea of  laboratory animals (unbred white mice) to chronic action of REFs  (with a12.5 kV/m vertical and 11.0 kV/m horizontal EF component)  and AEFs (with a 14.0 kV/mvertical EF component). A description  and the electrical schematic of the experimental device is  presented. It was determined that epidermis is affected by EP  and responds to EP action by stabilizing geometric parameters.  Tumors were detected in animals that had spent long time in EFs  (mainly in REFs). In explaining mitotic activity of epidermis  cells in these animals the author proceeds from the assumption  that induced currents are the main factor in the effect of low  frequency electromagnetic fields. The main process of EF  (currents) interaction in a biological object takes place on the  tissue and cell levels. The organism possesses effective  protection against external low frequency EFs. Acceleration of  rigor mortis had been detected in animals that spent at least  1.5 months in an EF. There is no principle difference between  high intensity industrial frequency alternating and rotating  electric fields. It is concluded that low frequency EFs warrant  further studies. The author contends that it is necessary  perform separatenormalization of the time spent in an EF for  REFs and AEfs. Figures 2, tables 2, references 18: 14 Russian, 4  Western.</p>

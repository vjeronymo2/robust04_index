			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Phoenix recovers to Pounds 173,000 Phoenix Timber Group swung back into the black at the midterm stage as the Essex-based flooring company built upon the improvement shown in last year's second half. Turnover from continuing operations amounted to Pounds 8.58m (Pounds 8.33m) in the six months to September 30, including Pounds 54,000 from acquisitions. After a reduced interest burden, pre-tax profits were Pounds 173,000, against losses of Pounds 525,000. The company stressed, however, that the improvement mainly reflected cost cutting; the market for its main operations remains weak, although trading in the last three months has shown some 'encouraging signs'. Earnings per share emerged at 0.55p, against losses of 1.94p.</p>

The clampdown on crimes against women is part of the city's  efforts to implement the law on the protection of women's rights  and interests.    Li Qiaoyun, vice-president of the city's committee on the  protection of women's rights and interests, said that her  committee handled 1,350 cases of violation of women's rights in  the past 14 months. Over 180 of them were "major" and "knotty"  cases, she said.    The city's people's court and district courts hold public  trials to announce punishment for criminals for cruelty against  women. Li said that the public trials were effective in  "deterring other criminals."    She said that the courts give priority to hearing cases  involving women's rights. Divorce cases involve many "thorny  issues", she said. The issues include support for children,  division of property and housing for the divorcees. The city's  supreme court has expressly imposed favorable provisions for  women in handling such cases.    The municipal people's congress, the city's legislature, is  now striving to pass a detailed bill on implementing the state  women's law within this year.    Since the law on women's protection came into force in  October 1992, a grassroots network of women's protection  committees has been set up throughout neighborhoods and suburban  areas. A medical scheme for women has been initiated in the  downtown district of Chaoyang, providing special medical service  for the 210,000 female employees in the district.    In order to give more say to women in the government, the  present city government has accepted a higher percentage of  women officials than previous ones. Women hold seven of 47  leading posts in municipal departments. Gender representation  was also considered in appointments of lower level officials.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Give to me your surplus workers President-elect Bill Clinton owes his triumph not merely to the delayed recovery from the US recession but also to a widespread belief that the American dream is failing, and that the latest generation will not enjoy the same opportunities as its parents and grandparents had. My inclination had been to shrug off most of this talk as a reflection of the jaundiced attitude towards capitalism of the chattering classes on both sides of the Atlantic. Closer investigation has impelled me to believe that there is something in the complaints; but that there is little Clinton can do to remedy matters. Indeed, the changes are an aspect of the reduction of income differences between American citizens and their geographical neighbours, which progressive politicians ought to welcome but seldom do. A standard analysis of the labour market data appears in an article by F Levy and R J Murnane in the September 1992 issue of the Journal of Economic Literature (JEL). The authors' starting point is that real income per full-time employee was rising by 2.45 per cent per annum between 1947 and 1975, but by only 0.67 per cent in the 1973-88 period. The real median income of a 45-54-year-old man (this means that he is in the middle of the income distribution) rose by more than 20 per cent in the decade to 1958, nearly 41 per cent in the decade to 1968, and by only 1 or 2 per cent in the decade to 1988. The near standstill in hourly pay is clearly associated with the much-discussed productivity slowdown. President George Bush's outgoing Council of Economic Advisers has suggested that a change of gear has taken place, from an underlying 3 per cent annual growth in business sector output per hour up to the early 1970s to 0.9 per cent since then. The squeeze on hourly pay has not been reflected nearly as much in disposable income and spending. Higher participation rates have helped family income. There has also been an increase in the share of property or non-wage receipts such as property returns or social security payments. According to the orthodox tabulations, not only did pay grow more slowly in recent years; but there was among male, although not female, workers a pro-cess known as polarisation or 'hollowing out'. The proportion increased of relatively highly paid men earning more than Dollars 40,000 in dollars of constant 1988 value. But so did the proportion at the bottom end, earning less than Dollars 20,000. It was the numbers in between that fell. The near standstill in earnings dates back to 1973. But I wonder if a study based on families and lifetime earnings, rather than snapshots of pay per worker at any one time, would have come to such dismal findings. Nevertheless, the slogan is that the US has been producing fewer middle-class jobs, in the American popular sense of jobs affording a single family house, car and associated expenditures. In Europe the reference would be to upper-working or lower-middle class jobs - C1s or C2s in media classification. Toleration of 'polarisation' or other disparities depends on the prevailing general trend. As the JEL authors point out, when polarisation of earnings increases around a rapidly rising average, then the poor get richer and rich get richer faster. When it grows around a stagnant mean, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer; and an outcry is to be expected. One explanation of polarisation is the shift away from manufacturing, where the better-paid middle-class jobs had been found. Another factor has been the increased premium on educational qualifications. There has also been a growing differential in favour of middle-aged workers against younger ones, probably reflecting the disadvantages of newcomers in manufacturing, where there have been few new vacancies. Quite apart from these identifiable differences, there have been growing gaps in wages paid by different companies for workers with the same qualifications, which researchers have been unable to explain. The academic studies might have yielded more insights if their authors had looked beyond the US frontier. For we are really seeing a new chapter in a story made familiar ever since western economic growth began to slow down after the 1973 oil price explosion. The US has taken the pressure in the form of stagnant earnings and increased pay disparities. Europe has taken it in the form of inadequate employment opportunities. In 1973, the total number of jobs was very similar in the US to what it was in a group of central and western European countries selected by the OECD. Between then and 1989 (thus excluding the recent recession years), employment in these European countries has risen by a bare 5m, while in the US it has risen by 32m. Even in the 1970s the growth of population of working age could only explain half the difference in job growth between the two sides of the Atlantic. In the 1980s, the demographic disparity explained almost none of the difference, which represents American superiority in finding jobs for a greater proportion of its labour force. In fact, US job growth might have been much greater than the official figures suggest because of the unrecorded influx of workers from Mexico and elsewhere. If there is a large increase in unskilled and semi-skilled labour, relative to capital and other resources, one would expect pay per head to come under pressure in a flexible labour market, and average labour productivity to stagnate as well. These phenomena are a mark not of failure, but of successful absorption of many new workers. Something like this would have happened in Germany if centralised agreements had not prevented wages from coming down to market clearing levels. One hope behind the North American Free Trade Association is that imports of goods will replace immigrant inflows into the US. Even if, against all the odds, this were to happen, pay among skilled workers would still suffer from the pressures of competitive imports. Free trade normally provides an increase in overall national income, but not necessarily for every section of the population. The US still produces much more per head than its main competitors, including Japan, and even its labour market problems are a sign that the Statue of Liberty is, however grudgingly, beckoning workers and goods from less-favoured areas. The orthodox diagnosis of the OECD is that the US needs to save more and invest more, which soon comes back to the old slogan of reducing the budget deficit. My own suspicion is that President Clinton would do more for his country if he left the economy alone and concentrated on removing the laws against soft drugs, and thus acted against the main force for the criminalisation of US society.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------           AVERAGE ANNUAL US GROWTH RATES (AT CONSTANT PRICES)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     1959-69     69-79     79-89 Consumer expenditure per capita       2.8        2.2       1.8 Disposable income per capita          2.9        2.2       1.5 Savings ratio*                        6.5        7.1       4.4 Employment to population ratio*      58.0       59.9      63.0 Hourly compensation**                 0.4        0.3       0.5 Output per hour**                     2.4        1.3       0.8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: OECD, US Economy 1992; * end of period; **non-farm business sector  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

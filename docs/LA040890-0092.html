			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> REPORT SAYS MOSCOW REJECTED MISSILE BAN  </P> <P> The United States last month secretly proposed a ban on land-based missiles  with multiple warheads, but Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev replied that  the plan was too limited, according to a published report. Citing  Administration sources, the New York Times said in today's editions that  Gorbachev complained in a letter delivered last week to President Bush by  Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze that the proposal excluded  sea-based ballistic missiles, which Moscow has long wanted to cut.  Administration officials could not immediately be reached for comment.  </P></p>

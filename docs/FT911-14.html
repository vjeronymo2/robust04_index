			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Bond recovery fails to bring joy to equities Wall Street THE STOCK market remained subdued yesterday in the wake of last Friday's sell-off, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallying only marginally in very light trading from the 50-point drop, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow was 4.25 up at 2,924.42, having spent most of the day in negative territory. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in similar fashion, recovering 1.02 on balance at 376.76, while the Nasdaq composite picked up 0.51 to 493.93. Turnover on the New York SE totalled just 130m shares, while rises showed a small lead over falls at the finish by 786 to 742. On Friday it was the sharp fall in bond values which led share prices lower, but yesterday's modest recovery in the bond market failed to stimulate a similar movement among stocks. The weakness in the US economy continues to trouble investors, who can see little reason to invest more of their money in equities. Yesterday's industrial production data provided no real comfort on the economic front. Although the data showed an expected 0.1 per cent increase in April production, the Federal Reserve also revealed a revised 0.6 per cent decline in March production, previously estimated at 0.3 per cent. Banks featured, with American Express dropping Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 22 3/4 on turnover of 4.1m shares after announcing that it would take a Dollars 144m pre-tax charge to account for the 28 per cent stake held by Shearson Lehman Brothers, its securities subsidiary, in First Capital Holdings, the troubled Californian life insurance group. Bankers Trust was down Dollars 1 at Dollars 48 5/8 after the New York-based banking group confirmed it was laying off 200 staff, while JP Morgan, which had been actively bought since it was announced over a week ago that the stock would join the Dow index, slipped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 50 3/8 on meeting profit-taking. Square D jumped Dollars 6 3/8 to Dollars 87 3/8 after the company agreed to the bid by Schneider, of France, of Dollars 88 a share, or Dollars 2.23bn. AT&amp;T bucked the trend, firming Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 36 1/2 in active trading after reports that the merger with NCR is proceeding faster than expected. On the over-the-counter market, Nordstrom jumped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 44 on turnover of 1.5m shares on the back of an improvement of almost 100 per cent in first-quarter profits. Apple Computer climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 52 3/4 on volume of 2.2m shares after the company introduced its System 7 operating system software and said it would cut prices on logic board upgrades and memory kits for the Macintosh. Metcalf &amp; Eddy fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 15 1/4 after the water treatment and waste management company issued a second-quarter profits warning. Canada AFTER spending most of the day in lower territory, the Toronto market managed a mild recovery during the afternoon to end on a mixed note. The composite index was finally a net 2.9 up at 3,492.7 but declining issues still held an edge over advances by 273 to 240. Volume amounted to 21.6m shares, down from Friday's 23.3m. Lincoln Waste Management topped the most actives list after one of the company's largest shareholders and one of its directors sold more than 4m shares, approaching one-fifth of the session's moderate volume. The share price was steady at CDollars 10 7/8 . John Labatt, which rose CDollars 1 to CDollars 23 5/8 , said it is considering selling its JL Foods Inc unit.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- A draft report on tax  reforms released Friday [17 June] by the government's tax  commission calls for the shelving of part of a proposal that  would reduce tax privileges for small businesses.    The report said a plan to lower the maximum annual sales,  below which businesses are allowed to keep the consumption tax  they have collected from consumers, from the present 30 million  yen, should be shelved.    The report was released at a general meeting of the  commission.    The commission is expected to present a report on a set of  tax reform recommendations, focusing on income tax cuts and a  raise in the consumption tax from the present 3 percent, to  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on June 22.    The draft report also said the maximum annual sales for  businesses to which a simplified tax computation formula is  applicable should be cut from the present 400 million yen but  did not propose a margin for reduction.    It also called for a revision of the present system of  allowing businesses with annual sales of less than 50 million  yen to keep some of the consumption tax income.    The report did not propose a specific margin of increase for  the consumption tax but did say tax burdens for Japanese will  grow from increased fiscal demand for welfare measures.    It also said the combined maximum tax rate for income and  residential taxes should be cut to 50 percent from the present  65 percent.</p>

The sides talked about the necessity to strengthen the  bilateral parliamentary ties as a basic element for the  improvement of the Romanian-Hungarian relations.    Oliviu Gherman termed the inexistence of interparliamentary  relations of the ruling party and the opposition forces in  Romania with their counterparts in Hungary as "illogical and  contrary to bilateral interests" and said that as long as UDMR  (Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania -- an ethnic party  with representation to Romania's Parliament -- e.n.) is the sole  parliamentary representative of Romania to the Hungarian  Parliament, the progress in the bilateral parliamentary  relations will be "insignificant". Gabor Kuncze remarked that,  given the short time lying before the present Hungarian  legislative, the bilateral parliamentary relations between the  two countries could be intensified after the new legislative  assumes duties.    Both sides agreed that all possibilities should be used to  improve Romanian-Hungarian relations, and that keeping up false  tensions is to the interest of neither party. The president of  the Romanian Senate gave assurances to the Hungarian guests  that, before its term is over, the Romanian legislative body  will ratify the Romanian-Hungarian agreement for the mutual  protection of investments.</p>

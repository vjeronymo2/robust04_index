			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / A new year - and new realities: Barry Riley predicts that there will be no easy ride in the securities market in his gloomy 1993 forecast WE BEGIN 1993 with the bull market in UK equities now at a fairly mature stage. Since the end of September 1990, when prices bottomed amid Gulf war gloom and just ahead of the temporary euphoria of Britain's entry to the European exchange rate mechanism, the All-Share index has climbed by 42 per cent. In the meanwhile, company profits have fallen and the British economy has shrunk by about three per cent. Now the global economy is in trouble too, especially in continental Europe where the internal problems of Germany are spilling over to the rest of the European Community and beyond. There is nothing surprising about this euphoria amid the gloom. It is the way the cycle works. I can vividly remember the fuss 20 years ago on the day that the stock market hit a new high and unemployment simultaneously reached 1m. One day early this year, the same could easily happen except that the jobless figure will be 3m. But investors should be aware that by the time serious economic recovery begins, the fun will probably be over for quite a long time. Pension funds have been able to rule off 1992 with their portfolios - mostly of UK and overseas equities - showing an overall rate of return (capital growth plus income) of some 19 per cent for the year. Given a rise in their pay-linked liabilities of only five or six per cent, they have emerged surprisingly well from a traumatic year. However, the investment performance has been notably fragile, and has depended entirely upon the resurgence since the end of August when the markets began to anticipate the ERM capitulation. In four months, the All-Share index has jumped by a quarter. A second point to bear in mind is that pension fund actuaries do not take much notice of market values. They look at dividends, which actually fell by one per cent over 1992. The yield on the All-Share has declined to 4.3 per cent against a long-run average of about five per cent. On this basis, the pension funds are not doing particularly well. Nor is there any chance at all that dividends will grow vigorously in 1993, because although company profits should recover somewhat, first priority will be given to restoring balance sheets and rebuilding dividend cover. Conditions have been unusually favourable for equities in the UK during the past few months. Short-term interest rates have come down sharply, and long-term rates have eased too, partly because pressure from government gilt-edged sales has been temporarily reduced as a side-effect of the support for sterling in the run-up to Black Wednesday. Despite soaring share prices, there has been almost no supply of shares through new issues. Pension fund managers have consequently been able to dive back into a limited pool of equities and push prices up, which helps their performance and their fees but which, as I have pointed out, does not necessarily benefit the pension schemes themselves. There is scope here for a dangerous overvaluation of the UK equity market which arguably has begun to happen, with industrials selling on 17 times 1992 earnings, and might go further in the early part of 1993. A new year will bring new realities, however. Surely a great many companies will seek to take advantage of the bull market by launching rights issues: the banking and insurance sectors alone could soak up billions if they can pluck up the nerve to ask their shareholders to pay for past blunders. More importantly, the government's budget deficit looms above everything, with requirements for gross gilt sales likely to reach Pounds 1bn a week during 1993, and probably no less during 1994. Institutional cash flow runs at about Pounds 40bn, so there are obvious gaps, presumably to be filled by private investors or by foreigners. There is little doubt that life insurance companies will divert most of their cash flow of Pounds 25bn a year to UK government securities. This had already started to happen by the third quarter of last year, when life offices bought Pounds 4.3bn of gilts. But pension funds bought hardly any, and indeed they now have such a weak cash flow that they have little capacity to absorb gilts unless they make room in their Pounds 350bn portfolios by selling existing holdings of equities. As a first step, they can sell overseas equities, which may be one reason why the UK market is becoming expensive by international standards. Later on, the fear of an eventual funding crunch could increasingly overhang the UK stock market, although any actual crisis is more likely to happen in 1994 rather than during the coming year. To some extent, this general pattern was evident in the US in 1992, leading, in fact, to an almost complete stalemate in which bullish and bearish forces were just about perfectly balanced on Wall Street. But that was something of a freak which is unlikely to be repeated in the UK. My central expectation is that share prices in London will hit a high point early in 1993 and then be subject to increasing pressures, although it may still be possible to make money in recovery stocks and second-liners. The problems will centre on one or two nasty moments as the Bank of England seeks to price its gilt-edged auctions. In the 1970s, in similar circumstances, the authorities resorted to interest rate manipulations in order to tempt investor to buy gilts at supposedly unrepeatable interest rates. This time around, the Grand Old Duke of York could possibly conduct his main manoeuvres in the foreign exchange market as the Bank of England endeavours to lure international investors into UK bonds, which they have shunned since sterling was pulled out of the ERM. A lot depends, of course, on the vigour of the British economy. A year ago, I thought most of the forecasters were too optimistic; this year, I am inclined to believe that, if anything, the short-term gloom is overdone, although that is not the same as saying that I am optimistic. There has been a substantial monetary stimulus, and money market interest rates may well be cut to six per cent by the spring. But a simple consumer-led recovery would quickly run into a brick wall in the foreign exchange market. Back in the early 1980s, we could spend and borrow our way out of the recession because there was a balance of payments surplus and the private sector carried no more than an average debt burden. This time, we are in a much deeper hole, and the recovery must be led by manufacturing or it will not be sustainable. For the time being, the French and the Germans are doing the UK a favour by rendering their manufacturing sectors uncompetitive, and the renewed strength of the dollar is helping, too. But for this kind of UK recovery to happen, there needs to be a sharp rise in the domestic prices of manufactured goods. Even in a deep recession, there are powerful inflationary forces in the British economy. Without inflation, it is hard to see any way out of the crisis in the housing market and, without inflation, it will be hugely expensive for the government to finance its borrowing binge. The temptation for the government to engineer another sterling depreciation will grow. But in those circumstances, investors might prefer to buy hard currency bonds instead of gilts. We can get out of the ERM but we cannot avoid exchange rate disciplines. So do not expect an easy ride in the securities markets in 1993.</p>

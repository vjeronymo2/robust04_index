Although it was expected that the U.S.  would shelve the project, the base will be significantly smaller  than originally planned. It has been reported that white  welders are being recruited in South Africa to assist with the  construction of "steel structures" near Gaborone, later  identified as oil tanks necessary for the fuel supply to the  planned air force base. This information confirms earlier  reports that the rail link from Gaborone to the American base,  approximately 90 kilometers from the town, will not be built  anymore, otherwise the tanks would have been built on the base.  It is said that without the rail linkage the military  capabilities of the base will only be a quarter of what it would  be with rail links.    The base is being completed under huge financial pressure.  The American defense budget has been drastically cut and will  be further reduced. Several U.S. air force bases have been  closed and the construction of new bases contravenes the  country's fiscal policy. Added to this is the change in the  French government's Africa policy. From the expected 1 billion  rand cost of the project, the figure now stands at 2 billion  rand. The French, whose contribution to the cost of the base  would be approximately 700 million rands, chiefly undertaken for  a contract to be awarded to the French concern Batignolles --  with Anglo American and LTA as subcontractors -- do not want to  pump any more money into the project. French Prime Minister  Balladur, in a sensational shift in policy, discontinued all  financial assistance to black African states.    The cost of the base, at the escalated cost of 2 billion  rand, means that there is a significant shortage of funds and  were it not for the political importance of such a base,  construction plans would have been dropped. The fact that it is  still being completed on its drastically reduced budget hints at  the American determination to use the project as a political  threat against the whites of South Africa. According to reports  the original plan was to transfer American troops stationed in  Somalia, to the new base in Botswana in April. It is still  possible that a small force may fly from Mogadishu to the  Botswana base, but in the meanwhile, the political clout of  Clinton's opponents, including Ross Perrot, has increased to  such an extent that the deployment of any American troops in  Africa is a political risk he can do without. It is said that  the whites should, therefore, not be intimidated by the American  military exhibition but that it should be realistically  evaluated. The military threat from Botswana has probably not  disappeared, but at least we are aware of the size of the threat.</p>

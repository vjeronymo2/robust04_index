			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Westminster left with series of puzzles The week started with Lord Archer looking forward to a long-awaited return to the Conservative political establishment. It ended with his hopes of preferment in Mr John Major's ministerial reshuffle apparently in ruins. Westminster meanwhile was left last night with a series of puzzles. Conspiracy theorists focused on the decision by the Department of Trade and Industry to break with precedent and confirm that Lord Archer was indeed the subject of an investigation into alleged insider dealing. Had it deliberately ruined his chances? Others wanted to know why 10 Downing Street had not moved to quell the mounting speculation in recent weeks that Lord Archer was at last to be rewarded for his years of dogged performances before the Tory faithful. Then there was the question of why Lord Archer himself had seemed so confident that his time had come. Those who have spoken with him in recent weeks have not been left with the impression of a man fearful of the future. In retrospect it is clear that Mr Major was unlikely to have been able to offer a job to the flamboyant novelist and Tory peer - least of all the post of chairman of the Conservative party which he coveted. The prime minister has known since February that Lord Archer was one of the subjects of an inquiry into share dealings in Anglia Television before its takeover by the media conglomerate MAI. Mr Major could not have given him a post until the investigation was completed. The judgment of political friends was that Lord Archer will eventually be exonerated. No one except a handful of inspectors in the DTI actually knows whether they are right - and the DTI investigations are incomplete. Lord Archer has done some less-than-sensible things during his 25 years in the limelight but he is judged by friends and enemies alike as fundamentally honest. He has at least Pounds 20m in the bank and as much again promised for his next batch of novels. So there was no obvious reason why he should throw away his reputation by dealing himself or passing on tips on the basis of inside information. Nor is Lady Archer an obvious candidate for the role of secrets trader from the Anglia boardroom. Yesterday Lord Archer decided to say nothing to the journalists staking out his Thameside penthouse apartment. But his demeanour over previous days had suggested he was convinced the investigation would not prevent him from being given a job in the government. Yesterday the DTI appeared unable to explain convincingly why - with the explicit approval of Mr Michael Heseltine - it had so publicly dashed that dream. The most likely thought offered by officials was that if the department had refused to confirm reports already circulating in the City, the government would have been accused of a cover-up. Mr Major could not afford another 'sleaze' story. Equally, it would have been entirely improper for the prime minister's office to have discussed the investigation - or its implications for the reshuffle - with Lord Archer. It is a cliff-hanging ending. The question is whether the result of the DTI probe will come before or after the re-shuffle.</p>

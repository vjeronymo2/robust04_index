			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One group stated that NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  controls should be required because NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions cause other adverse health and environmental effects besides contributing to ozone formation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA agrees that high NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions can contribute to air pollution problems independent of their role in ozone formation; however, the EPA disagrees that the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  controls required under section 182(f) of the CAA should be implemented in the DFW area regardless of their impact on ozone. Because ambient air monitoring shows that the DFW area is in attainment for the nitrogen dioxide NAAQS standard, the EPA does not believe that the current level of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions pose a public health or environmental risk in the DFW area. In addition, section 182(f)(2)(B)(i) specifically provides for an exemption in cases where NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission reductions would not contribute to the attainment of the NAAQS for ozone in the area. The TNRCC has demonstrated that the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reductions required by section 182(f) would be in excess of the emission reductions necessary for attaining the ozone NAAQS. Finally, for the purposes of reducing acid rain deposition, certain NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  sources will still be required to reduce NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions under Title IV of the CAA. For these reasons, the EPA does not believe that the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  controls required under section 182(f) of the CAA should be implemented in the DFW area regardless of their impact on ozone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One group questioned whether the current ozone standard of 120 parts per billion provides sufficient protection of public health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA does not believe that this comment is relevant to this rulemaking action on the section 182(f) petitions for DFW and El Paso. The EPA is currently reviewing the ozone primary and secondary standards and will address concerns over the current ozone standard through a separate rulemaking process. If the standard is revised, the EPA will determine at that time what action is appropriate for attainment SIPs and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exemption petitions that had previously been approved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One group felt that EPA's action to propose conditional approval of the State's exemption petitions without the attainment SIPs was premature and denied adequate public input on the issue. They commented that EPA should wait until the State actually submits the attainment SIPs before making any determination as to the feasibility of the two areas actually achieving the NAAQS for ozone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA disagrees with this comment for several reasons. The EPA does not believe its action proposing approval of the petitions was premature. As explained in the FR notice which proposed approval of the petitions (see 59 FR 44386), the attainment demonstrations rely on VOC regulations contained in the 15 percent RFP SIPs which had previously gone through public comment, State adoption, and submission to the EPA. For this reason, the EPA did not anticipate that the substance of the final attainment demonstration SIPs would differ from what had already been submitted to the EPA by the TNRCC in the section 182(f) exemption petitions. In addition, the EPA further explained that the EPA would not take final action to conditionally approve the petitions for each area unless and until the State had submitted the attainment demonstration SIPs to the EPA in accordance with section 182(c)(2)(A) of the CAA. Therefore, the EPA has waited until the State submitted its attainment SIPs before making any final determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA believes the public has had adequate opportunity for public comment. The control strategies contained in the attainment SIPs had previously gone through public comment and State adoption as part of the 15 percent RFP SIP. In addition, the State proposed the attainment SIPs on July 27, 1994. The State's public comment period on the attainment SIPs closed September 2, 1994, while the comment period on the EPA's proposed action to conditionally approve the petitions closed on September 28, 1994. The proposed attainment SIPs were therefore available for public review for two months prior to and during the EPA's public comment period on the proposed action on the petitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the EPA's action to approve the petitions is conditioned upon the EPA finally approving the modeling portion of the attainment SIPs, which will provide another opportunity for comment on the adequacy of the attainment SIPs as a basis for the section 182(f) exemptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three groups provided a generic comment arguing that NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exemptions are provided for in two separate parts of the CAA, section 182(b)(1) and section 182(f). Because the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exemption tests in subsections 182(b)(1) and 182(f)(1) include language indicating that action on such requests should take place ``when [EPA] approves a plan or plan revision,'' these commenters conclude that all NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exemption determinations by the EPA, including exemption actions taken under the petition process established by subsection 182(f)(3), must occur during consideration of an approvable attainment or maintenance plan, unless the area has been redesignated as attainment. These commenters also argue that even if the petition procedures of subsection 182(f)(3) may be used to relieve areas of certain NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  requirements, exemptions from the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  conformity requirements must follow the process provided in subsection 182(b)(1), since this is the only provision explicitly referenced by section 176(c), the CAA's conformity provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA disagrees with the commenters regarding the process for considering exemption requests under section 182(f), and instead believes that subsections 182(f)(1) and 182(f)(3) provide independent procedures by which the EPA may act on NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exemption requests. The language in subsection 182(f)(1), which indicates that the EPA should act on NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exemptions in conjunction with action on a plan or plan revision, does not appear in subsection 182(f)(3). And, while subsection 182(f)(3) references subsection 182(f)(1), the EPA believes that this reference encompasses only the substantive tests in paragraph (1) (and, by extension, paragraph (2)), not the procedural requirement that the EPA act on exemptions only when acting on SIPs. Additionally, paragraph (3) provides that ``person[s]'' (which section 302(e) of the CAA defines to include States) may petition for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exemptions ``at any time,'' and requires the EPA to make its determination within six months of the petition's submission. These key differences lead the EPA to believe that Congress intended the exemption petition process of paragraph (3) to be distinct and more expeditious than the longer plan revision process intended under paragraph (1). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

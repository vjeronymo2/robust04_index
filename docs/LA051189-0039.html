			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S., SOVIETS AGREE TO NEW TALKS ON LONG-RANGE ARMS  </P> <P> The United States and the Soviet Union have agreed to resume their negotiations  to reduce long-range nuclear weapons in mid-June, ending a six-month freeze  imposed by the new Bush Administration, U.S. and Soviet officials said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The decision to resume the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks, or START, was the  main tangible result of a day of talks between Secretary of State James A.  Baker III and Soviet officials that also produced a glimmer of hope for  U.S.-Soviet cooperation in ending Third World conflicts from the Middle East to  Central America.  </P> <P> "We are very pleased with the way things started," Baker told reporters midway  through the first day of his first visit to the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Gennady I. Gerasimov, said the  Kremlin had high hopes for the talks and welcomed the Americans' new emphasis  on Third World trouble spots.  </P> <P> "Dealing with regional problems will enable us to get the last of the Cold War  behind us," he said.  </P> <P> At the same time, however, Gerasimov expressed the Soviet government's  impatience with theBush Administration's slow approach to arms control, and  jumped the gun on Baker by publicly announcing the agreement to resume the  START talks a day before U.S. officials expected.  </P> <P> "We think our negotiators have had enough holidays," Gerasimov said. "We have  lost a lot of time. While diplomats are on vacation, arms are piling up. We  understand the specifics of the U.S. political system, but we regret the time  lost. . . . We have lost six months."  </P> <P> The Reagan Administration negotiated the outline of a strategic arms agreement  with the Soviet Union last year, agreeing on a reduction of roughly 50% in  intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear-armed manned bombers.  </P> <P> But the Bush Administration called off the scheduled resumption of the talks on  Feb. 15, saying it needed more time to decide what new mobile missiles to build  and to settle on a negotiating strategy.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, the Administration has decided to build limited numbers of  both the MX and the Midgetman mobile missiles and has decided on a basic  approach in negotiations: to cling to the essential positions the Reagan  Administration held.  </P> <P> "We are ready to proceed in general on the basis of the work that has been done  (in last year's START talks), and we expect the Soviets to see considerable  continuity in our positions," an Administration official traveling with Baker  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Resuming June 12 or 19  </P> <P> Gerasimov told reporters that the two sides had agreed to resume the talks in  Geneva on either June 12 or June 19 and that the first round would probably  last six weeks.  </P> <P> He said the Soviet Union had proposed that the talks begin this month, but the  United States objected, saying that Bush's nominee as chief negotiator, Richard  R. Burt, is unlikely to win Senate confirmation that soon.  </P> <P> Despite the broad agreement on cuts to 6,000 nuclear warheads and 1,600  delivery vehicles on each side, serious points of potential conflict remain,  including the Soviet desire, resisted by the United States, to reduce  sea-launched cruise missiles and restrict the Strategic Defense Initiative.  </P> <P> The Soviet government of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has also been visibly  uncomfortable with the Bush Administration's long pause in East-West diplomacy  -- and with the comments of some U.S. officials, notably Defense Secretary Dick  Cheney, that Gorbachev's ambitious reform program is probably doomed to  failure.  </P> <P> Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze pointedly raised Cheney's comments with  Baker in their first meeting on Wednesday and was told by Baker that President  Bush views the Soviet reform program, or perestroika, as "a very positive  development," a U.S. official said.  </P> <P> "If we raised the subject (of Cheney's comments), it is not because we were  offended in any way," Soviet spokesman Gerasimov said. ". . . The U.S. side  assured us it was his personal opinion. We realize that Cheney needs more money  for military programs -- and how can he possibly obtain it if the Soviet threat  is going away?"  </P> <P> Baker's initial meeting with Shevardnadze, scheduled for 25 minutes, lasted  almost an hour -- an encouraging sign, officials said.  </P> <P> Baker is scheduled to meet with Gorbachev today.  </P> <P> On the so-called regional issues, on which Baker aides said they wanted the  meeting to focus, there was only fragmentary progress, U.S. officials said.  </P> <P> Soviet officials said they consider Israel's proposal for elections in the  Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza strip "worthy of attention," a phrase that  a U.S. official called "encouraging but not definite." But at the same time,  Gerasimov told reporters that the Soviet Union would reject as "a deceit" any  election that did not include the Palestine Liberation Organization.  </P> <P> A U.S. official said that his Soviet counterparts rebuffed a plea to the  Kremlin to stop dealing with Libya and other countries that the United States  considers to be terrorist states.  </P> <P> On Central America, Shevardnadze repeated the Kremlin's proposal for a total  ban on arms shipments to the region, a proposal the United States has rejected.  But officials on both sides said that some common ground had been reached,  including a joint commitment to a negotiated peace in Nicaragua.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Afghanistan Discussed  </P> <P> On Afghanistan, Shevardnadze again asked the United States to halt its military  aid to the Muslim rebels fighting the Soviet-backed regime in Kabul. Baker  reportedly turned that request aside but agreed that the two countries should  talk about a possible peaceful resolution of the decade-old civil war.  </P> <P> On human rights, Gerasimov said the United States promised to seek the repeal  of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act if the Soviet Union's new and  more liberal emigration policy is enshrined in law. The Jackson-Vanik Amendment  ties U.S. trade to Soviet restrictions on Jewish emigration.  </P> <P> Baker's day in Moscow also included an unusual political event: a meeting  between the secretary of state and three newly elected members of the Congress  of People's Deputies, the first freely elected Soviet legislature since the  1917 revolution.  </P> <P> Baker, who managed Bush's 1988 presidential campaign, invited the three new  legislators, all strong proponents of perestroika, to talk with him at the U.S.  ambassador's residence.  </P> <P> Asked by reporters whether he believes the United States should work directly  with the new congress -- much as foreign governments approach Congress in  Washington -- Baker said: "Let's see how it evolves. Perhaps so."  </P> <P> Asked whether he plans to dispense any campaign advice, Baker smiled and said,  "I might be getting some from them."  </P></p>

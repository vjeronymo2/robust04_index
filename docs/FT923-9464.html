			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: Schering lifts sales to DM3.4bn SCHERING, the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, lifted sales by 5 per cent to DM3.4bn (Dollars 2.23bn) in the first six months of this year. Earnings at DM179m were down 4 per cent compared with the same period last year. Lower profits from subsidiaries were blamed, but Schering forecast that earnings for the year would be slightly above the record DM274m earned in 1991. The DM660m sale of Schering's industrial and organic chemicals operations to Witco Corporation in the US was cited as a contributing factor to the projected higher earnings. Schering said it wanted to concentrate on pharmaceuticals and plant protection chemicals as its market share in the other sectors was too low to permit expansion. Pharmaceuticals sales in the first half rose 14 per cent to DM1.9bn, contributing 57 per cent to total turnover. Agro-chemicals, which made up 25 per cent of sales, fell 10 per cent to DM857m. Schering placed responsibility on drought conditions in Europe and recent EC agricultural measures. The company said a decision was expected in the next few days on the sale of Schering's electroplating division. Negotiations were continuing with a US company. Electroplating sales fell in the first half by 5 per cent to DM143m.</p>

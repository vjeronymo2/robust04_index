			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Sport: The cars are the same, the countries have changed - Motor racing TO NICK BRITTAN, former British saloon car racing champion-turned-motor sport impresario, 25th anniversary re-run of the 1968 London to Sydney car marathon seemed a good idea as he relaxed in an armchair in the balmy days of August 1990. Four months later, escaping Kabul on a Russian aircraft popping heat-seeker decoys every ten seconds to fool the Mujahedin's SAM missiles, he was starting to wonder. This, after all, was just the preliminary route survey. Afghanistan, part of the original route, was 'off'. Nevertheless, over Christmas that year Brittan made his decision. The marathon, he announced to the world's media on January 16, 1991, was on. And so, Saddam Hussein made clear just a few hours later, was the Gulf war. Next Saturday the marathon finally starts from London's Chelsea Harbour after long periods of uncertainty. For months, route surveying teams plotted the marathon's course - through Yugoslavia, Azerbaijan, across the Caspian by ferry, then on, loosely following the ancient silk road, to Bokhara, Samarkand and Tashkent. And, one by one, the areas exploded into conflict. The rally competitors' intended hotel in Sarajevo, Brittan notes in a March 1992 diary entry, 'no longer exists'. By the turn of this year, he recalls: 'I was having nightmares that all 15 countries on the route were in the process of declaring war on the country next door. I would wake relieved to discover that this was only half true'. The current geo-political realities will thus be uncomfortably to to the fore of competitors' minds when, at 8am next Saturday, the official starter lets slip the dogged by war. From Chelsea Harbour the 106 crews, in period cars ranging from American Ford Mustangs through Porsche 911s to Lotus Cortinas and Austin 1800 'Landcrabs', will make their way through Belgium, Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Turkey, India and Australia. These are not the 15 countries originally on the route. To most crews' chagrin, they are not even the 12 countries still on the route little more than a month ago. But then even Brittan had not expected to have author Salman Rushdie among his last-minute logistical problems. Last year Brittan persuaded Iran to open its borders to a motor sport event for the first time in 20 years, Brittan acknowledges his heart sank when the death fatwah on Rushdie was renewed in February. Since then, relations with the UK have plunged into the deep freeze. Brittan was detained for 24 hours inside Iran while on a final survey of the Iran / Russia leg, and felt he had no option but to reroute the rally yet again. It is far removed from the original marathon of 1968, when competitors' main concerns were with avoiding breakdowns and suicidal kangaroos rather than diplomatic incidents. However, it is the new world order that has almost certainly allowed the rally to take place at all. A commercial deal unthinkable just five years ago means the entire rally is to be airlifted past the trouble spots by two giant Russian Antonov freighters which dwarf even US Air Force's mighty Galaxies. Two Antonovs have been converted by their privatising owning company to twin cargo decks. Each aircraft is can swallow 60 rally vehicles. The Antonovs will airlift the rally from Turkey to Delhi. After a five-day blast around the Indian subcontinent, taking in the Himalays, competitors will be airlifted en masse from Bombay to the final, 10-day race across Australia. It is in the bleak vastnesses of the Nullarbor Plain and other remote areas of the Outback where the rally's winners and losers will be finally decided. The structure of the 1993 rally is inevitably regarded with mixed feelings by the 25 competing crews who also took part in the original event. Foremost among them are Andrew Cowan and Colin Malkin, who as outright winners in 1968 will be first away from the Chelsea Harbour start line in the very same Hillman Hunter they took to victory. Is it, then, just a nostalgic event - a 'fun run' for those wishing to test again the high-speed prowess of their youth? Brittan, as organiser, says it is not. He has designed the rally to be hard and competitive, with the sole concession that it will halt each night rather than bash on for days on end as in 1968. By the time survivors reach Sydney on May 16, after 30 days and 11,500 miles of driving, they will have raced through 46 'special stages', each timed to the second and ranging in length from 10 to 168 km. The age, gender and motivations of the crews vary widely. Many of the 46 Australian crews are hard-charging youngsters. Cowan and Roger Clark, another veteran in his 50s and perhaps Britain's best known rally driver, will almost certainly remain faster than all of them. At the other extreme is 66-year-old Pamela Morgan from Southampton. Entered in a Morgan two-seater sports car. She describes herself as 'a tough old bird. I had too many kids around in 1968. Now I have the freedom I'm off on this great adventure'. That, allowing a decade or two, is roughly the spirit in which I am tackling this event with Neville Marriner, Daily Mail photographer and part-time racing driver, in our Lotus Cortina. It is the spirit, too, in which we are being backed by the Unipart group and its 4,000 employees, with each sponsored mile clocked up adding to the coffers of the Save the Children Fund. And it is the spirit in which so many other sponsors are taking part. 'It's a welcome departure from the rarified high-tech world of modern world championship rallying,' says Brian Carte, chief executive of main event sponsor Lombard North Central, the NatWest-owned finance house which backed the UK's RAC world championship rally for 19 years. Parts trucks and helicopters and many of the other standard apparatus of modern world championship rallying are banned. Even the Automobile Association is coming along. Four patrolmen, in specially-equipped back-up vehicles, will provide the rescue service for casualties. They are the winners of a contest in which no fewer than 3,000 AA employees took part . . .</p>

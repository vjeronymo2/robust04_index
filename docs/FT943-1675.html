			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Bank dispute likely to be resolved The African Development Bank hopes to resolve a dispute paralysing its soft loans subsidiary at next month's International Monetary Fund meeting in Madrid, much clearer. Most requirements have been met and it's not unlikely something will be signed,' Mr Ernest Achonu, bank information officer, said. The subsidiary, the African Development Fund, normally lends Dollars 1bn a year on easy terms. But it has not functioned since last year, because of a wrangle over lending conditions. Donors wanted only countries with per capita incomes of more than Dollars 1,054 per year to be regarded as acceptable credit risks and allowed to borrow from the bank; countries with incomes of Dollars 543 or less would borrow only from the fund.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Defense Minister Mario Henriquez </F> by unidentified reporters in Guatemala City on 8 April; from the  "Telepress" newscast]    [Text] Government Minister Danilo Parinello and Defense  Minister Mario Henriquez arrived at Congress today after being  summoned to report on measures adopted by their offices to  confront increased violence in Guatemala. Before appearing  before the plenary session, General Henriquez spoke to reporters  about the congressional initiative to ask the United Nations to  appoint a special rapporteur for our country.    [Begin recording] [Henriquez] The legislative branch has the  right to make such a decision.    [Reporter] Do you think it could negatively affect  Guatemala?    [Henriquez] If it was made by all of the deputies, I will  respect the congressional decision to request a rapporteur. I  believe Congress has the authority to do this.    [Reporter] Do you think the presence of a rapporteur is  unnecessary?    [Henriquez] I believe the presence of a rapporteur is  unnecessary, because we have already signed a human rights  agreement, and, perhaps -- I do not know for certain --  approximately 100-150 UN representatives will come here to  review the human rights situation.    [Reporter] Could the congressional measure sway the peace  agreement [words indistinct]?    [Henriquez] I do not think so, because, as I have said, we  already have expert advisers on human rights, a human rights  ombudsman, a Human Rights Commission in Congress, Cofrere  [expansion unknown], and Dona Monica Pinto [not further  identified]. We have everything we need, and, to comply with  the general human rights agreement, many more people are going  to come here. Therefore, one more rapporteur does not mean a  thing.    [Reporter] However, the human rights ombudsman has stated  that his resolutions are not being accepted by several  organizations, including the government and [words indistinct].    [Henriquez] I believe the resolutions issued by the Human  Rights Ombudsman's Office or the ombudsman himself are accepted  and mean a great deal. I have received several resolutions or  admonishments [words indistinct]. [laughs] They were  resolutions to censure, for example, the recruitment of a minor.  I, of course, respected the resolution. I am talking about my  personal experience. It was an admonishment. The resolutions  move your conscience, and they must be respected.    [Reporter] Could the presence of a special human rights  rapporteur in Guatemala corroborate the international petition  to dissolve the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols? Would the Army  be willing to dissolve the patrols if a rapporteur specifically  requested this?    [Henriquez] One thing has absolutely nothing to do with the  other. It is not the Army's responsibility to dissolve the  Civilian Self-Defense Patrols. The government of the Republic  has to do this. However, this issue has already been outlined  in the agreement with the URNG [Guatemalan National  Revolutionary Unity]. The agreement clearly states that  voluntary civilian defense committees will remain in place until  the guerrillas disappear. Furthermore, the recommendation made  by the 50th Human Rights Conference in Geneva was that the  government should start demobilizing the voluntary civilian  defense committees in those areas where guerrillas are no longer  present. We will start doing this on 30 June.    [Reporter] My next question refers to the investigations  into  the case of Dr. Obdulio Chinchilla. He says he told you he had  received death threats. What can you say about this?    [Henriquez] I am going to talk about this issue in a few  minutes. I can tell you right now, however, that he did not  talk to me. I thank God that he is alive, and I hope there  never is another attack against Deputy Chinchilla Vega.  Nevertheless, he did not talk to me at the time. He talked to  the head of the ministerial command staff, and I am sure he will  confirm this later.    [Reporter] [words indistinct] you made investigations?    [Henriquez] We paid a lot of attention to these charges. For  example, Father Giron [not further identified] called me  yesterday to say he was being threatened. I immediately offered  him security and provided security to him. Chief Justice Juan  Jose Rodil Peralta also told me he had been threatened, and I  sent him security personnel the same day. It seems a wave of  terror has started, and we have to stop it because it is time  Guatemala [words indistinct].    [Reporter] [question indistinct]    [Henriquez] In general, there is security for people because  it is the government's job to provide security and to assure the  people. However, the most likely targets are top-ranking  officials, politicians, and military officers. On an individual  basis, they have to be more careful, and the government must  provide these people with more security.    [Reporter] Mr. Minister, the possibility that a soldier  might be implicated in the attack against Deputy Duilio  Chinchilla Vega was mentioned by Deputy Chinchilla Vega himself  days before the attack. At the same time, he said...    [Henriquez, interrupting] He spoke with that soldier. He  received an anonymous note, and he spoke with that officer.  That officer is with me now.    [Reporter] [words indistinct]    [Henriquez] That is what we are going to discuss now.  Colonel Fernandez Ligorria was mentioned. He is none other  than the chief of the ministerial staff. Deputy Chinchilla Vega  met with him, not with me. They discussed the matter, he was  offered security, and so on, and so on, and he left without a  fuss.    [Reporter] What do you think should be done to counter the  current wave of violence? Some areas are under a state of  emergency. What actions do you recommend?    [Henriquez] I believe some measures should be implemented.  This is precisely what will be done, following instructions from  the president of the Republic, and it will be done without  having to implement a state of emergency in accordance with the  five cases mentioned in the Constitution. We hope that the  press and all Guatemalans will take note of this. The measures  will be announced soon, no later than next week. The government  minister has only been in his post for 17 or 18 days, but he has  been working on this in coordination with the Guatemalan Army.    [Reporter] What will those measures be?    [Henriquez] We prefer not to disclose them yet, because if  there are 30 [words indistinct], many criminals, and terrorists.  Why should we alert them? There are about 500 car thieves. We  must be cautious when we talk about such things. Some degree of  secrecy is necessary in certain cases to achieve our objective  -- namely, guaranteeing the personal safety of civilians, peace,  and harmony.    I am very pleased to know that state employees have lifted  their strike and that an agreement has been reached. This means  the situation will soon return to normal.    I wish Congress and the judicial branch could work in  harmony  for the benefit of all Guatemalans. I would like to see the  press comply with its sacred duty of reporting objectively and  truthfully. Guatemala would be a beautiful country, right?    [Reporter] Mr. Minister, former President Vinicio Cerezo has  said former soldiers were implicated in the current wave of  violence that is creating a nationwide crisis. Although he did  not mention names, there are rumors that those involved could be  Colonel Menardo Perussina and others who retired from the Army.    [Henriquez] I would not dare mention any names. I know all  of them, and, frankly, I believe it is very unlikely that a  retired officer would engage in destabilizing activities. In  addition, the Army has its own means of information. It has  intelligence and counterintelligence services to detect such  actions. If any of these men were involved in any wrongdoing,  we would likely already know about it, and certainly the defense  minister would have called them in and reprimanded them.    If it is confirmed that they are involved, they will be  tried  and punished according to the law. However, I do not think this  is the case. I read about former President Cerezo Arevalo's  statement. He said some civilians and retired officers could be  trying to destabilize the country to promote a coup. He was  probably referring to those who destabilized his government.  There are many rumors and a great deal of speculation. I would  like this to stop in Guatemala, because sometimes friendships  are lost because of such rumors. This should not happen.    [Reporter] Mr. Minister, you just said the Army has its own  intelligence and counterintelligence services. Why then have  the murderers of Jorge Carpio and those responsible for other  attacks, as well as those individuals behind the nationwide wave  of violence, not been identified yet?    [Henriquez] That is why I said we have our intelligence  agencies, but it is not easy to detect terrorists. I have also  noted that even in the United States, the only superpower in the  world at this time, terrorists managed to introduce large  quantities of explosives into those tall buildings in New York  -- what are they called, the twin towers in New York? -- and set  off a large blast, killing people. This happened right on the  noses of the FBI, the CIA, and a huge military. You see, it is  not that easy. For example, we would like to find out right now  who killed Epaminondas or who attacked Chinchilla Vega and  announce to the press: Gentlemen, this person did it. I would  like to do that, but sometimes I feel helpless.    [Reporter] Are there any clues?    [Second reporter] It has been reported that someone was  arrested in connection with Epaminonda's murder.    [Henriquez] I have no knowledge of that. What I know is that  the technical investigations are ongoing and that there is a  good chance of arresting the murderer. [end recording]</p>

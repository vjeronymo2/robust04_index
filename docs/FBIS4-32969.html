			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marcela Gutierrez from the "ACIR Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] The Foreign Secretariat reported on today's meeting  between Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello and 10 representatives of  the print media. The main topic discussed was the 21 August  elections. Tello said Mexico is not harmed in any way by the  arrival of representatives from other countries or international  organizations to learn how the Federal Electoral Institute is  organizing the elections. He added the presence of observers  from the United Nations and other international organizations  helps to dispel any doubt that may exist about the elections.    The official noted Mexico has nothing to hide. It is quite  the contrary, he said, since we must not only convince the  public here but our friends abroad. The foreign secretary was  confident the elections will be conducted in total peace because  the people of Mexico do not want violence and do not advocate  violence as a way to settle disputes. To conclude, he added  that one cannot rule out irregularities in the 21 August  elections, but he said he was confident any irregularities would  be minimal and would not undermine in any way the whole  electoral process.    During the meeting that lasted a little over two hours,  Manuel Tello commented on the purchase of crowd control  equipment. He said the Mexican government purchased it to  replace the existing equipment that was acquired in 1972 or 1973  but was never used. He indicated this may not have been the  best time to purchase the crowd control equipment considering  the controversy over the purchase. He noted, however, any  responsible government has to have this sort of equipment.    Commenting on the visit by U.S. Democratic Congressman  Robert  Torricelli, who arrived on Friday in Mexico City, the foreign  secretary said he is fully convinced the visitor will be highly  impressed by the great effort Mexican society has made through  its organizations and political parties to guarantee honest  elections. He added Torricelli will go to Chiapas State where he  may meet with Subcommander Marcos.    On another matter, Tello said the Mexican Government is  holding talks with the Cuban Government to agree on the date in  which President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will visit the  Caribbean island, but he declined to comment further.</p>

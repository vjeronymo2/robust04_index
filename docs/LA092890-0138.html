			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE FACULTY HAS SECOND THOUGHTS;  </P> <P> SENATE: CONCERN OVER FUNDING FOR MOVE TO NCAA DIVISION I CITED BY TEACHERS.  </P> <P> The uneasy marriage of academics and athletics at Cal State Northridge took a  turn for the worse Thursday when the university's faculty senate approved a  motion expressing concern over the intercollegiate athletic program's move to  NCAA Division I.  </P> <P> The motion, as presented by math professor David Ostroff, centers on finances.  The faculty senate believes that the athletic program is receiving funds that  could be put to better use in instructional programs.  </P> <P> While the motion leaves athletic program officials disappointed, it does not  constitute an official action. CSUN will stay at Division I in all sports  except football for at least three years. That is the minimum period required  by the NCAA after a division change unless the university fails to fulfill the  obligations of its divisional status.  </P> <P> Just two years ago, the senate unanimously approved the move, but the economic  climate since has changed dramatically. Like all universities in the Cal State  system, CSUN's budget was cut this school year, by $6.6 million. As a result,  the Oviatt and South libraries are closed on Sundays except before final exams,  fewer classes are being offered and faculty research projects have been  delayed.  </P> <P> During the hourlong discussion several senators gave impassioned pleas about  spending money on athletics when students are on waiting lists for classes and  cannot use the library. But CSUN President James W. Cleary assured the senate:  "Not one red cent of lottery monies goes to athletics.  </P> <P> "There is at least some implication that the athletic department receives more  funds than it is entitled to," Cleary continued. "That simply is not true. It  receives the state monies it is entitled to in the formula of the state system.  In terms of this budget reduction, this department will expect to suffer every  other cut that other departments are going through."  </P> <P> But Louise Lewis, chairwoman of the Educational Resources Committee, wants to  be sure that the faculty is carefully monitoring the athletic program's  dollars.  </P> <P> "We want to send out a signal that we want to be consulted and involved," she  said.  </P> <P> Cleary, however, already has established a watchdog that includes faculty  members and students. The University Intercollegiate Athletic Oversight Board  will be in place by Oct. 22.  </P> <P> It might clear up the misconceptions referred to by by one senator who was  unsuccessful in his bid to have the motion tabled: "I am amazed by the lack of  scholarship and research," he said. "I don't think there has been any  clarification about what this whole thing is about."  </P> <P> For example, several senators expressed concern that the athletic program is  getting funds from the Cal State Northridge Foundation that should go to  "instructionally related activities." But the foundation can do what it wants  with its money.  </P> <P> The foundation's board of trustees decides where its money, gained primarily  from food services and the campus book store, will go. And it comprises six  faculty members as well as six students and three administrators, including  Cleary. It not only grants funds to athletics, but it provides funds for  everything from band uniforms to faculty research projects.  </P> <P> Another sore spot with senators is the full-time equivalent or FTE program with  regard to the athletic program. The state bases its funding on the number of  FTEs -- students taking at least 15 academic units.  </P> <P> "Those people (coaches) are not earning their keep as far as FTEs," senate  faculty member Dr. Jane Bayes said.  </P> <P> She was immediately corrected. Not only do CSUN coaches gain FTEs by teaching  in the kinesiology and physical education department but by coaching. In the  Cal State system, participation in a sport is considered a course.  </P> <P> Bayes also said: "It is difficult to believe we are not going Division I in  football when we are building a stadium."  </P> <P> Cleary said the stadium has been in the works for 20 years and that it is  needed for commencement exercises, football, soccer and concerts.  </P> <P> The voice of the students at the meeting came from Michelle Cooper, student  body president.  </P> <P> "I am not an athlete but I still feel athletic programs benefit students. Many  students who participate might not otherwise be able to attend a university and  their athletic participation often provides their motivation for academics."  </P> <P> Bob Hiegert, CSUN athletic director, was particularly disappointed with the  senate's motion.  </P> <P> "Emotionally, it is not a very happy afternoon," he said. "A lot of the issues  discussed in there were on an emotional level. What we do with regard to FTEs  and meeting the formula of the state is our business. We've had it reviewed by  the appropriate administrators."  </P> <P> He added: "We've had a successful run for 20 years (in Division II). We've  outlived our mode. Division II does not fit the pattern any more. We started  this change five to six years ago. We worked through the proper channels."  </P> <P> Hiegert and Cleary also noted that the difference in budget between Division II  and Division I could not solve CSUN's funding problems.  </P></p>

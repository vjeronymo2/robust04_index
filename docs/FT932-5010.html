			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Air route bids turned down THE US Transportation Department yesterday dismissed 10 applications by US airlines to fly new routes between the US and the UK, saying the authorities sought were not available under the present aviation agreement between the two countries. Some route requests stemmed from the requirement that USAir dispose of its existing US-UK route authorities as part of its tie-up with British Airways. United Airlines had offered to buy the USAir route authority between Philadelphia and London if it could move the US end to Chicago and the London end from Gatwick to Heathrow. Northwest Airlines made a similar offer for USAir's Baltimore-London authority, seeking to switch the US end to Detroit. It had been suggested that, if these proposals were approved by the US and UK authorities, it could signal a more co-operative approach toward the liberisation of the skies between the two countries. Other applications dismissed included Delta's request to fly between New York and Heathrow, and New York-Manchester. But the DoT said that it was intent on achieving a 'new, liberal bilateral understanding with the UK' and that 'this focus on comprehensive reform necessarily eclipses short-range goals, including the acquisition of rights to serve a few particular routes'.</p>

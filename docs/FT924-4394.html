			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: French bonds rally as speculation increases over devaluation of franc FRENCH government bonds rallied up to half a point on hopes of lower interest rates, as the performance of the French franc in the foreign exchange markets continued to come under close scrutiny. Dealers said that as the French franc came under pressure against the D-Mark  -moving from DM3.40 to approach DM3.41 - there was increased speculation that the French currency might be devalued or even pulled out of the European exchange rate mechanism, paving the way for the Bank of France to cut domestic interest rates. The December bond future contract ended at 110.16, up 0.50, while in the cash market the yield on the bond due 2003 ended at 8.26 per cent, against its previous close of 8.33 per cent. THE Bundesbank again stressed its commitment to keeping domestic interest rates high in order to conquer inflation, putting a dampener on several of the European government bond markets at the opening yesterday. The German government bond market fell in the morning following the publication of a newspaper interview with Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, who said there was no room for monetary policy easing in the near-term. The March Euromark futures contract fell sharply from 92.11 to 91.92 as hopes of lower interest rates were dashed. However, after a weak start to the day, German government bonds picked up and prices closed either slightly firmer or little changed. The Liffe bund futures contract, which closed Monday at 91.04, fell to a low of 90.93 and then traded up to 91.05 by late afternoon. Treuhand, the German privatisation agency, issued DM4.0bn of 10-year bonds with a coupon of 7 3/8 per cent and at an initial price of 100.50. The bond was priced to yield 7.30 per cent at issue. Additional portions of the bond will be sold via the traditional bond consortium, the results of which are due today Dealers said the issue was not well received. While the issue is deliverable into the DTB bund futures contract, it will not be deliverable into the Liffe bund contract until the June 1993 delivery month. US Treasury prices were mixed across the maturity range yesterday in the wake of more bullish economic news. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at 100, yielding 7.561 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  1/16 at 99 19/32 , yielding 4.824 per cent. Although the day's economic news was predominantly positive, which is usually bad news for bonds, the market managed to post solid gains at the long end. This was primarily because investors do not fear a revival of inflation, and because they had already discounted the day's statistics, which included the October index of leading economic indicators, which rose 0.4 per cent, and the November National Association of Purchasing Management's index, which climbed from 50.6 in October to 55.0 last month. Later in the day, shorter-dated paper was sold off following comments from Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, about the possibility of lowering the Fed's target range for M2 - the broadest measure of money supply. Although such a move would be made on purely technical grounds, dealers said it would bring current M2 growth clearly into the target range, thus giving the Fed a reason not to cut interest rates again. UK government bonds rose about  3/8 of a point ahead of today's Pounds 2.5bn gilt auction, making up some of the ground lost on Monday. Dealers noted a squeeze on gilt prices ahead of the auction of the 8 per cent gilt due 2003. JAPANESE government bonds closed higher. The Nikkei stock average ended down 370.61 points at 17,313.04, leading to hopes that the Bank of Japan will ease monetary policy.</p>

			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 300 FILIPINOS ARRESTED IN SMOKING CRACKDOWN  </P> <P> Police in suburban Quezon City said today that they have already hauled into  jail about 300 violators of a tough anti-smoking law that took effect a day  earlier.  </P> <P> Those arrested were locked in holding cells until charges could be prepared  against them. After a few hours, they were released pending trial.  </P> <P> The dragnet snagged not only scofflaws but also unwitting violators.  </P> <P> One 19-year-old youth arrived today at the police station, puffing on a  cigarette, carrying food for a friend arrested earlier for unauthorized  smoking.  </P> <P> The teen-ager was thrown into the cell with his friend after police explained  the smoking ban applies in police stations too.  </P> <P> The new ordinance bans smoking in most public places, including buses,  restaurants, government offices, hospitals and theaters in the city of about 1  million, part of metropolitan Manila.  </P> <P> Violators who smoke in public places that are not designated for smoking face a  $10 fine or 10 days in jail or both.  </P> <P> "No complaints so far," said Col. Rodolfo Garcia, police station commander and  a reformed smoker, speaking about the crackdown. "The people are even pleased  because we are protecting them."  </P></p>

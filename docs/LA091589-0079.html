			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> HORTOBAGY'S FARE STAKES OUT A BIT OF TRANSYLVANIA  </P> <P> Something must have been very wrong with Count Dracula. Why else would a landed  nobleman living in a country blessed with richly satisfying cooking have  developed a taste for human blood? Worse yet, he made a laughingstock of his  Transylvanian homeland.  </P> <P> Transylvania (since World War I a part of Romania) is no laughing matter at  Hortobagy (hor-toe-bazh) Hungarian restaurant in Studio City. Transylvanian  goulash and Transylvanian flekken are prominent on this venerable restaurant's  menu.  </P> <P> Hortobagy has been serving reliable Hungarian peasant cooking for a long time  -- I've even written appreciatively about it, though some years ago. In the  intervening flood of restaurant developments, however, I'd forgotten about it.  But there it is still, now huddling next to a multistory office building where  you navigate the big curve on Ventura Boulevard in Studio City. After so many  years and so many changes in eating habits, it hadn't seemed possible that it  could still exist.  </P> <P> Entering its pristine interior did nothing to alleviate my fear that the whole  experience was a dream, that if I spoke, the peasant decor would turn to stark  white and the food to dust. Far from it. Although the maternal waitress who  once picked up my plate, looked at it, put it down and said, "Eat your  potatoes!" is gone, little else seems to have changed.  </P> <P> The prices are low, as always. Most lunch entrees are $5.25, and dinners  (including a four-course prix fixe dinner) are about $9.80. Hard as this is to  believe, it's harder still to believe that the food, on the whole, is really  good, and the portions large. This might be among the last of the inexpensive  homey ethnic restaurants that once bridged the culinary gap between bland  American cooking and pretentious French cuisine.  </P> <P> At Hortobagy, it was comforting to rediscover among the appetizers the savory  red cabbage vitalized with caraway seeds, vinegar, black pepper and brown  sugar. I liked it so much that it stayed on the table through the main course  so I could dip into it from time to time as a condiment. It goes well with  everything on the menu. The cucumber salad -- cucumber slices, with onion in  vinegar -- though refreshing, was awfully tame by comparison. And although  there was nothing wrong with the chopped liver, it was as flat as an unseasoned  egg salad, which it resembled.  </P> <P> The prix fixe dinner is characteristic of a meal at Hortobagy. After the red  cabbage comes a plate overflowing with meat and potatoes. In this case, the  meat is two generous slices of richly flavored marinated roast pork. The  potatoes are also unexpectedly flavorsome, infused, I imagine, with meat juices  and black pepper. Included in the dinner is a palacsinta and coffee. Palacsinta  is an egg-batter crepe offered with apricot jam filling with or without ground  walnuts and sugar. Either way, it is a memorable dessert, one which might well  bring you back for more.  </P> <P> The main dishes are meats either roasted, breaded with a light hand or served  with a fairly delicate cream sauce. The roast duck, half a bird, was almost  painfully plain, but crisp and moist nonetheless. There are various breaded  veal and pork cutlets, and the cream-sauced dishes are the goulashes. They are  not stews as we usually think of them (except for the goulash soup), but rather  good-sized tender chunks of veal waiting to be broken open and washed with the  surrounding rich sauce. Uncharacteristically, among generally moist meats, the  sliced veal was dry, unlike the Transylvanian flekken, which unites a pork  cutlet with the potatoes and red cabbage whose marinade permeates the meat.  </P> <P> These dishes were basically the sustenance of herdsmen on the vast Hortobagy  plain. A fitting tribute to those hearty eaters is Hortobagy's wood platter,  mounded with enough food to more than satisfy two tired road jockeys worn out  from wrangling Colts and Mustangs on the Ventura Freeway.  </P> <P> Counting from top to bottom, it consists of a rasher of crisp bacon, a large  sausage, two deep-fried mushroom caps, two large deep-fried meat loaf  croquettes so well-spiced and textured I thought that they were sausages, a  pork chop, two pieces of fried liver and two breaded veal cutlets, all mounded  on top of copious portions of potatoes, red cabbage and rice cooked in broth.  Except for the liver, which had its life cooked out of it, this daunting  display of excess (at the most unexcessive price of $22.80 for two people) was  so tasty that two urban eaters finished it off with gusto.  </P> <P> For dessert, the palacsinta was even better than I remembered. The other  desserts, alas, have not worn well over the years. Plum dumplings, once an  amazing confection (of steamed potato dough filled with dark plum jam), were  soggy and over-sweet. The mocha torte was no longer the light-textured  cream-filled cake I remembered, although it still looked like a mini-terry  cloth bath towel draped over its plate.  </P> <P> Like many national cuisines, Hungary's is far more complex than one restaurant  can offer. Although Hortobagy offers only the hearty type of Hungarian cooking  (I am still waiting for fish, goose and fruit dishes), it's one of the best  restaurant values in the city and I'm very glad it's still there.  </P> <P> Eat your heart out, Count Dracula.  </P> <P> Recommended dishes: goulash soup, $5.90; wood plate (for two), $22.80;  palacsinta, $1.50.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hortobagy, 11138 Ventura Blvd., Studio City. (818) 980-2273. Open noon to 10  p.m. Tuesdays through Sundays. Beer and wine. Cash only. Parking lot. Dinner  for two, food only, $20-$35.  </P> <P> </P></p>

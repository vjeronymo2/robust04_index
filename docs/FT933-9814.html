			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Letter: Price of others' privilege Sir, The arrogance is breathtaking. The advice given by their professionals, whether good or bad, has to be paid for. The sums lost to the UK by some of those 500 City firms wishing to be left in peace are enormous. Yet they have the impertinence to wish to withhold rights to other traffic to traverse their habitat - all in the name of security of their own lives and possessions and the enjoyment of peace and a better environment. I have no doubt that those working and living in the City benefit by the restrictions, but why should the rest of us have to pay for this enormous privilege; they are requesting it for no better reason than that it suits a tiny coterie thriving on nepotism. A short trial of the measures in the quasi-holiday period is not proof of anything except the wish to rush them through before the enormity of the obstructions is realised by the general public. The householder has no right to the street in front of his building - the City has no right to annexe its streets in the name of its own well-being. Edward N Addison, chairman, The Addison Tool Company, Elliott House, Victoria Road, London NW10 6NY</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, March 16 (AFP) -- Russia will probably  join NATO's Partnership for Peace plan of military cooperation  with former communist states by the end of the month, NATO  sources said Wednesday [16 March].    The announcement eased concern of some NATO officials who  had  said Moscow was laying down conditions for joining the program  for closer contacts between the armies of the former Warsaw Pact  group and Western forces.    Russia's decision was announced to ambassadors of the  16-country North Atlantic Treaty Organization at a regular  meeting, the sources said, although no date for Moscow's entry  was set.    Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will travel to Brussels to  sign Moscow up, the sources said.    But even as the sources spoke of military cooperation  between  NATO and its former arch-enemy, Russia's defense minister  insisted in Moscow that Russia was still a power to be reckoned  with and should not be treated just like any other partner in  the plan.    The U.S.-sponsored initiative offers former Warsaw Pact  countries military cooperation in training, maneuvers and  planning as a first step toward full membership at some  unspecified point in the future.    It was devised as a way to help provide the greater security  sought by these countries and at the same time avoid  antagonizing the Russian military at a time of growing  nationalism and volatility in Russia. The program was launched  in January.    Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told reporters  Wednesday in Moscow that Russia welcomed cooperation but not  integration with NATO and that it would join the Partnership  "within its own parameters."    In order to participate, he said, "other countries in East  Europe will have to change their armament and the way they train  their troops. Russia is a huge country with its own military  technology and its own armament, and cannot be integrated into  NATO. It can only cooperate."    So far 12 former Soviet republics and other former East Bloc  states have joined the Partnership. The latest is Moldova,  which joined Wednesday.    NATO officials have been concerned in recent weeks by what  they said were conditions set by Moscow for taking part.    The officials said Moscow had been told the plan could not  be  modified just to satisfy Russia, but that dialogue with the  Russians was possible in recognition of the country's military  importance.    Under the plan, participants are entitled to political  discussions with NATO only when they come under serious threat.  Grachev has said NATO -- obliged by its charter to defend any  member in danger -- should not decide on its own on military  engagement in a hot-spot but rather consult with Russia first.</p>

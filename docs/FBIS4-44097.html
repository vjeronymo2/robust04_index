			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mitterrand: Fighting </F> Euroskepticism"]    [Text] In an interview with the Greek Government daily TA  NEA [as published], the text of which was released by the Elysee  [presidential office] press department yesterday, President  Francois Mitterrand recommends "bringing Europe closer to its  citizens."    Speaking on the eve of the Corfu summit, the head of state  did "not deny that certain external phenomena" -- the slowing of  world growth, jittery financial markets, and international  disturbances -- could "affect or even delay" the "process for  the unification" of Europe.    However, he insisted: "It is precisely during these  difficult times that we must stand firm." To fight  "Euroskepticism," he called for "the wise reform of institutions  and practices in order to bring Europe closer to its citizens,  to take into account the aspirations of its peoples, and to  improve the operation of the Union to make it more efficient."    For Francois Mitterrand, the constant enlargement of the  Union should not make it too ponderous and thus reduce its  decisionmaking capacity and ability to act. Europe, he stressed  forcefully, is not just "a geographical zone, but a collective  will, with institutions that now deserve to be touched up to  inject fresh impetus."    As for the risk, mentioned by some people, of a trend toward  a "German Europe" as a result of the enlargement toward Austria  and the Scandinavian countries, the head of state stated:  "Neither France nor Germany want to make a French or German  Europe." In his opinion, the "will" of the two countries, whose  "union is of course fundamental," is "to create a free,  prosperous, and democratic Europe for the whole continent."</p>

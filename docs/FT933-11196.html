			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Unitech down to Pounds 10m in poor Japanese trading PRE-TAX profits at Unitech, the electronic components maker, fell from Pounds 14m to Pounds 10.5m in the 12 months to May 31, hit by poor Japanese trading conditions for the second successive year. The shares rose by 10p to 258p as a strong market rewarded the proposal to raise the final dividend to 4p (3.75p), making 6.1p (5.85p) for the year. Earnings per share were 7.3p (13.2p). The 1992 comparisons have been restated under FRS 3. Pre-tax profits, which suffered a net non-recurring loss of Pounds 103,000 but were flattered by a Pounds 600,000 gain on exchange rates, were struck on reduced turnover of Pounds 252.9m (Pounds 253.5m). Mr Peter Curry, chairman, said profits of the Japanese subsidiary declined 49 per cent to Pounds 3.6m. Operating profits dropped to Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 17m). Net interest payable fell to Pounds 4.51m (Pounds 5.14m). Net debt was Pounds 62.3m (Pounds 40.9m), giving gearing of 58 per cent (43 per cent). COMMENT FOR all of management's clever attempts to broaden its market, as a quasi-commodity business serving the global power supplies market, Unitech should be a Cinderella stock. Fortunately for shareholders it has a listed Japanese Prince Charming in Nemic-Lambda. This handsome business is currently attracting interest because its recently difficult market seems to be recovering. Unitech's stake alone could be worth as much as the whole company, giving a gross asset value per share of about 430p, compared with yesterday's closing price of 258p. With corporate unbundling all the rage, the shares are likely to trade on these calculations rather than a pre-tax profit forecast of Pounds 15m and a prospective multiple in the high-20s.</p>

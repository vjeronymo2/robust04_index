According to Helio Vigio, chief of the DAS [Counter-Kidnapping  Headquarters], the main drug traffickers from the Comando  Vermelho and Terceiro Comando gangs have established illegal  enterprises to supply men and weapons and plan the collection of  ransom, and they even have experts to negotiate with the  kidnapped victims' families.    According to police, Flavio Negao, from the Vigario Geral  slum, and Orlando Jogador, from the Alemao and Marcelo Xara  slums on Varginha Hill, besides being drug traffickers also  kidnapped people and stole bullion in the past four months. "The  news now is that smaller gangs are kidnapping minor businessmen  to raise money to buy drugs," said Inspector Placidio Guimaraes,  DAS operations chief.    Other gangs, like that of drug trafficker Robertinho from  Parada de Lucas slum, which is linked to the Terceiro Commando,  rent sophisticated weapons for kidnapping and bullion robbery  operations. They also provide men for operations in exchange for  a percentage of the ransom. Joel de Oliveira Carvalho says he is  "an expert in negotiating with the victims' families" and also  provides other services to kidnappers.    Vigio says drug traffickers usually buy drugs in return. "If  police discovers one of their drug caches, they need to find  money quickly to buy more drugs and not lose their supplier," he  said.    According to DAS, there currently are seven kidnapped people  in Rio de Janeiro.</p>

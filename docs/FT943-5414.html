			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A bottle of Spanish Australian - Wine This is the time of year when ambitious southern hemisphere winemakers are heading for the vineyards of Europe, there to double their vintage experience and exchange high-tech expertise for a sniff round the cellars of the Old World, where they are temporarily employed. The Australian giant Penfolds, for example, is flying in a team to Val d'Orbieu, its opposite number in the Languedoc. Ocker meets paysan. The usual distinguishing features of these winemaking incomers are that they need gumboots (to satisfy their obsession with water and winery hygiene) and much less sleep and food than the natives ('the wine doesn't take a lunch hour or weekends, mate'). They also tend to work at low, low temperatures and add special antioxidants and yeast nutrients so that the wines taste immediately appealing if more uniform and vapid than traditional models. At a giant tasting of wines made mainly last year, Safeway brought some of us wine writers up short by deciding to group its wines by whether they were made by itinerant oenologists ('flying winemakers'), or by what they almost patronisingly called 'local talent'. It was rather shocking to realise how rapidly it has become a novelty that a wine should be made by someone who has watched the vines bud, leaf and flower throughout the growing season, someone whose livelihood is necessarily linked to the fortunes of that wine region. I thought of this when I tasted recently, chez Sainsbury, the peripatetic Hugh Ryman's Santara Chardonnay 1993, Pounds 3.95 at the top 120 stores. It actually comes from Conca de Barbera in Spanish Catalonia (where the Chardonnay for Miguel Torres' revered Milmanda is grown) and yet, to my palate at least, it is pure Australia, effusively fruity and ready-to-gulp, 'with the added complexity of a light oak flavour', according to the back label. Smell those wood shavings. Santara is probably a very smart move on Sainsbury's part as the prices of Australian Chardonnay from Australia continue to rise, but Spanish and Australian wine producers should feel shivers down their respective spines. Compare and contrast with, for example, La Porcii Chardonnay 1992, Pounds 5.99 at larger Tesco stores. In this case an Australian winemaker, Yalumba's Brian Walsh, seems to have relished his winter playtime in the northern hemisphere by celebrating the differences between his regular diet of South Australian fruit and this Languedoc Chardonnay, doing his damnedest to transform it into a Montra-chet. Served at exactly the right temperature (not too cold) this rather unappetisingly named wine could be taken for something much smarter than a Vin de Pays d'Oc, and reflects glory on both Australia and the Languedoc - although I should point out that neither Conca de Barbera nor the Languedoc have a long history of Chardonnay production to be used as a stylistic guide by incoming winemakers. There are, fortunately, instances of incomer winemakers who take the local style and smoothly move it up two or three gears so as to provide an entirely new cruising speed for the region's own winemakers. Last September the glamorous Gaetane Carron flew in to north-east Italy from her principal employers Concha y Toro in Chile and leaves us with the stunning Pinot Grigio Ca'Pradai 1993 Bidoli, Pounds 3.49 from Asda, which is remarkably similar to her Pinot Grigio 1993, Grave del Friuli, Pounds 3.99 from Safeway. Quite unlike the tart, anaemic norm that has been Pinot Grigio, her version is full, soft, and quite dramatically more fruity and long-flavoured. Bravissima. Really attentive readers of this column may remember that elsewhere in Italy last year, the flamboyant Australian winemaker Geoff Merrill was beavering away on behalf of Sainsbury's wine department. By far the most appealing result, as far as this warped, varietally conservationist palate is concerned, is Sainsbury's Teroldego Rotaliano, Pounds 3.95 which is a deep, inky, red with lots of tang and just as much lively fruit, but no harsh tannins whatsoever, so that it could be served at almost any temperature and would be very delicious gently chilled. Merrill was also responsible for Sainsbury's Grechetto dell'Umbria, Pounds 3.69 which is another admirably distinctive rendition of a local grape variety - in this case a scented dry white with real backbone, good fruit, a little bit of bite, and a dire label. It is a proportion of Grechetto grapes which so usefully distinguish Antinori's delicious Cervaro - about Pounds 20 from Italian specialists such as Valvona &amp; Crolla of Edinburgh - from any other barrel fermented Chardonnay. I am all for incomer winemakers who show their respect for the native region by interpreting what it has to offer, and preferably showing the locals how to make that something even more appealing to the outside world. Nick Butler's whistle-clean Sainsbury's Moravian Gruner Veltliner 1993 Pounds 2.95, for example, is just the sort of lively, punchy, racy, unmistakeably central European wine that we all hoped would flow from the Czech Republic. Hugh Ryman himself has done wonders for tons of Semillon and Sauvignon grapes in south-west France. His Ch l'Ortolan 1993 Entre-Deux-Mers, Pounds 3.95 at Sainsbury's, is just one of many current examples, and Thresher/Wine Rack/Bottoms Up have many more. But I find it unsettling when 'local talent' and actual location are blatantly ignored in favour of a commercially expedient reproduction of a style that belongs on the other side of the world.</p>

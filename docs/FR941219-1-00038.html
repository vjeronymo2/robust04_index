			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In today's notice, NHTSA is proposing 1,500 cycles for the flaw tolerance and pendulum impact tests, and the more severe alternative of 18,000 cycles for the drop test. This is consistent with the manner of cycles specified in NGV2, after which the agency is patterning its proposal. However, since NHTSA has no authority to require the periodic inspection of CNG containers, the agency requests comments on whether 1,500 cycles is adequate to assure the safety of a CNG container throughout its life. As a alternative, the agency is considering requiring 18,000 cycles for the flaw tolerance and pendulum impact tests. This is consistent with the pressure cycling test in FMVSS No. 304 and with the drop test where no inspection would be involved. It would also represent the worst case scenario for a container which sustains damage early in its service life, but may not be subsequently inspected, since 18,000 cycles represents four refuelings per day, 300 days per year for 15 years. The agency requests comments on the appropriate number of cycles for the flaw tolerance, pendulum impact, and drop tests to assure the safety of the traveling public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Flaw Tolerance Test <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1&hyph;18(f)(1) of NGV2 sets forth a flaw tolerance test, which evaluates a container's ability to withstand external damage caused by abrasive material scratching a container, NHTSA is proposing to adopt the flaw tolerance test in NGV2 with some minor modifications. The agency's adaptation of these performance requirements and test conditions and procedures is set forth in sections S7.8 and S8.8 of this notice's regulatory text. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGV2's flaw tolerance test specifies that the container shall be tested ``without evidence of distortion, deterioration or failure'' and ``show no evidence of flaw propagation <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  or other physical damage likely to weaken the container appreciably.'' as explained in the earlier discussion on the environmental cycling test, these performance requirements contain subjective criteria that the agency believes need to be modified to be objective and enforceable. The agency believes that the terms ``without deterioration or failure'' and ``other physical damage likely to weaken the container appreciably'' are unreasonably ambiguous and broad. Therefore, the agency has decided not to include, in the proposed requirement, the terms ``deterioration'' and ``failure'' and the phrase ``other physical damage likely to weaken the container appreciably'' since these terms are not sufficiently objective to include in a Federal standard and would not provide measurable criteria for enforcement. The agency welcomes comments about ways to refine terms to make them objective. In addition, the agency requests comments on whether there are other terms, such as fiber delamination, which should be incorporated and how they could objectively be defined. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Propagation is defined as ``enlargement or extension (as of a crack) in a solid body. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Instead, the agency is proposing a modified version of the NGV2 pass/fail criteria for the flaw tolerance test that states that when cycle tested, the CNG container ``shall not leak or permanently change in external configuration or dimension.'' In addition, NHTSA is proposing an additional performance provision to prohibit the growth of a longitudinal cut made in the container. NHTSA has added the prohibitions against leakage and increase in the size of cut since compliance with them can be objectively determined. It is also consistent with the flaw tolerance test's safety goal and with the performance requirements for the presence cycling test and the hydrostatic burst test in Standard No. 304. The agency previously discussed the no distortion criterion in the environmental cycling section and request similar comments here. In addition, the other requirement being proposed for the flaw tolerance test is that the ``cut made in accordance with S8.8 for the purpose of this test shall not increase in length, width or depth as a result of this test.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has tentatively determined that it is also necessary to depart from certain aspects of NGV2's flaw tolerance test procedures and conditions to make agency's flaw tolerance test objective and repeatable. As proposed in this notice, these modifications include specifying the precise dimensions and location of the flaw. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGV2 specifies that a cut be made in the other wall at approximately midlength and that the cut be not less than 0.75 mm (0.030 inches) in depth. The agency is proposing additional provisions to make the proposed FMVSS more precise, thereby increasing the test procedure's objectivity and repeatability. For instance, the agency is proposing to amend the standard to specify that the cut be 0.75 mm wide. The agency tentatively believes that these dimensions represent abrasions that containers may experience as a result of contacting road debris. However, the agency requests comments on the cut's dimensions, including the appropriate width, and whether the length, width, and number of such cuts should be increased. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

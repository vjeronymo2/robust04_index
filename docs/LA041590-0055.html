			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELPING OTHERS HELPS RETIRED EXECUTIVES, TOO  </P> <P> At Executive Service Corps of Southern California, we witness many of the  trends highlighted in "Managing Retirement" on March 11.  </P> <P> Our objectives are to serve as an outlet for the energies and experience of  retired executives, a vast reservoir of talent that often goes untapped, and to  help managers in the nonprofit sector access the time and talent of retired  executives who serve as volunteer management consultants.  </P> <P> Studies have shown that 75% of top executives serve as volunteers within six  months of retirement. Typically our consultants, who include over 250 retired  executives, say they receive as much as they give. It is widely known that men  and women who volunteer their time to community efforts tend to be healthier  and happier.  </P> <P> MEGAN G. COOPER  </P> <P> The writer is executive director of Executive Service Corps of Southern  California in Los Angeles.  </P></p>

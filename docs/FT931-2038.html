			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report SUGAR futures slipped below Friday's closing levels as profit-taking in London New York ate into gains. In early trading prices had continued last week's uptrend, taking New York prices to fresh three-year peaks and London's to the highest level since April 1991. London's May position, which had reached Dollars 309.50 a tonne at one point, slipped back to Dollars 304 a tonne, down 80 cents. Traders had been expecting a price correction after the recent sustained rise. 'It is healthier to have the market a little lower, where it will attract fresh buying,' one commented. London robusta COFFEE futures firmed in light trading with May closing at Dollars 891 a tonne, up Dollars 11, just below the day's high. The initially steadier tone on New York helped the London market to build on its morning advance, but traders thought the price was unlikely in the near future to move back above the Dollars 900 support level that was breached last week. LME COPPER prices capitalised on the generally firmer trend engendered by the situation in Russia but the cash price baulked at overhead resistance before closing Pounds 4.50 up at Pounds 1,464 a tonne.

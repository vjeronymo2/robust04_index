			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Arts: Brighter picture - Off the Wall THE 1992-93 art market year, which officially ends today, will not linger in the memory. It saw the main auction houses report a slight rise in sales, but any return to the heights of 1989-90 will be slow and tortuous. Sotheby's has the greater cause for satisfaction. Its old competitor Christie's seemed to be driving remorselessly toward Sotheby's traditional, that is 19th century, saleroom dominance, but New-York based Sotheby's, building on the slightly renewed business confidence in the US, was able to re-assert itself over its London rival. It achieved sales of Pounds 773m (Dollars 1.2bn), a rise of 20 per cent in sterling terms (but only 4 per cent in the more relevant dollars) as against the Pounds 683m (Dollars 1.06bn) turnover at Christie's (a gain of 16 per cent in sterling and 1 per cent in dollars). So the gap between the two has widened again. This is a small consolation when set against both auction houses' sales in the rogue record year of 1989-90 when Sotheby's registered a turnover of Pounds 1.96bn and Christie's Pounds 1.46bn. At both sales are less than half those of that annus mirabilis when, for sometimes financially dubious reasons, buyers, the Japanese in particular, displayed an insatiable lust for works by Van Gogh, Renoir, and other Impressionists, leading to the highest price ever paid for a picture of Dollars 82.5m, for a Van Gogh. But the steady-as-she-goes improvement in sales this season, the first upward movement for three years, was not without incident. For Christie's things could have been oh, so much better, if the highest bid in London during the season, the Pounds 7.7m. from the Zurich dealer Edgar Mannheimer for an early 19th century calculator, had proved real. For a happy week or so Christie's believed it had pulled off a coup, for the calculator had only been estimated to sell for Pounds 15,000 or so. But then the money was not forthcoming and Christie's had to decide whether it was the victim of a hoax or whether Mannheimer had completely misread the mind of a prospective collector. The real victim is the vendor who went on holiday to celebrate his unexpected windfall and is now being placated by Christie's. The most encouraging feature of the season was the return of large bidders for high- priced Impressionist and post-Impressionist pictures. The summer sales in London and New York did well. Buyers are still selective and dealers lack the cash and the confidence to acquire stock, but top-quality paintings are selling again. Sotheby's was amazed when it sold a Cezanne for a record Dollars 28.6m and a Matisse for Dollars 14.3min its May sale in New York. Such deals should bring out other masterpieces which owners have been reluctant to risk on the market. London could not match that but Christie's achieved the highest price in the UK this season when it sold a typical Renoir portrait of a pretty girl for Pounds 5.72m. The picture had sold in the feverish market of 1987 for Pounds 2.9m. Its surprise early re-sale at a much higher figure suggested that the Japanese were returning. The second highest price of the year in the UK was paid at the Bond Street dealers, Noortman, when a continental collector gave around Pounds 5.5m for a De Hooch scene of a courtyard in Delft. Noortman had bought the painting at Christie's in December for Pounds 4.4m, slightly below its estimate. Christie's was relieved to sell it for the child in the painting had an unattractive face. Another cleaning improved her appearance - and the work's value. In spite of expectations Old Master paintings did not become the rival, and successor, to the Impressionists. They cannot shake off problems of condition, attribution, and obscurity. Fortunately, the Getty Museum of Malibu still has its mighty cheque book and bought the other main Old Masters on offer, a Goya bullfighting scene for Pounds 4.95m, a Michelangelo drawing for Pounds 4.2m and a Caspar Friedrich romantic landscape for Pounds 2.3m. In the main the finest and rarest objects sold while the mundane were passed over. By persuading vendors to reduce their reserves Sotheby's and Christie's marginally improved their sold percentages at auction to 80 per cent of lots on offer. There were disappointments. Christie's expected to set a record price for a miniature when it offered a double portrait of Thomas Cromwell by Hans Holbein, but this was sunk by doubts about the Holbein link. Jewels remain a firm market and top quality English furniture and silver were solid. Victorian art enjoyed a revival. The art market is marching in line with the US and UK economies; two steps forward then one step back. Didi Brooks, chief executive of Sotheby's America says: 'The trend is getting better at a fairly gentle pace'. David Tyler, financial director for Christie's, sees 'a slow consolidation'. As confidence returns so will better properties. Sotheby's can look forward to another multi-million pound clear out from the castles of the Princes of Thurn and Taxis. Christie's is handling the sales of the art of the late Rudolf Nureyev. The other UK salerooms carry on the struggle. Phillips, with its concentration on the middle market, has been hit by the reluctance of people to move house and sell the contents. Its turnover fell slightly from Pounds 85.3m to Pounds 79.6m, but Bonhams bucked the trend and raised sales 27 per cent to a record Pounds 27.9m.</p>

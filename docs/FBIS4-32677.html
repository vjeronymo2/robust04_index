			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Foreign Ministry Statement on Italian Foreign Minister's </F> Visit" -- TANJUG headline]    [Text] Belgrade, 28 Jun (TANJUG) -- Antonio Martino,  foreign minister of the Republic of Italy, paid a one-day visit  to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] on 28 June. The  talks with Federal Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic centered  on the international community's intensive efforts aimed at  finding a peaceful solution to the Yugoslav crisis, the two  countries' contribution in this respect, and certain bilateral  issues.    The Yugoslav side informed its Italian collocutors about the  constructive efforts the FRY is making toward ending the civil  war in Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible by reaching a  peace agreement, with respect for the legitimate interests of  the parties involved.    Voicing support for the new Italian Government's endeavors  to  become more actively involved in the peaceful resolution of the  Yugoslav crisis, the Yugoslav side expressed its hope that Italy  -- a neighboring country and influential member of the European  Union -- will contribute to a principled approach to the crisis.  As Italy will soon be presiding over the summit of the G-7 and  Russia in Naples, hope was expressed that Italy will contribute  to the shaping of a more objective view of a resolution and a  more realistic position regarding the search for a just and  lasting peace.    Special emphasis was laid in the talks on the need for  normalizing relations between the FRY and the CSCE, with the  lifting of the ban on the FRY's activities as the final result.    The Yugoslav side underscored the necessity for lifting the  sanctions, since it has met all the conditions stemming from  relevant UN Security Council resolutions. There is a growing  awareness among international factors that the FRY is actively  engaged in the search for a peaceful solution, while the  sanctions are becoming counterproductive because they are  encouraging the advocates of the war option and rendering peace  talks more difficult. In addition to their dire consequences  for the population and the economy of the FRY, the sanctions are  adversely affecting neighboring countries and the entire  European continent. As a result of the sanctions,  Yugoslav-Italian trade has dropped from several billion dollars  to zero.    The Italian side was informed about the situation in the  Balkan region, relations with neighboring countries, and the  current process of normalizing relations with the former  Yugoslav republics -- something Yugoslavia is sincerely  interested in.    The meeting reaffirmed the traditionally friendly relations  between Yugoslavia and Italy -- relations that are not burdened  by open problems. It was mutually concluded that significant  prospects exist for the revival of all-encompassing bilateral  cooperation after the sanctions are lifted. The conviction was  expressed that the development of such cooperation will in  future be an important impetus to the overall normalization of  economic and political ties in the region of former Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Sharp turnround for Daimler-Benz Daimler-Benz, the German automotive and aerospace group, achieved a DM3.3bn (Dollars 2.1bn) turnround in its operating performance in the first half with an operating profit of DM926m, compared with an operating loss of DM2.4bn in the same period a year ago. Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of the management board, said the group would achieve 'a thoroughly satisfactory operating profit' for the full year, and forecast that 'almost all' operations should have returned to profit by 1995. Around DM650m of the improvement came from the sale of a majority stake in Mercedes-Benz Leasing to German banks. Daimler-Benz net profits under US accounting standards totalled DM369m in the first half compared with a net loss of DM949m a year ago, while earnings per share on the same basis recovered to DM7.82 from a loss of DM20.37 per share a year ago. Under German accounting rules net profits nearly tripled to DM462m from DM168m on a group turnover which rose by 13.4 per cent to DM48.96bn from DM43.19bn. Mr Reuter said the group was concerned by 'the inexplicably weak rate' of the US dollar against other leading trading currencies, and in particular against the D-Mark. The turnround follows a drastic restructuring programme begun in the second half of 1992 which includes the cutting of 78,000 jobs by the end of 1995. The recovery in the first half has been helped by severe measures to cut costs, boost productivity and rationalise operations, but it has also been supported by an improvement in the fortunes of the Mercedes-Benz executive and luxury car operations, due chiefly to the successful launch a year ago of the new C-Class executive car range. Car production in the period jumped by 44.3 per cent to 302,076, while car sales volumes rose 40.3 per cent to 296,770 and turnover rose by 22.8 per cent to DM21.2bn. Mr Reuter forecast that the volume of car sales in the full year would rise by around 15 per cent to 585,000. The car operations were currently working 'to the limit of our technical capacity' in most areas, he said. The group's E-Class luxury car would be replaced in mid-1995. The turnover of Deutsche Aerospace, which is cutting 10,000 jobs and closing 6 plants, declined by 5.6 per cent to DM7.2bn and for the full year was expected to be unchanged, said Mr Reuter.

Expressing deep concern at the present crisis in  Afghanistan,  Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari said that the entire Islamic  world, including Pakistan, is anguished at the outbreak of  fighting in Afghanistan. He said that is why he and Prime  Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto have appealed to all the Afghan  groups to observe a cease-fire to provide an opportunity to  friendly countries to forge an agreement between the rival  groups. The president urged the Afghan leaders to adopt the  path of dialogue to end their differences peacefully for the  sake of preserving Afghanistan's territorial integrity.    Reports say fighting resumed in the Afghan capital Kabul  this  morning after an overnight lull.

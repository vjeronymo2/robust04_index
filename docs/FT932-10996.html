			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Green shoots that sprout problems Few will deny that green shoots are at last springing up everywhere in the UK economy. This is hardly a matter on which the British government should congratulate itself. As the EC economics commissioner Henning Christophersen remarked: 'There is nothing astonishing' about the recovery. 'It would be much more catastrophic if there was no sign of recovery in the UK after a long period of negative growth.' The present recovery presents one big puzzle and may present one big policy problem. The puzzle is why unemployment has fallen in the past two months, a movement confirmed by the vacancy statistics. This is much earlier than normal. In the typical cycle unemployment continues to increase well into the upward phase of the business cycle until slack is absorbed and labour shortages develop. Changed practices at government employment offices by officials anxious to establish a good end-year record in reducing the register may have made a contribution. Demographic forces may also explain some of the difference between the present behaviour of the labour market and that of the early 1980s. Yet the demographic change has been known for a very long time and did not prevent most forecasters from expecting rising unemployment for the greater part of 1993. The best way to treat individual monthly figures is neither to ignore them, nor to take them at face value, but to see what differences they make to a longer trend. If you take the past three months together, unemployment has been falling by a monthly average of 11,000. If you take the past six months it has been rising at a monthly rate of 17,000. The probability is that the trend is now flat, if not slightly better. A similar impression is given by the April Confederation of British Industry survey. This shows a remarkable drop in the percentage of respondents saying they are working below capacity, from 73 per cent to 63 per cent; too large a change to be explained by spring seasonal factors. Indeed capacity utilisation is now nearly back to the average of a normal non-recession year. Whether the early change in the unemployment trend is good news depends on the reasons for it. The worst reason would be that productivity gains have started to falter and that more workers were required to sustain a modest increase in output. A more optimistic explanation is that the recovery is faster than preliminary statistics suggest. The Central Statistical Office has made a brave experiment in publishing an estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product, suggesting that output (excluding oil) has been rising at an annual rate of just over 2 1/2 per cent; but the estimate may well be raised. Is the recovery too rapid for comfort? No one can say. We do not know the trend rate of growth - most estimates are in the 2 per cent to 3 per cent a year range. Above all we do not know how large is the 'output gap' due to recession. If it is large, output could grow for some time at above trend rate without disaster. For such reasons the wisest economists have embraced a financial framework designed to encourage non-inflationary growth without attempting to fine-tune the real economy. It is in this financial framework that policy problems are liable to arise. The dip in sterling at the beginning of this week was a reflex to reaction on the foreign exchange market in the face of the Byzantine intrigues of the anti-Maastricht factions. The trend of sterling for much of 1993 could well be upwards. The severity of the recession in Germany and the alarmist reaction of the establishment there is likely to accelerate the pace of interest rate cuts. More and more analyses are appearing which suggest that the D-Mark is overvalued. This view could come to affect foreign exchange market sentiment  -both directly and by its effect on German economic policy. One can easily imagine a repeat of the 1987-88 dilemma. This was whether to cut interest rates or to allow sterling to rise to levels which could be both unsustainable and damp the recovery. Already the finance director of an engineering company has told the Financial Times that if the government allows the pound to strengthen any further 'then it must be out of its tiny mind'. If sterling were indeed to strengthen later in the year there would be enormous pressure to cut base rates to cheapen the pound. Unfortunately, the self-interested business pressure for a low pound is given added respectability by the concern of mainstream economic analysts about the current payments deficit. For instance, Gavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs (and a member of the chancellor's forecasting panel) believes that a 10 per cent fall in sterling's real exchange rate may be required if output is to grow at anything like its trend rate. Yet Davies is also sympathetic to the Treasury's desire for a strong pound to prevent the official 4 per cent inflation ceiling (excluding mortgage interest payments) from being breached. He tries to reconcile objectives by outlining an optimal path under which sterling would be kept at about its present level for the time being - to avoid an inflation blip to 5-6 per cent - and then further depreciation encouraged later. I would label this policy anti-Augustinian. The famous saint prayed to be made virtuous but not yet: the strategy followed by Norman Lamont with his deferred tax increases. The Goldman Sachs exchange rate advice is just the opposite: make me profligate but not yet. Mention of saints is highly appropriate, as Davies admits that it would take a miracle to produce the right timing. The strategy would, in any case, be wrong-headed. It is an example of the incurable habit of mainstream economists to suppose that the Treasury can fix real magnitudes such as competitiveness or the current trade balance for more than a transitory period. Davies's own diagram is revealing. It shows that competitiveness since 1979 has been 18 per cent less favourable than in the 1960s and 1970s (UK Weekly Comment, April 23). But even in the later period sterling has more often than not been below the level indicated by estimates of its purchasing power in terms of traded products. The degree of undervaluation required in the 1970s when the UK was a large net oil importer and beset by quality and delivery problems has limited bearing on what is required today. Competitiveness is mainly influenced by structural forces such as oil and capital movements which determine the needed manufacturing balance. Attempted changes for policy purposes end up with unwanted inflation or deflation. My own advice would be to encourage sterling to edge upwards, even if this means putting off the prospect of further base rate cuts. But that does not mean that the sky should be the limit. There would be no point in having endured the agonies of sterling's departure from the exchange rate mechanism last September only to let the pound approach the old DM2.778 lower limit. (Any ERM re-entry will have to be freshly negotiated). As the Bundesbank realised in its earlier campaign for D-Mark revaluation, the movement and level of the exchange rate are indicators of policy tightness just as much as domestic interest rates. But because of the traumas endured when the government shadowed the D-Mark in 1987-88, I fear that the Treasury could act in caricature of what the engineering company's finance director fears and allow sterling to rise too high, only to follow the anti-Augustinian depreciation advice later on. Even outside the ERM an explicit policy for sterling is needed - which does not mean precise floors or ceilings at which speculators can aim.</p>

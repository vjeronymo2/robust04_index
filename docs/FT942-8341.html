			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Wool at auctions held towards the end of the main selling season, has sold at prices mostly firm and unchanged. Some of the main market indicators are up again, with Australia's at 614 cents a kg. compared with 603 a week ago, but this does exaggerate the rise on a strictly comparable basis. Whatever the exact market measurement, wool sold very well and clearances in all primary markets remained good. The problem for those buying it is their own customers are still showing reluctance in paying the quite substantial increases from recession low points. Retailers in particular are unhappy at the prospect of having to raise their own selling prices, or of cutting present margins. The battle is unresolved but with ho;idays in consumer markets and recess in wool sales acting as incentives, background buying interest remains.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Baltic atom waste fears unfounded Fears of radioactive leaks from nuclear submarines scuttled by the Soviet military appear to be unfounded, writes Bronwen Maddox. A Norwegian-Russian team has been sampling water between Finland and Russia where it is believed the Soviet navy dumped radioactive parts from up to 12 nuclear submarines and three ice-breakers in the 1960s. Norwegian and Finnish fishermen have feared leaking radioactive waste could contaminate fish. The European Community yesterday signed a new convention to fight pollution in the Baltic, one of the world's dirtiest seas, together with the countries which discharge waste to it.</p>

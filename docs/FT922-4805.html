			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Diamond's hard-won reputation faces tough challenge DIAMOND may no longer be the hardest substance in the world now that US researchers have made small quantities of carbon nitride, a synthetic material which appears from preliminary tests to be as hard as or even harder than diamond. If the discovery at North-western University in Illinois is confirmed, it will shatter diamond's romantic reputation for supreme hardness, which most scientists had assumed would last for ever. But it could lead to many industrial applications for carbon nitride (CN) as an ultrahard coating which could resist wear better than any other material. The Northwestern project started after physicists at the University of California, Berkeley, published a computer prediction saying the hexagonal crystal structure of CN - containing carbon and nitrogen atoms in a three-to-four ratio - would be harder than the cubic crystals of diamond, which is pure carbon. The researchers have made a thin film of carbon nitride by a technique known as reactive sputtering. This involves firing carbon atoms from a graphite electrode at a smooth metal surface in a low-pressure atmosphere of nitrogen. Although there is not yet enough crystalline material to do a definitive hardness test, preliminary results suggest that CN will live up to its computer model. The coating has come through standard wear-resistance tests without a scratch. The university recently received a three-year grant from the US National Science Foundation to make more carbon nitride and investigate its applications. It could give a protective surface to a variety of materials including cutting tools and bearings. Mr Ming-Show Wong of North-western's industrial research laboratory sees a large potential market in extending the life of computer disks with an ultrahard coating. But if carbon nitride is to become more than a scientific curiosity some questions remain. For example, whether it can be manufactured at a reasonable cost and how well it bonds to other materials. A serious difficulty with diamond coatings is getting them to stick securely to the substrate, says Mr Alan Collins, a physicist at King's College, London. 'If carbon nitride sticks well to a large number of substrates, it could be a winner.' However, carbon nitride still exists only as a microscopic coating and as yet there is no practical technique for making gem-sized crystals. So for the foreseeable future diamonds remain a girl's best friend.</p>

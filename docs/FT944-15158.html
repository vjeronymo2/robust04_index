			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of North American Business Locations (2): A place in the Sunbelt beckons - Martin Dickson examines the strengths and weaknesses of US regional economies Go west, young man - but make sure you stop at the Rocky Mountains. That might be useful modern-day advice to the adventurous and entrepreneurial, since for the past three years the six states down the spine of the Rockies, plus the nearby desert states of Arizona and Nevada, have been the fastest growing region of the US, measured by job creation. The nation's fastest growing city is the gambling centre of Las Vegas, Nevada, where employment is expected to rise 7 per cent this year. Utah is the fastest growing Rocky Mountain state, with 6 per cent job growth last year. Contrast that with California, once the golden destination of Americans heading west to seek their fortunes: it has suffered four years of recession and this year seems likely to manage only marginal job growth as the economy shows signs of a painfully slow recovery. This tale of two regions underscores a fact of considerable significance to companies deciding where in the US to set up shop. The nation is not so much a single economy but a collection of regional economies, with their own distinct personalities, strengths and weaknesses, and differing economic cycles. Two broad national trends have been discernible in recent decades: strong growth in population and national output in the hot, less crowded southern and western parts of the country - the so-called Sunbelt - thanks partly to the invention of relatively cheap forms of air-conditioning. At the same time, population growth has slowed to a trickle in the traditional industrial heartland - the so-called Rustbelt - and this region has suffered a decline in manufacturing output, as companies have been lured by the cheaper production costs of the South and its hostility to organised labour. The north-eastern US - New England and New York state - have to some extent offset this decline in manufacturing with expansion of service industries. Boston, for example, is a powerhouse of the computer services, medical and teaching industries, while New York city remains the world's foremost financial services centre and an important location for the global trade and media businesses. The huge amount of intellectual capital located in the north-east and mid-Atlantic states will continue to give the region a strong comparative advantage in an era when brain power, rather than brawn, is the key to competitive advantage in the developed world. It is no accident that in a survey last year by Fortune magazine of the 'best US cities for knowledge workers', New York emerged in second place and Boston third. Raleigh/Durham, in North Carolina, topped the list. That said, the north-east is only now recovering slowly from a severe economic downturn between 1989 and 1993, which was brought on by the contraction of the securities industry, the bursting of a property bubble and the federal government's sharp cuts in defence spending, which hit the region disproportionately - just as the boom in 1980s defence spending helped give it an abnormal boost. The region is expected to see only modest growth - of around 2.5 per cent - this year and next. Expansion will be restrained by continuing defence cuts, falling profits in the securities industry, and the restructuring of large local companies such as Eastman Kodak and IBM. Defence cuts and an over-inflated property market have also been a principal factor in California's long recession, which began in 1990, and at last seems to be ending. The aerospace industry - long a mainstay of the economy  -is continuing to cut jobs and some companies are moving operations to other states, weary of California's high business costs and red tape. The Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy, a research organisation which has long been bullish on the state's prospects, insists that the state has strong long-term potential, based on foreign trade, high-technology, professional services, tourism and entertainment. But it argues that the principal threat to job and income growth is 'the lack of a strategy to prioritise and fund critical public investments, such as infrastructure and education'. Further up the west coast, the state of Washington is also suffering a slowdown in growth as the recession in the civil aircraft industry forces Seattle-based Boeing to cut back on production. However, Washington, which enjoyed above average growth in the early 1990s, remains one of the more attractive US business locations, with Seattle often near the top of a locational league tables. The state has strong positions in some of the world's leading edge high-technology industries, strong ties with the booming Asian Pacific Rim countries, and great beauty. For now, however,the fastest growing regions of the US are in the south and/or centre of the country. The Rocky Mountains are expected to show growth of around 5 per cent this year, dipping perhaps to 4 per cent in 1995, thanks to an influx of manufacturers from other regions seeking lower operating costs and professionals who have been freed by the fax and telephone modem to work wherever they choose. Many of these so-called 'lone eagles' prefer to live amid the stunning physical beauty of the mountains and deserts. The Rocky Mountain expansion is admittedly from a very modest base - the region accounts for no more than 5 per cent of US GDP - and the influx is pushing up labour and housing costs. Texas, which suffered a severe slump in the mid-1980s when the price of oil tumbled, has since diversified away from the sector, into areas such as high-technology and environmental services, and the state is now growing a little above the national average. Cities such as Houston, Dallas and Austin have become centres of high-technology excellence and the state will benefit greatly from its proximity to Mexico as the North American Free Trade Agreement increases trans-border economic activity. The upper-midwest - an area which encompasses much of the traditional Rustbelt and ranges from Ohio in the east to Iowa in the west - is also thriving and has transformed itself over the past 20 years. At one time it appeared to epitomise the problems of American heavy manufacturing industry: its car, motorbike, machine tool, steel and equipment manufacturers were all losing out to Asian rivals and the region looked to be in irreversible decline. The machine tool and motorbike industries remain shadows of their former self, but the US motor and equipment industries have become much more competitive operations and the region has diversified into a wide range of leading edge industrial sectors and adopted a much more international outlook. The region neither soared during the 1980s with the defence boom nor suffered so much as the east and west coasts in the defence/property downturn of the early 1990s, and seems set to maintain solid, stable growth of 4 per cent or more this year and 3.5 per cent next year. That rate of expansion could put it close to the south-east, which is growing faster than any region but the Rockies, thanks to population growth, company relocations, and greenfield factory construction, such as BMW's plant in South Carolina and a Mercedes plant being built in Alabama. Atlanta, the unofficial regional capital, will get an additional boost from the 1996 Olympics, to which it is playing host. Florida is suffering from a sluggish tourist industry but is emerging as an increasingly important centre for Latin American trade.</p>

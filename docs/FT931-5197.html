			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / As they say in Europe: The bathing beauties of nation-building - The former Communist nation which is embracing Western culture - pin-ups and all 'SHYNESS IS not conducive to beauty,' was the main headline in the Slovak daily Narodna Obrada last Monday. That story was about the Miss Slovakia contest. Narodna Obrada means 'National Revival.' It looks like an old Communist daily, so even now it is a bit of a jolt to see a picture of a dozen bathing beauties in the slot on the front page which might, four years ago, have been reserved for a party functionary. But it seems the beauty contest is one of the instruments of nation-building in central Europe today. The Slovak occasion became a story in which 'a hundred thousand juries around the country could make their own judgment.' The event was reported through the eyes of last year's Queen and it was she who produced the memorable quotation that provided the headline in my first paragraph. The message was that the country, now free of the Czech yoke, could encourage its youth to participate fully in the European experience. The creation of a new sense of nationhood is not easy for those emerging from the communist trauma, especially if the nationhood itself is new. In this endeavour governments aim at a nice mix of tradition and capitalist modernity to reassure citizens that not only are they now part of the world which they have envied for so long, but their society has sound, ancient roots. A similar movement between the wars ended up as fascism. But there are more recent precedents for the process. Thirty years ago Michael Frayn, the British writer, noted the psychological upheaval that hit the post-colonial states which were striving to assert their independence before a sceptical world. So he composed a suitable anthem for an emergent nation anxious to create that hard-to-find image of ancient modernity: 'Freedom's historic home, Our oft-embattled nation, Now boasts the finest water-skiing And modern sanitation.' Recently I had a fascinating conversation with a senior official of the central bank of Slovakia. It ranged from the role of St Svatopluk as founder of the Slovak nation in the tenth century to the well-managed national budget of today. The deficit, it emerged, is well under 3 per cent of gross domestic product, only half that of the Czech Republic. This curious combination of themes is frequently heard in the former Communist world: 'A sound monetary policy can be constructed through the assertion of national authenticity in the financial domain.' This kind of thinking inspired me to update Frayn's anthem to render it suitable for one of the 'economies in transition' as they are known: 'Now wakes our long oppressed land To offer incentives superior, And ensure the market's hidden hand Meets fiscal convergence criteria.' But the trouble in Eastern Europe is that it is the song of yesterday that one hears. In Budapest the talk is of yuppies, in Warsaw property speculation has been the rage. In Slovakia, with its beauty contests, it is evidently the day before yesterday that provides the model. Separatist and national movements generate specific fads and Western Europe sets trends here too. It likes to think itself immune to the virus which has horribly afflicted much of the central part of the continent, but disintegration under the guise of national rights exists here too. Nobody takes much notice of what goes on in Belgium but this week has provided new guidelines for those who wish to square the circle of tradition and modernity. As Slovakia watched its strapping beauties simper down the catwalk, the Gazet van Antwerpen produced the splash headline, 'Clean air, beautiful water, peace in vehicle-free town centres - Flanders paradise in 2002.' This was the prospect laid out by the Flanders regional government in a policy document on the next nine years. Another daily, De Standaard, led on the same story and had a picture of the new official poster which shows a couple in a half-embrace and the slogan, 'Flanders-Europe 2002.' Those who cannot stand their neighbours often believe they can live harmoniously with more distant nations in a wider community. Flems, Serbs, Scots and Slovaks each carry some mythical picture of the European ideal into which they will perfectly fit. The historical basis of this ideal is flimsy: the state of communications has not up to now permitted the ancient regions of Europe to slug it out in the manner of, say, the English and the French. But as a Welsh friend of mine once pointed out, a Europe filled with people who have scarcely heard of each other might be easier to handle than anything else that is likely to emerge.

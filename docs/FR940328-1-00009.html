Specifically, when coal companies apply for surface mining permits to State agencies responsible for SMCRA enforcement, they are not required to provide proof of any kind regarding who owns the surface of the property the coal company seeks to strip mine. In other words, the coal companies set forth the name or names of the persons or companies that own the surface without any documentation, and the various States simply assume the correctness of the coal companies' representations. My experience has shown that it is very risky to presume the good faith or the accuracy of information submitted by coal companies in their permit applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> My concern is prompted chiefly by my experience representing an elderly woman in Perry County, Kentucky, in her efforts to prevent a coal company from getting a surface mining permit for her property. At the time, I was a staff attorney with the Appalachian Research and Defense Fund of Kentucky, Inc., a Legal Services Corporation-funded legal aid program in eastern Kentucky (at present I am a staff attorney with its sister program in West Virginia, Appalachian Research and Defense Fund, Inc.). My client, America Caudill, came to me in July, 1992, frustrated in her efforts to protect her small piece of land that she and her now deceased husband had purchased in 1940. (Enclosed is a copy of a newspaper article about Mrs. Caudill's difficulty.) After seeing the company's (Sheena Coal Company) published notice in the local newspaper indicating that it had applied for a surface mining permit in the vicinity of her home, she took the time and effort to go to the local Department for Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (``DSMRE'') (some forty miles from her home) in order to examine the permit application. Much to her dismay, she saw that Sheena Coal sought a permit to strip mine her property, but the application utterly failed to identify her as the owner of the surface! Instead, the application and accompanying maps asserted that America's neighbors on either side of her property were the owners of her property as well! <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mrs. Caudill then attempted to exercise the citizen's rights provisions of SMCRA by requesting the DSDRE to deny the permit because it failed to identify her as an owner of the surface as required by SMCRA, and because she had not given Sheena Coal permission to mine her property. In reply, the State of Kentucky advised Mrs. Caudill that her contention amounted to a mere private ``property title dispute'' which it lacked the authority to resolve. They further advised her that they were going to issue the permit without further ado, which they did. They were kind enough to advise her of her right to petition for a hearing pursuant to SMCRA's provisions, further advising her to whom she should write to request the hearing and nothing more. Mrs. Caudill followed up with a written request for a hearing, but the attorney for the Kentucky Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet promptly filed a motion to dismiss her petition for hearing on the basis that her request for a hearing had failed to set forth with particularity the items required by the applicable State regulations. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  Never mine that Mrs. Caudill had already provided all of that information in her previous communications with the State of Kentucky and that the letter advising her of her right to request a hearing failed to advise her of the particular requirements for a hearing request under the regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> To its credit, the Cabinet subsequently adopted a policy, as a result of this case, whereby the Cabinet will not seek the dismissal of citizen hearing requests without substantial justification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It was at this point that Mrs. Caudill came to me and requested assistance. The first thing I did was to check the public records at the Property Valuation Administrator's office in the County Courthouse. This office includes aerial photographs of every square inch of the county as well as the property lines and owners of record of the surface. There on file was the public evidence of Mrs. Caudill's and her deceased husband's surface ownership of the very land that Sheena Coal proposed to strip mine. I submitted this documentation to the State as well as a previous letter from the President of Sheena Coal Company to Mrs. Caudill in which he acknowledged that he had no right to mine her property, but indicating his hope that she would some day give him permission to do so. In the end, Sheena Coal was compelled to amend its permit so as to delete Mrs. Caudill's property. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

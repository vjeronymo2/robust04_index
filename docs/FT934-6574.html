			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Vodafone There was more fodder for the bulls than meat for the bears in Vodafone's interim results. The drop in operating margin was due to start-up losses overseas rather than competitive pressure at home. Declining revenue per subscriber in the UK is a reminder that margins will fall over time, but Vodafone is still attracting new customers fast enough to maintain momentum. Importantly, Mercury's One-2-One network appears to be expanding rather than cannibalising the market for mobile phones. Yet it is early to draw firm conclusions about the impact of low-cost competition. Hutchison is waiting in the wings, and pricing could take another downward lurch next year. Vodafone therefore looks wise to pursue growth overseas. Operating losses from overseas projects this year and next  -and sharply higher capital expenditure - are the price. But while its UK business is throwing off cash and generating double-digit profits growth, Vodafone can stand the strain. Cash piles have few attractions anyway with interest rates so low. With US investors determined to focus on the value of Vodafone's portfolio of licences, even substantial dents in profits and cash flow will not undermine the shares. Judging the worth of cellular phone licences from Greece to Fiji is no easy matter, but the appreciation of Vodafone's shares during the summer owes much to efforts to do so. Whether such notional valuations will be justified by earnings is less certain.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN LEFT;  </P> <P> THE MAJORITY RULES, BUT NOT FOR LONG;  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA'S VOTING POPULATION IS 80% WHITE; THE URBAN SCHOOLS' IS 20%. A 'NEW  POLITICS' IS DAWNING.  </P> <P> There will be an election next week in a state called California, a pleasant  and orderly nation of white people living well in Mediterranean climates along  the Pacific Ocean between Oregon and Mexico. The big contest is between Atty.  Gen. John Van de Kamp and former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein for the  Democratic nomination for governor.  </P> <P> The winner will face Republican Sen. Pete Wilson in November for the chance to  govern a place called California, an unruly and rather wary conglomeration of  people of many colors, many incomes, many cultures.  </P> <P> There are two Californias sharing the same space these days, in different  decades, different time zones. There is a 20-year gap, at least, between  California on election days and California on any other day of the year. Next  Tuesday, more than 80% of the voters will be white. Next Wednesday, almost half  of California will be black and many shades of brown and tan.  </P> <P> The current coexistence of old and new Californias is one of the most  extraordinary episodes of change in American history -- and most American  history is about change. The voting population of California in the 1980s was,  and will be on June 5, between 80% and 85% white -- and 7% black, 7% Latino and  2% or 3% Asian. But the overall population is now estimated at only 58% white  -- or Anglo, as most say here. "Euro-American" is used by some scholars in  anticipation of the day, not far away, when Anglos are again a minority here,  as they were until the 19th Century.  </P> <P> The overall population, as opposed to the voting citizenry, includes both  children and non-citizens, including immigrants, some legal, some not. But if  you used demographic statistics including only actual U.S. citizens above the  voting age of 18, the white total would still reach only a little more than  60%.  </P> <P> "There are new and potentially dangerous pressures in the demographic gaps  now," said Mervyn Field, director of the California Poll, which produced some  of the figures used here. "The non-voters are becoming more and more different  from voters in color, class and life-style."  </P> <P> The time and place to see that is any Sunday at the intersection of Alvarado  and 7th streets near downtown Los Angeles. If you are white and middle-aged, as  I am, you can sit in Langer's delicatessen with a collection of urban types as  American as bagels and lox -- a cross-section of the people who vote in Los  Angeles and most other American cities, Jewish and Christian, most white but a  couple of blacks.  </P> <P> Step outside and you magically transcend great distance and time. You are in  Guatemala City. The streets are crowded with families, all Latino, speaking  Spanish in the accents of Guatemala, Mexico, El Salvador, Nicaragua and  Honduras. Men wait in long lines to buy ices or to make telephone calls.  Children chase each other through a maze of food stalls along the edge of  Westlake Park. There is nothing visible to indicate that this is the United  States until three Los Angeles Fire Department trucks come screaming down  Alvarado as if they were spaceships from another planet. How many people on the  streets are legally in this country? Maybe half, but the ones who have American  citizenship don't often vote -- and neither do the Asians, mostly legal, in  other parts of the state.  </P> <P> If Langer's customers reflect today's voting, Alvarado, Koreatown and Asian  neighborhoods up and down the coast reflect tomorrow's California. More than  80% of the children in the lower grades of Los Angeles schools are "people of  color." Only 33% of the students are white at Berkeley, the best of the fine  schools that make up the University of California system. Ten years ago, the  proportion of whites at Berkeley was 58%, but their numbers have eroded with  affirmative action and the scholastic achievements of Asians and  Asian-Americans.  </P> <P> The schools, from kindergarten to college, are where the races and cultures of  modern California come together -- and divide. White resentment over admission  to the state university is balanced by minority-group resentment about the  flight of white students from public schools, usually followed by the  reluctance of voters and politicians to pay or levy taxes to maintain the kind  of high-quality California schools represented by the Norman Rockwell past.  </P> <P> So next Tuesday, white voters will choose Van de Kamp or Feinstein to oppose  Wilson. But the victory photos will look like old tintypes the moment they are  developed. This is already the politics of the past in the California.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> MAN SUFFERS BURNS IN PROPANE EXPLOSION  </P> <P> The owner of an automobile tuneup shop suffered severe burns on the chest,  face, back and arms when a propane tank erupted into flames Wednesday,  spreading fire through the building, fire officials said.  </P> <P> The fire caused $25,000 damage to the Accutune Auto Electric building in the  15100 block of Moran Street, and another $30,000 to its contents before the  fire was brought under control, Westminster Fire Department Battalion Chief Don  Herr said.  </P> <P> The owner of the business, Steve Oliver, was treated at the scene by  paramedics, then taken by an ambulance helicopter to the burn unit at UCI  Medical Center in Orange. He was listed in serious but stable condition with  second-degree burns over 30% to 40% of his body.  </P> <P> Herr said Oliver was fixing a leaking propane tank in his shop and that it  exploded while Oliver was working on it.  </P> <P> The incident occurred at 4:54 p.m., about 100 yards from a Westminster Fire  Department station, which meant firefighters were able to get there quickly,  Herr said. It took only about 10 minutes to control the blaze, he said.  </P> <P> The firefighters "were inside the fire station when they heard a knock on the  door. Workers from the area said there was a fire down the street. They got on  their rigs and drove down the street," Herr said.  </P> <P> "You can't pull hose that far," he explained.  </P></p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo out of favour Pharmaceuticals heavyweight Glaxo led the sector down on speculation that the company had, as one dealer put it, 'taken a bath in the bond market'. These suggestions were accompanied by a downgrade of Glaxo shares by one US bank and rumours of negative comments by another. Analysts have been scrutinising Glaxo's investment portfolio over the past few days as the group approaches its year-end and some believe that as much as half of its Pounds 2bn securities investments are in the badly hit global bond market. Yesterday there were whispers that the company might have lost heavily in bonds. Although some analysts were sceptical, the shares were marked down in early trading. Then, dealers heard that Goldman Sachs had cut its Glaxo profits forecast for the current year by Pounds 50m to Pounds 1.9bn, telling clients that sales growth of both Zantac, the top-selling anti-ulcer treatment, and also of its anti-emetic treatment for cancer patients, were slowing more than anticipated. Finally, there were reports that Lehman Brothers had prepared a negative report on weekly prescriptions for Zantac. The stock ended the day 14 1/2 lower at 538p. The fall unsettled SmithKline Beecham, whose 'A' shares slipped 5 to 403p, and Zeneca, off 4 at 712p.</p>

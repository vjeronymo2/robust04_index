			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Observer: Object Lessons Why should one of the world's canniest fund managers seek advice on property investment from the central figure in the world's most spectacular property empire collapse? Well, George Soros replied, he was excited that his new Quantum Realty property fund is to be advised by Paul Reichmann, whose abilities as a 'developer and creator of values' are outstanding even though his Canadian-based Olympia &amp; York business has been under bankruptcy court protection for the past nine months. Take for example Reichmann's three real estate 'grand slams' - the development of downtown Toronto in the early 1970s; taking a big stake in Manhattan property in 1977 at the bottom of the market; and the successful development of the World Financial Center in New York in the 1980s. True, Soros conceded, there was also Canary Wharf in London's docklands, which helped to precipitate O&amp;Y's collapse. But that 'taught investors important lessons, which we intend to apply in the management of Quantum Realty'. In particular: 'If you pyramid your leverage (build up layer on layer of debt) eventually you are going to come a cropper.' While the new fund will buy mainly in North America, he added, it might also invest in Latin American markets and Europe, including London. So might the line stretch to Canary Wharf, now in the hands of administrators? That, said Soros, was 'rather a distant possibility,' since the fund would not have sufficient money at its disposal.</p>

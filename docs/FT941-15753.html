			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Property Trust drops to Pounds 0.1m Profits at Property Trust declined from Pounds 426,000 to Pounds 102,000 pre-tax in the six months to September 30, though last year's figure was boosted by Pounds 900,000 from the sale of development properties. The company said these sales had the effect of reducing rents receivable in the period under review, which declined from Pounds 747,000 to Pounds 713,000. It added that there had been no sales in the first half and it was unlikely that there would be any in the second. Rather, the company stressed that it had been buying properties, though the full impact in rental terms would not be reflected in the accounts until next year. Gross annual rental income from the acquired properties and other proposed acquisitions was currently some Pounds 856,000. The company expects to accrue net income of some Pounds 449,000 a year after interest - an initial return on equity of about 18 per cent. With the benefit of acquisitions gross rental income is expected to rise by some 40 per cent to more than Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 1.54m annualised). Earnings fell to 0.5p (5.6p). In December the company announced the acquisition of 207/213 High Street, Dorking, and the proposed purchase of 1/30 The High Parade, Streatham High Road, London.</p>

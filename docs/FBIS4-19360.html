			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Prime Minister Gro Harlem </F> Brundtland by Bente Egjar Engesland in the prime minister's  office; date not given: "The Mighty Gro"]    [Text] She is in the midst of the political fight of  her life. Will Gro Harlem Brundtland achieve what has until now  been almost unthinkable? Is it at all possible that stubborn  Norway will vote yes on membership in the European Union [EU]?  "Sure it's possible," says the mighty Gro.    With the EU's internal crisis as background noise, she is  going to travel around the country to get skeptical people to  vote yes -- just as the negotiators in Brussels did and just as  she herself did in 1972.    Then Gro Harlem Brundtland was no activist during the "civil  war" and she only publicly announced her 1972 position for the  first time in 1990.    But it is not typically Norwegian to be Gro and it is not  typical of Gro the practitioner of realpolitik to be a doubter.  She has an almost frightening iron will, resoluteness, and  energetic power.    The prime minister's large meeting room is opened for us, a  room free of intimate atmosphere: There are 12 empty chairs  around the big conference table. There is a watchful press  spokesman carrying a cassette tape recorder -- which is  frequently used ever since reporter Geelmuyden's statement that  the prime minister merely chatters. Perhaps the press spokesman  can do the interview as well, so we can take in the view  instead. We have windows looking out onto the rooftop terrace,  where all the world's guests are photographed with "madame," the  woman in the brightly colored clothes. Red is the fiery woman's  color. Gro loves red.    She makes her entrance and kicks off the black, high-heeled  patent leather shoes; we have more than half an hour, a whole  eternity.    Norway is now seriously being devastated by an EU struggle.  But for Gro Harlem Brundtland, this is not the beginning, just  the beginning of the end, because the Europe process has already  been a marathon. First there was the European Economic Area  [EEA] concept that we never became familiar with. The EEA  process alone took five and a half years.    "It's hugely demanding to work with such processes. It  requires long-range thinking," she says.    Many people have completely forgotten that the EEA was also  about to fall through. But when we ask Gro about The Big  Disappointment, she cannot avoid the EEA breakdown in Luxembourg  in the summer of 1991. That led to a major defeat for Gro, the  Labor Party, and the European project.    "Luxembourg's foreign minister, Jacques Poos, interpreted  the  situation in such a positive way that we thought an agreement  about free market access for fish was in place. Here at home we  were scolded. Political opponents exploited the situation for  all it was worth. We learned that you can't take such statements  for granted. You have to get up early in the morning."    Hard work, more hard work, and yet more hard work is her  political recipe -- and her dogma. For Gro, stamina has an  intrinsic value in politics and in life. Like so many Social  Democrats, Gro was born into politics. She has rarely asked the  question whether the choice was the right one because  the choice was obvious. It is just as obvious to work  systematically to achieve political goals.    But the systematic thinker also takes chances. She sent  avowed opponents to Brussels to negotiate a Norwegian yes vote.  From the 15th floor in the Government Building, she kept in  contact by telephone with negotiators Gunhild Oyangen, Grete  Kundsen, Jan Henry T. Olsen, and special advisor with special  status Jonas Gahr Store. But they were able to fend for  themselves.    "I consciously kept in the background."    "No fish" Olsen was a particularly big gamble. But Gro fell  for him four years ago when he delivered a "dazzling speech to  the Fishermen's Association." In any event, if Norway does not  become a member of the EU, it will not be Olsen's fault. He  behaved like a duck in water.    Little, if anything, in Gro Harlem Brundtland's Europe  mission is accidental. With Thorbjorn Jagland as the central  strategist, every step is carefully planned, from the EEA  process to the Labor Party's big consultation and the prime  minister's promembership speech in the fruit-producing town of  Ullensvang on 4 April 1992 in which she said that Norway could  still give up a fish.    At the eleventh hour Gro could also phone her political  friend of many years' standing, Spain's Prime Minister Felipe  Gonzalez.    "Personal contacts are important to build up confidence. If  people you know from before know you can be depended upon, you  can pick up a phone and in three minutes get down to brass  tacks. I have known Felipe Gonzalez since 1975, before Spain  became democratic and he was in exile. We established an  ideological companionship that means today we are colleagues.    ``But there are limits to how much personal relationships  can  exert an influence. Fisheries policy is an important and  difficult national issue for Spain, just as it is for Norway.  Neither one of us wants to destroy the respect we have at home.  Job number one is to take care of national interests. But when  we know one another well, it's also possible to proceed without  ceremonial phrases. I said that we couldn't do anything more  than stretch out the EEA fish. So Gonzalez knew that that was  the reality.''    When Jacques Delors was told that the Norwegian negotiators  had the backing of the prime minister, he too knew that this was  true. Just as now Gro Harlem Brundtland can use her network of  international contacts that has been built up since 1974, when  Norway's youngest, freshest cabinet minister was given the task  of running an OECD conference on the environment.    "I remember thinking we couldn't let this possibility slip  away from us, and that I had to prepare myself well. That was  also how I immediately got an international challenge. At that  time as well transnational and interdisciplinary contacts were  important. First I approached the Spanish environment minister  and went systematically to work."    [Engesland] I can believe it. Have you never been  particularly troubled by nerves?    [Brundtland] I don't get nervous, but it's not out of  arrogance or a lack of respect for my tasks. I don't want to be  paralyzed by nerves. My recipe is to prepare myself as best I  can.    Indeed unprepared situations can throw her off balance and  unleash that famous red-hot temper. As at an improvised news  conference in Arhus, when the prime minister thought she was  supposed to speak about Nordic cooperation while the reporters  were only concerned about the book dealing with intelligence,  Vi som styrer Norge [We Who Run Norway].  Then Gro flew into a raging protest.    The hard-as-nails Gro-Kare duels taught her to control her  temper, but she can still be a fury and cut off an opponent with  razor-sharp retorts or silence them completely. This is the  language of power, even if Gro would deny that herself.    [Engesland] What do you think about Anne Enger Lahnstein's  role in the EU debate?    [Brundtland] I'm thinking of the country's future.    That is all the "yes queen" has to say about the "no queen."    [Engesland] What role do you want to play yourself?    [Brundtland] I am the prime minister.    No one can deny that, she laughs cleverly. As prime  minister,  Gro must be be somewhat cautious about being too strong an  exponent, but all the same, is it tempting to let everything go  now?    [Engesland] You have stayed in the background during the  last  round of the negotiations. But will the Labor Party, Thorbjorn  Jagland, and Gro Harlem Brundtland now roll across the country?    [Brundtland] No, we'll take it at a quiet pace. This is not  an issue for one or two people. In this instance there are many  of us.    All the same: Gro is at the top now and strongly convinced  of  her own ability to persuade. She is Norway's most powerful  woman, she is the most dominant political leader since Einar  Gerhardsen. Will she be able to do what Trygve Bratteli could  not? Or will the power elite once again stab her in the back?    Finally Gro says that a no vote from a majority of the  people  will not be a personal, only a political defeat, and that she  will not resign. But the fight over the EU has also divided the  Social Democrats, and god only knows how an internal struggle  has torn the Labor Party to pieces before, in 1972 and during  the struggle for power in 1979-81 -- that pushed out Reiulf  Steen and brought Gro in. In her time the Social Democratic  movement has been threatened by an identity crisis and  ideological disintegration, by tension between the state and the  market, and between the national political leadership and  ungovernable international forces. Gerhardsen the younger came  back from oblivion, he talked about the good, old values and  went into the television studio with Socialist Left Party [SV]  leader Erik Solheim. In 1982 Rune Gerhardsen was her personal  secretary, but he could not keep up with Gro's pace very long.  Ten years later he was the opposition incarnate.    The Labor Party was down low in the opinion polls. But it  was  a personal tragedy that led to the dramatic retirement in 1992  -- not any uproar on the outside.    Gro Harlem Brundtland bears a great sorrow. She lost a son,  and for a mother there is nothing worse. A prime minister can  trust few people, and now she protects herself more than ever.  So the individual with feelings within her is increasingly  thrown into the solitude that follows the life of a top leader.    Time with her family and outdoor activities are essential.  She is now going to the mountain where she will spend her Easter  vacation to relax with her family.    [Engesland] What will you read over the Easter holiday --  more EU documents?    [Brundtland] I'm going to read Jostein Gaarder's  philosophical novel Sofies verden [Sophie's  World]!    [Engesland] So might you reflect on which classical  philosophers fascinate you the most? In Steinar Hansson and  Ingolf Hakon Teigenes's book Maktkamp og mannefall  [The Struggle for Power and the Slaughter], it is  implied that there is a less than flattering connection between  you and Plato. You have frequently said that there is a close  connection between the doctor and the politician. The doctor  prevents disease and heals suffering whereas the politician  prevents social problems and corrects biases. Plato also  believed that statesmen should take responsibility for society  the way the doctor does for the patient. Aren't you in danger of  becoming elitist?    [Brundtland] No, be reasonable. What nonsense! she snorts.    I haven't read Plato from A to Z, but in any event what is  not possible in a democracy is not having leaders. Power cannot  be decentralized as long as no one makes decisions. It's also  quite wrong to give the impression that some politicians here at  home represent the people and that others do not. If any party  is close to people's everyday lives, it is the Labor Party.    It is right to observe that the choice of a career tells a  lot about someone's personal leanings. I became a doctor because  I liked to be with people, I liked to do things, to help. I also  think that I have always had the ability to make contact with  people.    Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland is a remarkable blend  of  toughness and tenderness, of uncompromising resolution and  generous care. She does, however, direct little irony towards  herself. Nor will she ever become a big popular orator. The  torrent of speech wears at the wits of every reporter with a  feeling for proper quotations. But political journalists are  nonetheless seen more frequently as "Gro's court" than as a  counterweight to her.    Because no one can challenge Gro's or the Labor Party's  position in the government because the opposition in the  Storting is so divided and weak, because there are so few  experienced leaders on an international scale in our little  country, and, because she reigns so sovereign, she is also  becoming next to impregnable.    Today Gro is no longer called the chatterbox from Bygdoy,  nor  is she called the "Green Goddess," but everyone is still on a  first-name basis with her and she increasingly behaves like the  country's grandmother -- commanding and compliant.    The battle over Norway and Europe will be a historic one.  The  big question is whether the leadership of the Labor Party will  make close contact with the sentiments in the hearts of the  people. Gro is pleased to be traveling northward. But will the  skeptical people in northern Norway vote yes just because  grandmother says they ought to?</p>

The meeting's purpose was to reach  an agreement on measures and draft a plan to combat sea  pollution, especially that caused by oil slicks.    Representatives from Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Peru,  Brazil,  Poland, the PRC, the ROK, Russia, and Ecuador who attended the  meeting committed themselves to asking their respective  governments to buy the standard antipollution material suggested  by the Chilean Navy. They decided to draft a concerted action  program at their next meeting.    Commodore Urdangarin stated: "All the participants  acknowledged that Chile is the only country that has the ways  and means to combat pollution in the Antarctica in a systematic  way. We have both the qualified people and the infrastructure  in the vessels of the Chilean Navy's Antarctic Patrol and the  Prat Base and Fildes Port Garrison."    He underscored that this initiative was materialized by  Admiral Jorge Martinez Busch, the Navy commander in chief, who  had the foresight to plan for possible problems arising from the  increase in sea traffic.    On that occasion, the commanders of the bases and stations  in  the South Shetland Islands located in Antarctica, agreed to  appoint the Chilean Navy's Antarctic Patrol as the operations  coordinator in case of a possible environmental disaster in the  area.    At present, only the Chilean Navy has the necessary vessels,  equipment, and staff to face an emergency such as this, as well  as to undertake rescue operations with the Antarctic Patrol.</p>

The first was to conclude the republic's entering the ruble  zone as soon as possible, which would facilitate surmounting of  budget deficit which at present totals 95 Bn [billion] rubles.    The premier mentioned the necessity to widely use market  structures in the economy, trading of enterprises which are on  the brink of bankruptcy as the government's second task.  According to his estimate, there are dozens of bankrupt  enterprises in all branches of the national economy already and  their existence is problematic without additional state  allocations. These are primarily the Tajik aluminium factory,  the Vakhsh nitric fertilizers factory and several other large  sites.    The third task is to increase the republic's authority in  the  world community against the background of political and economic  transformations. This will give a real opportunity to receive  investments in the economy. According to Samadov, a $500  million credit would enable the republic's economy to develop  without worsening the living standards of the local population.    "In 1994 we shall be experiencing rather painful political  processes linked with the discussion and adoption of the new  Constitution, a nation wide referendum on the state system and  further elections of a new parliament," said Samadov. He  mentioned social security of certain categories of the  population, primarily pensioners, families with many children,  invalids and students, as one of the priority tasks of the  government.    Tajikistan's present government, a country within the CIS,  takes the obligations of the previous cabinet, indicated Samadov.    As far as priorities in the cooperation with other countries  are concerned, we cannot but mark the role of Russia and Central  Asia countries, primarily Uzbekistan, said the prime minister.  In his words, Tajikistan is inclined to cooperate with the West.    "We must not forget that the nation's mentality adheres to  the Moslem religion," emphasized the premier and said that  Dushanbe pays great attention to its relations with Afghanistan,  Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Jozsef Szabo Bartha report: "Csurka Supports Csucs's </F> Nomination in Mohacs -- The MIEP's Budapest Elections List Is  Complete"]    [Text] The unlawful police actions against the Hungarian  Justice and Life Party [MIEP] have become tendentious. The  latest incident occurred on 18 February, when the MIEP's  petition for a referendum was confiscated in the underpass at  the Nyugati railroad station, MIEP Cochairman Lajos Horvath  announced at the party's news conference on 23 February.    He said that a MIEP member who tried to clear up the matter  immediately after this police action was ejected from the police  station, being told "walkies outside, why should we deal with  such a matter, you will not win the elections anyway!" In the  MIEP's view, it is not impossible that police patrols had been  given orders to act against the collection of signatures. A  letter has been sent to National Police Chief Sandor Pinter  asking him to investigate the responsibility for this  politically motivated act.    In connection with the elections, it was said at the news  conference that the Budapest list is complete and the number of  their individual candidates exceeds 140. They are delaying the  publication of the list of names because running in MIEP colors  involves the threat of losing one's job in a number of cases.    They are willingly to support Laszlo Csucs, deputy chairman  of Hungarian Radio, if he runs as an independent candidate in  Mohacs [southern Hungary]. Similarly, they would also be happy  to support Gabor Nahlik, deputy chairman of Hungarian  Television, either as a MIEP or as an independent candidate.    Answering NEPSZABADSAG's question in connection with the  Hungarian Democratic Forum's [MDF] National Convention last  weekend, [MIEP Co-Chairman Istvan] Csurka stated: "The MDF's  ship is already nose down in the sea. We are lucky that we had  been removed from this Titanic before it started to sink. The  current three captains will not be able to repair the hole that  was caused by the previous captain Jozsef Antall when the ship  collided with the iceberg of the pact."</p>

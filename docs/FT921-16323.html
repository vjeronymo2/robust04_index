			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: The end is not yet nigh for investors  -Serious Money GLOOM, GLOOM, all around is gloom. It was hard to enjoy Christmas while one economic pundit after another popped up in the media to pronounce, like Private Fraser in 'Dad's Army', 'We're all doomed]' Sages have predicted a worldwide slump to rival the 1930s, with financial crises bringing down many a famous corporate name. The pound will be under pressure, interest rates could go up, and the price of houses will continue to fall. No one has yet forecast a plague of boils but it cannot be long before they do. Savers naturally are worried. Some have even suggested that the traditional 'safe havens' in troubled times - banks and building societies - are not as secure as they used to be. But how much notice should savers take of all this pessimism? As a rule, journalists love bad news, and financial journalists are no exception. The collapse of a corporate empire such as Robert Maxwell's is always likely to generate more column inches than the success of, say, Glaxo. A 100 point fall in the FT-SE 100 makes better copy than a 100 point rise. Readers can therefore dismiss some of the catastrophe stories being printed as the natural journalistic relish for crisis. There may also be a psychological reason or two behind the gloom spread by economists and stock market analysts. Normally, it pays a forecaster to be reasonably optimistic. Economies grow, more years than not, and stock markets rise, more years than they fall. In the 1980s, analysts got used to seeing companies produce 20 per cent per year earnings per share growth. The tendency to extrapolate from past trends, plus the natural enthusiasm for the companies they follow, meant that sector analysts were slow to see the effect of higher interest rates and the recession on corporate profits. Over the last couple of years, therefore, the trend has been for analysts to be initially over-optimistic in their forecasts for profits growth - and then be forced to indulge in a round of downgradings. That process has just occurred in respect of 1992 profits expectations. Economists were never quite as bullish as the sector analysts, but even they, given the natural bias of the City, had a tendency to take the Panglossian view that free markets would ensure that all would be for the best. They, too, have been cutting their forecasts for economic growth in 1992. In short, the recent bout of pessimism is in part a reaction to the over-optimism that went before it. This is not to say that the world economy does not face enormous problems; just that the average saver needs to keep a sense of proportion. Take the stock market. Those who bought shares or unit trusts back in 1986 or 1987 learnt to their cost the penalties of buying at the top of the market. Now they must learn the benefits of buying near the bottom. One need not get too carried away by the 73 point one-day rise in the FT-SE 100 index. It was achieved on thin volume and could easily be reversed (and more) by a run on the pound. Nevertheless, statistics show that when the stock market yields more than 5 per cent it is a good time to buy shares. The profits will not come instantly; the wisdom of the purchase will only be proved over three or five years. But such a strategy has been successful even during crises such as the 1930s depression and the 1974 oil shock. It is, admittedly, tempting to fight shy of shares at the moment. With interest rates on some accounts at 11 per cent or more, and inflation at 4 per cent, the real returns to savers of 7 per cent are very high by historical standards. Those worried about the stability of individual financial institutions should not invest more than the deposit protection scheme limit of Pounds 20,000 with any one group. It may mean giving up the 0.5 of a percentage point or so offered on higher sums, but it will be worth it for peace of mind. In the long run, savers will not prosper by investing solely in deposits. Real rates of 7 per cent cannot be sustained for ever without driving the economy into penury. For what might happen, one need only look at the US where savers are being offered rates of a measly 4-5 per cent - their search for better returns elsewhere is part of the reason for the recent strength of Wall Street. Prudent investors should therefore be shifting part of their funds out of deposits before interest rates fall. Given the risk of further individual corporate calamities, any purchase of equities should be done though the vehicle of a unit or investment trust. But for those who, whatever the rationale, simply cannot face the risks of equity investment, there are alternatives. If interest rates are set to fall, the 8.5 per cent tax-free on offer from National Savings (the equivalent of 14.17 per cent for higher rate taxpayers) looks highly attractive. And gilts, which currently yield around 10 per cent, should show capital gains if interest rates fall - although the rise may be limited by the widening government deficit. In other words, savers should not despair. Universal gloom does not eliminate investment opportunities; indeed, to some extent, it creates them. As Corporal Jones would say in response to Private Fraser, 'Don't panic'.</p>

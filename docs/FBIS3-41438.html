			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Bombay, 26 Nov--The draconian anti-pollution law  recently imposed by the U.S. on ships trading with that country  is not fully justified as ship-source pollution only amounts to  10 percent of the total marine pollution, Mr. P.K. Srivastava,  director (bulk carriers and tankers), Shipping Corporation of  India, told a seminar here on Wednesday.    It was revealed at the seminar, organised by Steamship  Mutual  Underwriting Association (Bermuda), a leading P&amp;I (protection  and indemnity) Club, and Crowe Boda and Co, its Indian  correspondents, that the U.S. has rejected the international  conventions and their protocols and had its own pollution  legislation--the Oil Pollution Act.    Referring to the U.S. legislation, Mr. Srivastava said such  laws, if they are not reality-based, would act as disincentive.  As the issue had become highly emotive, all protests about the  perceived imbalance between the degree of the ship-generated  pollution and the draconian nature of the law were proving to be  a cry in the wilderness.    There has also been concern that the ready availability of  ever-increasing compensation funds for marine pollution tends to  instil a sense of complacency within the operational sector of  the shipping industry, according to him.    The P&amp;I Clubs had a role in mitigating the problem as  pollution related claims, not only accounted for a sizeable part  of the total P&amp;I claims but also because the wide publicity  that  is being given to the incidents of pollution affected the  professional image of the shipping industry, he said.    The clubs cover claims against their members for loss damage  and expense arising from pollution caused by an escape or  discharge of oil from their vessels including fines, up to a  limit, at present, of $500 million per accident or occurrence.    Dr. I.C. White, managing director of the International  Tanker  Owners' Pollution Federation, the UK, gave details about the  federation's computerised oil spill response database and said  it also provided practical information on oil spill response  techniques.    He said the incidence of oil spills greater than 5,000  barrels (about 700 tonnes) from vessels had come down from an  average a year in the 1970's to nine in 1980's, spills of the  size resulting from recent accidents involving the Nagasaki  Spirit, Aegean Sea, Braer and Maersk Navigator being exceptional.    The ``entry into force'' provisions of the conventions and  their protocols have, therefore, been amended so that they will  take effect without the U.S. support. One of them is the  International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution  Damage 1969 (CLC) and the other International Convention on the  establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil  Pollution Damage 1971 (the Fund Convention), established to  provide additional compensation in cases where the damage claims  exceeded the shipowners' liability under the CLC or where the  case fell within one of the exceptions of defences under the CLC.    CLC is funded by the tanker owners through their insurers,  where the Fund Convention is funded by contributions levied on  crude and fuel oil cargo receivers who get more than 15,000  million tonnes of oil by sea in any one year.    The main amendments to them adopted by the protocols have  increased the limits of liability under CLC and Fund Convention,  taken into account not only actual pollution but also pure  threat situations, extended the geographical scope of the  conventions and amended the definition of pollution.    The CLC is now applied in 79 countries, excluding the U.S.,  and 56 of them have adopted the Fund convention. The protocols  have yet to come into force.    Anticipating delays in the ratification of international  conventions, the tanker and oil industries established voluntary  agreements such as Tanker Owners' Voluntary Agreement Concerning  Liability for Oil Pollution (TOVALOP), supported by P&amp;I  clubs,  who are insurers of the tanker industry, and Contract Regarding  a Supplement to Tanker Liability for Oil Pollution (CRISTAL), an  agreement between oil companies anticipating the coming into  force of the Fund Convention.    Limits of liability which apply under CLC and the Fund are  exceeded by the limits under the voluntary schemes as the  voluntary schemes have moved ahead of the international  conventions.</p>

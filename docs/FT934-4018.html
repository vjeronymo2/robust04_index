			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Emerging Markets: Staking a claim in China - The Emerging Investor So you want to invest in China? Many people do. Foreign companies have signed direct investment contracts worth more than Dollars 100bn (Pounds 67bn) this year alone - though the actual flow of foreign money into joint ventures in 1993 is probably nearer Dollars 15bn. Portfolio investors are equally keen to take a stake in a country which may be the next economic superpower. Economic growth rates of 13 per cent last year and probably around 12 per cent this year are hard to ignore. The past few weeks have seen a new surge of interest from foreigners, with US institutions in particular awakening to China's potential and ploughing money mainly into Hong Kong. 'All China shares have undergone an enormous re-rating as a consequence of the new perception that China is no longer Hong Kong's greatest risk, but its greatest asset and that China may be the world's most promising emerging market,' writes Mr David Whittall of Baring Securities. However, Baring and some other firms are cautious at current price levels, advocating only purchases of Chinese shares listed in either China or Hong Kong when they are initially offered at lower earnings multiples than are prevalent in the market. Though markets are encouraged by recent reform measures in vital areas such as the financial system and taxation, there is considerable uncertainty about the success of Beijing's measures to slow the overheated economy. Although the government has gone a long way towards creating a market economy, the most difficult measures, such as tackling the public sector, still lie ahead. Recent buying was sparked partly by a view that previous price declines meant that bargains were to be had and that China appeared to be avoiding a hard landing for the economy. The comments of Mr Barton Biggs, emerging markets strategist for Morgan Stanley, who said in September that he was 'maximum bullish' on China, raised the consciousness of US investors even though the investment bank later reversed September's increase in its portfolio weightings for China. Mr Mark Mobius, president of the new Templeton China World Fund, says he accepted Dollars 288m from investors but could have raised as much as Dollars 1bn. The fund became the largest of about 40 'China funds' with total net assets of around Dollars 2bn, of which all but five have sprung up within the past two years. The problem facing investors who want to participate in China's growth is that of several different vehicles available, none is perfect and all are volatile. Many investors have preferred to go through funds which profess to invest in China or in equities closely linked to China. Investing directly on the small and illiquid stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen involves a high degree of uncertainty. B shares in which foreigners are allowed to invest - A shares are for domestic investors - are volatile and profit performance varies considerably. When buying is in fashion, the small amount of stock available tends to send prices rapidly to levels which many analysts regard as overbought. Shanghai B shares rose 14 per cent during one week in November on average daily turnover of Dollars 13m - high for that market - and are now trading at an average of 18 times 1993 earnings, according to Baring Securities. Investors in B shares have to accept inadequate regulation and corporate disclosure. Although Chinese companies have come some way towards western accounting standards the typical manager of a state-owned enterprise has a pretty hazy concept of profit. These uncertainties have led fund managers to buy China via foreign markets, principally Hong Kong. The degree of exposure ranges from a small number of H shares, Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong, to 'red chips', Hong Kong companies deriving a substantial amount of their income from China, to other Hong Kong companies with less direct links to the mainland. Of 36 funds on which Micropal, publisher of the monthly Emerging Market Fund Monitor, has data, seven have more than 40 per cent of their portfolio invested in B shares and 20 have more than 40 per cent invested in Hong Kong. Eight still have more than 40 per cent of their portfolio in cash - some because their mandate is to seek equity in unlisted Chinese companies, which takes time and expertise. Though some managers feel that funds which buy principally in Hong Kong do not have a portfolio truly representative of China, many believe strongly that it is the best route. Mr Mobius, who has invested around 60 per cent of the Templeton China World Fund in Hong Kong, says: 'I feel comfortable about buying Hong Kong because it is a reflection of China and you're buying experienced managers and an accounting system you can understand.' Mr Robert Lloyd George, who runs a firm managing two China funds, notes that companies in the Hang Seng Index derive only some 2 per cent of their profits directly from China. However, the fortunes of smaller listed companies tend to be much more closely tied up in China, he says. The Lloyd George Standard Chartered China Fund has shares in about 35 smaller Hong Kong companies and half a dozen H stocks, as well as B shares. Fund managers stress, however, that China is a long-term investment which is likely to see many jolts as well as spurts forward. Investing in China via Hong Kong may add further volatility because of local factors such as the Sino-British dispute over the territory's political development.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               BARING SECURITIES EMERGING MARKETS INDICES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  Week on week movement Index                       3/12/93     Actual      Percent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- World (239)                 145.61      +2.08        +1.45 Latin America Argentina (19)               98.84      +1.08        +1.10 Brazil (18)                 131.86      -8.86        -6.29 Chile (12)                  129.05      -1.26        -0.97 Mexico (22)                 140.88      +2.74        +1.98 Latin America (71)          132.60      -0.68        -0.51 Europe Greece (14)                  82.65      +4.31        +5.51 Portugal (13)               111.30      -0.93        -0.83 Turkey (22)                 142.72      -0.24        -0.17 Europe (49)                 107.63      +1.22        +1.15 Asia Indonesia (17)              155.04      -1.02        -0.65 Korea (23)                   96.79      +1.28        +1.34 Malaysia (21)               215.62      +8.99        +4.35 Phillippines (9)            239.08      +9.39        +4.09 Thailand (20)               223.97     +10.56        +4.95 Taiwan (29)                 104.83     +10.22       +10.80 Asia (119)                  182.55      +7.92        +4.53  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Month on month movement     Year to date movement                        Actual     Percent         Actual     Percent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- World (239)            +6.37       +4.57          +44.55     +44.09 Latin America Argentina (19)         -0.75       -0.75          +24.58     +33.11 Brazil (18)            -4.03       -2.97          +53.95     +69.25 Chile (12)             +2.47       +1.95          +17.76     +15.96 Mexico (22)           +14.08      +11.11          +23.14     +19.66 Latin America (71)     +6.23       +4.93          +32.24     +32.13 Europe Greece (14)            +3.37       +4.24          +12.49     +17.81 Portugal (13)          -1.19       -1.06          +27.30     +32.49 Turkey (22)           +28.65      +25.12          +88.86    +164.96 Europe (49)            +6.98       +6.94          +37.51     +53.50 Asia Indonesia (17)         +9.69       +6.66          +57.60     +59.11 Korea (23)             +5.30       +5.97           +8.18      +9.23 Malaysia (21)          +5.56       +2.65          +86.59     +67.11 Phillippines (9)       +7.20       +3.10         +116.61     +95.23 Thailand (20)          +8.84       +4.11         +101.71     +83.20 Taiwan (29)            +8.09       +8.36          +28.87     +38.01 Asia (119)             +7.26       +4.14          +69.96     +62.13  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All indices in Dollars terms, January 7th 1992=100.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Barings Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               TEN BEST PERFORMING EMERGING MARKET STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                            Friday   Week on week change Stock                          Country      close     Dollars      %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Far Eastern Textile            Taiwan       1.17       0.23      24.16 Public Bank                  Malaysia       1.24       0.22      21.54 Formosa Plastic Corp           Taiwan       1.71       0.29      20.46 Evergreen Marine               Taiwan       1.72       0.27      18.46 Formosa Chemical &amp; Fibre       Taiwan       0.91       0.13      17.19 Shinawatra Computer &amp; Comms.

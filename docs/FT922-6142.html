			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Merry Hill interests the Richardsons - Mountleigh shopping centre may revert to former majority owners DON AND Roy Richardson, the twins who developed the Merry Hill shopping centre and sold a controlling interest in it to Mountleigh, could again emerge as the majority owners. 'If we could get some arrangement on price we couldn't let a good deal pass by,' Mr Don Richardson said yesterday, contemplating the implications of Mountleigh's collapse and anticipating that the receiver, at some stage, will sell off Mountleigh's interest. The Richardsons do not expect the receiver to dispose of the centre, the jewel in Mountleigh's somewhat tarnished UK property crown, at firesale prices. 'If he did, we'd be the first there,' Mr Richardson observed. The attraction - at a price - for the Richardsons is clear. Rents are higher than when they sold it, the capital value undoubtedly less. About 25m shoppers a year visit Merry Hill, near Dudley - indeed, it was packed yesterday. After the MetroCentre in Gateshead, it is the second largest shopping centre in Europe. But the ownership of the Merry Hill shopping centre, itself part of a wider development under construction in an enterprise zone since 1982 and involving also offices and an industrial park, is complex. The adjacent developments are largely owned by the Richardsons. The shopping centre ownership, however, can be split at least five ways. The first point is that the Richardsons still have a direct interest, the exact extent of which they have not and will not disclose. The second is that when the Richardsons, in December 1990, sold Mountleigh an interest for a sum which, again, they would not disclose, but which Mountleigh latterly valued at Pounds 160m, the payments were staged. Some payments remain outstanding, but they are secured against part of the property. Had Mountleigh managed to sell its interest to Hammerson, the UK property group, and O'Connor Group of the US, earlier this year, at least some of the takings would have found their way to the Richardsons. The third facet of the ownership is the existence of the Richmount Laser Trust, set up by Mountleigh and the Richardsons, to attract private investors seeking tax shelters through the purchase of a property in an enterprise zone. Part of the Merry Hill shopping centre is owned by the Trust. Fourth, during the years of the centre's development - over four years to the completion of the last and biggest phase in 1990 - a series of individual transactions were completed with the retailers. Some own their freehold. Others are on leases of 99 and 999 years. Others again have shorter leases: the terms of some of them are related to turnover. The fifth slice of ownership is that of Mountleigh. It is estimated that of the whole it is probably about 80 per cent. But that is not to say it owns 80 per cent of all the 260 shops on the 1.85m sq ft of retailing space at the centre. While it might own the building, the retailer may have spent twice the value of the building's shell on the interior. Given the fragmentation of the ownership and the presence of the Richardsons in the background, the sale of the Mountleigh interest in Merry Hill is likely to be a lengthy affair. It is likely to be made more complicated by fears that it might be on contaminated land, one of the reasons given for the collapse of the Hammerson-O'Connor purchase. The shopping centre is on the site of old railway sidings, next door to the old Round Oak steelworks, which closed in 1984. The Richardsons are building an office complex next door to the shopping centre on the Round Oak site. But the land has not been designated by anybody as contaminated and the Contaminated Land Register in which it was feared that it might appear does not yet exist.</p>

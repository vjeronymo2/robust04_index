			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: US regional banks extend recovery THE RECOVERY in US bank earnings was further illustrated yesterday by strong performances from regional banks in the midwest, California and the middle Atlantic regions. Banc One, the successful Ohio-based institution that has expanded rapidly through acquisitions, yesterday unveiled a 30 per cent increase in second-quarter net profits, to Dollars 181m. Earning per share were 24.3 per cent improved at 87 cents. Net earnings for the first six months of 1992 were Dollars 360m, up by 33.9 per cent on last year's first half. Banc One's annualised average 1.52 per cent return on assets remained at the highest level of US banks. Mr John McCoy, chairman, said earnings were helped by a continued strong interest margin, which averaged 6.53 per cent in the second quarter, against 5.83 per cent. Mr McCoy said asset quality had improved in recent months, with non-performing assets of Dollars 621m, up on the level of Dollars 514m in the same period last year, but down from the Dollars 645m at the end of March 1992. The bank noted the figures were not directly comparable because of the inclusion since last autumn of banks acquired in Texas. Bad debt provisions in the second quarter were Dollars 107.5m, up from Dollars 89.2m, but down from Dollars 160.9 at the end of March 1992. Net loan losses were Dollars 96m, up from Dollars 66.2m a year ago and down from Dollars 129.2m at the end of March 1992. Wall Street marked Banc One's share price Dollars  1/4 lower to Dollars 44 1/4 . Wells Fargo, the San Francisco-based bank that saw nearly all of its 1991 profits wiped out by bad debt provisions, continued the solid recovery it began in the opening months of 1992. Net earnings of Dollars 82m or Dollars 1.33 per share were dramatically better than the Dollars 14m net profit or 21 cents recorded in the second quarter of last year. The bank said lower bad debt provisions, higher interest income and growth in fee income contributed to the recovery. The bad debt provision was Dollars 300m for the second quarter, down from Dollars 350m a year ago. Mr Carl Reichardt, chairman of Wells Fargo who came under regulatory pressure last December to make heavy provisions on property loans, noted that economic conditions remained 'tenuous', particularly in California. He said loan demand was still weak and asset quality slow to recover. For the first six months, net profit was Dollars 201m, against Dollars 166m last time. Wells Fargo shares fell Dollars 2 3/8 in late trading yesterday, to Dollars 70 7/8 . Mellon Bank, based in the heart of the middle Atlantic regional economy, unveiled a 30 per cent increase in second-quarter net profits, to Dollars 90m. Net earnings per share were 18 per cent higher at Dollars 1.41. The bank's non-performing assets decreased by 5 per cent, to Dollars 825m, while bad debt provisions were unchanged at Dollars 50m and loan losses were Dollars 10m higher year-on-year at Dollars 66m. Mellon, which has Dollars 30bn of assets, achieved its recovery on the back of 18 per cent higher net interest revenues of Dollars 281m and service fee revenues that were 5 per cent better at Dollars 199m. Net profit for the first six months of 1992 was Dollars 176m, against Dollars 138m last year. Mellon's share price yesterday stood at Dollars 40 1/2, down by Dollars 1/4.</p>

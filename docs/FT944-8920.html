			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Philips Electronics to spend Dollars 45m in Hungary The Hungarian unit of Philips Electronics plans to invest Dollars 45m in Hungary over the next two years, mainly to boost its production capacity, Reuter reports from Budapest. Some of the funds will be used to establish a factory manufacturing monitors for personal computers in Szombathely in western Hungary, Philips Kft general manager Williem van der Viegt said. Another part of the investment would go toward producing combination video recorder-televisions in Philips' video recorder plant in Szekesfehervar, central Hungary, he said. Philips plans to manufacture 800,000 units of 14 and 15 inch screens by the end of 1996, Mr van der Viegt said. Increasing transport costs and the flexibility required by customers in western Europe made it necessary to move production from east Asia to central Europe.</p>

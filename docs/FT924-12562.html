			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Arts: Period polish - Chamber Orchestra of Europe On the face of it, a small-orchestra programme of Beethoven, Haydn and Schumann would seem unlikely to fill the Barbican Hall. On Saturday, however, the band was the crack Chamber Orchestra of Europe, and their conductor was the period specialist Nikolaus Harnoncourt. He is better known for his Bach and Monteverdi, but he has strong convictions about performing styles in later music too. Nothing in this programme was less than crisp and vivid. That was true even of the little Haydn violin concerto in G, called 'no. 2'  -but possibly not by Haydn at all. The orchestra's leader, Marieke Blankestijn, was the coolly assured soloist; the accompanying strings addressed their music in strictly pre-Romantic style. For Beethoven's First Symphony and Schumann's Third, the 'Rhenish', there were smallish period timpani, dry and effective, and in the earlier work fine valveless trumpets. The trumpeters returned for the Schumann with instruments of a later model, and a perfectly balanced trio of trombones spoke beautifully in the 'Cologne Cathedral' movement. But all the parts of the orchestra gleamed in that work: instead of the lush, plush sound of a big modern band, we had a lithe polyphony of voices, all colourfully distinct. Harnoncourt's beat can be slightly unrelenting, but for the pawky Landler movement - the so-called Scherzo - he relaxed to wholly disarming effect. The string of little dances took on a comic mock-innocence. In the Beethoven Harnoncourt was severer, in his more usual manner. He insisted upon clean, sharp dynamic extremes - bracing, sometimes even disconcerting, but convincing. If his treatment was occasionally stiff, the exuberant brio of his players went a long way toward compensating for it. Barbican Hall. Sponsored by ICI</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Leak Detection <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to meeting the leak prevention requirements, owners and operators of USTs must use a method listed in &sect;&sect;280.43 through 280.44 for detecting leaks from portions of both tanks and piping that routinely contain product. Deadlines for compliance with the leak detection requirements have been phased in based on the tank's age: The oldest tanks, which are most likely to leak, had the earliest compliance deadlines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Release Reporting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> UST owners and operators must, in accordance with &sect;280.50, report to the implementing agency within 24 hours, or another reasonable time period specified by the implementing agency, the discovery of any released regulated UST substances, or any suspected release. Unusual operating conditions or monitoring results indicating a release must also be reported to the implementing agency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Closure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Owners or operators who would like to take tanks out of operation must either temporarily or permanently close them in accordance with 40 CFR part 280, subpart G_Out-of-Service UST Systems and Closure. When UST systems are temporarily closed, owners and operators must continue operation and maintenance of corrosion protection and, unless all USTs have been emptied, release detection. If temporarily closed for three months or more, the UST system's vent lines must be left open and functioning, and all other lines, pumps, manways, and ancillary equipment must be capped and secured. After 12 months, tanks that do not meet either the performance standards for new UST systems or the upgrading requirements (excluding spill and overfill device requirements) must be permanently closed, unless a site assessment is performed by the owner or operator and an extension is obtained from the implementing agency. To close a tank permanently, an owner or operator generally must: Notify the regulatory authority 30 days before closing (or another reasonable time period determined by the implementing agency); determine if the tank has leaked and, if so, take appropriate notification and corrective action; empty and clean the UST; and either remove the UST from the ground or leave it in the ground filled with an inert, solid material. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Notification, Reporting, and Recordkeeping <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> UST owners who bring an UST system into use after May 8, 1986 must notify state or local authorities of the existence of the UST and certify compliance with certain technical and other requirements, as specified in &sect;280.22. Owners and operators must also notify the implementing agency at least 30 days (or another reasonable time period determined by the implementing agency) prior to the permanent closure of an UST. In addition, owners and operators must keep records of testing results for the cathodic protection system, if one is used; leak detection performance and upkeep; repairs; and site assessment results at permanent closure (which must be kept for at least three years). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Corrective Action Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Owners and operators of UST systems containing petroleum or hazardous substances must investigate, confirm, and respond to confirmed releases, as specified in &sect;&sect;280.51 through 280.67. These requirements include, where appropriate: Performing a release investigation when a release is suspected or to determine if the UST system is the source of an off-site impact (investigation and confirmation steps include conducting tests to determine if a leak exists in the UST or UST system and conducting a site check if tests indicate that a leak does not exist but contamination is present); notifying the appropriate agencies of the release within a specified period of time; taking immediate action to prevent any further release (such as removing product from the UST system); containing and immediately cleaning up spills or overfills; monitoring and preventing the spread of contamination into the soil and/or groundwater; assembling detailed information about the site and the nature of the release; removing free product to the maximum extent practicable; investigating soil and groundwater contamination; and, in some cases, outlining and implementing a detailed corrective action plan for remediation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Financial Responsibility Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The financial responsibility regulations (40 CFR part 280, subpart H) require that UST owners or operators demonstrate the ability to pay the costs of corrective action and to compensate third parties for injuries or damages resulting from the release of petroleum from USTs. The regulations require all owners or operators of petroleum USTs to maintain an annual aggregate of financial assurance of $1 million or $2 million, depending on the number of USTs owned. Financial assurance options available to owners and operators include: Purchasing commercial environmental impairment liability insurance; demonstrating self-insurance; obtaining guarantees, surety bonds, or letters of credit; placing the required amount into a trust fund administered by a third party; or relying on coverage provided by a state assurance fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. State Program Approval Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subtitle I of RCRA allows state UST programs approved by EPA to operate in lieu of the federal program. EPA's state program approval regulations under 40 CFR part 281 set standards for state programs to meet. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Scope of the UST Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are certain types or classes of tanks that are exempt from all or part of subtitle I's requirements. Specifically excluded by statute are: Farm and residential tanks of 1,100 gallons or less capacity used for storing motor fuel for noncommercial purposes; tanks used for storing heating oil for consumptive use on the premises where stored; tanks stored on or above the floor of underground areas (such as basements or tunnels); septic tanks; systems for collecting stormwater or wastewater; flow-through process tanks; emergency spill and overfill tanks that are expeditiously emptied after use; and tanks holding 110 gallons or less (42 U.S.C. 6991(1)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, and of particular importance to today's proposal, the statute excludes one type of potential ``owner'' from the corrective action requirements applicable to owners. Specifically, the statute excludes from the definition of owner any person ``who, without participating in the management of an UST, and otherwise not engaged in petroleum production, refining, and marketing, holds indicia of ownership primarily to protect the owner's security interest in the tank'' (RCRA section 9003(h)(9), 42 U.S.C. 6991b(h)(9)). This statutory provision is intended to exempt from cleanup responsibility a person whose only connection with a tank is as the holder of a security interest; i.e., a bank or other secured creditor who has extended credit to a borrower (commonly the tank's owner) and who has in return secured the loan or other obligation by taking a security interest in the tank. EPA has promulgated regulations governing corrective action under subtitle I. (See 40 CFR part 280, &sect;&sect;280.51 through 280.67.) The regulation proposed today addresses the requirements of subtitle I that are applicable to a person who holds a security interest in a tank (a ``security holder'' or merely ``holder'') from the time that the person extends the credit up through and including foreclosure and re-sale. As described in this proposed rule, a holder may face obligations either as an owner or as an operator, depending upon the specific activities undertaken by the holder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

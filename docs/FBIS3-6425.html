			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 16 (YONHAP) -- The North Korea-U.S.  package agreement was on the verge of collapsing Wednesday after  Seoul and Pyongyang officials parted with no progress to show in  arranging an exchange of presidential envoys.    Inter-Korean dialogue on exchanging envoys will resume  Saturday, and officials here said they still haven't given up  hope on reaching an agreement, although perhaps not before March  21 as expected earlier.    But the highlight of the package deal, the third round of  North Korea-U.S. high-level dialogue, will probably be suspended  indefinitely since the Stalinist state failed to meet the two  preconditions for the meeting with Washington.    Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae, chief Southern  representative at the meeting, said the delegates spent  two-thirds of the gruelling two-hour meeting on the North's  demand for a joint press statement expressing both sides' desire  to realize the envoy exchange.    Song had gone to the meeting, held at the truce village of  Panmunjom, with a revised proposal on the envoys' agenda but  barely had the chance to get into it, officials said.    Seoul and Washington cancelled this year's joint military  drill Team Spirit and promised the high-level dialogue in Geneva  on March 21 as part of a small package deal.    Pyongyang, in return, was to allow unrestricted nuclear  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and  exchange envoys with Seoul.    In a key setback, however, IAEA inspectors reported last  week  that their activities in North Korea had been hindered.    Now that neither of the two preconditions has been  fulfilled,  the March 21 meeting is virtually dead in the water.    One official admitted that North Korea's intentions are  becoming even more unclear, "but it's too early to say that the  small package deal is entirely off."    Seoul officials believe the North is trying to break the  close coordination between the South and the United States.  Pyongyang had once threatened to refuse IAEA inspections if the  United States kept insisting on an envoy exchange.    The officials said Pyongyang apparently is counting on  differences surfacing between Seoul, which demands improved  inter- Korean relations, and Washington, whose main interest  lies in maintaining nuclear safeguards and keeping the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) regime intact.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "At Last the New World Trade Order"] </F>   [Text] No country has worked harder than Australia to  obtain agreement for the more liberal trading arrangements to be  signed tonight into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  As initiator and chair of the Cairns Group, which drew together  a lobby of like-minded traders to raise a more influential voice  among the giants of world trade, Australia has been diligent,  consistent, and tenacious in its advocacy for the new regime.    The doubting and protectionist nations have not been  vanquished: they remain formidable and will continue to attempt  unilateral, managed trade where it suits them. Some of the  sectors incorporated into the GATT have still to be determined  properly, and while fears of a world broken into exclusionary  trading blocs have lessened, that threat has not disappeared.  It remains to be seen how committed regional associations such  as the European Community and the North American Free Trade  Agreement will be to giving precedence to the multilateral GATT.    But for all its faults the GATT, to come into effect next  year through a permanent governing body, the World Trade  Organization [WTO], is a powerful instrument for global  enrichment. Fairly employed, it is capable of benefiting every  signatory nation and could increase the value of export  production by $325 billion [currency not specified] a year. To  give one illustration, French consumers who last year watched  their nation's farmers do their destructive best to thwart the  deal will enjoy a cheaper and wider range of goods on their  supermarket shelves, courtesy of a reduction in subsidies and  enhanced competition emanating from trade freedoms.    Despite the failure to achieve as much as the free traders  had sought during the seven years of hard bargaining that  constituted the Uruguay Round, Australia and its fellow groupers  can claim a significant triumph out of this week's ceremonies in  Marrakesh. Our representative at the 125-nation conference is  the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan. But among all the  Australians who deserve personal credit and recognition for  their long-term roles in the negotiations two especially stand  out: former trade minister Mr John Dawkins and senior  negotiator Mr Peter Field. Next month the Cairns Group will  assemble to consider its future. There have been occasional  rifts - in the latest, Australia is quite rightly threatening to  take one of its fellow members, Canada, to the WTO because  Canada has improperly increased trade barriers on some farm  products. But the group has generally held together very well  indeed and been a highly effective alliance.    The new GATT, which member nations are expected to pass into  domestic legislation before it takes effect from next January,  will remove or lower trade tariffs and progressively free global  trade in services, agriculture, textiles, and government  procurement. Specific liberalization in some of these sectors  has yet to be agreed, but for the first time they have been  brought into the framework of rules, disciplines, and  international disputes procedures. The next big step will be to  resolve these outstanding points and negotiate the entry of the  financial services and telecommunications sectors. Some rich  nations are also pressing for uniform labor standards to be  incorporated into these trading arrangements. That issue, which  has understandably been condemned as protectionist by developing  nations, should not proceed without careful study and debate.    Rather, the priority now should be to extend the GATT's  inclusiveness by enrolling China. Beijing has been pressing for  membership since 1986. Its application has rightly been  supported by Australia and this week obtained conditional  backing from the United States, the EU, Japan, and Canada.  China stands to have the world's biggest economy by early next  century. It is unthinkable it should continue to be isolated  from the world economy. It would be a natural and auspicious  beginning for the new world trade order to be inaugurated with  the admission of what may become its biggest member.</p>

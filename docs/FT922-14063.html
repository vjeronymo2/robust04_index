			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Observer: Fobbed off The word 'retirement' has just been given a whole new meaning by Midland Bank. When Sir Kit McMahon gave up as its chairman and chief executive last year, he said he was retiring. But his departure brought him more than the customary gold fob watch and pension. Midland's accounts show he was paid Pounds 489,187 'in respect of the termination' of his service agreement and a further Pounds 60,813 was paid into his pension scheme. The bank says the payment was properly determined by a committee composed entirely of non-executive directors and chaired by Sir Patrick Meaney, whose services as a non-exec are in high demand among leading companies. Moreover McMahon was 'retired early' and therefore compensation was quite in order. It is an open secret in the City of London that the Bank of England encouraged his departure, following the collapse of his hopes that Midland would merge with Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. Now, however, Midland is once again in talks with Hongkong and Shanghai, which are expected to lead to the British bank being taken over. Curiously there is no mention of these talks in the report and accounts - not quite best corp- orate governance practice.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / UK Company News: McKechnie static at Pounds 10.5m MCKECHNIE, the plastic and metal components maker, said it was beginning to recover, although without help from the economy, as it reported pre-tax profits slightly higher at Pounds 10.6m, against Pounds 10.5m, in the six months to January 31. Mr Michael Ost, chief executive, said the restructuring, including disposal of the European metal businesses, had been completed. He expected growth in operating profits in the second half despite continuing difficult trading conditions. The shares rose 8p to 346p on the news. He said the group had increased gross margins by being tough on suppliers and resisting pricing pressure from customers. It had cut the cost base, with another 300 jobs going in the six months; and it was maximising cash flow which should be positive this year after dividends, tax and capital expenditure. The strong financial position, with gearing 6.9 per cent after disposals, would allow bolt-on acquisitions, he said. Sales in the six months fell from Pounds 153.6m to Pounds 139.9m, but this was almost entirely attributable to disposals. Pre-interest profits fell 18 per cent to Pounds 10.9m. Mr Ost said that the underlying fall was 8 per cent or Pounds 1.1m, as the recessions in the UK and US offset recovery in the Pacific area. Also affecting profits was the absence of Pounds 600,000 of non-operating gains in the previous years figures, and Pounds 700,000 of profits from the disposed businesses. The loss of these profits was more than offset by a fall in interest charges, of Pounds 2.57m to Pounds 323,000, also aided by a reduction in working capital. A fall in the tax rate from 35.4 to 32.3 per cent helped to give a small rise in earnings per share to 9p (8.8p). The interim dividend is unchanged at 5p. The plastics divisions suffered the worst fall in operating profits, down 28 per cent to Pounds 3.78m, with the vehicle components business hit by volatile demand. There were also development costs on new businesses in the US. Profits from the specialist products division fell 17 per cent to Pounds 4.3m, but Mr Ost said this was the result of the absence of profits from disposed activities. Profits from the consumer division were barely changed at Pounds 2.8m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Varosha Is To Be Opened: In his </F> letter to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, the President of  the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Rauf Denktas said: `If  Sufficient Guarantees Are Given on Benefits to the Turks on the  Island, Then Varosha Will Be Opened Under UN Control as an Area  for Contacts and Cooperation Between the Two Communities'"]    [Text] Nicosia -- Rauf Denktas, the president of the  Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC], announced that they  agreed to discuss the opening of Nicosia Airport and Varosha  [Maras], as stipulated in the confidence-building package, after  having studied the reports of the UN secretary general and  experts.    In his statement to reporters, Denktas said: "The package is  based on the principle of providing major economic benefits to  the Turkish side. The UN secretary general and experts  confirmed this. Our people will witness this. If such a  situation really does exist, then naturally it will be easy to  hold talks."  <H5>  What Does the Mini-Package Include </H5>   Briefly, Denktas said the following:    1. "So far, we were concerned with what the package gave to  and took from us. In approaching the package, we are still  defending the principles that we uphold, and we are agreeing to  talk with goodwill.    2. "We are given firm guarantees that we can fly anywhere in  the world from Nicosia Airport with our own passports, that the  flight control area of Ercan [Tymbou] Airport and the Ercan  flight information zone will not be affected, and that Ercan  will continue to function as it does at present.    3. "Our airplanes registered in Turkey will land and take  off from Nicosia Airport without any intervention.    4. "This way, the embargo will be mostly broken. The  entrance to this airport will be through two separate doors  enabling us to have full control over entrances to TRNC.    5. "The FIR [flight information region] between us and  Turkey will probably not be affected and will continue to exist  as it is, as this is related to our security."    6. Explaining that they have been told that the package has  been drawn up not to deceive the sides but to open the way to  new cooperation and, in the words of the UN secretary general,  to provide major economic advantages to the Turkish Cypriots  subjected to embargo for years, Denktas said: "We will look at  the results at the end of the talks to see if our expectations  are justified, and then we will ask our people: What do you say?    "I do not want to start an argument by replying to  Kliridhis'  statements in Thessaloniki.    "The UN secretary general is well aware of our position. He  also knows on which principles we will not retreat. Our desire  is to hold talks in goodwill."  <H5>  Shuttle Diplomacy in TRNC Starting Today </H5>   Indicating that the UN secretary general's special  representative in Cyprus Joe Clark will meet with him and  Kliridhis today, Denktas said that shuttle diplomacy might start  between the sides at the end of February, and in the case of  positive results the need might arise to go to New York.</p>

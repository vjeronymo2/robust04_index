			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS RISE TO THE EASTER OCCASION  </P> <P> Sunrise services, the Hallelujah Chorus, colorful baskets, egg hunts -- to all  these longtime Easter traditions, many Orange Countians now add dining out. So  virtually all local hotels and most restaurants meet the demand by offering  gala brunches or holiday dinners, or both, on Sunday.  </P> <P> Reservations, of course, are essential. Here are just a few of the  possibilities:  </P> <P> * At the Disneyland Hotel's Easter brunch, children up to 12 years old will  hunt for eggs on the gazebo lawn from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The brunch itself,  served in the grand ballroom from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., highlights a buffet  of round of beef, roast leg of lamb, seafood, freshly made waffles and omelets,  intricately decorated Easter eggs. Reservations: (714) 956-6709.  </P> <P> * With an Easter bunny to snap your picture, a magician to entertain, the  Reuben E. Lee in Newport Beach serves a champagne buffet brunch from 9 a.m. to  3 p.m. It's $16.95 for adults, $7.95 for children ages 5 to 12. Sunday Easter  dinner, starting at 3 p.m., features a complete ham dinner for $12.95.

It's $18.95 per person without champagne and $21.95 with. (714)  540-5112.  </P> <P> * Also on the bay, Newport Landing on Balboa peninsula features a sit-down  champagne brunch from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Selections vary from Belgian waffles  with macadamia nuts, chocolate chips or berries to abalone benedict, New York  steak and eggs. Afterward, move upstairs to the oyster bar and lounge, when the  calypso band, The Islanders play from 1 to 5 p.m. Reservations: (714) 675-2373.  </P> <P> * At the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point, the hotel's award-winning executive chef  Christian Rassinoux and his staff will create an Easter brunch to enjoy in the  Cafe and at the Pavilion from 11 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. The tab is $35 per person,  with children under 12 half-price.

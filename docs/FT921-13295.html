			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Battle over Russia's runaway central bank: Why control over credit may be vital for Yeltsin's survival A BITTER subterranean struggle is now convulsing the Russian administration. It is between the Russian cabinet and the country's central bank, and it is about control of credit. The stakes are high: either the government wins control of credit in a matter of weeks, or it falls, according to Professors Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard and Anders Aslund of the Stockholm Centre for Soviet and East European Economies, two foreign advisers to the Russian government. In their view, the demon is Mr Georgy Matiukhin, the academic-turned-chairman of the central bank. Mr Matiukhin, on government estimates, advanced credit mainly to the commercial banks, to the tune of Rbs600bn last year. Credit was advanced at an accelerating rate as the year progressed and at an interest rate of 6 per cent. The credit went to industrial enterprises, and now keeps them afloat, protecting them from market influences and allowing them to hoist prices without regard to sales. It allows military-industrial plants to produce armaments no one wants even when the budget allocation to defence equipment has been cut to 12 to 15 per cent of last year's level. Since the main prize the government hopes to achieve in the immediate future is a cut in the rate of inflation, control of money supply is critical. A plan last year to bypass the central bank by creating a new Russian state bank was dropped. The government has since tried to depose Mr Matiukhin. Last month Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform, told the daily newspaper Izvestia that a new chairman - Mr Boris Feodorov, a senior executive with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London - would soon be taking over from Mr Matiukhin. That has not happened. Mr Matiukhin survives mainly because he is responsible not to the government but to parliament. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, or chairman, is himself the sternest of critics of the government's economic policies, having called for its dismissal and for Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, to distance himself from the government which he heads. Mr Matiukhin claimed in a recent interview that he now has tight control of monetary policy, following talks with Mr Gaidar and his colleagues. However, he has resisted providing information either to the government or to the International Monetary Fund, from which the government wants to put a strong team inside the bank to run monetary policy. But Mr Matiukhin can also claim to have been wronged by the government. When he was stoking up the fires of credit last year he was quietly encouraged to do so by a Russian government which wanted to destabilise the central, Soviet power. But now that Russia is independent and requires monetary prudence, Mr Matiukhin is being turned upon and savaged by Mr Yeltsin's government. Indeed, Mr Yeltsin himself took a sideways swipe at him in his speech to the Russian parliament last Thursday, when he alleged 'sabotage' of reform by powerful forces. The government is preparing new stratagems inside and outside parliament to deal with Mr Matiukhin. As Russia's application to join the IMF as a full member is being processed, there will be more pressure from the world economic community to open the bank's books and to enforce discipline - otherwise the desperately needed support for reform, through a stabilisation fund for converting the rouble and for purchasing imported food, will not be forthcoming. A showdown is not far off.</p>

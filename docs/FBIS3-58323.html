			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Do More or Pull Out"] </F>   [Text] NATO leaders in Brussels yesterday declared their  determination to eliminate obstacles to United Nations  operations in the old Yugoslav federation. In particular they  threatened air strikes to break the strangulation of Sarajevo,  the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and other parts of that state  where the population is at risk. Their priorities are to open  the large, modern airport at Tuzla for the distribution of  humanitarian aid and to enable Danish troops to relieve a  Canadian contingent blocked in Srebrenica.    The embarrassing question of Bosnia was forced on to the  Brussels agenda by the French, who have the largest national  contingent in former Yugoslavia. It remains to be seen whether  yesterday's declaration will amount to anything more than a  similar commitment made by Nato, but never implemented, more  than five months ago. At present, the UN is devoting greater  resources to supplying its own forces in Bosnia than to the  purpose for which they are there: the delivery of emergency aid  to civilians caught in the vicious struggle between Serbs,  Croats and Muslims. The lack of political will is such that a  lone gunman can halt an entire convoy with its armoured escort.  Such impotence is humiliating, both for the governments which  have contributed to the UN force and for the soldiers  themselves. It has led General Jean Cot, the French overall  commander, to call for reinforcements, and last week provoked  the resignation of General Francis Briquemont, the Belgian  commander in Bosnia. The current situation is obviously  intolerable. There is a case for the UN to abandon its  operations in Yugoslavia. But, if relief is to continue, then  UN troops must be empowered to use whatever degree of force  proves necessary to move supplies.    The NATO declaration merely threatens air strikes. It omits  to mention that a tougher policy would also require  reinforcements on the ground. If the UN is to use Tuzla  Airport, open the road from Mostar to Sarajevo and assure access  to the Muslim enclaves in eastern Bosnia, it must be prepared  not merely to make an armed demonstration, but also to protect  areas which have been secured. The worst course would be for  NATO, acting for the Security Council, to make a one-off gesture  without any intention of following up. The alliance must pursue  a coherent plan for relieving those areas most at risk from the  fighting.    Fortunately, in General Cot and General Michael Rose,  Briquemont's successor, it has two able officers who have worked  together before. Several NATO governments, including the  British, have talked of the possibility of withdrawing their  forces in the spring if a settlement has not been reached. That  option should remain open. But the immediate task is to turn a  flagging aid operation into an effective channel for relief  through the rest of the Bosnian winter.</p>

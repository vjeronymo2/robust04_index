			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / EC law delays prison scheme THE CONTRACTING out of the management of Strangeways prison in Manchester has been further delayed by complications arising from EC legislation designed to protect the rights of workers in takeovers and mergers. The deadline for submitting bids to run the prison has been put back by four weeks to April 13 to allow contractors extra time to prepare bids that comply with the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations 1981. The Tupe regulations, which implement the EC legislation in the UK, require the successful bidder to offer the same terms and conditions to prison staff who transfer to the private sector. This is the third delay since Home Office lawyers advised in December that the regulations would apply. It comes as attempts to contract out the prison service stores to the private sector have collapsed - also because of the regulations. The contract to run the stores was won by Beck &amp; Pollitzer, the contract services group. The company has withdrawn after it emerged that the contract would be covered by the regulations. The contract now goes to an in-house team, which put in the second lowest bid. The 140 employees - who had been issued with redundancy notices - have been offered their old jobs back. Beck &amp; Pollitzer is negotiating with the prison service over providing advice and assistance in implementing the in-house bid. The two contracts were put out to tender as part of the government's market-testing programme, under which private contractors have been given the opportunity to bid for almost Pounds 1.5bn of government work. Recent decisions of the European Court of Justice have extended the scope of the regulations to cover contracting-out of many public ser-vices. Mr John Sheldon, acting general secretary of the NUCPS civil service union, said of the prison stores reversal: 'It's about time the government accepted that the regulations do apply to most market-testing.'</p>

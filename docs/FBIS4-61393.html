			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Lyudmila Aleksandrova and </F> Lyudmila Yermakova]    [Text] Moscow May 5 TASS -- "We, representatives of  business circles, expect much of the treaty", President of the  Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Arkadiy  Volskiy said in interview with TASS on Thursday.    This view is shared by other participants in today's second-  stage signing ceremony in the Kremlin, during which Russia's  major industrialists, agrarians, entrepreneurs and bankers put  their signatures under the treaty on social accord.    The main thing that prompted the Russian Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs to sign the document is  renunciation of the use of force and any actions involving  bloodshed, Volskiy added. He noted that so far the point at  issue has been accord in the political sphere, but this is not  enough for the economy. The next thing to do is to work out  appropriate measures with a view to stop the current economic  recession and output decline, the industrialist believes.  "Unless we manage to pass this stage, unless we achieve  economic accord, the treaty will become senseless", he stressed.    Presidential Aide Georgiy Satarov told reporters that the  country's business community had been amply represented at  today's signing ceremony. Their role is especially significant  now that the crisis is being aggravated, and they may become the  principal force to help overcome this crisis, the aide  emphasised. He reported that the next stage of the signing  would take place on May 12. This will not be the last stage,  since the document is open for further signing by any  organization concerned and interested.</p>

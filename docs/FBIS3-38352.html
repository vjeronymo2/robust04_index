In your editorial of January  28, "Alms and arms," you no longer do this. But the new ground  of attack is just as flawed.    The Foreign Affairs Committee soon will review expenditure  on  Pergau and our Aid and Trade Provision [ATP]. I do not,  therefore, intend to go into the details here. The Prime  Minister and I have already made clear our position in the House  of Commons. But to correct the latest suggestions:    1. The formal offer of ATP support for Pergau was made in  April 1989, not as you suggest only a month after the Memorandum  of Understanding on Defence Procurement was signed in September  1988. The companies' application was first lodged in November  1988. The final decision was taken in February 1991.    2. Pergau is only one of 23 development projects in Malaysia  which we have supported with ATP since the scheme was introduced  by the Labour Government in 1977.    3. ATP has not been used at any stage for projects in  Malaysia covered by the 1988 memorandum.    The Malaysian Government regard the Pergau project as  important for their country's economic development and the  diversification of its energy resources. Our aid has helped to  build a relationship which has brought benefits to both  countries. These have included a large increase in British  exports -- one of the acknowledged objectives of the Aid and  Trade Provision. Our exports to Malaysia rose to almost 900  million pounds last year, nearly three times the 1988 figure.    On the separate issue of the defence relationship, we have  long been partners of Malaysia in the Five Power Defence  Arrangements. It is right that we have been and continue to be  ready to help Malaysia to acquire the equipment which it needs  for its armed forces. None of this has been done under the aid  programme.    I find extraordinary the argument that Britain is wrong to  pursue defence sales overseas within the rules which we have  laid down. Developed and developing countries alike should have  the right to buy the equipment which they need for their defence  or for peacekeeping, provided that national and international  laws are observed. Malaysia is a friendly and peaceable  Commonwealth country. Exports made a big contribution to the  success of Britain's defence industry.    You suggest that our decision on Pergau threatens Britain's  reputation for plain dealing. That is nonsense. ATP is a  recognised form of aid, covered by OECD guidelines to which we  adhere. If we had failed to honour our commitment to the Pergau  project, then indeed our reputation for plain dealing would have  suffered--and British interests with it.    Yours faithfully,    DOUGLAS HURD,    Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London SW1.    January 29.</p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 'JOHN HAMMOND' TONIGHT ON KCET  </P> <P> Some years ago, the legendary talent scout John Hammond went to Chicago to take  part in a public television special staged in his honor. He was surrounded by  many of the artists in whose careers he had played a seminal role; he talked  with them and about them.  </P> <P> Because that program, which has been rerun several times, was a unique tribute  overflowing with live talent, it is difficult to understand the raison d'etre  for "John Hammond: From Bessie Smith to Bruce Springsteen," to be seen tonight  at 10:15 on KCET Channel 28 as part of the "American Masters" series.  </P> <P> The earlier show was 90 minutes long; the new one is half an hour shorter.  Whereas giants such as Benny Goodman, Teddy Wilson, George Benson and Bob Dylan  performed entire songs, live and in person, in Hammond's presence, this  posthumous show (he died in 1987) finds the artists often in truncated early  film clips; typically, Billie Holiday begins to sing one number and after eight  bars the emcee, Ossie Davis, interrupts with a voice-over.  </P> <P> Hammond is seen in color footage apparently shot not long before his death, and  in snippets from a black-and-white interview in 1958 with the very unhip  Gilbert Seldes. Comments about Hammond's role as a radical reformer and  integrationist visionary are offered by Nat Hentoff, Milt Hinton, George Wein  and others. Peter Seeger talks for a minute about the blacklisting days. Count  Basie and Aretha Franklin are shown in short black-and-white segments. The  cliche clips so familiar in jazz documentaries -- shots of jitterbugs, Harlem  street scenes -- are shown yet again.  </P> <P> There is valuable music and a measure of historic information here, but much of  it smacks of deja vu. (How many more times are we going to see that one and  only Bessie Smith film?) Those who did not see the earlier program may well  find this sequel fascinating, though its better passages might well have been  telescoped into the form of an addendum to the original.LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

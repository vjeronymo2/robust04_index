			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Independent Parts gets Pounds 20m valuation via placing Shares in Independent Parts Group (IPG) were yesterday priced at 112p in a placing with institutional investors for a flotation capitalising the vehicle components company at Pounds 20m. Peel Hunt, the company's stockbroker, will place 7.15m shares, representing about 44 per cent of the equity, raising Pounds 7.6m net of expenses. IPG is the holding company for Tuberex, a manufacturer of automotive exhaust systems, and Veco, a wholesale distributor of replacement vehicle components. Turnover to end-March 1994 for the combined group was Pounds 13.5m, with pre-tax profits of just over Pounds 2m. The placing receipts will be used to repay borrowings, which will leave the group ungeared.</p>

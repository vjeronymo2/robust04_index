			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / UK Company News: The right mix for an early flotation - Kenwood and its plans for coming to market MR TIM PARKER is very anxious not to be seen as a man in hurry to make a fortune. Tousle-haired with footballer looks, the 36 year-old former Treasury economist is about to bring Kenwood to the stock market a little under three years after taking the famous maker of kitchen appliances private in a management buy-out from Thorn EMI. Mr Parker will, of course, make a paper fortune from the June flotation that is likely to raise Pounds 45m-Pounds 50m. The 11 members of the buy-out team are only selling up to 20 per cent of their stakes - enough to pay off loans taken out for the MBO - but they will be left with about 9 per cent of a company capitalised at about Pounds 100m. The float will also give Kenwood access to capital markets and opportunities to expand through acquisitions that simply would not exist with its current level of debt. It will rank as one of the faster and more successful exits for investors, though considerably slower than Taunton Cider, which also floats this summer little more than a year after the MBO. 'We have a good five-year record as a team,' says Mr Parker at modest offices in Havant, Hampshire, that show all the signs of being run by a cost-conscious management. 'This is not the story of any old MBO that has cut a few costs. The flotation is not just an MBO harvesting arrangement.' But Mr Parker accepts that Kenwood's 900 staff could lose motivation when they read about the small management team's new found paper riches and has spent some time addressing the issue. All senior department heads already own options but they will be given new packages after the float. Further down the company, staff can already contribute to a share save scheme and Mr Parker is planning an employee share option plan which will subscribe to up to 10 per cent of the new share offer at the flotation price. To varying degrees, therefore, Kenwood's employees are already along for the ride - although only a handful are travelling first class. It has been quite a journey, but not without its bumpy patches. For years Kenwood had been stifled within Thorn EMI's white goods division where, despite a strong international brand name, it was never allowed to grow as a focused small appliances company. The lead given by Mr Kenneth Wood, the founder and inventor of the Kenwood Chef 45 years ago, had slowly ebbed away and companies like Braun and Moulinex had made much of the running in developing new markets. Mr Parker found the backing, from NatWest bank and a buy-out fund of venture capitalist, Candover Investments. But having paid what was seen as a full price of Pounds 56.5m, the MBO team only just hit the banks' targets, narrowly avoiding a renegotiation which would have handed an additional slice of equity to the financiers. But Kenwood has bounced back with vigour. The company is now selling 200 products, where five years ago there were only 20; through designer Kenneth Grange, who has been working with Kenwood for 31 years, the company has developed what it calls a Kenwood look and got rid of what Mr Parker calls the 'funny sort of raspberry colours'; and Kenwood's high overheads have been slashed. The results, during one of the toughest consumer recessions, speak for themselves. Pre-tax profits in the year to March 1991 were Pounds 6.6m on sales of Pounds 76m, up from Pounds 4.2m on sales of Pounds 66.7m the previous year. And the prospectus is likely to report a further jump to profits of Pounds 9.5m on sales of Pounds 92m, despite Pounds 5.5m of interest charge. So why float now? Why did Mr Parker not wait to enjoy the benefit of a resurgence in consumer spending? Mr Parker says he could have continued to soldier on with the banks. But at 4pm in the morning of April 10 this year, as it became clear that the Conservatives had been returned to power, Mr Parker - a one time chairman of Oxford University Labour Club - knew he should seize the moment. Quite apart from the boost that the stock market has since enjoyed, Mr Parker is wary of losing momentum through delay. He remembers that two weeks after closing the deal to buy Kenwood in 1989, finance for MBOs dried up almost overnight after Japanese banks withdrew their support for the United Airlines buy-out. Depending on the flotation price, Kenwood is hoping it will either repay all of its debt or end up with a small cash balance after costs. That price obviously depends to some extent on how much froth remains in the London stock market over the next month. Furthermore, Mr Parker believes it should also reflect the unusual qualities of the company which make it such a good growth prospect. 'We are semi-unique,' he says. 'We are an international design consumer goods company that happens to be in small kitchen appliances, and Kenwood is an extremely well known brand internationally.'</p>

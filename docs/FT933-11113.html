			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg faces up to golden question - The rally in gold shares has been driven by offshore investors Mr Donald Gordon, chairman of the Liberty Life group, enjoys a reputation in Johannesburg as an investment guru. His announcement last week, therefore, that Liberty would raise R1bn (Dollars 222m) by selling off 20 per cent of its strategic investments has been cause for some concern. The reasoning is that if 'Donny' is lessening his equity exposure to the tune of R1bn, then this is an unequivocal bear signal. This cautionary note comes against the background of an equity market deprived of the certainties of the recent past when it could be assumed that financial and industrial stocks would outperform, while gold did nothing. The judgment calls are now much more difficult. Whatever uncertainties the future holds, the past has at least brought a warm glow to the hearts of gold bulls who, at last, have had cause to celebrate after years in the wilderness. Driven by the improved dollar and rand bullion price, the performance of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) this year has been dominated by the 150 per cent gain in the All Gold index to its current level of 1,988, from 786 at the start of the year. On the back of this, the overall index has climbed some 25 per cent to 4,087, while the industrials index has hardly moved, rising only 4.9 per cent to 4,573, from 4,359 in January. The gold rally has been music in the ears of brokers, who have profited from the higher turnover of shares. In June, for example, the value of shares traded on the JSE was R3.52bn, 77 per cent higher than a year ago. This has boosted the JSE's dismal liquidity ratio to an annualised level of 6.63 per cent, compared with 4.42 per cent a year ago. Any investor with exposure to gold is also sure to have prospered handsomely. The hard question is where gold goes to from here. The JSE view is broadly positive, although analysts are cautious not to predict the gold price rushing ahead to Dollars 500/oz; nor do they believe the recent price strength is a hoax about to dissolve before their eyes. Mr Rob Lee of the Board of Executors, a financial services institution, says that given the sort of dividend increases which can be anticipated, the current level of gold prices can be justified. Looking ahead, he is bullish about the prospects for the dollar price of gold. Given an inevitable deterioration in the value of the rand - the one fundamental all pundits seem agreed on - he believes gold shares 'will go a lot higher than they are now'. Given the near vertical ascent in the bullion price, and share prices, many anticipate a short-term correction before the market moves further ahead. Against this it is argued that the recent run in share prices has been largely driven by US general funds. Local institutions and European investors have been on the sidelines or selling. These investors, the reasoning goes, may well use any weakness in share prices as an excuse to get into the market, thus underpinning equity prices. If this is so, it will take a sharp drop in the bullion price to crack share prices. Certainly local institutions appear underweight in gold. Whereas the All Gold index accounts for 10 per cent of the overall JSE capitalisation, reports from the 23 general equity unit trusts for the June quarter reveal that 16 of them have 5 per cent or less gold in their portfolio. These figures confirm that the buying has been coming from offshore. JSE figures released two weeks ago show that, following years of being net sellers of equities, non-residents have bought more than R2bn of shares this year, most of which will have gone into gold. As big a headache as the outlook for gold is the high level of the industrial market, currently on a dividend yield of 2.5 per cent. This level has only twice been reached before: during the 1969 and 1987 crashes. The market appears to be discounting some fairly robust profits growth, but this is not a view supported by economic fundamentals. Predictions for 1993 GDP growth are in the -0.5 to 0.5 per cent range and 1994 is seen as offering only modest growth prospects. Corporate profits are thus likely to remain under pressure for some time, though the downward trend in interest rates will offer some respite. As for the politics, the market is either taking a very sanguine view of negotiations, or believes that equities will be the best place to be, should the situation unravel. In all, a better time to be a broker than a fund manager.</p>

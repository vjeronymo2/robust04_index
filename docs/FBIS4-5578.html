			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Hwang Yu-song: "Closure of North </F> Korea's Operational Office in Macao"]    [Text] Macao has been reportedly known as a base of North  Korea's overseas activities. "Korea International Tourist  Corporation in Macao" is the name of North Korea's such office  in Macao. In the mid-seventies, North Korea opened it to  attract foreign tourists to Pyongyang and to promote its trade  with other countries. Many people have so far denounced,  however, that this office has played a great role as a base of  the North Korean intelligence organization's overseas activities  in Southeast Asia without doing its own business, such as  tourism and trade.    Recently this office was closed and stopped issuing visas  for  tourists to go to North Korea. It is, therefore, very  significant.    On 30 March, a female clerk working in this office said to a  person who visited there to apply for visa: "We no longer  handle visa or consular business in Macao. If you want to apply  for a visa, you should go to Beijing, China." She also said  that "North Korean officials in the office had already left  Macao for Beijing."    North Korea's past kidnapping of actress Choe Un-hui is a  model case of its overseas operational activities through the  office in Macao. Actress Choe was kidnapped by North Korean  agents in Hong Kong in early 1978, then transferred to North  Korea via its office in Macao.    The overseas activities of the North Korean Macao office  reached the peak of its intelligence activity with the explosion  of KAL [Korean Air] 858 by Kim Hyon-hui in 1987. Kim Hyon-hui  studied Chinese language there, as well as received a training  course to adapt herself to capitalist society from July 1985 to  January 1987, immediately before the explosion of KAL 858 took  place.    Since the incident by Kim Hyon-hui, the Macao Government has  expelled some North Korean officials from Macao and kept an eye  on the others who worked in the office because of the ROK  Government's strong protest. As a result, since then, the  office -- which at one time had more than 30 employees -- have  reduced the number of its employees by ten. Also, the number of  North Korean residents in Macao have decreased from 380 to 100  since the late 1980's.    It has not been disclosed why North Korea has closed down  the  office in Macao. It can be assessed, however, that North Korea  could close the office under the following reasons: the  reduction of its value as a base for overseas intelligence  activity, the rapid reduction of foreign tourists to North Korea  through Macao since the North Korean nuclear issue has emerged,  and the difficulties in maintaining the office as a result of  its economic situation.</p>

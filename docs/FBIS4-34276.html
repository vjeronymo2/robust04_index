			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] A meeting is taking place at this time in Santa Fe  de Bogota to discuss the Penal Code. Participating in the  meeting are Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff, Justice  Minister Andres Gonzalez, and Attorney General Carlos Gustavo  Arrieta.    Prosecutor General de Greiff has reappeared with firm steps.  This time, speaking to Attorney General Arrieta, Justice  Minister Gonzalez, and hundreds of agents of the Attorney  General's Office, he defended the benefits of the law on  surrender and reduction of penalties in Colombia, and questioned  the double standards of the United States on the subject.    [Begin de Greiff recording] The United States criticizes  Colombia because supposedly we have very mild sentences against  drug traffickers, especially when they surrender to justice.  They claim that the United States has the right system, which  consists of very tough sentences. Those high sentences are  applied to some Colombians, but I do not know of any case in  which U.S. drug traffickers have given life sentences. [end  recording]    De Greiff also referred to the possible surrender of Cali  Cartel leaders.    [Begin de Greiff recording] I believe that would be their  best choice because otherwise, the Prosecutor General's Office  will continue its policy of pursuing them. [end recording]    With regard to the scandalous espionage case at the  residence  of Presidential Candidate Ernesto Samper, de Greiff said that  espionage is a crime, and therefore those reports will be  investigated.    De Greiff also proposed a legislative reform to monitor  arrests in Colombia.</p>

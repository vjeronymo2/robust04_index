			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (6): Consumer revolution grips Russia - A rocky road to capitalism / Many of the world's biggest multinationals are rapidly developing their presence in Russia For the past 70 years, Russia has been a land without shopkeepers. In the Soviet economy, the retail trade almost ranked as an afterthought as industry manufactured products, according to the central economic plans, and pushed them through to the consumer irrespective of demand. There was little need to advertise; no need to woo the customer. But as Russia starts the rocky road to capitalism, a great consumer revolution is under way. The process is most visible at the top of the market as status-conscious Russians snap up western trinkets. Posh boutiques, such as Christian Dior and Escada, now brighten up Russia's shopping arcades. The best-dressed clients of fashionable restaurants are no longer foreigners but the new generation of Russian businesmyeni. Stretch limousines cruise Moscow's streets. The mass market is changing just as fast. Following a high-profile advertising campaign for Snickers chocolate bars, Russians joked that the country has now entered a third phase of economic development. First came industrialisation, then 'collectivisation,' and finally 'snickersisation' as 150m Russians satisfy their craving for consumer goods. Thousands of kiosks, stocking Marlboro cigarettes and Absolut vodka, have mushroomed on street corners. The country's bold privatisation programme, which effectively transferred thousands of shops to their employees, is stimulating real competition between Russia's retailers. The more energetic entrepreneurs are flourishing while the less aggressive are going to the wall. In such a fast-changing business climate, it is not easy for western companies to exploit the pent-up demand. Several retailers, such as Benetton, Panasonic, Julius Meinl and Galeries Lafayette, have opened stores. Littlewoods, the Liverpool-based retailer which started trading in St Petersburg in 1991, has also been one of the most adventurous companies to enter the market. Littlewoods has opened five clothing and food stores and is developing trading links with a large local clothing manufacturer with a view to exporting Russian-made goods. It says its stores are trading successfully and will continue to invest substantial resources. But as a private company, Littlewoods can afford to adopt a longer time horizon than most. A thicket of bureaucratic complications, the ever-changing legal framework and the fast-growing pandemic of crime has made life difficult for the other pioneers. The political and economic risks remain high. No-one has yet produced accurate enough market research for consumer spending patterns to lend much confidence. Most leading western retailers are maintaining a watching brief on the market waiting for it to mature. That has left western exporters with a problem. There are extremely few dependable western-style outlets through which they can sell their goods. That means dealing with Russian operators, who are inevitably inexperienced and often unreliable, or setting up their own distribution networks, which requires a big commitment. Nevertheless, many of the world's biggest multinationals, such as Philip Morris, Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever, Mars, and RJR Nabisco, are rapidly developing their presence in Russia. The simplest approach for fast-moving consumer goods manufacturers is to stimulate the 'pull' side of the marketing equation by making their goods available and making consumers want to buy them through advertising, which remains cheap by world standards, despite sharp price rises. For example, Cadbury Schweppes, the UK chocolate and drinks manufacturer, has adopted just such an approach for its Wispas and Picnic bars and recently reported it was achieving annual exports approaching Pounds 10m. The US multinational, RJR Nabisco, has also targeted Russia as a fast-growing market and opened a secure warehouse in Moscow to supply its products, including Planters' peanuts. 'We started out small and conservative and we did not have an advertising blitz. We picked a few stores we wanted to be in - mainly the hard currency stores - and used it as our test market. That went well and then we started to sell for roubles to Russian distributors,' says Mr Ruben Ter-Minasyan, a Moscow sales representative for RJR Nabisco. Nabisco advertises mainly through in-store promotions building up relationships on a store by store basis. The company also employs a large dummy Mr Peanut who tours around Moscow handing out free samples. Nabisco relies on Russian distributors to sell its goods in the big cities and says they are learning fast as the market develops. 'We are trying to work with the companies which like to work and want to work. The wholesalers could make astronomical profits one or two years ago of 50 per cent or even 100 per cent, but it is real work now. The margin is going down as the turnover is going up. Our wholesalers make 10 to 15 per cent margins and the retailers make the same margins, too,' says Mr Ter-Minasyan. At present, the balance of risk and reward is still unfavourably tilted against western investors, but that is rapidly changing. And while China's startling economic growth has obsessed western executives, it would be foolish to ignore Russia's potential. The country's painful economic stabilisation programme is at last paying some dividends, the sharp contraction of industrial production is slowing down, and the service sector is growing at a phenomenal rate. Those executives who laughed at talk of a Russian economic 'miracle' are feeling a little less comfortable today.  -------------------------------------------------------------------         RUSSIAN FEDERATION: FORECAST RETAIL TURNOVER, 1994-1998  -------------------------------------------------------------------                  Rbs billion at constant 1993 prices  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Retail       1994     1995     1996     1997     1998    % change  ------------------------------------------------------------------- sector                                                    1994-98  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Food        8,869    8,941    8,994    9,057    9,256         4.4  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Non-food    7,026    7,256    7,286    8,294    9,256        31.7  ------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL      15,895   16,197   16,780   17,351   18,512        16.5  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Euromonitor  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Interior Minister Imre Konya reacted to the  statement by Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist  Party [MSZP], late last night in a press release to MTI.  [passage omitted]    [Begin recording] [Konya] I consider these kinds of  statements as giving rise to great concern. Here in this  country we have succeeded over the past four years in creating a  police force that is really free of politics; and now a chairman  of a political party -- and what is more, a party which,  together with the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats], is  preparing to govern in coalition -- brings into doubt in a  public statement the correct behavior, the training, and the  professionalism of this police force.    I think that such statements may be very significant warning  signs for the future. Such an excessive power is a danger to  democracy in any case and even more so if the MSZP has a larger  than two-thirds parliamentary majority. They will be able to do  what they want and that is not at all reassuring in the light of  such statements. I hope that in the course of this week the  police will be able to provide unambiguously proven facts to the  public. [passage omitted]    [Unidentified correspondent] Is there the slightest  suspicion  that it [Horn's road accident] was not an accident?    [Konya] No such suspicion exists whatsoever -- apart from  the  suspicion raised by Chairman Horn. [end recording]</p>

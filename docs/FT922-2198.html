			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: Olivetti warns of further restructuring OLIVETTI, the Italian computers and office equipment group, suffered a 4 per cent drop in sales in the first four months of this year. It may need further restructuring before returning to profitability. The warning, made by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman, came in the middle of a week-long conference aimed at restoring confidence in the loss-making company. Olivetti last month announced a L459.8bn (Dollars 387m) loss for 1991, largely due to restructuring costs, and passed its dividend. Although Mr De Benedetti declined to give details on sales or earnings ahead of next week's annual meeting, he expressed confidence that Olivetti would meet its target of breaking even this year. In spite of the fall in sales, Olivetti's volumes had increased in the first four months of 1992. The difference was explained by the continuing slide in prices for many information technology products. Prices for a 'basket' of Olivetti goods had dropped by 15 per cent in the year to April 1992. However, within that basket, prices for personal computers, which account for around 30 per cent of Olivetti's turnover, had plunged by over 45 per cent, while other goods had remained firm. Mr De Benedetti said there were mixed signals in the market. While demand was still constrained by recession in many countries, the process of 'downsizing' - the transition to cheaper and ever more powerful computers - had reached a turning point, he said. 'I see the possibility of a quite important recovery by the beginning of 1993,' he said. The question of further job cuts at Olivetti, which has slimmed its workforce by around 25 per cent in the past two years, 'depends on the quantity of work'. With sales still shrinking, further savings might be necessary, he implied. 'We will adjust our workforce to the success we have on the market.' Mr De Benedetti gave no indication as to whether Olivetti might move more of its manufacturing abroad, especially for low-cost products. However, he drew attention to the impending North American Free Trade Agreement, and the impact this could have on companies, such as Olivetti, which are already well established in Mexico, where labour costs are low.</p>

			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> POLICE LOOKING AT PECK COLLAPSE  </P> <P> Police investigators sifted through Polly Peck International's books today to  try to solve the mystery over what caused one of Britain's biggest corporate  collapses.  </P> <P> The Serious Fraud Office, which investigates major corporate crime, said it had  searched the London office of the conglomerate that had interests from fruit to  electronics.  </P> <P> Control of Polly Peck International PLC was handed to court administrators last  week after it missed payments on its $2.1-billion debt.  </P> <P> The fraud office said police and accounting investigators were examining the  company's financial records.  </P> <P> The search expanded a previously launched probe into alleged trading  irregularities in the stock of Polly Peck, one of Britain's hottest shares of  the 1980s. The stock, valued at $3.95 billion in July, is now deemed worthless.  </P></p>

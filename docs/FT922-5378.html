			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow slips back after hitting record high Wall Street US EQUITIES ended the day modestly lower yesterday after soaring to record levels in the morning yesterday, bolstered by a strong first quarter GDP advance, lower bond market yields and buoyant overseas markets, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The day started on a strong note, following Thursday's record close, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average passed the important 3,400 level within minutes of opening and remained above that level until the last half hour of trading. Contributing to the bullishness was a report that GDP had risen 2.4 per cent in the first quarter, its most substantial gain since the same period of 1989. The Dow's failure to hold above 3,400, however, caused some analysts to speculate that the market is now set to turn lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 3,396.88, down 1.55 in moderately heavy volume of more than 204m shares. Advancing issues led those declining by 966 to 726. While the more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also moved lower, sliding 1.39 to 415.35, the Nasdaq composite bucked the trend to rise 4.82 to 585.31. On Thursday, the Dow rose 27.99 to 3,398.43. A second day of declining bond yields also bolstered the equity market through most of the day. In late trading, the treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was  1/4 higher at 101 27/32 , yielding 7.833 per cent. Airline stocks recovered some of their previous day's losses. Shares in AMR, parent of American Airlines, firmed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 63 1/4 , Delta Airlines was unchanged at Dollars 57; UAL, parent of United Airlines, added Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 118 3/8 and USAir was Dollars 1/2 higher at Dollars 12 5/8 . Pharmaceutical company stocks saw active trading, with Merck slipping Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 50 1/4 and Glaxo's ADR's up Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 28 1/4 . Trading was heavy in a number of blue-chip stocks including General Motors, up Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 39 7/8 and Citicorp, Dollars  1/8 higher at Dollars 18 5/8 . Shares in Centel, the Chicago-based local phone company which has agreed to merge with Sprint at a price well under market valuations, edged Dollars 1/8 higher to Dollars 32 after plunging Dollars 10 1/2 a day earlier. Sprint, which dropped Dollars 1 3/8 on Thursday, lost Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 23. Among other cellular phone stocks which were battered on the Centel merger news, GTE regained Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 31 3/8 , McCaw Cellular eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 27 1/4 , and Lin Broadcasting slipped Dollars 1 to Dollars 67. Shares in Rockefeller Center, the real estate investment trust, tumbled Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 14 3/8 after Lehman Brothers downgraded its rating on the stock amid concerns that Rockefeller might cut its dividend. Canada TORONTO posted a small advance in moderate trading. Based on preliminary figures, the composite index was up 12.59 points, or 0.37 per cent, to 3,387.93, for a gain on the week of about 16 points. Advances led declines by 317 to 264, volume fell to 20.404m shares from 25.594m shares on Thursday, and trading value was CDollars 223.8m against CDollars 324.7m. Royal Bank of Canada, up  3/4 to 23 1/4 , reported slightly lower second-quarter earnings. It said it has classified CDollars 510m of its CDollars 780m of loans to Olympia &amp; York as non-performing.</p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> CLUB MARKS 50 YEARS BUT FUTURE IS DIM  </P> <P> Fifty years of dinner meetings and impromptu speeches were celebrated Saturday  on the golden anniversary of Ventura's International Training in Communication  club, formerly known as the International Toastmistress Club.  </P> <P> Despite the happy memories generated as past members gathered, the event was  sad, too, because of a drastic drop in membership, said Pauline Romero, a  26-year member.  </P> <P> In the past, the group had close to 100 members; it now is down to 12.  </P> <P> The club changed its name in 1985 to make it clear that it is, and always has  been, open to men and women, although the Ventura club's membership has been  primarily women.  </P> <P> Romero said competition from International Toastmasters, which now accepts  woman members, has made inroads into her group's membership.  </P> <P> "But we've held on . . . for 50 years," she said.  </P> <P> Among the anecdotes Romero related was an incident years ago when the charter  president of the organization, the late Guidotta Lowe, forgot a news clipping  at her home in Oxnard. She left the meeting as the entree was being served,  rushed home, and returned to the Ventura restaurant in time for dessert.  </P> <P> "From then on we called her the 'go-gotta girl' because she got back in time to  give the topic for the evening," Romero said.

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Argyll Argyll seems to be moving up a gear. Given the nagging concern that the big three grocery chains are close to saturating the UK market, shareholders might be forgiven for wondering whether they are in for a white-knuckle ride. Capital expenditure will rise by 50 per cent this year, according to yesterday's interim statement, and climb again next year. More significantly, a sharp rise in the cost per square foot of new stores suggests Safeway is starting to confront Sainsbury and Tesco head on. Since Argyll has in the past trumpeted its advantage as developer of cheap retail space, it can hardly expect the market not to flinch when this starts to erode. The average cost of new space for Safeway is being inflated by the development of a few expensive stores in prime locations. Argyll legitimately argues it is protecting positions of market leadership. The risk, though, is that the company will be drawn into an expensive - and ultimately fruitless - attempt to keep Sainsbury and Tesco off what it regards as home turf. But that point is some way off. The latest flagships are producing a healthy return on capital. Argyll still prefers, where possible, to concentrate on cheaper space rather than slug it out for premium sites. Yet sales growth at Safeway is keeping up with the best of the competition. By increasing its investment in the discount end of the market through Presto and Lo-Cost, Argyll is also spreading its risk. With efficiency improvements still to come, the shares could yet close the substantial rating discount to Sainsbury.</p>

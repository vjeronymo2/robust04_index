			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANA FIRM BUYS RADIO OUTLET, PLANS SPANISH FORMAT  </P> <P> A Santa Ana broadcasting company has bought KRTH-AM for $23 million in an  all-cash deal and plans to change the Los Angeles radio station's format from  oldies rock to Spanish-language music.  </P> <P> Liberman Broadcasting Inc. will separate KRTH-AM from its twin, KRTH-FM, both  of which are owned by Beasley Broadcast Group of Naples, Fla. Liberman owns and  operates KWIZ-AM and FM, which are based in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Beasley announced the sale Wednesday, when application was made to the Federal  Communications Commission for a change in ownership. The deal should be  completed by year-end. Beasley will continue to operate KRTH-FM.  </P> <P> "We plan on going Spanish with the station," said Lenard Liberman, vice  president of Liberman Broadcast Group. "This will bring to seven the number of  Spanish-language stations in the area. It will be the most powerful in terms of  signal strength."  </P></p>

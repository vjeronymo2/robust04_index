			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unscheduled news bulletin--read by unidentified announcer] </F>   [Text] Ladies and Gentlemen, good morning. We interrupt  our regular programing to report some urgent news on Bosnia.  This morning between 0630 and 0700 [0430-0500 GMT], four  Yugoslav Galeb aircraft were shot down by two U.S. F-16's. This  was announced a short time ago by YEETHA [National Defense  General Staff] Chief Admiral Khristos Limberis. The report was  confirmed just a few minutes ago in a REUTER dispatch from NATO  headquarters in Brussels. The news item from NATO is very brief.  It reads: NATO has announced that four planes were shot down  by U.S. aircraft. According to Admiral Limberis, the Galeb  planes are two-seater training craft similar to the T-33. They  can, however, be easily transformed into fighters. These planes  were flying over Bosnia-Herzegovina in the zone that is  restricted according to the UN resolution, 50 miles southeast of  Banja Luka. News agency dispaches mention nothing more and  offer no other information from Yugoslavia.    We now have correspondent Stefanos Kasimatis on the  telephone  line from the Ministry of National Defense:    [Kasimatis] National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis has  just completed a statement on the situation. His first comment  concerned the downing of four Galeb-type planes that belong to  the Serb Air Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This unfortunate  incident confirms the correctness of the Greek position against  any direct or indirect engagement by any Balkan country in the  Bosnian crisis.    The minister also noted that what impressed him was that the  four planes shot down were mainly training aircraft. But  Admiral Limberis, who interrupted his meeting with British  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, noted that these planes are  easily transformed into fighter craft. Arsenis said they were  informed of the incident by NATO headquarters in Naples and the  British Embassy during the meeting with Hurd. There has been no  other Greek reaction and the Greek side is waiting for  developments.    Answering a correspondent's question, Arsenis clarified that  the Greek military personnel in Bosnia, who number about 100,  are there within the framework of a European Union initiative,  not a NATO one, so there is no possibility of Greece becoming  involved. He reiterated the firm Greek position against  engaging in the crisis in Bosnia. This is the news from the  Ministry of National Defense.</p>

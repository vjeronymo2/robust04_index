			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Bank to allow paternity leave The Co-operative Bank has decided to allow paternity leave for its 1,500 male staff. This will amount to a maximum of three months' unpaid absence from the bank in line with the new European Union draft directive, which was vetoed last week by Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary. Mr Terry Thomas, the bank's managing director, said: 'In the future when we come to determining appropriate conditions of employment for staff we will be looking more to European co-operative banks than to our rivals in this country.' He added that the cost of paternity leave to the bank would be marginal. The bank will meet the pension contributions of staff on paternity leave and use contract workers to fill the vacancies.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Erich Hauser: "Marrakesh and the Aftermath"] </F>   [Text] The paths of future world trade are going to be  mapped in the former Moroccan trade center Marrakesh in the next  few days. The climax of the several-day meeting of ministers  from over 120 countries should be the official signing of all  the GATT agreements that were hailed in December by the apostles  of international free trade as the "successful conclusion" of  the seven-year so-called Uruguay Round of talks.    Whether every single minister will know exactly what he is  signing is a matter of doubt. There are no less than 28 new  agreements, which, with all the annexes and appendices, add up  to 20,000 pages of print. International economic dealing has  long become the domain of world enterprises, pressure groups,  and specialists sitting in bureaucratic ministries or inside  bodies like the European Union [EU] Commission. All the  politicians can do is lay down the general line of march. The  complexity of the mutual interdependencies makes democratic  control almost impossible.    When the new agreements are ratified by the majority of the  120 countries next year, over the 10 following years there will  be a gradual mutual "opening up of markets" not just to trade,  but also to public works and services, which will alter the  lives of millions of people on all continents. For the first  time, agriculture and, as part of technological progress, the  broadcast media, telecommunications, transportation, and much  else besides will be affected. The losers will be the poorest  developing countries that cannot feed themselves.    Skeptics fear that the new agreements contain too many  loopholes for countries that, under pressure form high  unemployment, might want to pull out of the strong international  competition. The GATT that was created in 1948 is to be  converted into a "World Trade Organization" (WTO) with tougher  rules.    To prevent the Marrakesh meeting from being overshadowed by  intense disputes, it has been agreed to continue the work over  the next 24 months. When the Uruguay talks began eight years  ago at the inspiration of U.S. President Reagan, the world was  still quite different from today. In the old Western  industrialized countries, including Japan, technological  progress has eliminated more and more jobs since then. The high  chronic unemployment is making West European social security  systems virtually impossible to finance. The technological  competitiveness of many low-wage countries has increased  markedly, and with the "opening of markets" it will exert an  even stronger wage pressure in the old industrialized countries.  The EU countries now have a moral duty to gradually integrate  the "new market economies" of East Europe. What is more, China,  as the world's most populous country, has made such progress in  the development of its increasingly capitalist economy that in  10 to 15 years it will have overtaken not only Germany, but also  Japan and the United States as a world trade partner.    No wonder the trade unions of North America and West Europe  are now demanding that a "social clause" be added to the new  world trade regulations. Countries in which trade unions are  suppressed and minimum ILO regulations, such as a ban on the  employment of children, are violated should be excluded from the  mutual opening up of markets.    The developing countries have already vehemently opposed  such  a "social clause" in Marrakesh. Their rich elites are using  their people's "poverty," from which they profit the most, as an  argument against "discrimination." Environmental protection was  also completely "overlooked" in the Uruguay talks. High  environmental standards are considered a cost factor that apply  mostly to those countries that enjoy a high standard of living.  If the industries of these countries consider themselves too  much at a disadvantage in free world trade, they pull out. The  only explanation for the great "joy" in Germany over the success  of the Uruguay talks is the fact that economic interests and  their prophets dominate this country.    The Marrakesh accords are a late victory for the already  anachronistic "Reaganomics" ideology. It is ironic that many  hopes are now being vested in the U.S. Congress. It is the most  unusual of Western parliaments because its majority is not  obliged to support the U.S. Government. Washington is virtually  the only capital that could belatedly force through an  environmental clause and a social clause in the WTO. The  apostles of free trade might scream blue murder about "new  protectionism," but this might salvage Germany's important  achievements.</p>

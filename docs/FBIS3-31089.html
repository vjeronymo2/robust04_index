			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Michal Kovac by an unidentified </F> PRACA correspondent; place and date not given: "Attacks Escalate  Tension"]    [Text] As president of the Slovak Republic, I am trying to  execute my job so as to gain the support of the widest possible  spectrum of citizens, President Michal Kovac said in an  interview for [Bratislava] PRACA [in Slovak] No. 33. I was one  of the cofounders of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  [HZDS] and have spent an intensive part of my life with it. In  the elections, I assumed my share of responsibility for the  movement's policy. I have received with pleasure reports about  the growing sympathy for myself within the HZDS. This growth,  which represents up to 15 percent, has occurred despite the  escalating attempts, particularly within HZDS ranks, to  discredit the president. It has become apparent, however, that  HZDS members and sympathizers think otherwise than individuals  in the Republican Board or in the HZDS Club of Deputies.    [PRACA] There is constant talk about certain tension between  the Castle and the government. Views are being foisted upon the  public to the effect that you are building some kind of a second  center of executive power in the state.    [Kovac] The assertion that I am building some kind of a  second center of state power is untrue and absurd. According to  the Constitution of the Slovak Republic, executive power in the  state is executed by the president and the Government of the  Slovak Republic. The president has had to build his chancellery  with its own experts to be able to exercise his constitutional  powers. Hence, there do not exist any two centers of state  power. The existence of political centers of power is another  matter. One cannot speak about a single political center in a  pluralistic political system; several such centers exist.  However, on the basis of election results, one, two, or more  political entities that come to an agreement on a government  program form the government. Even the president of the Republic  helps to implement this government program from the position of  the head of state. I painstakingly see to it that I engage in  this activity within the framework of my constitutional powers.  The discussion about a second center of power reminds me of the  fatal policy practiced by dogmatists of the former totalitarian  regime. After all, the prerequisite of a functioning democracy  is the division of power, which is clearly defined in Slovakia  by the Constitution of the democratic state.    [PRACA] How do you explain the existence of views that, even  though it was the HZDS that won the elections, people from the  Public Against Violence movement, the Civic Democratic Union,  and Czechoslovakists have conquered the Castle, have surrounded  you in the Office of the President, and act as your advisers?    [Kovac] This is an untrue assertion. I will cite only a few  basic facts. Of the nine key posts in the Office of the  President of the Slovak Republic, four are held by people who  come from the HZDS or are HZDS sympathizers, one is from the  Slovak National Party [SNS], three have declared themselves  independent, and I regard them as such, and one is from the  Christian Social Union. Another group of staffers consists of  former HZDS deputies to the Federal Assembly who are acting as  department heads or desk officers. They are complemented with  staffers professing allegiance to the SNS, and two come from the  Christian Democratic Movement [KDH]. The majority are without  party affiliation, both originally and at present.    In the election campaign, the HZDS campaigned for the idea  of  filling posts with professionally qualified and morally  competent people. I tried to achieve this also in building the  Office of the President when I gave priority to the criterion of  professionalism. There is not a single staffer here who would  not identify with the existence of an independent Slovak state,  no one who would not swear loyalty to the sovereign republic. I  cannot accept the criticism that people are working in the  Office of the President who had opposed the partition of the  CSFR because this would run counter to basic human rights, my  philosophy, and the position of the president as a  representative of all citizens. I accept the criteria of  loyalty toward the state and its constitutional bodies, moral  irreproachability, and professionalism and expertise. How will  my present critics come to terms with this approach, should a  coalition be formed, either now or after the elections,  involving the HZDS, the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], the  Conservative Democratic Party, and the SNS, should the  government be joined by members of the KDH, the SDL, or other  parties? After all, the prime minister has received such an  offer and he did not reject it. Therefore, I consider the  criticism of the composition of the Office of the President to  be only a pretext for attacks against the president of the  Slovak Republic. I reply to all my critics: Do you think that  the president of the Slovak Republic does not feel sufficient  responsibility for the kind of people who are working for him,  [that he does not care] in whose favor and in favor of which  cause they are working? Is it necessary to remind the president  of such elementary matters?</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Laird plans Pounds 68m rights issue - Pounds 80m programme of investment and acquisitions lined up for 1995 Laird Group, the manufacturer of automotive components and building products, has launched a surprise Pounds 68m rights issue to fund a heavy programme of capital expenditure and acquisitions amounting to some Pounds 80m by the end of 1995. The move was unexpected, given that the group's gearing is estimated at around 24 per cent, and that Laird is not looking at any substantial purchases. However, Mr Ian Arnott, chief executive, said: 'We've always had conservative long-term financing policies. We are setting up a strong financial framework for the future.' The announcement was accompanied by a pre-tax profits forecast of at least Pounds 46m for 1994, at the upper end of City forecasts. Mr Arnott said there were positive signs of a pick-up in automotive sales in Europe, after a bleak 1993. Further benefits were being reaped from acquisitions outside the automotive industry, he added. Laird's 1-for-5 rights issue is priced at 295p, representing a 17 per cent discount to Monday's closing price of 356p. The shares fell 6p yesterday. The company had rights issues in 1989 and 1992, both primarily to fund capital expenditure. One analyst said: 'I would like to see the company demonstrating that it can fund internal expansion from its working capital.' However, Laird is partly reacting to strong demand, leading it to invest in extra capacity at Fullarton, its US subsidiary supplying the personal computer industry, and its car body seals operation in Spain. In the past two years, Laird has pushed ahead with diversification outside automotive products, making acquisitions in printing and packaging, window security and plastics. Mr Arnott said Laird would like to build up 50 per cent of its profits from non-automotive products, and this would absorb substantial capital expenditure. At the end of October, the group had net borrowings of Pounds 53.8m, and these would have started to increase sharply. Laird's forecast of a 20 per cent increase in pre-tax profits was accompanied by a forecast final dividend of 6.9p (6.5p), putting the shares  -at yesterday's close - on a p/e of close to 14 and a yield of 3.2 per cent for 1994. COMMENT Rights issues with no immediate justification are always hard to sell, but Laird Group's offering is at least in keeping with the conservative character of the group. The offer will dilute earnings per share in 1995, since Laird is investing in projects with a long-term pay back. Analysts pushed up profit forecasts to around Pounds 57m for 1995, giving a prospective p/e of 13.4. However, despite economic recovery in the US and UK, profit margins remain under pressure and the shares look fully valued.</p>

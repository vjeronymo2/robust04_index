			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Bundesbank warns Bonn on federal debt A SENIOR Bundesbank official warned at the weekend that the central bank's clamp on monetary policy would achieve little in the long run if the German government and wage negotiators failed to control federal debt and pay increases. Mr Otmar Issing, a member of the central bank's policy-making council, told a symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that rising government debt would sooner or later lead to higher taxation. This would push up prices and inflation. Speaking at the end of a week of turmoil in world money markets and widespread criticism of the Frankfurt policy-makers - notably from the US - Mr Issing presented a stout defence of the bank's policy and independence. 'A lastingly high rate of economic growth cannot be achieved through large budget deficits and a passive monetary policy which tries to keep central bank interest rates low,' he said. Democratic fiscal policies, driven by political processes, had a tendency to generate excessive government debt. There was a need for the central bank to provide a counterweight: to try 'to contribute to a low and sustainable level of government debt, as part of its stability mandate'. Although Mr Issing did not name either the Bundesbank or the German government in his speech, his aim was unmistakably to stiffen the resolve of the German Finance Ministry. He made only passing references to the dangers of wage inflation, hitherto the prime concern of the Bundesbank. The ministry, run by Mr Theo Waigel, has promised strict budgetary controls and reduced subsidies. The target is an average 2.5 per cent nominal growth in federal spending until the end of 1995. He, in turn, has also asked the largely independent state governments to limit their expenditure growth to 3 per cent. Firm projects put forward so far by Bonn, including a scheme to save DM11bn (Pounds 3.9bn) on the health service this year and a DM5bn cut in the federal labour office's subsidy, have run into powerful opposition from the medical profession and drugs makers as well as civil servants in the labour office. Meanwhile, a handful of state governments have said they need to reduce administrative payrolls, while others are examining the possibility of raising further revenue through increased taxes on drinks, entertainment, tourism and even prostitution. A bank policy which was aimed at promoting capital formation and growth must be highly credible, reliable and predictable, Mr Issing said. 'Attempted deception and stop-go policies aimed at short-term demand effects are the best way of undermining investors' and savers' confidence in monetary policy, and hence also in economic policy as a whole,' he said. 'The capital which the central bank possesses in the form of a high credibility is thus. . . uselessly put at risk.' If the Bundesbank eased its controls it would amount to an announcement that, in future, monetary policy would be geared primarily to financing the government budget and, ultimately, inflationary. That would be 'a signal for a massive run on public budgets, which politicians. . . would find difficult not to become caught up in'. A strictly anti-inflationary policy was the best way to maintain stability and restrain 'distribution struggles and excessive budget policies. In the absence of a consensus among all those responsible, however, the central bank, too, will ultimately be able to achieve little,' he concluded. Economic indicators, Page 4</p>

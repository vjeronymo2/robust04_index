			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Fleming Emerging to raise Pounds 50m FLEMING Emerging Markets, the specialist investment trust, is attempting to raise Pounds 50m to take advantage of what it sees as increasing investment opportunities in developing economies. The trust has conditionally placed 37.5m shares and is offering a further 12.5m shares to existing share and warrantholders by way of an offer for subscription. The shares are C shares, which will bear the costs of the issue and so ensure that no dilution is suffered by existing holders. When the bulk of the proceeds are invested, the C shares will be converted into ordinary shares at asset value. The offer will close on March 31 and it is expected that dealings in the new shares will start on April 6. Emerging markets are seen as attractive investments because they have higher rates of economic growth and underdeveloped stock markets, and because many governments are liberalising their investment regulations. Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust is also considering raising new funds.</p>

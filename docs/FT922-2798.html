			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Doubts over Nissan plant benefits HOPES that the Nissan plant in north-east England will regenerate the local economy are unlikely to be realised, according to a study published today. Skills required to manufacture Nissan cars are company-specific and components come from Japanese suppliers, according to The Nissan Enigma, a book by two academics. Mr Philip Garrahan and Mr Paul Stewart, lecturers at Teesside Polytechnic and Cardiff Business School, say the increasing domination of UK motor manufacturing by Japanese companies will harm the domestic motor and components industries. They also question Nissan production and methods of staff management, which they say rest upon 'control through quality, exploitation via flexibility and surveillance by team working'. Nissan's success, they say, rests on a passive workforce resulting from strict social control within the plant and high unemployment in Tyne and Wear, coupled with government support and union restraint. Nissan said yesterday that there would always be people who were critical of success. The company had invested Pounds 900m in the plant and was proud of its contribution to the growth of the 'new north-east'. The Nissan Enigma.

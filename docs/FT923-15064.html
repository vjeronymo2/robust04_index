			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Arts: Do I Hear a Waltz? - Musical The film Summertime is a regular in the repeat slot on television and it came around again not so long ago. There, amid the ravishing backdrops of sun-soaked Venice, are Katharine Hepburn and Rossano Brazzi, embarking on a summer romance that we know will end with smiles shining through the tears. It is less well known that the same book also spawned a musical. Richard Rodgers's Do I hear a waltz? opened on Broadway in 1965 and ran for 220 performances, a short run by his standards. It was felt that the show failed because of the jaundiced view it takes of Americans on holiday, who are shown setting out with a couple of Italian phrases on their lips and little but a quick vacation romance on their minds. This is the satirical cutting edge, aided by Stephen Sondheim's lyrics, which is brought to bear on what might otherwise have been a stickily sentimental plot. Still, there are some good tunes, too good to have been forgotten certainly; and Martin Connor's production for the Guildhall School of Music students caught nicely the intimacy of a show, which has no really big numbers but spends its time sending romantic duos echoing along the canals of Venice. Among the travellers is Leona Samish, a thirtysomething single woman, not a loser, but not much money and no man, always alone in a crowd. Rodgers's music has given her romantic dreams, while Sondheim typically chips away at the pain within. Alice Macdonald did better by Rodgers, although by the end she had also won sympathy for a woman tricky to play in her very ordinariness. Most of the big singing goes to the lead man (Sergio Franchi impressive on the original cast recording). Renato Di Rossi works in a tourist gift shop, though what he is best at selling is his affections. He loves Puccini,which Zubin Varla found a tall order; but he too made a success of a difficult role by catching the sincerity, the middle-age experience, the Latin charm of the man. The caricatures of the other tourists, all 'generous, never-fuss' Americans, are a gift. Elizabeth Chadwick and David Curtiz were the bright young couple, working hard at some ambitious choreography by David Toguri. Melanie Ramsay and Charles Edwards were spot-on as the older pair, him in business, her the gawky wife. Polly Moore made her mark as the owner of the pensione who scavenges on stray husbands among her guests. In retrospect, what makes this musical worth seeing again is the unique match of its composer and lyricist. Just when Rodgers is indulging in ballads which melt too easily in the mouth, Sondheim is there, ready to turn hope into disillusion, relationships back into loneliness. Performances continue until July 9 (Box Office 071-638 8891)</p>

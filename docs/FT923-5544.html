			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Books: Murder in theory - Fiction DEATH OF THE AUTHOR by Gilbert Adair Heinemann Pounds 13.99 FRAUD by Anita Brookner Cape Pounds 14.99 KNOWN variously as post-structuralism, deconstruction, or simply theory, the phenomenon which invaded academic literary criticism during the 1980s was more than a harmless excuse for students to disguise their ignorance behind an enthusiastic tissue of jargon and bad puns. When its high priest, Paul de Man, was posthumously unmasked as the wartime author of pro-Nazi articles, the latent amoralism at the heart of the theory began to look more sinister. Inspired (though not explicitly) by the case of de Man, Gilbert Adair's The Death of the Author brilliantly combines a serious critique of a dodgy intellectual movement with a suspense-driven detective story. LeopaId Sfax, European emigre and Ivy League professor, is, in terms of Theory, the gurus' guru. His books (including the plausibly named Either/Either - Adair's post-structuralist pastiche achieves near perfection) have become cult objects. But their authors' background and personality remain elusive. When one of his ex-students proposes to delve into his past and write his biography, Sfax begins to get hot under the collar. Then, inexplicably, one of his colleagues, a jolly, unreconstructed liberal humanist sort of chap who stands for everything Sfax despises - is murdered . . . The death of the author is one of Sfax's critical shibboleths. For him, the author's intentions are irrelevant to the meaning of a text. Indeed, texts are mere matrices of 'polysemous ambiguity', with no stable meaning at all and a big black hole at the centre. This is convenient for Sfax, since, in practice, it follows that you can make anything mean whatever you want it to mean; there are no absolute moral values and Nazi propaganda can be made to look innocuous. Adair's satire is clever, compact, and so lucid that no reader need be put off by its theoretical themes. Economically written and intellectually incisive, it exposes the sophistry and inhumanity at the heart of deconstruction through a network of exquisite ironies. Written in elegant shades of grey, Anita Brookner's Fraud is a quietly melancholy book which leaves you with the taste of depression in your mouth. Its heroine, Anna Durrant, is a 50-ish spinster who has spent her entire life ministering to her widowed, and latterly invalid, mother. Incarcerated in their faded pink-and-powder-blue Kensington flat, Anna finds her only solace or means of self-expression in making her own clothes - jewel-coloured silk tweed suits of perfect cut. Lawrence, her mother's doctor, once attracted her attention, but he has since been snapped up by the odious Vicky, who struts about in a bright red mini-dress, oozing vulgarity and sex in equal measure. Since her mother's death, Anna has left the pastel-coloured prison for a flat of her own. Her claustrophobic existence has meant that she's made almost no friends, and when, one day, she disappears, her absence is not immediately noticed. It is not until the end that we discover where she has gone and how she plans to rebuild her life. But although the book finishes on a hopeful note, this optimism appears fragile and unconvincing, since the bulk of Anna's story, with its themes of heart-rending loneliness, frustration, and emotional exploitation, is so unutterably bleak. The title is provocatively Ambiguous. Is it Anna who's been defrauding herself of happiness? Does the guilt lie with her mother, whose so-called love might in fact be cruelty in disguise? Or is Lawrence the truly fraudulent one, deceiving himself into taking the easy option and ultimately punished for doing so? As ever, Anita Brookner writes with a flawless sense of style. Her prose is limpid, controlled, and unfailingly in good taste. But there is such ugly dreariness in the human relationships she describes that, despite appearances, Fraud provokes feelings of real discomfort.</p>

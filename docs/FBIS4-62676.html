			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Chisinau, 17 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Fearing a social  explosion, the Moldovan Cabinet today suspended for ten days a  local authority decision to increase the cost of municipal  services. It was decided last week to increase these almost  threefold.    One of the main reasons was Moldova's chronic indebtedness  for fuels imported from Russia and other CIS countries. The  republican federation of independent trade unions sharply  criticized the price rises, with the federation's leaders  threatening to organize mass demonstrations. Trade union  leaders say that the majority of the population today cannot pay  for housing and services even at the old prices, and can hardly  make ends meet because of growing unemployment and low wages.    Within the next 10 days a government commission hopes to  find  a way out of the situation, though this very day the government  informed citizens that Moldova owes the Russian Federation  Gasprom joint-stock company about 200 billion rubles for gas  alone.</p>

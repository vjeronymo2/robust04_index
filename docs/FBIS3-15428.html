Without Russia"]    [Text] Eduard Shevardnadze has been faced with the  temptation to agree to a new option prepared deep inside the  U.S. Department of State for establishing peace in Abkhazia. In  Washington it will be suggested to the Georgian president that  he agree to UN "blue helmets" being sent in without the  participation of Russian troops.    On Monday Bill Clinton is expected to reveal to the guest  from Tbilisi a U.S.-style plan for settling the Abkhaz conflict.  The essence of this plan is to restrict Russia's opportunities  for influencing the situation in the region. Its 2,000-strong  contingent is to pull back beyond the Psou River, which forms  the Russian-Georgian border. UN forces will take up positions  along the Ingury River, forming a security zone between  Georgians and Abkhazians. The United States is also promising  to increase financial aid to Tbilisi considerably.    If this is so, the situation around Abkhazia is changing  radically. Until now the sides involved in the conflict have  relied little on the United Nations and put their trust mainly  in Russia's good will. With one voice they entreated Boris  Yeltsin to hurry up and send in troops -- which would have  created conditions not only for a cease-fire but also for the  return of 300,000 refugees.    Moscow, which recently signed a treaty with Tbilisi,  proceeded from the premise that it remains the most real force  capable of instilling order in this part of the Caucasus.  Yeltsin made military aid for Georgia dependent on progress  toward a political settlement.    At the same time it has become obvious that Russia is biding  its time, seeking greater tractability from Tbilisi and Sukhumi  and waiting for the Security Council to invite it to play the  leading part in the UN orchestra. The United Nations is in no  hurry either, realizing that Russia itself will not dare to  assume the role of sole peacemaker.    A cooling in Russian-U.S. relations has been sensed in  recent  days. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that in  this situation Washington can be expected to take surprise  actions aimed at putting Russia in its place.</p>

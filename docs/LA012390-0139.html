			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: REBOUNDING WHIZ HARRY GOES OVERBOARD THIS TIME  </P> <P> Because she is 6-feet-2 and starts at center for Woodbridge High School, Deanna  Harry is bound to get rebounds.  </P> <P> But last week, Harry found herself putting the basketball through the hoop and  not just grabbing the ones that bounced off it.  </P> <P> Harry, The Times' Athlete of the Week, had 29 points, 23 in the first half, and  16 rebounds to lead Woodbridge in a 69-38 victory over Trabuco Hills Tuesday.  </P> <P> "I knew I had scored over 15 by halftime, but I didn't think it was that much,"  Harry said. "My role on the team is rebounding. But (Trabuco Hills) was playing  a defense designed to stop our guards, so I got a lot of baskets."  </P> <P> Harry had 21 rebounds in a 65-31 victory over Laguna Hills Thursday and had 20  more in a 76-52 nonleague victory over Estancia Saturday.  </P> <P> What's with the big week?  </P> <P> "Away games," Harry said. "I don't know what it is exactly. On the bus ride  over there I have time to think about the game and visualize. When we play at  home we talk more before the game."  </P> <P> Now people are starting to talk more after the game too.  </P> <P> "She came out for basketball on a whim as a 5-9 freshman and grew so fast in  the next year and a half -- you couldn't believe it," Woodbridge Coach Eric  Bangs said. "She's still a little gangly . . . but she works hard on footwork  and positioning."  </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> La Habra's Leslie Ferguson scored 48 points in two games.  </P> <P> The guard tandem of Michelle Harris and Valerie Ruiz led Kennedy to two  victories. Harris had 42 points and seven steals in the two games and Ruiz had  a total of 51 points.  </P> <P> Amy Jalewalia had 33 points and seven rebounds to lead La Quinta to a 64-30  victory over Los Amigos Wednesday, and had 32 points, nine rebounds and six  assists in an 82-39 victory over Garden Grove Friday.  </P> <P> Freshman Amber Parkinson had eight goals in three soccer matches for Orange  Lutheran, including three goals in one game twice.  </P> <P> Laurie Sallinger set an Orange High School record for assists in a game when  she had 11 assists and eight points against Laguna Beach Tuesday. Sallinger  also had seven assists and 10 points in a 62-53 victory over Costa Mesa on  Thursday.  </P> <P> In a 56-43 victory over Esperanza, Wanda Sequeira had 13 points and seven  assists to set Tustin's single-season assist record at 145, breaking the mark  set in 1979 by Mary Hegarty.  </P> <P> Deanna Harry  </P> <P> Woodbridge High  </P> <P> * Position: Center  </P> <P> * Height, Weight, Class: 6-2, 147, Junior  </P> <P> * Last Week: Harry had 52 points and 57 rebounds in three games.  </P> <P> * Season: Harry is averaging 10.2 points, 13.4 rebounds and 3.5 blocked shots.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, Yemen, May 29 (AFP)--One person was killed and  four were wounded Saturday [28 May] in a missile attack on the  southern Yemeni capital Aden, even though the missile was shot  down, a southern Yemeni military statement said.  Southern anti-aircraft batteries shot the missile apart, but  debris fell on the Shaykh 'Uthman district in the north of the  city, killing one person, the statement said.    Witnesses said they heard anti-aircraft fire and a muffled  explosion and a flash in the sky around 10:30 p.m. (1930 GMT).  Northern Yemeni forces have periodically fire Soviet-made Luna  missiles at Aden during the night, but most of them have been  downed by southern anti-aircraft batteries.    Three more dull thuds were heard around 2:00 a.m. in Aden on  Sunday, although it was not clear what had caused them.    Southern Yemen on Saturday appealed to Jordan to intervene  to  stop the civil war that broke out between the former North and  South Yemen on May 5, according to official sources here. Anis  Hasan Yahya, chairman of the Provisional Assembly of National  Salvation, the week-old caretaker parliament of the  newly-proclaimed Democratic Republic of Yemen, sent the message  to Jordanian parliamentary speaker Tahir al-Masri, the source  said. Yahya had asked for the "rapid intervention" of Jordan  with the aim of "stopping the war, returning the warring armies  to their original positions and starting immediate negotiations  without preconditions under the aegis of the Arab League," he  said.    Jordan brokered a Yemeni peace accord in Amman last February  20, but the move to ease relations between the two Yemens, which  had never fully integrated despite their unification in 1990,  remained a dead letter. Amman last Sunday reaffirmed its  commitment to a united Yemen recognised in international law.    Meanwhile Yemeni Foreign Minister Mohammad Basindwah, a  northerner, arrived Saturday in Cairo for the Non-Aligned  Movement's meeting of foreign ministers, opening on Tuesday.  Basindwah told reporters he had brought a message for Egyptian  President Husni Mubarak from Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih about the situation in Yemen. He also met his Egyptian  counterpart 'Amr Musa, who told reporters Egypt and the Gulf  states had asked the United Nations Security Council to look  into the Yemeni civil war. Musa stressed that a ceasefire had  to be secured to stop the situation deteriorating.    UN sources in New York said Oman had on Friday submitted to  the Security Council a draft resolution calling for an immediate  ceasefire in Yemen and the renewal of negotiations between the  warring sides.</p>

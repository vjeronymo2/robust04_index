			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Arab peace-talk partners to co-ordinate strategy LEBANON and its Arab partners in peace talks with Israel will meet in Beirut on a date to be fixed to co-ordinate strategy, the Lebanese ambassador to Egypt said, Reuter reports from Cairo. Mr Abdel-Rahman al-Solh said Syria, Jordan and the Palestinians had agreed in principle to attend such a meeting following a Lebanese invitation. Jordan said yesterday it would attend an Arab meeting in Beirut later this month to discuss progress in the peace talks. Arab diplomats said the proposed meeting would focus on the outcome of the four rounds of Middle East peace talks held so far and whether to hold a fifth round ahead of Israel's June general elections. The last round of talks ended in Washington this month with Israel and the Arabs blaming each other for lack of progress. Jordan's state news agency said the Beirut meeting would chart strategy for the peace talks. It did not say which countries would attend. Diplomats in Amman said the Arab peace talk partners would attend, plus Egypt. Some Arab participants say holding another round would achieve little. Others say the process might lose momentum if the talks are put off for four months.</p>

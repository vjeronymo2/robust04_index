			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / US Mid-Term Elections: Where politics is a commercial break By most counts, Ms Kathleen Brown, the Democratic candidate for governor of California, 'won' her televised debate with Mr Pete Wilson, the Republican incumbent, last Friday night. For once, she seemed confident, he came over as ungracious and she probably scored among women voters by effectively rebutting his charges that she did not care about the victims of violent crime with the disclosure that her daughter had been raped and her son mugged. If candidate debates were all there were to winning elections, Ms Brown might have reason to believe she was at last on her way to reducing the 13-point lead Mr Wilson has accumulated among likely voters in the latest Los Angeles Times poll. Even the fact that he agreed to only one debate and ensured it was broadcast only in Friday evening 'drive-time' were acceptable conditions given Ms Brown's need to energise her supporters. But across the country, and especially in big mass media states such as California, political campaigns prefer to leave as little as possible on the air waves to chance. Instead they buy the time and plug their own messages, secure in the calculation that six out of 10 Americans, and no fewer than nine out of 10 Californians, to whom television is a particular addiction, will be paying some attention. Virtually all of them have only one intent - to tear down the opposition. For a week California has enjoyed an unrelenting diet, from breakfast to the small hours, through soap operas and Monday night football, of lies, damn lies and highly suspect statistics. Unedifying it may be, and costly it certainly is, but it can pay quick, if not necessarily ultimate, dividends. Republican Congressman Michael Huffington has already forked out a record Dollars 12m-plus to undermine California Senator Dianne Feinstein and will probably double that by election day on November 8. That brought him from obscurity to near parity, though his surge now seems to have been stemmed and Ms Feinstein holds a seven-point lead. But this has been less the result of her vicious counter-attacks than national and local media attention on his record and the New Age associations of his wife, the former Arianna Stassinopoulos, considered odd even by Californian standards. The basic Huffington message is, according to an especially ubiquitous commercial, 'Feinstein - a career politician who will say or do anything to stay in office.' She is also 'slimy' (a quote from a local newspaper) and given to brokering 'sweetheart deals' in Congress that favour her unnamed 'supporters'. Even when the Republican's commercials are notionally positive - one concludes dreamily 'Michael Huffington, US Senate. Finally a reason to believe' - the voice-overs disclose nothing that he actually believes in, except no new taxes. Ms Feinstein, who has a serious record to run on in the Senate and as mayor of San Francisco, does not confine herself to the high road. One of her commercials, quoting an old story in the Wall Street Journal, charges that Mr Huffington's company 'repeatedly sold illegal shock batons to foreign dictators' (Singapore, as it turns out, which may restrict any Asian travel plans she has in mind). It does not try to explain the relevance of this to the voters of modern California. Her latest refined commercial pitch is to depict Mr Huffington as 'the Texas millionaire California can't trust'. This slogan, together with graphics featuring lots of dollars, manages to embrace his wealth, the charge that he delayed establishing legal residence in California for tax purposes, and even a congressional record of alleged big spending. Mr Wilson and Ms Brown have been little better. On capital punishment he tars her indiscriminately with guilt by familial association by recalling that her father and brother, both previous governors, opposed the death penalty. Her commercials quite blatantly distort his budget battles of two years ago in the depths of the recession, replete with a black and white mugshot of the governor that might have been taken from an FBI 'most wanted' list. One reason for Mr Wilson's lead is his support for, and her opposition to, Proposition 187, the 'save our state' referendum on the November 8 ballot that would deny a wide range of state-provided social services to illegal immigrants. It is a serious issue, involving federal and state responsibilities, worthy of serious consideration and both actually agree that even if it passes, as the polls say it will easily, it will end up eventually in the US Supreme Court. Writing in the San Diego Union-Tribune this week, Mr Robert Laurence suspects that all these smear campaigns are basically intended to turn the larger public off politics, with only the fervent minorities bothering to vote. 'And that,' he concludes sadly, 'tells you what the candidates themselves really think of the American democratic process.'</p>

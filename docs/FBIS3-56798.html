Les  Tanyuk, member of the presidium of the Supreme Council of  Ukraine and of the central leadership of the Ukrainian People's  Movement for Perestroyka [Rukh], said this to a RUKH-PRESS  correspondent. The act committed by Leonid Kravchuk on 14  January in Moscow did not give any advantages whatsoever to  Ukraine, either in the political or the economic spheres, Les  Tanyuk is convinced. By signing the Russian-U.S. categorical  demands, Kravchuk proved that he can only be a sprinter but not  a long-distance runner in world politics. Les Tanyuk also  believes that the absence of the mechanisms of eliminating  nuclear weapons in the signed trilateral statement deprives  Ukraine of any guarantees of its own security.    The Rukh leader stressed that the United States has again  made a drastic mistake, as far as Russia is concerned. Even the  outcome of the latest election did not cause the United States  to refrain from supporting the imperial policy conducted by  Moscow which, following the czarist and communist regimes, is  now being revived under the banner of Zhyrynovshchyna [code of  ideas and norms of behavior associated with Zhirinovskiy]. All  this reminds Les Tanyuk of the events connected with the  official recognition of the USSR by Washington in 1933,  precisely when the famine in Ukraine, engineered by Moscow, was  at its peak. By such dangerous actions the West is forging  nails for its own crucifixion by Russian national chauvinism,  Les Tanyuk emphasized.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Power groups are rebuked: Opposition from Littlechild ELECTRICITY companies that have urged the government to delay liberalisation of the energy market were yesterday rebuked by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, as he expressed strong opposition to their view. A delay in the liberalisation was backed last week by a parliamentary select committee because it would give electricity companies more certainty about the size of future markets and thus enable them to put in long-term contracts for more coal. Hospitals, schools, supermarkets and other medium-to-large users would all suffer because they would fail to benefit from the price reductions they could expect from increased competition among electricity companies, said Prof Littlechild. Plans outlined by the government before the industry was privatised mean that from next year customers using more than 100kw of electricity during a half-hour period will be able to choose which company supplies their power. The current threshold of 1MW applies to just 5,000 large users. Liberalisation would take the figure to between 40,000 and 50,000. Prof Littlechild's opposition is bound to influence the government, although a delay would provide it with one of the simplest solutions to the coal market crisis. The regulator said yesterday a delay would be very regrettable and he was disappointed that some of the generators and regional electricity companies had associated themselves with that view. There were 20,000 electricity customers just below the 1MW limit and they needed the lowest possible costs for fuel to compete abroad and provide jobs in Britain, he said. Ten thousand of the new sites that would qualify for supplier choice would be schools and hospitals. 'There is always need for more resources there,' Prof Littlechild said. Liberalisation would also ensure that regional electricity companies purchased electricity efficiently, he added. The regulator also repeated calls for a reduction in - and more clarity about - the nuclear levy which is paid to Nuclear Electric to cover liabilities inherited from the Central Electricity Generating Board when the industry was privatised. 'It really has been pretty much a black box. Where does it go? What is it for? The customer needs to know.' His remarks were delivered at the annual meeting of the Major Energy Users' Council, at which electricity companies were attacked by delegates for high profits since privatisation. Delegates also expressed discontent over the price rises that some large users had experienced. Mr Tom Lowes, representing Blue Circle, said the electricity companies' returns on capital were more than twice those in the rest of industry. He also attacked what he called the arrogance of the industry in responding to complaints. Other delegates called for the operation of the pool - the wholesale market for electricity - to be simplified. Prof Littlechild said he was not convinced that the running of the electricity pool needed to be as complex as it was. He said the record of the industry had been mixed since privatisation. Some large users were having to pay more, but for most, prices had been reduced by 10 to 15 per cent. Eastern Electricity, the largest of the regional electricity companies, yesterday signed a five-year contract with National Power, the generator, to meet 21 per cent of its needs over five years from March 31. The contract, similar to one already concluded between the company and PowerGen, the other main generator, depends on National Power negotiating a contract with British Coal for 40m tonnes next year and 30m in the following four.</p>

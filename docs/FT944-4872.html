			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (6): Too weak to stand alone - The aerospace industry faces formidable odds Almost unique among Japan's industries, aerospace has never been an international contender. In a land of industrial leviathans, aerospace has been a pygmy - the entire industry is just 8 per cent of the size of the US aerospace industry and a third that of the UK. Now, as the world's aircraft market creaks under the strains of over-capacity, Japanese government and industry are making one more attempt to get into the race with their European and American rivals. In the summer, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry confirmed that it had approved plans for the development of a new small civilian airliner. The project, code-named YSX, will start in 1996 and is planned to be in service by 2000. Japan's aerospace industry has long been dependent on the nation's relatively small defence forces for its staple business. Last year, more than three-quarters of the aircraft manufacturers' Y850bn sales were defence-related. The small civilian sector consists principally of component manufacture for US Boeing aircraft. But the end of the cold war threatens to cut military demand and the industry is pinning its hopes on the new civilian airliner project. If it succeeds it could open the way for the development of an independent Japanese aerospace industry, but the odds are stacked against it. Japan is anxious to avoid repeating its previous experiences with civilian aircraft. In 1962, the Japan Aircraft Development Corporation. a consortium of the leading aircraft manufacturers, launched the YS-11, a 60-seat twin-engined turboprop. After selling just 182 aircraft, the project collapsed in 1972 in the face of a mountain of debts and recriminations. A similar fate befell a short-take-off-and-landing craft called Asuka. Both failed because customers were wary of risking buying expensive aircraft from Japanese manufacturers with no track record. The failures persuaded the government of the futility of building an independent Japanese aircraft industry, and from then on it concentrated on developing international links. That philosophy bore fruit as Japanese manufacturers developed a role as a component base for Boeing aircraft. Contracts to build 15 per cent of the Boeing 767, and 21 per cent of the new 777 that comes into service next year have helped build the nucleus of an industry, albeit one confirmed to medium-level technology such as the construction of wing-tips. That dependence on international alliances is also behind the YSX. Initially, the government had planned to develop a small 70-seat aircraft, including possible involvement with European companies. But the YSX project which succeeded it now seems certain to be built, again with US co-operation from Boeing. The collaboration will extend from manufacturing to marketing. While the Japanese government will be responsible for marketing the aircraft domestically, Boeing will sell it overseas. The YSX, which will go into development in 1996 will have 90-100 seats - making it slightly smaller than the Boeing 737 - and is expected to meet the growing demand for regional aircraft, particularly in Asia. Miti expects world demand of between 1,500 and 3,000 units in the first two decades of the 21st century. Unusually in a country where government subsidy for the aerospace industry has been minimal, at least half of the research and development budget of Y2bn will be met by the government. Although the industry sees the project as a harbinger of a real aerospace industry in Japan, critics are sceptical. 'It will remain the same as past Japanese aerospace projects,' says one analyst. 'It will be essentially a sub-contracting job.' The principal aim of the YSX is to wean Japan's manufacturers off their dependence on the defence business. Despite the country's growing acceptance of an international role, the prospects for the domestic defence industry are no better than anywhere else in the world. In fact most observers think they are probably worse. Japan has relied heavily on US technology for its airforce. Forbidden from building aircraft for seven years after the second world war, the Japanese manufacturers only started to put together an industry in 1952. Since then, it has lacked the technological know-how to catch up with US and European manufacturers. The vast majority of Japan's warplanes are US-built. Aerospace as a whole is one of the few industries in which Japan runs a substantial trade deficit - of nearly Y500bn a year. The bulk of the small domestic industry is committed to producing US equipment under licence for the Defence Agency. Only a handful of aircraft have been built independently, such as the C-1 transport, the T-2 trainer and the F-1 support fighter. But in 1988 the Defence Agency announced plans to develop a new project, the FSX, with support from the US, based on the F-16 fighter. The new aircraft is scheduled to begin flights next summer, but orders are not expected to be high, and limited production is planned. It is unlikely even to be the successor for the F-15 aircraft, the principal strike jet of the Japanese Air Force, since the Defence Agency itself is thought likely to stick with a more reliable US fighter. And since Japan is forbidden constitutionally from exporting military equipment, the prospects for the fighter do not look appealing. Japan will continue to look to space to develop the aerospace industry, but there, too, competitive pressures mean the country's industry faces an up-hill struggle. In February, the country's first home-produced rocket, the H-2, was launched. The rocket, capable of carrying a two-tonne satellite, was two years behind schedule and is even further behind its principal competitors, the European Arianespace, and General Dynamics of the US in cost and efficacy. At Y19bn a launch, it is more than 50 per cent more expensive than the other two companies, and demand has so far been uninspiring. Japan's aerospace industry needs to look further afield than the small domestic defence market that has been at its core for so long. The YSX is the centrepiece of this new strategy. But the nature of the project - a junior partnership in a US-led alliance, suggests that the Japanese aerospace industry is still not strong enough to stand alone. In the increasingly competitive market for aircraft, that will leave the country at a chronic disadvantage.</p>

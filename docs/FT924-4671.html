			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: Bang &amp; Olufsen plans DKr160m saving on costs BANG &amp; OLUFSEN, the manufacturer of high quality television and audio equipment, yesterday announced a plan to cut costs and reorganise the group in an attempt to ensure its survival. Another 400 jobs are to go, including 80 in sales subsidiaries abroad. This means that, by the end of the fiscal year on May 31, group employment will be reduced by more than 20 per cent to about 2,400 from 3,143 at the end of last year. The measures will reduce costs by about DKr160m (Dollars 25.9m) a year. This would allow the group to move out of the red even if sales fall back to DKr2bn from last year's DKr2.23bn, Mr Anders Knutsen, chief executive, said. 'Many have predicted our demise, but we are still here, and we shall continue to be here in the future as well,' he said. A main objective of the changes is to reorganise the European sales operation, reducing the total employed but increasing the number engaged in active selling. The group's product strategy, based on high-quality products with exclusive design characteristics, will remain unchanged. But the range will be increased by introducing some lower-priced products. The group expects a loss of DKr50m in the half-year to end-November and forecasts a loss for the full year. In the two latest years, the group lost DKr101m and DKr45m, reduced to DKr31m and DKr74m by minority shares.</p>

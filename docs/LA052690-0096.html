			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Trade Deficit Shrinks: The U.S. trade deficit shrank to $26.4 billion in the  first quarter, the smallest quarterly imbalance in more than six years, the  Commerce Department reported.  </P> <P> The department said the 8.2% improvement in the trade balance in the  January-March period was a result of record-high export sales that offset the  highest volume of oil imports in more than 12 years. For the first quarter,  U.S. exports rose 4.7% to an all-time high of $96.04 billion. Imports were also  at a record level, reflecting the surge in oil demand. They climbed 1.6%, to  $122.4 billion.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ALASKA;  </P> <P> JURY BEING CHOSEN FOR OIL SPILL TRIAL  </P> <P> An Alaska judge refused to dismiss charges against former Exxon Valdez captain  Joseph Hazelwood and ordered jury selection to begin in Anchorage for his trial  in the nation's worst oil spill.  </P> <P> His attorneys argued that he should not be tried in a state court because  federal law preempts state law in such cases. The Exxon Valdez ran aground on  March 24, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaskan waters;  the cost of cleaning it up has been estimated at $2 billion. Hazelwood faces a  felony charge of criminal mischief and various misdemeanor charges, including  being intoxicated.  </P></p>

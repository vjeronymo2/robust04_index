			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Merger story helps stabilise nervous equities - Market Report London's equity market was given a massive shot in the arm after confirmation of long-running stories that a bid move against SG Warburg, perceived to be the UK's flagship merchant bank, could be in the offing. News that Morgan Stanley, the world-ranked US investment bank, is seeking a merger with Warburg sent the UK company's shares soaring and deflected some of the market's worries about the mini-Budget forced on the chancellor by the defeat of the government's proposed VAT tax on domestic fuel. News that the chancellor had elected to shift the tax burden from domestic fuel on to the consumer sector came as no surprise to a market which had braced itself to expect such moves. Brewers, distillers and, to a lesser extent, the oil companies, are expected to underperform the market this morning. On the other hand, the utilities, hit by worries that the mini-Budget could have included moves to penalise the hugely profitable electricity distribution stocks, generators and water companies, staged a good rally after escaping the latest tax net. At the close of the session the FT-SE 100 Index was 1.3 higher at 3,013.8, after having swung in a 20-point arc, while the FT-SE Mid 250 Index settled a net 2.6 firmer at 3,427.9. Embellishing a trading session bursting with news and stories was the unofficial market debut of BSkyB, the satellite television company, which got off to an encouraging 5 per cent premium to its 256p striking price. There was frantic trading in BSkyB shares, where turnover of 41m accounted for a short 8 per cent of business in London's equity market. There was considerable nervousness in London at the outset of trading, with fund managers reluctant to trade ahead of the mini-Budget. The FT-SE 100 kicked off around four points lower but quickly stabilised and began to gather upside momentum as stories of a bid for Warburg began to circulate in the City's dealing rooms. Confirmation from Warburg and Morgan Stanley that the two groups are involved in talks which could lead to a merger saw Warburg shares retreat sharply before embarking on another upsurge later in the day. Marketmakers quickly adopted the view that the talks were the start of what could be one of the biggest takeover battles in the UK financial sector. 'The view in the market is that Warburg is now very much 'in play' and that a 'serious take-out' price will need to be well in excess of Pounds 12.50 a share,' said one trader. 'JP Morgan was said to have been in talks with Warburg two years ago, and has to be seen as a serious contender to launch a counter to any merger offer from Morgan Stanley,' he added. Dresdner Bank was also viewed as a likely counter-bidder to any moves. The Warburg/Morgan Stanley news electrified the rest of the financials area, where other merchant banks and brokers were chased higher. Smith New Court's interim figures, although well down from last time, were much better than some analysts had forecast, and the securities house - long regarded as the most astute marketmakers in the City - was seen as a prime target for other international financial services groups. Transatlantic events, which have tended to dominate European markets in recent weeks, played a much quieter part, although Wall Street was showing ominous signs of weakening some two hours after London closed. Dealers in London continued to point to the worrying events in the US, where Federal Reserve chairman Mr Alan Greenspan recently spoke of the need to restrain the US economy. The bankruptcy of Orange County, in California, and the Magellen Fund's difficulty, were cited as further causes for concern.</p>

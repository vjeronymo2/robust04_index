			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / High Sri Lanka death toll TWENTY-THREE Tamil guerrillas and 11 soldiers were killed in fierce fighting in eastern Sri Lanka yesterday, police said, Reuter reports from Colombo. They said 16 rebels and eight soldiers were killed when troops stormed a coastal base of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in Batticaloa district. Nine soldiers were wounded and four rebels were captured, police said. Three soldiers and seven rebels died earlier yesterday when guerrillas ambushed a government patrol on a road in neighbouring Polonnaruwa district. Police said there were two other battles in the jungles of Polonnaruwa between troops and rebels, but no details were available. Polonnaruwa was the scene last week of a series of massacres in which 130 people died. Tamil rebels attacked a Moslem village, killing 56 people. Moslem villagers in retaliation killed 74 Tamils in two neighbouring villages. A government spokesman said yesterday that a committee comprising a retired judge, a senior army officer and a senior policeman was investigating the killings.</p>

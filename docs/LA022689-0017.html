			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: ENDORSEMENT DAZE  </P> <P> Has Spike Lee, renegade director of "She's Gotta Have It" and "School Daze,"  sold out? The young, hip film maker is not only pitching Nike shoes in TV spots  that co-star NBA superstar Michael Jordan, he's modeling fashion apparel in the  current Vanity Fair (for the Gap) and in Spy magazine (for the Gotham-based  Barney's chain).  </P> <P> "Hey, I don't do everything," Lee said from N.Y.C., where he's finishing his  new film, "Do The Right Thing," due this summer from Universal. "I've turned  down lots of stuff."  </P> <P> Among the rejectees: Miller Lite ("I just don't feel comfortable doing liquor  ads").  </P> <P> Lee doesn't think the endorsements have damaged his credibility.  </P> <P> "Would you turn down an ad where you get to stand next to Michael Jordan? I'm  not getting rich off this stuff -- none of these have exactly been $8-million  Pepsi deals. In fact, I'm giving all the money I got from this Barney's ad to  charity. All I'm getting is the Armani suit."  </P> <P> He laughed. "I think this is good for my credibility. No one's ever seen me in  a suit before!" Patrick Goldstein  </P></p>

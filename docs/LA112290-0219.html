			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP FLASHBACK;  </P> <P> THIS WEEK IN COUNTY PREP SPORTS HISTORY;  </P> <P> 10 YEARS AGO  </P> <P> Sunny Hills quarterback Jim Karsatos became the top single-season passer in  Orange County history 10 years ago this week.  </P> <P> Karsatos set the record, 2,142 yards, by completing 11 of 21 passes for 194  yards in a 34-14 first-round Southern Section playoff victory over Los Amigos.  Servite's Brad Wekal had set the previous mark of 2,139 in 1967.  </P> <P> Karsatos eventually reached 2,703 yards, a figure which stood for four years  until Newport Harbor's Shane Foley threw for 3,092.  </P> <P> Karsatos is now sixth on the all-time county list. The leader is David Lowery  of Trabuco Hills (3,325 yards, 1988), followed by Scott Stark of Capistrano  Valley (3,153, 1985), Foley, David Henigan of Fountain Valley (2,917, 1988) and  Steve Stenstrom of El Toro (2,830, 1989).  </P> <P> </P> <P> 5 YEARS AGO  </P> <P> Before a 35-6 victory over Nogales in the first round of the Southern  Conference football playoffs, Mission Viejo Coach Bill Crow put his team to the  test -- literally.  </P> <P> Crow gave his players a written test that briefly covered the opponent's  formations and tendencies and emphasized what he thought would be a key element  of the game.  </P> <P> The players also were expected to write a short essay on a variety of subjects.  Crow and defensive coordinator Mike Rush selected the best essays and read them  to the team just before taking the field.  </P> <P> "I think the tests get the players mentally ready, and the essays help them get  emotionally ready," Crow said. "Sometimes (a player's essay) will get through  to another player better than a coach."  </P> <P> The results? Mission Viejo (11-2-1) tied for second in the South Coast League  (with El Toro, behind Capistrano Valley) and finished as runner-up in the  Southern Conference, losing the final to Santa Ana, 31-21.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1 YEAR AGO  </P> <P> One-Man Shows:  </P> <P> Tim Manning of Trabuco Hills rushed for 138 yards and two touchdowns and passed  for 158 yards and one touchdown to lead the Mustangs to a 35-21 victory over  Cabrillo in a Division VIII football playoff game.  </P> <P> Mark Gaw of Mission Viejo rushed for 164 yards and a touchdown in 12 carries to  lead the Diablos past Dominguez, 34-6, in a Division II playoff game. Gaw also  had a 67-yard touchdown reception.  </P> <P> Donnie Smith of Edison completed 18 of 26 passes for 236 yards and ran for the  Chargers' final touchdown in an 18-14 victory over Eisenhower in a Division I  playoff game.  </P> <P> Terrific Two: In the second round of the Southern Section Division III  playoffs, Capistrano Valley receiver Dave Poltl and quarterback Tony Solliday  each had a big game in a 44-12 pounding of Santa Ana. Poltl caught five passes  for 112 yards, including one for a 55-yard touchdown play, and Solliday  completed 10 of 12 passes for 226 yards.  </P></p>

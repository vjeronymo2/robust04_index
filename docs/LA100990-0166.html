			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> OIL TOPS $40 AGAIN ON LATEST HUSSEIN THREAT  </P> <P> Oil prices flared nearly $2 higher to more than $40 a barrel today in response  to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's threat to strike against Israel after the  killing Monday of 19 Palestinians.  </P> <P> "The war premium just went up another $1.50 a barrel based on rhetoric coming  out of Iraq," said Brian Tagler, analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton.  </P> <P> In early afternoon trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas  Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. grade, rose a hefty $1.75 to $40.70 a barrel,  a record high for the futures contract. It eclipsed the old high of $40.10 set  on Sept. 27.  </P> <P> Brokers said oil in the U.S. spot market was pegged at record highs, with some  grades of oil fetching close to $42 a barrel. The last time spot prices  approached this level was in 1980, when the Iraq-Iran War set off panic buying.  </P> <P> Prices have doubled since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait because of fears  that fighting would disrupt supplies.  </P> <P> Traders said they feared the crisis in the Mideast was near a flash point after  Hussein's speech.  </P> <P> Analysts said crude will likely push to $42 a barrel in the near term.  </P> <P> "Any way Israel provokes Arab anger cannot be positive," said Jayne Ball,  analyst with New Century Resources Corp.  </P> <P> But others agreed with President Bush's assessment that Israel's actions had  little bearing on the U.S.-Iraqi confrontation.  </P></p>

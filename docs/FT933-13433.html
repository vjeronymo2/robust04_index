			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / International Company News: Portman acquires Zenith Productions PORTMAN Entertainment, one of the UK's longest established independent production companies, has bought Zenith Productions from Carlton Communications and Paramount Communications of the US. Zenith and Zenith North, based in Newcastle, have been on the market for some time. Best known for television programmes such as Inspector Morse and films such as Prick Up Your Ears, they were put up for sale following Carlton's successful bid for the London weekday ITV franchise. An ITV broadcaster can hold no more than a 15 per cent stake in an independent television production company. Portman was founded in 1944. It was restructured a year ago with more than Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.3m) of new financing in a deal struck with Television Enterprise and Asset Management, backed by Rockefeller in the US and Robert Fleming, the merchant bank, and Primetime, the independent producer, in the UK. The price of the deal was not revealed, although a statement referred to 'a transfer of shares'. Mr Bernard Cragg, Carlton's finance director said he was pleased to have found 'a suitable home for Zenith so that the company will be able to continue to supply high quality independent programmes to the ITV and other broadcasters'.</p>

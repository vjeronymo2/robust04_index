			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE KIDS: ICE SKATING;  </P> <P> BLADES OF GLORY;  </P> <P> THE CONEJO VALLEY RINK PROVIDES FAMILY FUN AS WELL AS INSTRUCTION IN FIGURE  EIGHTS AND HOCKEY.  </P> <P> At mid-morning, it was 80 degrees outside, but inside the Conejo Valley Ice  Skating Center, it was barely 40 degrees. Mothers in long, down-filled coats  huddled on bleachers to watch their children move on the ice.  </P> <P> Some of the kids had been at the Newbury Park rink since 6 a.m. Half a dozen  instructors were giving private lessons to competitors, some as young as 7.  </P> <P> Welcome to Ventura County's only ice skating rink -- one of a dwindling supply  in Southern California.  </P> <P> It's a no-frills place in a converted grocery store, tucked into a shopping  mall. Yet, it's a hub for serious skaters, both hockey and figure, and it is  the only spot around for public skating. It's home to the Conejo Valley Figure  Skating Club and a home away from home for many of the club's competitively  minded skaters.  </P> <P> "We focus on youth training," said Sean McGillivray, president of Ice Time  Unlimited, a group that owns the rink. "We have a number of serious competitors  who train four or five hours a day."  </P> <P> One of them is Tisha Walker of Thousand Oaks who was on the ice for a lesson  with her coaches during the freestyle session that morning. At 16, she placed  eighth during the U.S. National Figure Skating Championship last February in  Salt Lake City. As a junior the year before, she placed third.  </P> <P> She's one of the few young people in the country who can do a triple jump,  McGillivray said.  </P> <P> Tisha, already an international competitor, has her sights set on the 1992  Olympics. She's been skating since she was 4. She's at the rink by 6 a.m. for  her daily workout.  </P> <P> "None of it is easy. It takes a lot of work getting your jumps consistent and  getting a finished look," Tisha said during a break. To accommodate her  skating, she attends Thousand Oaks High School part time and does  correspondence courses at home.  </P> <P> Tisha's first skating instruction was at the rink's skating school, which is  headed by Terry Tonius. The school offers an eight-week semester of classes for  $78. That includes a half-hour group lesson each week and 20 practice sessions,  and two guest passes. The children start as young as 4 and progress through a  series of levels, learning both figures and freestyle skating.  </P> <P> At any one time, the school has about 300 students. On a Saturday, there might  be 30 to 60 kids on the ice at a time for lessons. Those who want to compete go  on to private instruction, which runs $16 to $25 a half-hour, Tonius said. The  school employs 16 instructors who also free-lance as private instructors for  aspiring skaters.  </P> <P> For young skaters not interested in freestyle or figure skating, the rink also  has a drill team for competition precision skating.  </P> <P> "It's good for the kids who do other things in their lives and don't have the  time to make quite the commitment," Tonius said.  </P> <P> The rink also is a hockey hub. The youth hockey program there includes 225 kids  on 16 teams, all of which play each other. There is a beginners' hockey program  where they can learn the fundamentals of the game.  </P> <P> Adults play as well. At least 300 -- including a 72-year-old man -- compete on  22 teams making up four divisions.  </P> <P> McGillivray has been with the rink since it moved into the converted grocery  store 14 years ago. He said plans to build a new rink are in the formative  stages.  </P> <P> "This wasn't designed to be a rink," he said. "It's not energy-efficient." Over  the years, the rink has had its financial problems -- including rising rent and  insurance costs.  </P> <P> "Two years ago, we were within days of closing down," he said. "We fought to  keep it open."  </P> <P> It's a familiar story at other rinks that face the same money problems. "There  is a tremendous shortage of rinks," he said. "Ten rinks have closed in Southern  California, including one in Santa Barbara."  </P> <P> For now, the Conejo Valley Ice Skating Center is on sure footing, although the  ownership of the building changed recently. The rink may not have the dressing  rooms and other perks that McGillivray envisions in a new rink, but he said it  has the essential ingredient.  </P> <P> "We have very good ice."  </P> <P> * WHERE AND WHEN: The Conejo Valley Ice Skating Center is located at 510 N.  Ventu Park Road in Newbury Park, just north of the Ventura Freeway.

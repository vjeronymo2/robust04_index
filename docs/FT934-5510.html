			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Industrialists urge economic reform Indian industrialists have urged the government to put economic reform back to the top of the political agenda following the ruling Congress (I) party's partial success in this month's state elections. Industry leaders believe Congress has done well enough in the polls, for which vote-counting started at the weekend, to have taken the steam out of demands from the Bharatiya Janata party, the militant Hindu opposition, for an early general election. Businessmen now expect parliament to run its full term to 1996, giving Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao and colleagues time to press on with reform. 'I hope the next 2 1/2 years will be assigned only to economic reforms,' said Mr S K Bhargava, chief executive of Eicher, an engineering group. Mr K N Memani, president of the Federation of Indian Exporter Organisations, said the results should give Congress enough comfort to go ahead with reform. In Bombay, stockbrokers expected the results to give a further boost to the stock market, where prices have risen by an average of 23 per cent in the past three weeks, as measured by the Bombay Stock Exchange's index of leading stocks. The market was closed yesterday for a religious holiday. Shares are in the middle of their biggest rally since last year's scandal in the interbank securities market triggered a prolonged sell-off. The elections are a delayed consequence of the storming of the Ayodhya mosque last year by militant Hindus. Soon after the sacking, the BJP-controlled assemblies in four northern states - Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh - were suspended by the central government for allegedly supporting the mosque's destruction. The elections were for new assemblies for these states and in two others - the city of Delhi and the small north-eastern state of Mizoram. In the states where counting began at the weekend, Congress has won Himachal Pradesh and won enough seats in Rajasthan to rob the BJP of an outright majority, though the BJP may still form a government with support from independents. In Uttar Pradesh, the BJP has lost its majority and control is likely to pass to an anti-BJP coalition led by Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav, head of the Samajwadi party, a populist grouping representing lower castes. The BJP has swept control of Delhi, where elections were held for the first time after 40 years of central rule.</p>

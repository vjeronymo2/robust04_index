			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of Greece (10): Slow to catch on - Spending on R&amp;D is low Only a few Greek companies make research and development a priority. Most prefer to pay royalties on imported technology. Greece lags far behind its European Union partners in R&amp;D, spending only 0.4 per cent of gross domestic product on research, compared to an average of 2.5 per cent in northern European countries. The lack of opportunity at home drives Greek research students abroad, usually for good. There are now more than 5,000 Greek researchers working permanently in western Europe and the US. Nikos Christodoulakis, head of the Greek government's research secretariat, believes this will change. The catalyst, he says, will be increased funding for science and technology from the EU's new structural aid package, amounting to Ecu150m over the next three years. 'We want to raise research spending to 1 per cent of GDP by the end of the 1990s and fund several hundred more researchers here in Greece,' he says. In the past decade the number of government-backed research operations, including new research centres, technology development companies in different sectors and technology parks, has grown from 114 to 270. But technology parks attract relatively few applicants, while private companies show little interest in co-operating with the development companies. Mr Christodoulakis is trying to link companies directly with researchers in order to work on specific projects. From next year, companies joining in the programme will contribute an average Dr5m over three years, with additional funding for small teams of in-house researchers coming from the government. 'There's no doubt that we have the talent. Greece handles over 3 per cent of the EU's competitive R&amp;D programmes, though it has only 0.6 per cent of the union's research population,' he says. The scheme is attracting more participants than expected, as Greek companies start looking for ways to remain competitive in the single market One of the biggest research spenders is Econ Industries, an electronics and precision components manufacturer, which allocates 10 per cent of its Dr20bn turnover on R&amp;D. After rapid expansion in the late 1980s, the result of winning co-production work in offset deals linked with Greek government weapons contracts, the company wants to diversify. 'We do well out of retro-fit kits to upgrade Greek army tanks, and we have an export market for our power amplifiers and night vision equipment but our growth prospects are better in the civilian market,' says Dimitrios Economides, managing director. Econ's night vision camera, originally designed for military use is being adapted both for civilian electronic surveillance and security systems and for use on yachts. Alex Economides, Econ's plant manager, says: 'To stay competitive, we have to design our own electronic products and devise something new every year. But as there are few jobs at home for Greek optical engineers, we have a very high quality workforce.' But the market for research in Greece is limited. In northern Greece, the Adhesives Research Institute, the research arm of ACM Wood Chemicals, a Greek-owned company based in Switzerland with manufacturing ventures in Canada and Belgium, provides technology almost exclusively for export. ARI has found a way of eliminating formaldehyde emissions, increasingly seen as hazardous to health, from resins and additives used in making particle board and other wood products. But its products are not in demand in Greece, where timber processors are not required by law to limit formaldehyde emissions and export mainly to countries without strict environmental controls. ARI makes cost savings through being based in Thessaloniki, where researchers' salaries are lower than in western Europe. Through its parent company, it develops close relationships with customers abroad to make up for the lack of interest among local maufacturers. Pavlos Mouratides, assistant head of research, says: 'We cooperate with some local manufacturers in testing our products, but they don't go into regular production.'</p>

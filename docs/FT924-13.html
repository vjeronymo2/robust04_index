			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Sterling futures rally SHORT-DATED sterling futures yesterday continued the rally of recent days as dealers expected another cut in UK base rates by the spring, writes James Blitz. Despite increasing signs of an upturn in the UK economy, the market continues to think that the British government will be forced to ease monetary policy again. On Tuesday, the Institute of Directors found that the proportion of business leaders who were more optimistic about the economy compared with six months ago increased to 38 per cent last month from 10 per cent in October. However the IoD carefully added that the chancellor should announce a further cut in interest rates to help improve the situation. Two other factors added to bullish sentiment yesterday. First, was growing speculation of a rise in taxes or other imposts at the time of the March budget, which would be offset by a cut in interest rates. The Bank of England also issued a further Pounds 1bn of 7 1/4 per cent Treasury stock due in 1998. Dealers have traditionally seen the issue of short-dated gilts as a precursor to a base rate cut. However, analysts who follow the Bank of England warned yesterday that the authorities had only issued this new tranche for technical reasons, notably that existing stock was well bid and in short supply. These factors helped to push the March short sterling contract up 13 basis points to a high of 93.55, although it later fell back to close at 93.52. At this level, it prices 3-month money at 6.48 per cent in the spring of next year. As ever, cash rates failed to reflect the excitement of futures. The 3-month rate closed unchanged at 7 1/16 per cent. The overnight rate was as high as 9 per cent in the afternoon, mainly because the Bank of England revised its forecast shortage upwards from Pounds 1.3bn to Pounds 1.6bn in the afternoon. Late assistance was Pounds 430m. German call money was quoted at around 8.80 per cent yesterday, although there were reports of wild swings in rates to as much as 9.50 per cent. The fluctuations were attributed to last-minute position taking before the end of the year. Euromark futures were slightly weaker. The March contract closed at 92.23 after peaking earlier in the day at 92.32.</p>

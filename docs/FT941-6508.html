			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Newsprint prices keep Abitibi in deficit Low paper prices drove Abitibi-Price, the world's biggest newsprint producer, to its fourth consecutive year of losses in 1993. The Toronto-based company said that newsprint prices in North America have shown no signs of recovery so far this year. But it expressed the hope that operating results will improve during 1994 thanks to a combination of higher offshore prices, a 7 per cent cut in North American discounts due to take effect today, and further price hikes later in the year as the US recovery gathers pace. Net losses last year totalled CDollars 121.7m (USDollars 90.1m), or CDollars 1.71 a share, a significant improvement on 1992's CDollars 220.9m deficit, equal to CDollars 3.19 a share. The results include a narrowing in losses from discontinued operations to CDollars 13.4m from CDollars 27.8m. Sales rose to CDollars 1.87bn from CDollars 1.60bn. Operating losses fell to CDollars 39.8m from CDollars 138.1m. The smaller losses were due to a drop in the Canadian dollar, lower costs and higher volumes. In addition, earnings from office products jumped 49 per cent. Analysts predict that Canadian and US newsprint producers will be able to push through at least part of today's proposed price increase.</p>

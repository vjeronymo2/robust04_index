			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Billiton seeks buyer for TDF BILLITON, the metals and mining subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, hopes to find a buyer for TDF Tiofine, its loss-making Netherlands-based producer of titanium dioxide pigment, within the next few months. Mr Heinz Klaar, general manager at TDF Tiofine, said several international companies had expressed an interest in buying the company, but he declined to name them or to give the probable purchase price. He said the process of finding a buyer would not be affected by TDF Tiofine's filing for a moratorium on payments to creditors on December 24. Billiton wants to sell TDF Tiofine as a going concern to a larger producer of titanium dioxide in order to provide it with a secure future. The Dutch titanium dioxide company, which opened a new production plant in the Botlek area of the port of Rotterdam less than three years ago, has annual capacity of 45,000 tonnes, making it a relatively small producer with annual turnover of about Fl 100m (Pounds 36.5m). TDF Tiofine has incurred cumulative losses of more than Fl 100m since opening its new plant, which required a total investment of between Fl 300m and Fl 350m. The losses were attributed to the weakness of the dollar, overcapacity in the market and initial difficulties in getting the Rotterdam site on stream, Mr Klaar said. Billiton, which is itself loss-making, is seeking to divest the company in line with its new strategy of emphasising upstream rather than downstream operations.</p>

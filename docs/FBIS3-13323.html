			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The U.S. Administration has demanded that Jordan  produce documents approving the export of 6,000 tonnes of  chemical materials transported to Iraq in late 1993. The  chemicals are used in the refinement of oil used by Jordan.    The Jordanian Government has submitted a report showing the  kind of materials exported, the license plate numbers of trucks  that transported them, and the dates of export.    The U.S. measure is meant to increase pressure on Jordan by  propagating rumors that Jordan is not complying with the embargo  against Iraq. The purpose is to force the Jordanian Government  to conclude a treaty with Israel before discussing its details.    Observers note that the United States wants to give the  world  the impression that Jordan is smuggling on the official level.    Knowledgeable sources say Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam  al-Majali might sacrifice Finance Minister Sami Qammuh -- since  Qammuh was the one who issued the export approvals -- in a bid  to convince the United States that Qammuh acted on his own  without consulting the government.</p>

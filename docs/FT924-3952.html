			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Individuals could block buy-back by Amstrad OPPONENTS of Mr Alan Sugar's controversial buy-back bid for Amstrad need to muster only a small group of individual shareholders to block the deal at next week's extraordinary meeting. A close reading of the UK Companies Act shows that the 30p-a-share offer needs the approval of a simple majority of shareholders by number voting at the meeting or by proxy, regardless of the size of their shareholding. This amounts to a one-man-one-vote provision. This particular test of support had been overlooked while investors focused on a second requirement that Mr Sugar, who holds a 35 per cent personal equity stake in Amstrad, needs to win three-quarters of the shares by value he does not own in order to proceed with his buy-back bid. Under the second test Mr Sugar needs the support of 281m shares, although even this has looked increasingly hard to achieve given the decision of two leading institutional shareholders to vote against the plan. Amstrad and its advisors confirmed yesterday that both tests must be satisfied, and expressed surprise that no public mention of the simple majority requirement had been made earlier. The subject is being brought to light by PLC magazine, a publication about practical law issues for companies, in its December issue. Meanwhile the High Court yesterday threw out one shareholder's legal challenge to the buy-out bid.</p>

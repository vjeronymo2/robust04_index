			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Map fogs view of Ireland Sir, I was much intrigued by the map used to illustrate the front page of your survey on Ireland published on May 25. The map of Ireland itself is accompanied in the top left-hand corner by a smaller scale map showing the area of the main map in relation to the British Isles. Why, I wonder, was Ireland not shown in relation to a map of Europe? After all, the survey on Tennessee, published with the same issue, positions that state within the whole of the Americas. I do not suppose the FT really regards Ireland as a sort of dependency as the map seems to imply; could it be that this is an example of the island mentality which many continental Europeans attribute to the British stereotype? It certainly smacks of that apocryphal headline: 'Fog in Channel  -Europe cut off from England.' Vincent Nutt, Frankfurter Strasse 26, D-61476 Kronberg, Germany</p>

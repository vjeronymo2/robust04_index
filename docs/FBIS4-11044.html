			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jorge Luis Velazquez from Boston] </F>   [Text] Domingo Cavallo has said he is convinced that the  dynamism of the stability plan will end up encouraging an  increase in internal savings and slowing down the growth of  consumption. The minister added, however, that the Economy  Ministry will "help" speed up the process. Tax controls will be  reinforced, exporters will receive incentives, and measures will  be adopted to get banks more interested in the business of long  term loans.    The minister described the scenario during a conversation  with CLARIN at Harvard University, a few minutes after talking  with a group of Argentine students on Argentina's current  economic situation. The minister answered questions on  corruption reports, the removal of Martin Redrado, and the small  budget allocated to education.    "The savings rate increased by nearly 2 percent last year.  It currently stands at 16 percent of the gross domestic  product. The trend will consolidate after we implement the  private pensions system. Savings will be encouraged by a nearly  zero inflation rate and a more effective application of tax  policies," Cavallo added.    The minister said he had his eyes on wealth tax  contributors.  "We eliminated many tax exemptions, and will now redouble our  efforts to make sure regulations are strictly fulfilled, just as  we are doing with the item profits."    The minister said at every chance that his recipe only  contains more of the same medicine. He cited as an example the  recent decree establishing guidelines on public spending. The  minister said the decree made official an "unwritten" norm that  the ministry enforced through regulations on budget programming.  But the government decided to add legal weight to the  instrument because of the need to establish stricter controls,  and in order to reduce the administration's spending rate.    Cavallo said the government will soon present a bill  establishing a new fiscal mechanism to encourage the export of  capital goods. Entrepreneurs will be able to postpone the  payment of the value added tax [VAT] on their operations until  they receive their tax return on the VAT applied on sales.    "Another source of internal savings will be in the form of  long term mortgage loans, which we still do not have enough in  the market," Cavallo said.    "Why do you think banks will stop preferring loans on  consumption which are short term and have higher spreads?"  CLARIN asked.    "The demand will no longer be oriented toward those loans,  and banks will have to compete and offer longer term lines and  lower interest rates. It will also be advantageous for banks,  because long term loans have minimum administrative costs which  are applied just once, when the loans are granted.    Will the government implement specific measures to speed up  the process?    "We are thinking of measures that will contribute to  creating  better conditions for banks to see more quickly where the  business is. The law regulating the creation of mortgage  securities [securitizacion de hipotecas] for trading in the  capitals market points in that direction, the minister said,  while walking through areas he remembered from his years as a  Harvard student.    The minister denied that current policies carry the risk of  recession. He defended his position with an example: "The  Austral Plan provoked an increase in internal demands in 1985.  But it also provoked a 20 percent drop in the volume of  exports, which lasted two years. With the convertibility plan  we were able to maintain our export rate stable during the first  two years. Exports started to pick up in the third year, and  they continue to grow today."    Cavallo's speech is strictly in accordance with what he has  been saying since the Guadalajara meeting. In the IDB  [Inter-American Development Bank] meeting in that city three  days ago, the minister minimized the possible influence of the  U.S. interest rate hike on his decision to promote an increase  in internal savings.    "This year we might receive a little less capital  investment.  But that is not a determining factor. Everything will depend on  us. Just as in the past we used external savings to finance  investments, we must now take advantage of the fact that a  reactivation in the United States might provoke greater demand  for our products," the minister reiterated in Boston, the oldest  city in the United States.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jose Armas] </F>   [Text] Last night, the Voice of America [VOA], an official  institution of the U.S. Government, reported during their  Spanish broadcasts on the meeting that the Cuban Government and  the organizations of our country have just proposed for April,  entitled: Cuba and the Exile Community.    In essence, the VOA stated that President Fidel Castro had  extended an invitation to exiled Cubans throughout the world and  that the only condition set on attending the conference was  loyalty to the Revolution.    Even though the VOA transmissions are aimed at Latin America  and the Caribbean and practically all the rest of the world, it  is imperative to state the following: The VOA's report is  flagrantly false. First: The summons was not made on behalf of  Comrade Fidel but on behalf of the Revolutionary government and  the Cuban organizations. Second: Nowhere in the text of the call  are Cuban exiles mentioned, but persons and organizations who  are representative of Cuban emigration. Third: It is a flagrant  and miserable lie to state that the only condition demanded by  the Cuban authorities to attend the conference was loyalty to  our Revolution.    The summons states the determination of the Cuban  authorities  and people to advance toward normalization of relations with  those residents abroad who, constituting a majority of emigres,  are not relinquishing their ties with the country. They do not  condition them on personal and political aspirations or group  interests. That is something very different from what the VOA  stated.    Cuba is not making a call for a political dialogue, even  though the summons has, of course, a certain political  connotation. The Cuban proposal is based on humanist principles.  As for the rest, the VOA can be sure that the conference will be  held and that it will not be a dialogue of the deaf, but a  dialogue between men and women of good will.</p>

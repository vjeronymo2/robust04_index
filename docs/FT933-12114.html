			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Shake-up at Medeva may be accelerated MR BERNARD Taylor, chairman of Medeva, the UK drugs company, said yesterday that the timing of some planned management changes could be accelerated by last week's profits warning which almost halved its stock market value. Mr Taylor said the changes included the 'inevitable' splitting of his own role as chairman and chief executive. He said: 'The profits warning may accelerate it. We really have not thought that through yet.' However, he added that he would like 'several months to pass' before the board considered any changes. 'One does not suddenly say 'lets review our strategy as a result of what's happened yesterday'. One must take these things in a measured way and not panic about them.' Medeva's stock market value tumbled from Pounds 589m to Pounds 295m in heavy trading early last week after the profits warning. Mr Taylor said the management structure had been in development for the past three years: 'Eventually it will be rather typical of drugs companies with regional directors, specialist services in quality assurance, finance and research and development and at the highest board level a reasonable number of non-executive direc-tors.' He said he did not believe Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, managing director, would leave the company in the wake of last week's announcement that pre-tax profits for 1993 would be about Pounds 10m below market expectations of between Pounds 53m and Pounds 57m. Mr Taylor said he had no plans to retire before he reached 60, in three years, and that he might well remain with the company after that time. He added that he 'is not required to go as a result of this problem.'</p>

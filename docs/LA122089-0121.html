			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> FAMILY-HELP PLAN GOING FULL STEAM  </P> <P> A spokesman for Southern California Edison was on one line, a needy family on  the other.  </P> <P> "Both seemed hesitant to talk, but they got over it after talking for about two  minutes," Irvine Temporary Housing's Louise Wagner said. "Now, it turns out,  the children in the family are all excited. They get to go for a ride in one of  Edison's big trucks."  </P> <P> This week, Wagner is once again playing matchmaker, just as she does each year  during the holidays. She is in charge of Adopt A Family for Christmas 1989, her  third year coordinating the program.  </P> <P> "Businesses, families and individuals all play a part. The Soroptomists have  called and are taking three families, Alderwood Basics Plus (an Irvine  elementary school) is taking seven families, the Chamber of Commerce is  involved, our high schools, the Irvine Medical Center. There are about 45  families we are placing this year," Wagner said.  </P> <P> Irvine Temporary Housing rents 10 apartments and two houses in the city to  needy families, based on their ability to pay. Each of these families will also  be adopted in the Christmas program. Their identities remain secret to save  them from embarrassment, Wagner said.  </P> <P> "Our 12 families always remain anonymous, as do many of the people involved in  the Adopt a Family program," Wagner said. "Many people, on both sides of this  program, simply prefer it that way. They bring food, gifts and sometimes  clothing here and families come to pick it up."  </P> <P> Others find out specific sizes for children and custom fit their donations.  </P> <P> "It just depends on how each individual wants to handle it," Wagner said.  "Sometimes we just give out phone numbers and they work it out outside the  program." LEN HALL  </P></p>

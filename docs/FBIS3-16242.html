It appears  to us that contacts between experts from the two delegations on  the eve of the talks have helped to achieve further progress  toward agreement on outstanding questions. We hope that  agreement on the technical questions that experts have not yet  resolved will be achieved during this round, thereby creating  real prospects for the initialling of the entire range of  agreements on military questions.

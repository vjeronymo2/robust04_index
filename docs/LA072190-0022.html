			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HANDCUFFING THE LOCALS IN TOBACCO WAR  </P> <P> The powerful tobacco lobby in Sacramento is close to obtaining legislation that  would take away the authority of local communities to block distribution of  cigarettes to minors. Like those fighting the war against illicit drugs, our  local officials understand that while they cannot attack tobacco at the  "source" by halting supply or advertising, they can "interdict" it in their  communities.  </P> <P> They can stop tobacco peddlers from preying on the young by restricting  cigarette vending machines and free samples. If these outlets are removed,  common sense suggests that fewer kids will become smokers.  </P> <P> The cigarette companies obviously agree or they would not be fighting so  ferociously for legislation to block these local efforts.  </P> <P> Will the Legislature be pressured into putting the state's seal of approval on  the promotion of America's deadliest drug to minors?  </P> <P> Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means  subcommittee on health and human services, and William I. Rothbard, Los Angeles  attorney and president of Americans for Nonsmokers Rights.  </P> <P> </P></p>

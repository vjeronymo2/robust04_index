			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: Imi profits fall to L208bn in first half Difficult financial markets and reduced commission on investment activities took their toll on first-half profits at Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the Italian banking group partly privatised earlier this year. Consolidated profit fell to L208.1bn (Dollars 133m) in the six months to June 30, after tax and provisions of L327bn, against L283bn in what Imi described yesterday as an 'exceptionally favourable' first half last year. The group pointed out, however, that profit was in line with the second half of 1993. Imi's board indicated yesterday that the company was likely to pay an unchanged dividend of L400 per share for 1994. In January, the Italian treasury sold just over half of its 60 per cent stake in Imi in one of the first large public offers by the government, and now owns 28 per cent. Mr Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister, indicated in June that once the nine-month freeze on selling more shares was over - in November - the treasury would consider reducing its holding still further. Imi is studying the possibilities, which could include a direct offer to foreign investors, or a reinforced 'hard core' of large Italian banks, such as Cariplo, San Paolo di Torino and Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which are Imi's largest shareholders after the treasury. At the moment, however, it looks as though a combination of less favourable market conditions, and reluctance to undermine other privatisation issues will delay the sale of a second tranche. Imi's main activities are medium and long-term lending, personal financial services and investment banking. During the first half the group said that it had generated a 'significant flow of commission' from its corporate finance and share placement activities. During the first half the group's credits rose to L50,783bn, up 1.2 per cent compared with the end of last year.</p>

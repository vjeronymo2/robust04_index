			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OPPONENTS OF PLANNED LANDFILL FEAR CONTAMINATION OF GROUND WATER;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: BUT FOR INDIANS OF THE CAMPO RESERVATION THE PROJECT IS A  LAST-DITCH ECONOMIC CHANCE.  </P> <P> Nearly one year ago, Tribal Chairman Ralph Goff looked out his window at the  inhospitable highlands that make up the Campo Indian Reservation and considered  the promise of landfills.  </P> <P> "There isn't a whole lot you can do out here," he said, gesturing toward the  15,000-acre reservation, one of the poorest corners of southeastern San Diego  County, that is home to more than 200 Mission Indians. There isn't enough  traffic to support a truck stop, he said. Bingo is an unlikely money-maker in  that remote a locale. Trash, he said, is the reservation's best hope for  economic survival.  </P> <P> "We're all for it," he said of a proposal -- vehemently opposed by the  surrounding community -- to build a landfill on Indian land. "We'll make sure  it's done right."  </P> <P> Now, Goff stands on the brink of getting his way. Earlier this month, the Campo  Band of Mission Indians contracted with an Ohio waste management company to  build a 600-acre landfill and trash recycling plant worth $15 million to $22  million on their land.  </P> <P> The tribe has begun the process of obtaining approval from the U.S. Bureau of  Indian Affairs. And if all goes as planned, the dump will begin accepting up to  3,000 tons of trash a day by mid-1992.  </P> <P> Under the contract, Mid-American Waste Systems Inc., a 5-year-old  Columbus-based company, gains the rights to operate the landfill until it is  full of 30 million tons of waste -- probably about 40 years. In return, said a  spokesman for the tribe, the Indians will receive a "substantial" up-front  payment, monthly royalties once the plant is built and first dibs on jobs at  the dump.  </P> <P> "Full employment is a primary goal for the tribe, and we think there will be a  job for everyone that wants one," said Kevin Gover, an Albuquerque-based lawyer  who is representing the Campo tribe. He refused to specify how much money the  tribe will receive, but said, "We think there will be sufficient revenue going  to the tribe to allow (it) to build a viable economic base."  </P> <P> The signing of the contract comes as several San Diego County landfills are  nearing capacity, sending civic leaders scrambling to find new sites. The city  and county of San Diego have included the Campo reservation on a list of 10  possible sites to replace the Miramar, Sycamore and Otay landfills. All three  are expected to close within a decade.  </P> <P> The agreement also comes amid a battle over a controversial bill, sponsored by  Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-Rancho San Diego), that would require some Indian  tribes to abide by strict state regulations when planning garbage dumps on  their sovereign lands. Sovereignty places the land outside the jurisdiction of  the county, the state and even the U.S. government.  </P> <P> The bill, which passed the Legislature last month, would require state  intervention only in cases where there is reason to believe there would be a  "spill-over" effect on surrounding non-Indian land. But even Peace's chief of  staff, David Takashima, predicts the bill will be vetoed by Gov. George  Deukmejian.  </P> <P> "My guess is that the odds are at this point against this," Takashima said.  "But there's always a glimmer of hope."  </P> <P> All this comes as a blow to Donna Tisdale, a rancher who lives within view of  the proposed dump site. For more than a year, as the Campo tribe has considered  various bids from several waste management companies, Tisdale and dozens of her  neighbors have fought tirelessly to protect their ground water by trying to  block plans for a landfill.  </P> <P> Tisdale and her neighbors -- and the Mission Indians themselves -- are  completely dependent on well water. The nearest water district is in Alpine,  about 40 miles west. So protecting that water has become a labor of survival.  </P> <P> Tisdale has talked to Mike Patton, a vice president at Mid-American Waste  Systems. She has heard him describe the safety precautions his company takes to  prevent the leeching of toxics into the water table -- from multiple protective  liners to methane detection systems to ground water monitoring. She has heard  the claims that this will be the best, most state-of-the-art landfill in the  state.  </P> <P> "That doesn't impress us at all," she said flatly. She has done her homework on  Patton's company, she says, and is concerned that of its 14 landfills in five  states, the company bought 13 already built -- so the Campo landfill would be  only the second fully constructed by Mid-American.  </P> <P> Patton confirmed that, but said the company's reputation and track record is  excellent.  </P> <P> "We take very good care of the communities that we're in and very good care of  the environment," he said. "We use the best available technology. We don't risk  contaminating the water."  </P> <P> Patton confirmed that, in keeping with the Indians' claim to full sovereignty  for the lands, neither his company nor the tribe will apply for state or local  government permits to build the waste facility. But he said the landfill will  exceed federal and state environmental standards and called the dump's  opponents uninformed.  </P> <P> "They are not fully aware of what can be done," he said. "I'm not going to  contend that any (protective) liner in the world is foolproof, because it's  not. Nothing is guaranteed. But you don't have all your assets riding on one  safety factor. There is more than one line of defense."  </P> <P> Gover, the tribe's lawyer, said that one-quarter of the money the tribe  receives will be used to regulate the landfill and to ensure it is built and  run in accordance with strict environmental safeguards. Economically desperate,  he said, the Indians have come to this solution after much soul-searching. But  they are determined to execute it well.  </P> <P> "Even if there were some (other) sort of venture that was viable, it would  require capital to start," Gover said. "We could not find another industry that  was willing to come in and capitalize up front other than the waste industry.  </P> <P> "The tribe considered many options. They come to it with great reluctance and a  sense of regret that this was what they have to do to develop an economy on  their reservation," he said. "But if this is what we have to do, we sure as  hell are going to do it right."  </P></p>

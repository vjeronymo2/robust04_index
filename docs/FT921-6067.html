			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / International Company News: Sharp fall in Esab earnings ESAB, the world's leading welding equipment producer, has reported a 97 per cent fall in profits after financial items to SKr9m (Dollars 1.5m) in 1991 and has halved its dividend to SKr3.25. The sharp earnings fall was blamed on a 7 per cent decline in sales to SKr6.57bn as well as costs associated with a reduction of the workforce. Although Esab predicts profitability will improve in 1992 due to cost-cutting measures, it expects market growth to be slow and only a marginal increase in sales. Orders during 1991 fell 9 per cent to SKr6.37bn, reflecting a decline in industrial production and reduced investments by customers. Esab noted that demand weakened in all its leading markets, which included Europe, the US, Brazil and south-east Asia.</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> BEST BET  </P> <P> The Banning Residence Museum in Wilmington is re-creating a lavish Victorian  Christmas today. Things will be just as they might have been a century ago for  the family and guests of Wilmington founder Phineas Banning.  </P> <P> The event, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., will feature music by costumed carolers,  bell ringers and a dulcimer player; a storyteller will entertain children, and  Santa Claus will arrive in a carriage. Aromas of baking will fill the mansion's  kitchen, and there will be demonstrations of old-fashioned doll making,  quilting, wreath making and ornamental gardening.  </P> <P> "The visitor will find a 19th-Century house in enthusiastic anticipation of the  holiday," said Cathy Partridge, coordinator of the fifth annual party being put  on by 100 museum volunteers. A 12-foot tree with re-created Victorian  decorations will adorn the living room of the elegant 1864 mansion, and a  romantic midnight supper will be laid out amid the sumptuous furnishings of the  master bedroom. A Victorian dollhouse and the sounds of an antique music box  will provide other authentic touches. Fresh greens and flowers will festoon  both the home and the carriage barn, where the museum shop will sell glass,  wood and pewter ornaments, and other gifts.  </P> <P> Admission will be a $5 donation, with children under 12 free. The museum is at  401 East M St. in Banning Park. GERALD FARIS  </P></p>

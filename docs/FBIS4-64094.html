			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report attributed to BELINFORM: "Government Critically </F> Assesses Activities of the Finance Ministry"]    [Text] If the Finance Ministry continues to operate this  way, we will not cope with financial problems. This is how this  ministry was assessed at a meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers  Presidium, chaired by Belarusian Prime Minister Mikail  Myasnikovich, during a report on the implementation of the  Belarusian state budget for 1993.    Among others, it was stressed that the Finance Ministry  poorly handles credits given as part of bilateral relations.  Those credits are misapplied, preventing the deficit of the  payment balance from being eliminated. State securities have  not been issued yet. Debts of other countries have also become  a serious problem, exceeding the amount of 200 billion rubles.  Only the debt of Uzbekistan to Belarus has been properly  handled. Insufficient interaction between the Finance Ministry,  the National Bank, and the National Committee for Statistics and  Analysis weakens the "hare." Supreme Soviet Deputy Chairman  Ivan Bambiza sharply criticized the ministry for its tax  policies.    It was said at the meeting that the economy and the budget  exist in isolation from each other. This is why a decision was  made to reexamine activities of the Finance Ministry on the  above issues.    The government's Presidium approved a temporary statute on  use of economic sanctions for economic entities. It also  decided to open new diplomatic representative offices abroad and  transform plenipotentiary representative offices of the Cabinet  of Ministers into embassies of the Belarusian Republic.</p>

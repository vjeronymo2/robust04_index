			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / International Company News: Abdullahs acquire more shares in Alexander Russell ALEXANDER Russell, the biggest sand and gravel company in Scotland, has once again attracted takeover talk following the announcement that the group's largest shareholder had increased its stake. The shareholder, Royalty Finance, is a Swiss-registered Arab consortium. It is a vehicle for Mr Raschid Abdullah and Mr Osman Abdullah, the brothers who run the engineering and quarrying business Starmin. It has boosted its stake in Alexander Russell by 250,000 shares and now holds 15.67 per cent of the capital. Starmin implied yesterday that, while the stakebuilding was merely opportunistic, a full-scale bid had not been ruled out. 'There was one per cent available and Royalty bought it but it is not the precursor of an immediate launch of a bid,' the company said. Fears initially developed in January when Royalty acquired 14 per cent of Alexander Russell's shares and asked the Glasgow-based company to provide a copy of its shareholders' register, suggesting that it was preparing a circular. The Abdullah brothers came to prominence after they built up Evered (now Evered Bardon) into one of the largest quarrying businesses in Britain. They turned it from an engineering shell into one of the most aggressive and expansionist mini conglomerates of the early 1980s. In 1989 they were ousted following a boardroom conflict and bought into the Guildford-based Starmin, which they used to purchase quarries and concrete businesses in Scotland. They have previously suggested co-operation agreements with Russell at least twice over the past two years but nothing came of them.</p>

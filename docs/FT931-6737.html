			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Severn Trent It comes as no surprise that Severn Trent is the first privatised water company to buy one of its smaller statutory neighbours. Having blazed the trail in waste management with the acquisition of Biffa, there is clearly no shortage of ambition. The Pounds 33m acquisition of East Worcester is only a drop in the ocean of Severn Trent's core water business. Even so, shareholders mindful of Biffa's dismal performance might take comfort that, in this case, Severn Trent should know exactly what it is buying. The deal sets something of a precedent for other privatised water companies. The regulator is evidently happy so long as benefits flow to customers in the form of lower charges. That will be taken as a green light by the rest of the industry. Even so, it is difficult to envisage a takeover binge. Giving East Worcester access to Severn Trent's network is a neat solution to an otherwise expensive supply problem. Cost savings in other cases will be more difficult to find. Acquisitions valued over Pounds 30m in terms of net assets - East Worcester is worth Pounds 16m on this basis - face an automatic monopolies investigation. That alone may be enough to discourage Severn Trent from bidding for the larger quoted South Staffordshire.</p>

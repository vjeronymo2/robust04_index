			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Daf plan excludes UK plants: Dutch and Belgian operations could form new company THE DUTCH and Belgian operations of Daf, western Europe's sixth largest truck manufacturer, may be demerged into a specially created company, financed by local banks and the Dutch government, according to senior bankers. The UK operations would not be transferred to the new company. Much of UK operating capacity, which employs 5,500 people, could close. Bankers said yesterday that the main truck plant at Leyland in Lancashire may be sold to management, but that the Birmingham van plant and the Glasgow axle plant were at risk. They added that Daf's administrators working under Dutch insolvency law, together with local bankers and government officials, were working on the demerger proposal. It also emerged yesterday that before seeking bankruptcy protection on Tuesday, Daf had been planning to withdraw from all van manufacturing. The Birmingham van plant employs 2,000 people. Under the original restructuring plan, Daf would have concentrated on the manufacture of heavy and medium-sized trucks. It would have attempted to find a partner for the manufacture of light trucks, at present assembled at the Leyland plant with 2,200 employees. Bankers said yesterday they believed MAN of Germany was the best partner for Daf in light trucks and hoped that talks between the two companies could be pursued. Daf's restructuring plan was based in part on an investigation by the management consulting firm AD Little, backed up by financial estimates from accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. A confidential study by Coopers estimated that Daf's losses in 1992 were more than Fl 800m (Pounds 296m). This included a Fl 580m provision to cover restructuring costs. Coopers and Daf also estimated that Daf needed to raise finance of Fl 800m in 1993, followed by Fl 500m the following year and Fl 250m in 1995. These funds would have had to be provided by the company's banks, its holders of preference shares and debentures, together with the Dutch government and the Flemish regional authorities. Any demerger would need to be approved by the group's banks, principally a consortium of nine led by the Dutch bank, ABN Amro, which is the biggest lender to Daf. A formal proposal should be put in the next three weeks, a banker said. Daf confirmed yesterday that it had received a short-term bridging loan from its banks and the Dutch government to allow it to continue trading for a month. It has received a loan of more than Fl 100m, including Fl 60m from the banking consortium. The Daf crisis, Page 7</p>

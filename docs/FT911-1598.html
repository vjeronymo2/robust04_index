			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Survey of Franchising (1): Pressure on new recruits - It has been said that a franchise provides additional safeguards over and above those available to the independent start-up business. The recession is providing the industry with the opportunity to show that it really is the safer way to start in business THE recession has presented the franchising industry with an ideal opportunity to show whether it really is the safer way to start in business that its proponents assert. Impressive claims have been made in the past for the additional safeguards that a franchise provides over and above those available to the independent start-up business. The signs are that franchising does succeed in reducing failure rates though not by the margins claimed in some of the wilder estimates. At present, 5-6 per cent of franchisees go out of business because of financial difficulties each year, according to Mr Peter Stern, senior franchise manager of National Westminster Bank. This suggests a slightly better success rate than for small businesses generally, 40 per cent of which can expect to survive their first 10 years. Apollo Blinds, a company with one company-managed store and 96 franchised outlets has experienced three failures as a result of the recession. Two were recent recruits to the Apollo franchise with underfunding and 'the quality of the people' factors in their demise, according to Mr James Watson, franchise director at the company. Franchised businesses held up better than managed outlets in the early stages of the present recession, says Mr Brian Smart, director of the British Franchise Association (BFA), representing 136 franchisors. Franchised businesses responded more quickly by increasing their marketing and by cutting costs but those which depend on the public's discretionary spending face tougher times. The franchising industry is more concerned at the pressure which the economic downturn exerts on the recruitment of new franchisees. Fewer people are prepared to take out a large bank loan at a time of high interest rates to launch themselves into business - whether franchised or not. On the plus side, for the franchise industry at least, is the prospect of further increases in unemployment. The present round of job cuts is affecting far more white collar workers than the 1981 recession and these are the people the franchisors are most keen to sign up. 'These people are the ones with business aspirations,' says Mr David Acheson, managing director of Stoy Hayward Franchising Services. As part of a long-term attempt to increase the number of new franchisees the BFA is considering establishing a permanent franchising centre in the London area, backed by three or four provincial outposts, to provide information and advice. At present, the industry markets itself by means of an annual round of conferences and seminars. A further bonus from the recession is that it is persuading some businesses, in the retail sector in particular, to consider franchising as a way of relieving pressure on their finances. However, this defensive approach to franchising cannot be seen as a quick fix. Franchisors must realise they are taking on a long-term commitment to their franchisees, Mr Acheson warns. In spite of the economic problems the franchise industry is confident of continuing growth throughout the 1990s. Mr Stern expects franchised turnover to rise by a further 10-15 per cent in the year ending June 1991 compared with the 11 per cent increase, to Pounds 5.24bn, in the year ended June 1990. The BFA is forecasting further increases to Pounds 12.5bn by 1995. Franchising in the UK comprised 379 franchisors or franchised systems last year (28 per cent up on 1989). They had signed up 18,260 franchisees (10 per cent up) who directly employed 183,600 people (nearly 1 per cent down). The BFA calculates that franchising accounts for 5.5 per cent of the domestic services sector and 1.4 per cent of the retail sector. Franchising is growing faster in the UK than in the US, traditional home of this business formula, though the scale of the industry in the US continues to dwarf that in the UK. Franchised sales in the US are Dollars 759m and account for about one-third of retail turnover. Franchising may only have begun to establish itself in the UK as a significant force in the past 10 years but as a general concept it has a long history. In its most basic form it goes back to the Middle Ages when the sovereign granted barons a franchise to collect taxes in return for services such as the provision of soldiers for an army. The Singer Sewing Machine company franchised out the right to sell and service its equipment to independent operators in the mid-19th century in the US and similar arrangements were adopted by the motor manufacturers and soft drinks bottlers. It was not until the 1950s that franchising was applied as a distinct way of starting up a new business as opposed to merely being a way of distributing an existing product, according to Mr John Stanworth and Mr Brian Smith, authors of the Barclays Guide to Franchising for the Small Business. To distinguish franchising proper from licensing, agency, distribution and tenancy agreements it is usually referred to as business format franchising. The franchisor signs a contract with the franchisee allowing him to use his brand name or trademark and his established method of trading as a way of going into business. The franchisor provides training and marketing support in return for a down-payment for the franchise, a share in turnover or profits, and a commitment to maintain the franchisor's quality standards. The franchisee is frequently required to buy his raw materials from the franchisor. The franchisee benefits by taking on an established product and by being able to call on the expertise of the franchisor. The franchisor, in turn, can expand his business more rapidly because his franchisees are sharing the financial burden. Fast food outlets and instant printing shops are frequently regarded as the most common forms of franchised businesses but in terms of turnover the three largest sectors in the UK are business services (excluding print) with 23 per cent of the total franchising market, home improvements with 13 per cent and property maintenance with 9 per cent. Financial services such as insurance broking and estate agencies have started taking a growing share of the market. The brewers, who have long made use of their system of tied houses are starting to turn to fully fledged franchising. Dairy Crest is starting to convert its milk rounds into franchises while plans are afoot to franchise main post offices and even an ambulance service. The increasing popularity of franchising is dependent in no small part on the efforts of the industry to improve its own standards of control and ethics. Franchising suffered in the 1960s from its association with pyramid selling while the failure in the mid-1980s of Young's Franchise Group (which subsequently went on to trade normally under new owners) dented confidence in the ability of the industry to police itself. Over the past two years the BFA has begun a programme to tighten up on its controls and from this year members will be required to seek re-accreditation annually. Would-be members will have to provide detailed information about their businesses to prove their viability. Mr Smart does not expect this process to lead to members being struck off, though he concedes that one or two may withdraw voluntarily. Some members may have to modify the contracts they present to their franchisees to bring them up to date with the latest European and UK thinking. 'We are not trying to catch people out,' says Mr Smart. 'What we want to do is to promote change.'</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Kessler rules out US cigarette sales ban: FDA says agency is not intent on prohibition Dr David Kessler, the US food and drug commissioner, does not wish to ban cigarette sales even if his agency is empowered to regulate nicotine as a drug, the New York Times reported yesterday. A congressional sub-committee has been attempting to determine whether the tobacco industry should be more closely regulated and the FDA - at the request of anti-smoking groups - has been compiling evidence on the addictive qualities of nicotine and whether tobacco companies manipulated nicotine levels in order to hook smokers. The tobacco industry fears that, if the FDA is given jurisdiction to regulate tobacco based on the addictive nature of nicotine, the agency would move to prohibit cigarette sales, driving US tobacco companies out of business. But sub-committee members and, now, Dr Kessler, have said it is not their intention to prohibit cigarette sales, an action which conjures up images of alcohol prohibition in the US. Responding to a suggestion that the FDA is acting as though prohibition were its only alternative to force Congress to find a compromise that severely limits, but does not ban, cigarette sales, Dr Kessler said: 'We haven't approached it that way.' He added: 'We must investigate seriously the question of whether nicotine is a drug under the law. If we did come to that conclusion. . . the blunt instruments we have at the FDA to deal with the issue. . . are not necessarily the best to find a reasonable final policy.' He said he would like to see regulation focused on preventing people - particularly teenagers - from taking up smoking. The FDA, Congress and the tobacco industry said they could find common ground on this.</p>

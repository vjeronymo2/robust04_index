			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Bond's debts exceed ADollars 700m MR ALAN BOND, the bankrupt Australian entrepreneur, has debts and contingent liabilities of more than ADollars 700m (Pounds 297m) and assets of just over ADollars 1m, according to a statement of his financial affairs filed in the Federal Court yesterday. The statement shows that Mr Bond, former chairman of Bond Corporation Holdings, does not own a home, and is living in an apartment in Cottesloe, Western Australia, for which he pays ADollars 200 a week rent. He lists assets of ADollars 1,000 in cash, ADollars 2,669 in bank deposits and shares, a wristwatch worth ADollars 1,200 and ADollars 1.13m in paintings. Most of the paintings are claimed by the liquidator of Dallhold Investments, Mr Bond's private company. The statement reveals the existence of 11 family trusts, some of which own property in New South Wales and Western Australia. However, Mr Bond says he has received no income from the trusts for two years. Mr Bond says his only income is ADollars 195,000 a year in consultancy fees from two UK companies: Heyside, of Darlington, and Expo Development and Trading, of Jersey. The statement shows Mr Bond paid ADollars 486,441 to lawyers and accountants over the last year as he sought to avoid bankruptcy. He also says he lost ADollars 10,000 in casinos in the last six months. Mr Bond puts his debts and contingent liabilities at ADollars 411.8m, plus damages sought by the liquidator of JN Taylor Holdings, former Bond Corp subsidiary, in relation to alleged mismanagement by Mr Bond and others. The damages sought have been quantified in court papers as in excess of ADollars 300m. Mr Bond disputes many of the claims against him, including the action brought by JN Taylor. He also claims he is owed ADollars 265m, mostly by co-guarantors of an ADollars 256m bank loan to a Dallhold subsidiary. The statement gives a fascinating glimpse into the lifestyle enjoyed by Mr Bond and his family during the boom years of Bond Corp in the late 1980s, when the company controlled assets worth more than ADollars 10bn and Mr Bond's personal wealth was estimated at more than ADollars 100m. Between May 1986 and December 1989, Mr Bond gave his family cash and gifts valued at nearly ADollars 30m, including jewellery worth ADollars 10.7m to his wife Eileen, from whom he is being divorced. Other presents include a watch worth ADollars 26,000 for his son Craig, a ADollars 253,000 bracelet for his daughter Susanne, 32, and a ADollars 69,000 Jaguar car for his daughter Jody, 26. Mr Bond resigned as chairman of Bond Corp in September 1990, two days before the group announced an Australian record loss of ADollars 2.24bn. Bond Corp is being restructured under a debt for equity swap which will reduce Mr Bond's holding from more than 50 per cent to 5 per cent. Most of Bond Corp's assets have been sold.</p>

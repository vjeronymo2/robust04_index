			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Observer: Share timetable Nice to see Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's co-chairman, underlining his confidence in the sickly project by buying 5,000 more shares yesterday. What's more he says he plans to hold them at least a year and then sell them when 'the holding shows me a 50 per cent per annum growth'. Brave words. Sir Alastair paid Pounds 2.30 for the shares and by the close was showing a loss of 7p a share on his latest investment. Timing has never been one of Sir Alastair's strong points.</p>

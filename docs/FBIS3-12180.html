			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The UN Security Council is to resume its debate  of the Hebron massacre this evening. A short while ago in  Jerusalem, Israeli officials were informed that the U.S. will  support a Security Council resolution which expresses regret  over the events in Hebron, and calls on Israel to take all  measures to restore calm to the area. Israeli officials are  said to be pleased with the American position. The PLO has  demanded that the Security Council resolution make an  announcement to send international forces to the territories to  protect Palestinian civilians. The Security Council started  discussing the situation last night. Judy Lessing filed this  report from New York:    [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Lessing] Islamic  countries have given the Council a draft resolution. The United  States has taken the lead in writing a statement. So the two  sides will consult and work out the way the Council will condemn  the massacre. The Council president said the resolution was  fairly mild, the statement has much stronger wording. He said  neither is critical of the Israeli Army, but is of the settlers.  Ambassador Gad Ya'aqobi understands something similar.    [Ya'aqobi] To the best of my knowledge none of the proposals  here is condemning Israel, and we condemned as well the murder,  the act of this lunatic murderer, so there is no proposal to  condemn Israel on this matter.    [Lessing] The PLO has said it was clear settlers should be  disarmed, but Ambassador Ya'aqobi wasn't ready to agree to this  step.    [Ya'aqobi] If you will assure me the total disarming of the  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and the Islamic Jihad, which  killed many settlers and many other Jewish people in Israel  lately, then I will be able to consider this question.    [Lessing] Ambassador Ya'aqobi would prefer to see a  statement calling for quick progress in the PLO-Israel  negotiations, rather than a resolution, because the massacre was  carried out by a single person, and wasn't done by a country or  a people.

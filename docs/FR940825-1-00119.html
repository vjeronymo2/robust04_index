			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Procedures for Review of Tribal Air Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In general, Tribes will be required to comply with the same statutory and regulatory requirements as States for the CAA programs that are submitted to EPA for approval. The main difference is that section 301(d) does not require Tribes to develop CAA programs. Thus, a Tribe may decide to implement only those programs, or even portions of programs, that are most relevant to the air quality situation on its reservation or other lands subject to its jurisdiction. This ``modular approach'' to Tribal CAA program development is discussed further in Part III.C.1 below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, section 301(d)(3) of the Act provides that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [t]he Administrator may promulgate regulations which establish the elements of tribal implementation plans and procedures for approval of tribal implementation plans and portions thereof. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 301(d)(4) provides that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [i]n any case in which the Administrator determines that the treatment of Indian tribes as identical to States is inappropriate or administratively infeasible, the Administrator may provide, by regulation, other means by which the Administrator will directly administer such provisions so as to achieve the appropriate purpose. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Further, as discussed previously, section 301(d)(2) delegates to the Administrator broad discretion in determining those provisions of the Act for which it is appropriate to treat Tribes as States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA interprets these provisions to mean that, both in the case of TIPs and in the case of other Tribal air programs (``TAPs''), where EPA finds that it is not appropriate for the same requirements to apply to Tribes as to States, EPA may modify those requirements by rulemaking. Accordingly, in this rulemaking EPA is proposing to make some changes to the State requirements for Tribal CAA programs. In addition, EPA is proposing to allow a Tribe to demonstrate to EPA that a specific CAA requirement may be inappropriate for that Tribe in light of the circumstances presented in a particular case. These issues are discussed further in Parts III.C.2 and C.3 below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Modular Approach to Tribal Air Programs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because Tribal governments have limited resources, and because Federal funding to support Tribal efforts is also limited, Tribes may decide to implement only certain of the CAA provisions for which EPA has determined it is appropriate to treat Tribes in the same manner as States. In order to provide flexibility and incentive for Tribal governments to assume responsibility for CAA programs, Tribes may submit reasonably severable elements of programs to EPA for approval instead of entire complex programs. However, in order to be approved, any such submittal must meet all applicable minimum Federal requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As one of the first steps in identifying Tribal priorities, EPA encourages Tribes to thoroughly assess their current air quality through emission inventories. Tribes should develop an accurate, comprehensive and current inventory of emissions from all sources of air pollution within the reservation and should project potential future emissions based on likely growth. This will help Tribes estimate the nature and location of air quality problems and, in turn, help prioritize Tribal CAA program development. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Note that EPA has issued detailed guidance on how to conduct emission inventories. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in Part II.B. above, EPA intends to provide Tribal air quality protection when Tribes do not develop such programs. EPA's efforts will take place in a prioritized, phased-in fashion due to limitations on Federal resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Volumes I&hyph;V of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Procedures for Emission Inventory Preparation_Volume I: Emission Inventory Fundamentals, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA&hyph;450/4&hyph;81&hyph;026a, Sept. 1981;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Volume II: Point Sources, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA&hyph;450/4&hyph;81&hyph;026b, Sept. 1981;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Volume III: Area Sources, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA&hyph;450/4&hyph;81&hyph;026c, Sept. 1981;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Volume IV: Mobile Sources,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPA&hyph;450/4&hyph;81&hyph;026d, 1992;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Volume V: Bibliography, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA&hyph;450/4&hyph;81&hyph;026e, Sept. 1981. The Clearinghouse for Inventories and Emission Factors, (919) 541&hyph;5285, has information on obtaining copies of these and other emission inventory guidance documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The results of Tribal emissions inventory assessments and projections regarding future growth will help Tribes to determine whether relatively few or many activities will need to be implemented immediately. Some minor problems may be addressed through public education and basic strategies to control the sources of pollution. Other problems may require some combination of monitoring, modelling and the development of Tribal plans and regulations. If future growth in emissions is projected, Tribes should also consider developing programs for the Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air Quality (``PSD''). See Addendum A, ``Title I'' discussion (overview of the PSD program) and Part III.D.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where the emissions inventory reveals a potential air quality problem, air quality monitoring can help further characterize the potential problem. EPA has issued regulations and guidance on air quality monitoring. EPA's air quality monitoring regulations are set out at 40 CFR part 58. Among other things, Appendices A through G to 40 CFR part 58 describe air quality network design, criteria for citing air quality monitors and quality assurance criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

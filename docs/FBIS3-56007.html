It is not hard to guess  that the purpose of his meetings and talks with the leaders of  the region's states is to explain and publicize as much as  possible the new NATO initiative. Therefore to some extent  Clinton may be regarded as the major lobbyist for the idea of  East-West partnership.    The meetings that the U.S. President has already held on 11  and 12 January with the leaders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia,  Poland, and Hungary -- the countries of the so-called Visegrad  group -- confirm that idea. During the talks with Czech  President Vaclav Havel, Clinton stated that although the program  of partnership does not guarantee the new allies complete  protection from external aggression it does nevertheless offer  the possibility even before the end of this year of joining in  the process of common combat training with the NATO armies and  of participating in joint exercises.    According to information from sources close to the U.S.  President, the aim of Clinton's meetings with Polish President  Lech Walesa, Hungarian President Arpad Goncz, and Slovak  President Michal Kovac is to hold similar talks.    The first impromptu action has occurred during Clinton's  European tour. I am talking about the U.S. President's  unscheduled brief stopover in Kiev and the talks with Leonid  Kravchuk. In Kiev, according to White House press service  spokesmen, the sides are to discuss questions connected with the  Ukrainian President's final resolve to renounce the strategic  nuclear weapons deployed on Ukrainian territory and agree to  their dismantling and shipment to Russia. The U.S. side is  ready to grant $175 million from the Nunn-Lugar fund to finance  this action. Ukraine is also being promised its share of the $1  billion which it is thought will accrue from the sale of  weapons-grade uranium to the West.    Although it is believed in the United States that Ukraine is  simply obliged to do this -- in order to fulfill its own  commitments under international treaties -- Washington is ready  in principle to offer Kiev a number of additional inducements.  Specifically, there is mention of a figure of around $1.8  billion to develop (or more accurately to maintain the viability  of) Ukraine's power industry and achieve at least a minimum  stabilization of its national currency. For the time being,  however, all these are just suggestions.</p>

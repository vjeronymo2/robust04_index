			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by IZVESTIYA military correspondent Viktor Litovkin </F> under the general heading: "Russia Does Not Intend To Create  Military Bases in Latvia. Diplomats Believe Boris Yeltsin Was  Given the Wrong Document To Sign"]    [Text] "All talk of turning our radar station at Skrunde  into a military base is unfounded," I was told by Yelena  Agapova, assistant to the Russian defense minister for relations  with the public and the press.    A few days previously, the Defense Ministry Information and  Press Directorate had refuted an ITAR-TASS report on this  matter. Chief of General Staff Colonel General Mikhail  Kolesnikov did not and could not have told the agency's  correspondent about the transformation of the radar station into  a military base. Russia had and has no such plans.    Nonetheless, statements by Russian Defense Minister Army  General Pavel Grachev have repeatedly mentioned plans for the  creation of 28 military bases outside the country's borders.  Where is it proposed to put them?    The locations of some of them are already known, according  to  the minister's statements at press conferences: In Georgia,  where under an interstate agreement -- which alone can serve as  the legal foundation for such bases -- Russian military bases  are to be located in Akhalkalaki, Batumi, where there are  Russian divisions, Tbilisi (the headquarters of the  Transcaucasus Group of Forces is there), and Poti, where Russian  Navy ships can be stationed in the port zone. The total number  of our troops will not exceed 25,000.    There are also troops of ours in Armenia, in the garrison of  Gyumri (formerly Leninakan). They are also there under an  interstate agreement between Yerevan and Moscow.    The locations of the other military bases are not yet known,  since there are no interstate treaties concerning them. Without  such treaties all talk of such bases, the military department  believes, can only act as a basis for political speculation by  various forces in certain states, as is happening in the case of  the Skrunde radar station.</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Books: A great economist - Can Keynes help from beyond the grave wonders William St Clair JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES VOL 2: THE ECONOMIST AS SAVIOURS 1920-1937 by Robert Skidelsky Macmillan Pounds 20, 751 pages THE SECOND volume of Robert Skidelsky's huge biography of John Maynard Keynes covers the inter-war years. In the first volume, published in 1983, Hopes Betrayed 1883-1920, and now published in paperback at Pounds 12.99, Skidelsky described Keynes's childhood at Eton and Cambridge, his membership of the Bloomsbury group, and his sudden rise to power and fame during and after the First World War. In this volume Keynes is now influential, independent and rich. He has largely forsworn his earlier homosexuality, and, to the astonishment of his friends, he marries a Russian dancer. He slips effortlessly between the worlds of politics, finance and academia, always ready with an opinion and a remedy. He publishes books of astonishing originality and power, and owns a weekly newspaper. Keynes is already a legend, brilliant everyone concedes, one of the cleverest men in England, the greatest economist of the age, perhaps of any age, but is he sound? Still to come in a future volume are his return to the Treasury; financing the war and the reconstruction; and Bretton Woods. Keynes hoarded his papers, sticking them on spikes before storing them in clothes chests. But although Keynes was a great man, not everything he did or said needs to be recorded. Skidelsky successfully sets Keynes in the political and intellectual context of his times, breaking the chronological narrative with occasional thoughtful summaries. His portrait of Keynes is entirely convincing, although a little too protective of the less attractive characteristics. But although he has divided his argument into sub-chapters and appendices, few readers will want all the information offered - the minor journalism, the forgotten colleagues, the hotels he stayed at, the names of his butler's children. Skidelsky rightly concentrates on Keynes the economic thinker. He takes us comprehensively through the arguments and counter-arguments of the time, and discusses the modern commentaries, not neglecting his opportunities to contradict a few colleagues along the way. However he tends to confuse the role of the historical biographer (to analyse and understand what was said, believed, and done in the past), with that of the contemporary economist (to explain the problems of Britain now). Despite the occasional disclaimer he does not give sufficient weight to the differences between Keynes's time from our own. When industrial investment was financed by fixed-interest bonds, and wage-earners and pensioners had no arrangements for uprating their incomes, inflation was more redistributive and more socially disruptive than now - but it was also good for profits. The policy choices of today are at best only partially elucidated by the debates and equations of 1934 even if they were true then. Keynes himself abandoned the idea that economics is a body of knowledge, as distinct from a method of analysis. The questions which the country faced in the 1920s and 1930s are still dismally topical. The ERM fiasco was a re-run of the 1925 return to the gold standard, a more precise case study than history usually provides. Keynes later estimated that the country paid 10 per cent in lost output when the Government deflated a depressed economy with high interest rates in its (fortunately unsuccessful) effort to maintain an inappropriate external parity. In the 1990s the finance markets are again said to be demanding cuts in public expenditure on the grounds that the country does not have the money. 'We do nothing because we do not have the money', Keynes told the Macmillan Committee in 1930, 'but it is precisely because we do not do anything that we do not have the money'. As for cutting real public investment in order to keep down the rate of interest on Government borrowing, that was 'one of the most desperate muddles the human mind has ever entertained. The whole object of having a low rate of interest is in order to do something. But if you think it is wise to stop doing things in order to lower the rate of interest, you are standing upside down.' Skidelsky, recommended for a life peerage by the Social Democratic Party, admires Keynes's attempt to promote a Middle Way, a taming of capitalism without socialism. He also writes confidently of the 'Keynesian Revolution', as if it were a movement which had irreversibly transformed understanding, and he evidently intends no irony in describing Keynes as 'the saviour.' In the long run, Keynes wrote, ideas are more powerful than vested interests. 'Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.' He had in mind his Victorian predecessors who naively believed, against the evidence, that economies tend towards full employment and equilibrium if left to market forces. We will see in next week's Autumn Statement whether the defunct Keynes can help us from beyond the grave.</p>

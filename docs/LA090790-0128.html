			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FBI WON'T PURSUE ATTACK ON GIRL;  </P> <P> INVESTIGATION: AN AGENT SAYS THE AMBER JEFFERSON CASE DOESN'T FALL UNDER THE  BUREAU'S JURISDICTION. A VIGIL FOR AMBER IS PLANNED TODAY IN SANTA ANA.  </P> <P> FBI officials announced Thursday that they have reviewed the case of a  15-year-old Garden Grove cheerleader who was beaten and slashed last month in  what some activists allege was a racially motivated incident and have decided  not to pursue an investigation.  </P> <P> The news dealt a blow to the victim's family, which had been calling for an  independent federal inquiry into the case, alleging that the Orange County  Sheriff's Department had mishandled the investigation.  </P> <P> "Our concern is violations by a police officer acting under color of the law,  but that was not the case here," FBI spokesman Fred Reagan said. "This appeared  to be a matter of mutual combat between private parties."  </P> <P> Amber Jefferson, who has a black father and a white mother, was beaten with a  baseball bat and slashed with a piece of glass outside a Stanton apartment  complex during a brawl Aug. 6 that involved more than a dozen people.  </P> <P> Amber and her friends allege that they were attacked by a group of white men  and teen-agers wielding baseball bats because they were black and Latino. Some  among the white group maintain that the incident was not about race but rather  escalated into a fight between two girls over a boyfriend.  </P> <P> The incident is still being reviewed by the Orange County district attorney's  office.  </P> <P> Reagan said the FBI decided not to pursue the case because it did not fall  within its jurisdiction.  </P> <P> "The facts of the matter have been studied in some detail and the determination  has been made that there was no apparent violation of federal law within FBI  jurisdiction," he said. That jurisdiction includes the federal civil rights  laws.  </P> <P> Amber's attorney, Carol Sobel, could not be reached for comment on the FBI's  findings.  </P> <P> The FBI announcement came as a demonstration was being held by the victim's  family and supporters aimed at turning up public pressure on Orange County  authorities. Gathered on the steps of the U.S. District Court building, a  coalition of civil rights groups and Hollywood celebrities repeated their  demand that arrests be made in the attack on the 15-year-old.  </P> <P> Echoing statements made at a news conference held last week in Yorba Linda,  organizers criticized the Orange County Sheriff's Department's handling of the  case. To further press that point, community groups from Los Angeles and Orange  counties have organized a candlelight vigil for 4 p.m. today near the Sheriffs'  Department headquarters in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Amber, who attended the news conference on the steps of the court building in  Los Angeles, suffered a broken jaw and an inch-wide gash running down the side  of her face.  </P> <P> When asked by reporters what she wanted to see done, she replied "justice." She  then broke into tears.  </P> <P> Mark Ridley-Thomas, executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said his group may ask the U.S.  Justice Department to intervene if Orange County prosecutors fail to file  charges in the case. Ridley-Thomas and other community leaders contend that the  Sheriff's Department has failed to aggressively pursue the case because of the  victim's race.  </P> <P> "We feel that had the makeup of the victims and the perpetrators been  different, the Sheriff's Department would have come out with a different  report," Ridley-Thomas said.  </P> <P> Besides the SCLC, other organizations attending the press conference were the  American Civil Liberties Union, Multiracial Americans of Southern California  and the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith.  </P> <P> Actress Irene Cara and Joe Morton, who plays a prosecutor in the television  series "Equal Justice," also turned out to lend their support to Amber and her  family.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department presented the results of their investigation to the  district attorney's office last week with the recommendation that charges be  filed against 12 people on both sides. Recommended charges against five of  Amber's friends range from fighting to assault with a deadly weapon;  recommended charges against seven people in the other group include fighting,  assault with a deadly weapon and participating in a hate crime.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department issued a statement Thursday saying that its  investigation was "thorough and comprehensive." Sheriff's Lt. Richard J. Olson  said the department is willing to cooperate with any government agency that may  ask to review the incident.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Orange County district attorney's office said  before the FBI announcement that his office is proceeding with its  investigation.  </P> <P> "If the feds want to look into it, fine," Assistant Dist. Atty. John Conley  said. "What is ironic is that people are criticizing our alleged lack of  activity without ever having talked to us."  </P></p>

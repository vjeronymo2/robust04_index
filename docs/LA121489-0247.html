			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAPANESE STEEL EXPORTS SLIP  </P> <P> Japan's steel exports in 1989 are likely to fall below 20 million tons for the  first time in 19 years, the top official of the Japanese steel industry  predicted today.  </P> <P> Hiroshi Saito, president of the Japan Iron and Steel Federation and chairman of  Nippon Steel Corp., cited sluggish exports to China following the events in  Tian An Men Square last June as one of the major factors.  </P> <P> He also said brisk domestic demand has compelled Japanese steel makers to  refrain from exports, which bring them a slimmer profit margin than domestic  sales.  </P> <P> Japan's steel exports in 1988 totaled 23.65 million tons.  </P></p>

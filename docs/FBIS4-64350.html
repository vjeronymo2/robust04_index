			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "West German Economic Situation </F> Undergoes Broad Improvement"]    [Text] For the first time in 20 months, the HANDELSBLATT  economic trend indicator for May suggests positive economic  growth. It also reveals a 0.2 percent improvement against April.  In April, the indicator displayed a 0.1 percent fall in  economic growth, a decrease of 0.3 points. Compared with May  1993, economic growth was 1.4 points higher.    This latest development permits the conclusion that the west  German economy has overcome the recession and will embark upon a  path of growth in the summer. If the positive trend of the past  few months continues, a 1.5 percent increase in the GNP should  be achieved in 1994.    May also appears a good month regarding the extent of the  signs of improvement. All six individual growth figures given  in the indicator have improved, most of them considerably.    The structure of interest rates has again normalized  following an uninterrupted fall since December 1990. In March,  capital market interest rates were 0.36 percent points higher  than short-term rates for three-month money deposits.    After boosting exports in previous months, the positive  economic signals now seem to be boosting domestic demand. In  February, the processing industry registered a 2.3 percent  increase in demand against January.    In January, the construction industry enjoyed a veritable  leap in demand as orders increased by over 10 percent compared  with December, which in itself was quite a good month.    Retail trade turnover, always a reliable indicator of  private  consumption in recent months, in February saw a 1-percent growth  against January.    In the meantime, the traffic lights of exports have settled  on green. In February, foreign orders for the processing  industries increased by 3.8 percent against January.    The Institute for Economic Research's exports surveys for  enterprises are becoming increasingly optimistic. In March, the  number of enterprises expecting further improvement over the  next three months leapt from 14.2 percent in February to 15.6  percent. The business climate in the processing industry also  improved from minus 18.7 percent in February to minus 12.5  percent in March.</p>

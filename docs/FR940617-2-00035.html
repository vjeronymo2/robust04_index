			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> 11.2&blank;Acquisition of Implementations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Conformance to FIPS for PHIGS is required whether PHIGS toolbox packages are developed internally, acquired as part of an ADP system procurement, acquired by separate procurement, used under an ADP leasing arrangement, or specified for use in contracts for programming services. Recommended terminology for procurement of FIPS for PHIGS is contained in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. General Services Administration publication Federal ADP &amp; Telecommunications Standards Index <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , chapter 4 part 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> 11.3&blank;Interpretation of this FIPS. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  NIST provides for the resolution of questions regarding FIPS for PHIGS specifications and requirements, and issues official interpretations as needed. Procedures for interpretations are specified in FIPS PUB 29&hyph;3. All questions about the interpretation of FIPS for PHIGS should be addressed to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL), ATTN: PHIGS Interpretation, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, Telephone: (301) 975&hyph;3265. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> 11.4&blank;Validation of PHIGS Implementations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Implementations of FIPS for PHIGS using either FORTRAN or C bindings shall be validated in accordance with NIST Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) validation procedures for FIPS for PHIGS. Recommended procurement terminology for validation of FIPS for PHIGS is contained in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. General Services Administration publication Federal ADP &amp; Telecommunications Standards Index <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , Chapter 4 Part 2. This GSA publication provides terminology for three validation options: Delayed Validation, Prior Validation Testing and Prior Validation. The agency shall select the appropriate validation option. The agency is advised to refer to the NIST publication  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Validated Products List <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  for information about the validation status of PHIGS products. This information may be used to specify validation time frames that are not unduly restrictive of competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency shall specify the criteria used to determine whether a Validation Summary Report (VSR) or Certificate is applicable to the hardware/software environment of the PHIGS implementation offered. The criteria for applicability of a VSR or Certificate should be appropriate to the size and timing of the procurement. A large procurement may require that the offered version/release of the PHIGS implementation shall be validated in a specified hardware/software environment and that the validation shall be conducted with specified hardware/software features or parameter settings; e.g., the sema parameter settings to be used in a performance benchmark. An agency with a single-license procurement may review the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Validated Products List <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  to determine the applicability of existing VSRs or Certificates to the agency's hardware/software environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PHIGS implementations using either FORTRAN or C bindings shall be validated using the NIST PHIGS Test Suite, a suite of automated validation tests for PHIGS implementations. The NIST PHIGS Test Suite was first released in July 1990 to help users and vendors determine compliance with FIPS for PHIGS. The most recent version of the test suite will be used for validating conformance of PHIGS implementations after the effective date of FIPS PUB 153&hyph;1. The results of validation testing by the PHIGS Testing Service are published on a quarterly basis in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Validated Products List <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , available from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS). See related documents section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each release of the test suite has provided additional language bindings and test cases to increase the test suite's coverage of PHIGS functionality. Version 2.1 of the NIST PHIGS Test Suite, released in April 1994, provides testing for PHIGS implementations using either the FORTRAN or C language binding. Version 2.1 does not include tests for the functionality of PHIGS PLUS added by this revision of FIPS for PHIGS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A PHIGS Test Suite license includes all of the tests described above, documentation, and automatic notifications of approved changes to the PHIGS Test Suite for a six month period. A license for the most recent version of the PHIGS Test Suite is a necessary requirement for an organization that desires to be tested by the NIST PHIGS Testing Service after the effective date of FIPS 153&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current information about the NIST PHIGS Validation Service and validation procedures for FIPS for PHIGS is available from: National Institute of Standards and Technology, Computer Systems Laboratory, Graphics Software Group, Building 225, room A266, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, (302) 975&hyph;3265. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> 12. Waivers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate such authority only to a senior official designated pursuant to section 3506(b) of Title 44, United States Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Waivers shall be granted only when: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal computer system, or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Governmentwide savings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also act without a written waiver request when they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot be met. Agency heads may approve waivers only by a written decision which explains the basis upon which the agency head made the required finding(s). A copy of each such decision, with procurement sensitive or classified portions clearly identified, shall be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology; ATTN: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building, room B&hyph;154; Gaithersburg, MD 20899. In addition notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of authority to approve waivers shall be sent promptly to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

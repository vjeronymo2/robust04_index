			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rank deadline Shares in Rank Organisation proceeded to gather pace in advance of the closure of the BZW strike price auction for shares - worth Pounds 25m - which the broker has agreed to acquire under its cash offer in respect of Rank's enhanced share alternative. Rank announced on Monday that 94 per cent of shareholders had accepted an enhanced share alternative to the 1993 interim dividend of 31p, saving Pounds 90m in cash and Pounds 26m in advance taxes. But holders of 18 per cent of those not accepting the share alternative had subsequently accepted the cash option offered by BZW. Analysts said other marketmakers had marked the Rank share price higher in the knowledge that BZW was buying the stock, but that the price was likely to come off as the broker sold the stock into the market after today's deadline. Rank closed 15 up at 789p.</p>

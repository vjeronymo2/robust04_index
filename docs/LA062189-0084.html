			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> A BIT MUCH;  </P> <P> IMMENSE, ORNATE NEW CIVIC CENTER BLOSSOMING IN BEVERLY HILLS  </P> <P> It's bigger than Union Station, bigger than the Sports Arena and when its  pieces are added up, it's bigger than almost every other public building in  Southern California. What is it? A hint: The parking structure can hold as many  as 553 Mercedes-Benz convertibles.  </P> <P> Yes, it's the new Beverly Hills Civic Center, now taking shape over 10 acres  and spanning Rexford Drive, at a cost of $83 million. Even Mayor Max Salter  says the structure is, well, a bit much.  </P> <P> "There's no question in my mind that it is overbuilt somewhat," Salter said.  "But as against piddling around for another 20 years until you've finally  decided on something, I'd opt for what we have. Quality is remembered long  after cost is forgotten, and that's what people should remember."  </P> <P> Made up of city offices, a library, a firehouse, a police station, a jail and  parking facilities, the complex totals nearly 600,000 square feet. By  comparison, there is 507,715 square feet of usable floor area in Los Angeles  City Hall.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Long in Coming  </P> <P> The new civic center has been long in coming. There was a ground-breaking  ceremony in 1985, and the project was originally scheduled for completion in  1987. It was held up for redesign after a theater and a cafeteria were dropped  to save money, and delayed again after the discovery of asbestos in the walls  of the existing library building.  </P> <P> Some of the work is finished: The parking structure and the fire station,  complete with two shiny brass poles, have been in business for two years.  </P> <P> But the police station, library and a pedestrian bridge over Rexford Drive are  still under construction, and work is also under way at the 58-year-old City  Hall, a Mexican baroque landmark that sticks out above the low-rises on Santa  Monica Boulevard.  </P> <P> Salter said he is determined to move into his new office by December.  </P> <P> "Every day I take out the whip and give them a few lashes here and there," he  joked. "We're going to have a sensational City Hall when it's all completed,  and it's going to serve the people for the next 100 years."  </P> <P> Inside the old City Hall building, which also housed a courthouse, police  station and morgue when it opened in 1931, the City Council chamber has been  expanded by removing a small room that was once used for study sessions.  </P> <P> Craftsmen from A. T. Heinsbergen &amp; Co., the same firm that created the  elaborate ceiling in 1931, are about to restore the gilded paint job and  duplicate its floral motif in the extension and in the old courtroom down the  hall, where it was hidden for decades by a false ceiling.  </P> <P> The City Council chamber, which once seated 80, will now have room for 130.  Two-way audio-visual links with other meeting rooms will enable as many as 400  people to take part in debates.  </P> <P> Workers are about to restore the colorful tile work and reapply gold leaf to a  knob atop the cupola of the eight-story tower, but A. T. Heinsbergen, son of  the man who did the original job, said he wanted no part of that assignment.  </P> <P> The gold work is especially tricky, he said. The gold leaf is just one  two-thousandth of an inch thick and can easily blow away. The glue that holds  it on has to be applied the night before and it can be too sticky or too dry,  depending on the humidity, he said.  </P> <P> "They didn't ask me to do it and if they did I wouldn't have, because my dad  told me he lost his shirt on it in 1931," Heinsbergen said. Another contractor,  Pacific Coast Painting, has taken on the job.  </P> <P> Building codes were considerably less stringent when the old City Hall was  built, but tests have shown it to be structurally sound, said John Hartsock,  the consultant who is managing the construction project for the city.  </P> <P> The architectural details -- leaves, flowers and other delicate forms cast into  concrete from hand-carved wooden molds -- were also a testimony to the  workmanship of those days, he said.  </P> <P> But the building's interior walls, made of hollow clay tiles for fire safety,  had to go for fear they might collapse in an earthquake.  </P> <P> Across Rexford Drive, the new police station, complete with the latest in  communications equipment, full-scale locker rooms for officers of both sexes,  10,000 square feet for evidence storage, 35 individual jail cells and a firing  range in the basement, will finally match the image of the Beverly Hills cop  shop depicted in the movies.  </P> <P> "From our perspective, the talk about this thing being too large doesn't hold  water," said Police Capt. Bill Hunt. "We were so cramped (before) that it  definitely impacted our ability to provide service."  </P> <P> City officials are just as proud of the library, which has been gutted and  revamped to make way for video facilities, an electronic book retrieval system  and a two-story-high reading room illuminated by skylights.  </P> <P> "If you remember the old library and its cramped quarters, this will be what  the public sees the most, and it'll be a show-stopper," said Howard Rattner,  city economic development manager.  </P> <P> Architect Charles Moore used three oval courtyards to link the two city blocks  that make up the Civic Center.  </P> <P> The palm-lined courtyards are strung together on a diagonal line, with traffic  flowing through a central ellipse on Rexford Drive. The two smaller ovals will  be for pedestrians.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Wonderful Solution'  </P> <P> "I thought that was a particularly wonderful solution to what seemed to be an  intractable problem," said Eugene J. Johnson, a professor of art at Williams  College in Williamstown, Mass., who has written about Moore's work.  </P> <P> Moore, a professor at the University of Texas and at UCLA who is involved on  other projects in cities from Santa Fe, N.M., to Eugene, Ore., was not  available for an interview, but one of his associates acknowledged the debt to  an Italian master.  </P> <P> "Borromini is an Italian baroque architect whose work Charles (Moore) is very  fond of," said Stephen Harby,c) Moore's design manager for the Beverly Hills  project.  </P> <P> Moore's vision of a Civic Center was picked from a field of six finalists in a  competition in 1982.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Faithful to Vision  </P> <P> Frank Dimster, a professor of architecture at USC, acknowledged that Moore was  faithful to the vision of the original builders, but asked, "Is it still  appropriate to do so in today's context?"  </P> <P> "What I'm trying to raise is, if that display of values for a city hall is an  appropriate one," he said. "In some ways, to have a building that is very  ornate and very opulent, you could structure an argument that it might not be  the best display of service to the community."  </P></p>

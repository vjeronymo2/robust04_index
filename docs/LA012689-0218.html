			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> U.S. OKS SOVIET WHEAT PURCHASES  </P> <P> The United States has given the go-ahead to the Soviet Union for buying more  U.S. grain this year, including subsidized wheat, raising the possibility that  total sales might exceed the record level of four years ago.  </P> <P> Agriculture Department officials said Wednesday that the Soviets have been  cleared to buy up to 20 million metric tons of grain in 1988-89, up from the 16  million tons specified earlier. Purchases already total more than 12 million  tons.  </P> <P> The department also said the Soviets have bought an additional 150,000 tons of  soybean meal, which has a potential current market value of about $36 million.  </P> <P> Under a long-term grain agreement, the Soviet Union was originally limited to  12 million tons of U.S. grain a year without further consultations with  Washington, but that was increased to 16 million tons Dec. 23. The agreement  had expired last Sept. 30 but was later extended.  </P></p>

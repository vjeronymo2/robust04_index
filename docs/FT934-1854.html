			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Bundesbank plans 30-year issue The Bundesbank will set the terms for a new 30-year government bond offering, its first for eight years, on December 28. The central bank said other 30-year issues would follow and a 30-year issue for the Treuhand, the German privatisation agency, is planned for March. The move signified a determination to make use of the long end of the German yield curve on a regular basis. 'There will be more of these. The Bundesbank is committed to use this segment of the market in a routine way,' it said. Following the announcement, the Deutsche Terminborse, Germany's futures exchange, said it will launch a new futures contract based on 15 to 30-year Treuhand bonds and Bunds in late February or early March next year. The DTB said the decision was based on the Bundesbank's commitment to create a liquid market in long-dated Bunds. 'If there is a liquid underlying market, then we should offer a product,' it said. The Bundesbank described the two moves as 'a concerted action', designed to strengthen the attractions of Finanzplatz Deutschland, Germany as a financial centre. It described the new issue as a response to demand from German and international investors. However, dealers said that the existing 2016 bund underperformed the market yesterday. Its yield spread over the 10-year bund has widened from 42 basis points last week to about 50 points. 'There is no sign of clients queueing up for a very long-dated issue,' said one trader. A European bond analyst said: 'We heard rumours that the 30-year issue would be launched at a spread of 50bp over 10-year bunds but that would be very tight. We think it is more likely to be 60 - 65bp over the 10-year as this would be in line with spreads in France and Holland.' The DTB contract, provisionally named the Buxl (Bund extra-long) future, will have a notional 6 per cent coupon. The DTB already lists Bund (long-term) and Bobl (medium-term) futures, and will launch a Fibor (short-term German interest rate) contract on March 18, allowing DTB members to trade the entire German yield curve. An official at Liffe, the DTB's arch-rival for market share in German interest rate products, said it was 'too early to consider' launching a 30-year Bund contract.</p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: BEVERLY HILLS;  </P> <P> FUND-RAISER FOR EXODUS  </P> <P> Home meetings in the Beverly Hills-West Los Angeles area have raised more than  $2 million toward Operation Exodus, the Jewish community's fund-raising drive  to help emigrants from the Soviet Union, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> Richard Gunther, co-chair of the local campaign, said Los Angeles-area donors  have come up with almost $22 million toward a goal of $36 million.  </P> <P> "The home parlor meetings have been so successful because individual  contributors recognize the peril of the Soviet Jews and are responding in a  heartfelt way," Gunther said.  </P> <P> Funds raised help pay for transportation from the Soviet Union, housing, job  training, language classes and other relocation expenses.  </P></p>

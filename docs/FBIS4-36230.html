			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F> Hayim Zissowitz; place not given -- live]    [Text] [Zissowitz] Good morning, Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres.    [Peres] Good morning.    [Zissowitz] Why did you conceal the existence of this  letter?    [Peres] Excuse me, why do you say that I concealed anything?    [Zissowitz] In any event, you did not reveal it.    [Peres] Excuse me, I would like to explain things first. In  a speech in Johannesburg, 'Arafat said he had received a letter  from us in Cairo containing a commitment regarding Jerusalem.  Utter nonsense! To begin with, he did not receive any letter  from us in Cairo with regard to Jerusalem. What is more, he did  not receive any letter whatsoever from us.    Second, the letter was sent to Norwegian Foreign Minister  Holst after the agreement was signed, and, in my opinion, its  contents are identical to what I said in the Knesset. In my  opinion, this is an attempt to concoct a totally unfounded  slander. I would like to read to you an excerpt of my remarks  in the Knesset: to uphold its cultural heritage and its social,  religious, and other institutions -- that is what I said in the  Knesset. I also said that coexistence in Jerusalem is a matter  of mutual respect between all the residents and the normal  functioning of the relevant institutions and systems -- I repeat  -- the relevant institutions and systems. My letter does not  contain any commitment regarding Orient House or any PLO  institutions. The papers write that Peres agreed to Orient  House. Where did I agree to Orient House? If Orient House  existed during the Likud's tenure and it is legal, then this can  be put in writing. If it is illegal, then it can be closed down  today. This entire attempt to slander and attribute things that  are totally unfounded.... [pauses] The truth is that Holst was  involved in the negotiations. I think that what we did this  year on the issue of Jerusalem is unprecedented in the history  of the State of Israel. On the one hand, we reached an  agreement....[pauses] One must look at the whole picture.  Again, what we are witnessing here borders on character  assassination.    [Zissowitz] Perhaps this could have been averted if you had  made the letter public, perhaps....    [Peres, interrupting] Excuse me, hold on a second. We  reached an agreement this year with the Vatican in Jerusalem --  in Jerusalem as it is: united, under Israeli sovereignty. This  year, for the first time, we set Jerusalem aside from the  autonomy. True, we promised to uphold the status quo, but the  status quo existed even without the letter.    [Zissowitz] With your permission, Mr. Foreign Minister, we  will soon touch upon the status of Jerusalem and your position  on the issue, but first I would like to ask you: Why did you  fail to make the existence of the letter public for eight  months, even after Yasir 'Arafat announced the existence of such  a letter?    [Peres] I may have been wrong from a journalistic point of  view, but I do not act according to journalistic considerations  alone. I cannot start making public correspondence with fellow  ministers without asking them first....    [Zissowitz, interrupting] But you wrote the letter.    [Peres] Wait a minute; you asked me a question, and I will  answer you. I returned to Israel the evening of Friday, 3 June,  shortly before the beginning of the Sabbath. The issue began  unfolding on Saturday, and I had been abroad for two weeks.  Sunday is a day off abroad, and on Monday I coordinated matters  with the person I thought I should. I had no reason to conceal  the letter. The letter is not stamped top secret, confidential,  or anything of the sort. Whoever reads the letter and reads it  in good faith, without trying to slander, smear, humiliate, or  degrade -- as people in our midst tend to do these days -- will  see that it does not contain anything other than a reference to  the existing situation in Jerusalem.    [Zissowitz] In retrospect, when you read the papers this  morning and see that even commentators who usually support you  are writing that your credibility has been tainted, do you not  think you made a mistake?    [Peres] No. It is very easy for them to talk. Why not?  After all, they were not the ones who conducted the  negotiations. You cannot attribute all the negative things to  me. Who achieved all the positive things? When you look at the  entire picture of the negotiations and what happened to  Jerusalem, I believe that Jerusalem received an unprecedented  international boost, both from Christians and Muslims.    [Zissowitz] You sent a distinguished cabinet minister like  Moshe Shahal to the Knesset podium to declare that those who  claim they are in the possession of such a letter...[pauses]  that the whole letter is merely the figment of a wild  imagination.    [Peres] Which letter?    [Zissowitz] The same letter that Yasir 'Arafat claimed he  had in his possession.    [Peres] No, excuse me, we are not talking about the same  letter. My dear friend, please be accurate. I was not in  Israel when Minister Shahal made the speech. He did not ask me,  and I did not send him to the Knesset. Shahal was asked about a  letter to 'Arafat, and no such letter exists. To repeat, all  the stories that 'Arafat took part in the formulation of the  letter or that he insisted that the word Christians appear  before the word Muslims are the figment of a wild imagination.  It makes absolutely no sense! All these are fanciful stories.    In his speech in the Knesset, Moshe Shahal referred to  'Arafat's speech in Johannesburg. What did 'Arafat try to do in  Johannesburg? He alleged that he had received a letter from us  in Cairo -- and he did not receive a letter from us in Cairo --  and that the letter contained some promises about Jerusalem --  and these do not exist in reality; there are no such promises.  In my opinion, Shahal's denial really and truly corresponded to  the situation.    We left the status quo unchanged. Why did we do that? In  order not to change it for the worse. Why did we agree to  Jericho? So that the relevant institutions could be located in  Jericho.    [Zissowitz] Let us talk about the relevant institutions,  which, as you said in your letter, are very important. If the  Palestinians really choose to conduct all the activities  pertaining to the autonomy from Orient House....    [Peres, interrupting] They have no permission to do that.    [Zissowitz] Will the status of this building also be upheld  in such an event?    [Peres] Which building?    [Zissowitz] Orient House.    [Peres] Where does it say Orient House?    [Zissowitz] It says other institutions.    [Peres] Who says Orient House has been recognized? Listen,  it is either one of two things: If it is legitimate and existed  during the Likud's tenure, then it will continue to exist in the  future. If it is not legitimate, then it must be closed down.  This letter does not give any legitimization whatsoever to  something that is illegitimate.    [Zissowitz] I would like you to clarify this point. If the  Palestinians conduct their autonomy affairs from Orient House....    [Peres, interrupting] We will close the place down. This  would be in contravention of the agreement. Jerusalem is  outside the autonomy agreement. It does not contain any  permission whatsoever....[pauses] This whole thing looks like a  bunch of Indians dancing around an imaginary bonfire. The whole  purpose of the letter was to clarify that the autonomy  institutions would be located in Jericho and that whatever  existed in Jerusalem prior to the autonomy -- not during the  autonomy -- would remain unchanged.    [Zissowitz] Generally speaking, will you agree to any  compromise with the Palestinians with regard to the status of  the Palestinian institutions operating in the city and the  status of Jerusalem when these issues are discussed in the  negotiations on the permanent arrangement?    [Peres] No, there will be no compromise where matters of  government are concerned. My mind is made up, and I will not  change it. All those who attack me are actually weakening  Jerusalem; you know, in a bid to lash out at the government,  they are weakening Jerusalem. My position is clear-cut and  unequivocal: Jerusalem and no other city is the capital of  Israel. Jerusalem will not be Berlin and will not be divided in  two; it will remain a united city under Israeli sovereignty. I  have said on more than one occasion, and I will repeat it now:  Jerusalem is closed politically but open from the religious  point of view.    Seeing that we are talking seriously, let me tell you  something else. At times, a more relaxed and smarter style  saves me arguments. What does the letter contain, after all? A  promise to uphold the status quo. It contains no reference  whatsoever to Orient House. I believe Orient House is Faysal  al-Husayni's property. There were times when it was open and  times when it was closed down. The letter does not contain any  commitment whatsoever either to open it or to close it down.    [Zissowitz] Are there any other letters appended to the  agreement?    [Peres] Not that I know of. I reiterate, all these alleged  lies are totally unfounded. What lies? Did we send even one  letter to 'Arafat? Was this letter sent before the agreement?  Was it part of the agreement? And even after you read it, what  does it contain? Only a reference to the existing situation, and  that is all.    [Zissowitz] Finally, Foreign Minister Peres, did you  mishandle the entire issue?    [Peres] No, I did not. I know some issues are bound to  cause anger and aggravation, but I am determined. I think we  have scored huge achievements. I think all we have done  surpasses what the Likud had committed itself to many times  over. I would like to tell you that if any forgery was ever  committed, it was when the Likud signed an agreement citing the  words Palestinian people [previous two words in English] and  translated it into Hebrew as the Arabs of Eretz Yisra'el. At  the time, everybody kept mum about it. Any schoolchild will  tell you that Palestinian people [previous two words in English]  means the Palestinian people.    [Zissowitz] But this is altogether a different issue.    [Peres] That is right. Nevertheless, we said we did not  give a letter to 'Arafat, and we did not give a letter to  'Arafat. There has been no change in the status and the  situation of Jerusalem as it existed until the autonomy. There  has been no such change.    [Zissowitz] Thank you very much, Foreign Minister Peres.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 7 June carries  a similar live telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres by Mikha Friedman and Ya'el Dan. Asked what was the  reason for sending such a letter a few days after the agreement  was signed in Oslo, Peres replies: "The answer is quite clear.  On the eve of the signing of the agreement in Oslo, a deep  crisis emerged between us and the Palestinians which almost blew  up the entire negotiations, because they wanted the autonomy  institutions to be outside Jericho -- say, in Jerusalem. We  said that they must be located only in Jericho and nowhere else  or else there will be no agreement. They said: What about  existing institutions, such as hospitals and schools? I said:  We will not change the existing situation in Jerusalem. Holst  asked me whether I would be prepared to put this in writing some  day, and I replied: Yes, I have no problem with that. That is  the whole story."    [Asked whether the future of Jerusalem will be discussed in  the framework of the negotiations on the permanent arrangement  or on the autonomy, the foreign minister replies: "In the  framework of the permanent arrangement."    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 7 June  carries a summary of the interview with Foreign Minister Peres,  adding that "correspondent Moti Amir points out that the text of  the letter the Palestinians have in their possession is dated 9  September, more than one month before the date written on  Foreign Minister Peres' letter to Norwegian Foreign Minister  Holst."]</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Waging war THE BRITISH government's employment green paper, designed to curb the power of an already enfeebled trade union movement, seemed a hangover from the Thatcherite 1980s when it was first published last year. But now, after nine quarters of recession and with the abolition of the wages councils tacked on, the employment bill looks even more anachronistic. The bill may still make good politics, providing Tory backbenchers with some light relief from seeing the finances of trade unions put under pressure. And there are elements of the bill which make good sense, in particular the strengthening of the rights of individual trade union members. Yet in deciding now to abolish the wages councils the government is taking a risk. Attempting to reduce the wages of low-paid workers, at time of depressed confidence, rising unemployment, and with the public sense of injustice already aroused by the miners debacle, is not the most politic of actions. In any case, the evidence does not suggest that the low levels set by the wages councils have a significant negative employment effect, as the government claims. By contrast, Labour's relatively high national minimum wage would certainly have cost jobs. There is, in fact, a case for a system of low but flexible wage floors as a way of preventing unscrupulous employers from paying below market wages. The main weakness of the current system is that, since 1986, the industry minima have been set nationally rather than regionally. Abolishing them now, in the current depressed economic climate, is likely to do little more than reduce the wages of some low-paid workers, while increasing the amount of family credit paid to those low-income households that are adversely affected. This government is showing again a rare taste for the wrong battles. Yes, the UK faces great labour market challenges which require political leadership. But trade union power and the wages of the low paid are low down the list of problems. The government needs to devise strategies which can reduce unemployment while keeping the real wage growth of above-average earners under control when recovery comes. So far, on these issues the government has had little to say and less to offer.</p>

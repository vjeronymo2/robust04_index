			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CHARGES AGAINST BOTHA ARE QUITE BEASTLY  </P> <P> An opposition member of Parliament has called on President Pieter W. Botha to  resign over alleged illegal use of a police vehicle to transport dead antelope  after a hunt.  </P> <P> Fanie Jacobs, told a news conference Monday that the carcasses of eight bucks,  a cow and two wildebeest, all clearly labeled "State President P.W. Botha,"  were found during a routine check on a truck at a roadblock last week.  </P> <P> Jacobs, from the ultra-rightist Conservative Party, said the truck was a police  vehicle with false plates and that its insignia was deliberately concealed. The  driver did not have the written authorization required to transport dead meat,  he added.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the president's office confirmed that Botha was on a hunt at a  game farm last week but denied any wrongdoing in transporting the kill.  </P></p>

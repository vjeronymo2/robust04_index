"Once I am, motivation will  return and then I will start playing again."  </P> <P> Martin Strelba of Czechoslovakia upset top-seeded Stefan Edberg of Sweden, 6-4,  6-1, in the BMW Open at Munich, West Germany.  </P> <P> In other matches, fourth-seeded Jim Courier beat Bruno Oresar of Yugoslavia,  6-2, 6-1, and Thomas Muster of Austria defeated Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden,  7-5, 6-2.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Steffi Graf routed Nicole Provis of Australia, 6-0, 6-2, in the  third round of the Citizen Cup at Hamburg, West Germany.  </P> <P> In second-round matches, second-seeded Martina Navratilova defeated Rachel  McQuillan of Australia, 3-6, 6-1, 6-1, and third-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario  of Spain defeated Barbara Rittner of West Germany, 6-4, 6-1.  </P></p>

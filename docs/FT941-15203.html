			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Peace overture in S Africa South Africa's radical black Pan-Africanist Congress, blamed by police for numerous attacks against whites in recent months, said yesterday it was suspending its armed struggle and had begun telling guerrillas to disarm. 'We announce a unilateral moratorium on the armed struggle,' PAC president Clarence Makwetu said. This was welcomed by Mr Hernus Kriel, law and order minister But it is unclear whether the suspension will lead to a substantial drop in attacks against whites. Leaders of the movement's armed wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army, have been carrying out such attacks without seeking approval from, or even informing, PAC political leaders. The new move seemed to pave the way for PAC participation in the election on April 27. Mr Makwethu said the aim was to show the PAC's 'commitment to peace, which is essential to ensure free and fair elections'. An opinion poll in the Johannesburg Sunday Times yesterday showed PAC support at a negligible 1.7 per cent - below the threshold required to gain a seat in parliament. The poll also showed the African National Congress would win nearly two-thirds of the vote if elections were held now, the second poll in a week to predict such a large ANC victory. The ANC, with a two-thirds majority in parliament, would be able to amend clauses of the new constitution without support from any other party. The ruling National party had 15.8 per cent in the Sunday Times poll and the Inkatha Freedom party 5.2 per cent.</p>

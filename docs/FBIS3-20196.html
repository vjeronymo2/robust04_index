			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Gloomy Forecasts for the Airbus"] </F>   [Text] The Daimler-Benz subsidiary German Aerospace (Dasa)  is in a worse state than had been thought until now. Two years  ago, in drawing up their medium-term financial plans, Dasa  managers assumed that their German Airbus subsidiary would  deliver about 215 aircraft a year. A year ago, they had to  adjust their forecast to about 180 aircraft a year -- according  to their latest internal calculations, Airbus can only sell 120  aircraft this year and next year. As a result, almost 3,000  jobs are to be shed by the end of next year. From 1996 onward,  Dasa managers expect Airbus sales to improve: If their  calculations are wrong once again, there is a danger that more  jobs will be lost.</p>

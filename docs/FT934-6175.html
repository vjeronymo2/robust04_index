			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / US gives warning over foreign interests in Cuba Prospective foreign investors in Cuba have been warned by the US and by at least one company whose assets were seized by the Cuban government that they could face legal problems if they invest in nationalised property. This follows recent Cuban statements that its efforts to attract foreign investors to several sectors of the state-controlled economy are succeeding. Jamaica's economic development agency has told the island's hoteliers that the US government has suggested that they proceed with caution in investing in Cuban resort properties, as many of these could be the subject of legal proceedings in the future. Bacardi, the world's largest rum producer, said on Wednesday that potential investors in Cuba faced legal risks if they became involved in confiscated property, including three breweries and a distillery which were seized from it by the government. The US State Department said it sent warnings periodically through government agencies in countries from which investments in Cuba are being made. Jamaican hoteliers have invested in Cuban properties. 'These notices have been sent not only to Caribbean countries, but also mainly to Europe, Canada and Latin America,' said an official. 'We cannot tell people not to invest in Cuba, but we are warning them that when the political and economic situation in Cuba changes, the real owners of the property will either want to recover their assets or will want what could be a significant compensation. Some will want both.' Mr Manuel Cutillas, president of Bacardi, has written to big distillers and brewers in several countries, saying the three Cuban breweries were on a list of 131 properties for which the Cuban government was seeking foreign partners. The company's assets in Cuba were worth Dollars 70m (Pounds 47m) when they were confiscated, he said. 'It is Bacardi's position, supported by expert legal advice, that its confiscated assets continue to be its lawful property, and that no one who accepts a purported conveyance of any such property from the Castro regime will acquire good title under either Cuban or international law,' Mr Cutillas said. Earlier this month President Fidel Castro told foreign businessmen that investment opportunities in Cuba were worth many billions of dollars, and that the tourism sector alone had the potential for Dollars 20bn in new foreign business. He said opportunities for foreign investment in Cuba were going so fast there would be 'not one square metre of beach' left for US companies because of Washington's economic embargo.</p>

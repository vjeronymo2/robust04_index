			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Barings freezes Peps business as price war weakens returns Barings said yesterday it would stop taking applications for personal equity plans, the first indication of a possible shake-up in the Pounds 3bn-a-year Pep market. Baring Global Fund Managers, the merchant bank's asset managing arm, is putting its Pep business on hold pending a review of its long-term retail operations. Peps, introduced in 1989, are popular tax shelters for private investors. Up to Pounds 6,000 a year can be invested free of capital gains or income tax. A further Pounds 3,000 can be invested tax-free in single-company Peps. Barings is a relatively minor provider of Peps, which represent just Pounds 15m of its Pounds 3bn in managed assets. Other groups in the highly fragmented market may soon follow its example, as returns from Peps begin to weaken. Increasing regulation and an intense price war have substantially raised the costs of participation for groups without a large market share. Earlier this year M&amp;G, the UK's largest Pep provider, abandoned the initial charge on its managed income fund. Most other Pep providers have followed M&amp;G with some form of discount. Mr Nick Wells, Barings product development manager, said the bank's relatively minor position in the Pep market and its reluctance to discount had prompted the decision to stop taking applications from next Tuesday, the end of the 1993-94 tax year. The bank had also decided that the Pep market would become even more difficult in future. Competition would become increasingly cut-throat, as opportunities for discounting developed in the transfer mar-ket, which allows plan-hold-ers to switch managers. Barings has not yet decided whether to withdraw completely from Peps. A decision would be announced after the review was completed, Mr Wells said. The extension of unit trust allowances and, more recently, the fall in interest rates have sharply increased the popularity of Peps. The market, which has more than doubled since 1992, is expected to reach Pounds 5bn this year. However, returns have been diluted by the price war. One leading provider estimated it would now take up to five years to make a profit in the new, more aggressive environment. This made it difficult for niche specialists such as Barings to remain competitive, he said. 'It is difficult to stay in this market unless you are prepared to enter it in full,' he said. 'We have the benefit of volume and that is an important factor.'</p>

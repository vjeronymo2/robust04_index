			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Clinton &amp; Co's sales machine cashes in - 'High-level advocacy' pays dividends for US The Dollars 6bn Saudi order for commercial jets, announced on Wednesday, was the climax of an extraordinary sales effort by the Clinton administration in concert with McDonnell Douglas and Boeing, which will share the fruits of the victory. It represents the admin-istration's commitment to 'high-level advocacy', matching the efforts of foreign leaders who routinely promote their products during state visits. Before this deal was clinched, Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, and Mr Federico Pena, transportation secretary, had promoted the aircraft in Riyadh, and Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, had gone there twice. President Bill Clinton, who triumphantly announced the deal, admitted that he has no difficulty in 'asking for business'. At the suggestion of Mr Brown, he had telephoned King Fahd last year to urge him to 'buy American'. In response to business criticism, President Bush led the way for a government role in overseas sales. In 1990 he and cabinet officials lobbied for a multi-million dollar telecommunications deal with Indonesia to secure a contract for AT&amp;T. But even that was criticised by some in US business as 'defensive' and arranged hastily when it seemed that NEC of Japan would get the sale. It did lack the kind of synchronisation that the Clinton administration has been developing under its Trade Promotion Co-ordinating Committee, which represents the view of the 19 different agencies involved in export promotion. Swift approval by the US Export-Import Bank of a preliminary commitment to finance the Saudi deal was one result of this co-ordination. The administration has clearly come some distance since the US Council on Competitiveness issued a report warning of 'a fragmented system of policy development . . . mirrored by a fragmented information and intelligence system across government agencies and between government and industry'.</p>

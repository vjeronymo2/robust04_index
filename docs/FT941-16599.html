			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Books: Blake and the devil WITNESS AGAINST THE BEST by EP Thompson Cambridge University Press Pounds 17.95, 234 pages Everything characteristic of the late EP Thomson - his clarity, humanity, and breadth of learning - is present in this book, the last he wrote. It is an absorbing historical detective story revealing aspects of English history usually neglected in the textbooks. With his customary skill Thompson brings vividly into view the turbulence of social and religious life in the 17th and 18th centuries, his aim being to contribute to a great scholarly debate  -the mystery of where the poet William Blake got his extraordinary religious and poetic imagery. There is an entire academic industry devoted to Blake, and Thompson ventures into it with disarming robustness. There are almost as many views as there are scholars on the question of what influences shaped Blake's imagination, an imagination which seems in equal parts surreal and bizarre until one glimpses the rich veins of dissenting religion which fed it. Thompson's intimate sympathy for the life of England below the grand social level where constitutional history is made - the level of bishops, dukes and princes - gives him a sharp sense of the tumultuous life of popular religious thought. Ranters and Quakers, Muggletonians, Diggers and Behmenists, strove with one another, the established order, and even themselves, in a surging flux of thought in the 17th century. Thompson's concern is to discover in this rich tradition the basis of Blake's ideas, expressed in the vivid symbolism of great poems like 'Jerusalem' and 'The Marriage of Heaven and Hell', and in the extraordinary illustrations which accompany them. Blake could not, Thompson argues, have simply made up ab novo the resonant vocabulary of symbolism which distinguishes his work. Its character and consistency suggest not miscellaneous reading fuelling the free play of imagination, but a rich tradition upon which he could draw. What was it? Some say that Blake's source is the Bible as interpreted by Milton and radical Dissent. Others say it is the doctrines of such movements as the Moravians, Rosicrucians or Swedenborgians. Yet others hold that Blake was as an omnivorous and eclectic reader who helped himself to an assortment of notions from as far afield as Neoplatonism and the Kabbala, mixing them into his own poetic vision. Into this whirl of opinions Thompson brings his forensic skills to suggest an answer. It goes as follows. In the 17th century many dissenting groups saw the God of established religion as a 'God-devil', presiding over a Babylon of bishops and parsons who aided the state in oppressing ordinary people. Dissenting religion and political revolution were closely allied in the Leveller and Ranter movements of the time. Doctrinally these ideas expressed themselves as a rejection of the outward forms of established religion - including, for example, marriage - in favour of inspiration and prophecy. These revolutionary movements were suppressed, but one strand of them survived and, a century and a half later, was still an influence as Blake was writing his great poems. This was the Muggletonian movement, named after Ludowik Muggleton who with his cousin John Reeve preached a striking gospel. The serpent, they said, had literally entered Eve's womb in Eden, and dissolved there into seed, so that some of her progeny - Cain and his succession-were offspring of Satan. Thus mankind is a mixture of sons of Adam and the devil. Later God literally dissolved himself in Mary's womb likewise, and was made man; so that while Jesus walked the earth there was no God in Heaven. One Muggletonian creed ran, 'I believe in God the Man Christ Jesus, who was a Spiritual Body from all Eternity Who by Virtue of his Godhead Power Entered into the narrow passage of the Blessed Virgin Mary's Womb And so Dissolved Himself into Seed and nature and Clothed Himself with Flesh Blood and Bone as with a Garment; thereby made Capable to Suffer Death.' Not unsurprisingly the Muggletonians were accused of blasphemous obscenity, and remained an underground organisation. Muggletonian notions, Thompson argues, echo strongly in Blake's writings. Reason is regarded as the work of the devil; the theme of the serpent copulating with Eve appears constantly; and so does the idea that the evil in man results from that copulation. Thompson demonstrates that these themes pervade Blake's poems and paintings. But Thompson might have made a discovery - he is judiciously cautious about it, because the evidence is incomplete - which makes the Muggletonian connection with Blake persuasive. It is that his mother very likely came from a Muggletonian family. If so, a powerful conduit for these ideas directly links the Muggletonian teachings to Blake's extraordinary poems. Historical detective work carries its dangers; dramatic mistakes can be made in reconstructions of the past. Thompson was always alert to the dangers. He weds caution to brilliance, and tempers insight with fact. But in his hands the result, as this fascinating study shows, still reads like a thriller.</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STORYTELLERS: NEW IN AUGUST  </P> <P> Stir up the ingredients of a good, fast-paced story and you'll flush forth the  usual: romance, passion, suspense and three-dimensional characters. But it's  more than coincidence that an extra edge is found in the novel that carries  with it another ingredient: villainy, pure and simple. Black-heartedness  running rampant is icing on the cake, and the popular fiction hitting the  marketplace in August has it in abundance.  </P> <P> The publishers bill Rebecca Ryman's work, Olivia and Jai (St. Martin's Press:  $19.95; 640 pp.), as "a novel of passion and betrayal in 19th-Century India,"  and it is almost an understatement for this sweeping, powerful and complex  story of entwining business interests, global politics and social back-stabbing  in this -- at the time -- isolated corner of the British Empire. The year is  1848, the setting Calcutta, where the strong-willed Olivia, born, reared and  educated in California by her writer-rancher-environmentalist father, has been  sent to spend a year with her aunt, Lady Bridget Templewood, while the widowed  father stakes new claims in far-off Hawaii.  </P> <P> It's a rude, cultural shock for both niece and aunt -- Olivia plopped down in  the very proper, stultifying, atmosphere of colonial India where her uncle, Sir  Joshua, heads Calcutta's largest tea-exporting business -- and no less so for  Aunt Bridget, who has aspirations for mating Olivia (as well as her own  daughter, Estelle) to, you know, the proper type of wealthy English peerage.  Romance, however, comes in the form of Jai, a half-breed known locally, and  hated by the British, as Kala Kanta, or the Devil, and the venom is  particularly thick between the Templewoods and Jai. A shipper, Jai controls the  only fleet of fast clipper ships plying the India-England route that all  exporters, particularly the Templewoods, need desperately.  </P> <P> The ground is laid, aplenty, for scandal, treachery and intrigue as the affair  between Olivia and Jai thickens, and as Jai and the Templewoods clash over coal  (which Templewood needs to give his own ships a competitive edge with Jai's  clippers) mined by a Maharaja in northern India. But there are old secrets and  villainies further intensifying the hatred between Jai and Sir Joshua -- not  the least of them being the relationship between the young Sir Josh and Jai's  dead mother. This is an incredibly complex story line where it is only possible  to scratch the surface of the racial, economic and emotional conflicts that  ultimately tear the Templewoods apart, and Jai and Olivia apart as well.  </P> <P> While author Ryman is an admitted pseudonym -- because, as an Indian, her  extended family might be embarrassed by the passions described in "Olivia and  Jai" -- it is impossible to believe that this masterful and beautifully crafted  novel of romance and intrigue against such a lavish background could be a first  effort. This is a skilled and articulate work that is a Literary Guild and  Doubleday Book Club alternate selection and for which foreign rights already  have been sold to nine countries.  </P> <P> Consider the case of a born loser named Salvatore D'Amore, a case which Marcel  Montecino explores in detail in Big Time (William Morrow: $19.95; 488 pp.).  Life for New Orleans-born-and-reared Sal should have been kinder -- as a  teen-ager he had tremendous potential as pianist, vocalist, songwriter and  arranger. Instead of following his agent's urging to make a break for the big  time, D'Amore chooses the line of least resistance: trading on his local fame  with one-night gigs.  </P> <P> In his 30s, he is reduced to occasional bookings but works, primarily, as a  bartender booking bets for the New Orleans Mafia. And this is a crowd no one in  his right mind would try to double-cross -- like pocketing the customers' bets  on the assurance that, of course, they've picked the wrong horse. Except that,  from suddenly being $70,000 in the black, Sal is even more suddenly $170,000 in  the hole and, in a crowd where holding back a $2 tip from the Mafia can get  your kneecaps shattered, a debt like this has extermination written all over  it.  </P> <P> In "Big Time," author Montecino is following up on his earlier best seller,  "The Crosskiller," with a chase story that is as beautifully crafted as it is  blood-chilling. For the New Orleans Venezia family, neither time nor distance  can save Sal D'Amore from paying the ultimate price for betrayal -- and doubly  so when one of its prize hit men, tracking Sal to Waukegan, both fails in his  mission and never returns to New Orleans. (Never mind that a heart attack did  him in -- the Valenzias have added murder, now, to Sal's dossier).  </P> <P> Fleeing abroad (although he can't really breathe freely there, either), Sal  falls in with beautiful teen-ager Isabel Gemelli, who is not only the heiress  to a Gucci-type Brazilian leather fortune but, more important, has a God-given  pop music talent that -- with the right training -- could catapult her to  inter- national fame. Even as he flinches at sudden noises and unexpected  shadows, Sal is drawn in spite of himself to the shaping of this girl, and his  own dormant talents as writer, composer, arranger and teacher explode as they  never could have in New Orleans. It's a deadly mix as Sal's involvement with  Isabel throws him more and more into the international pop-music spotlight --  the same spotlight that it is essential he avoid when it draws him back to the  United States and the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> This is a real hair-curler of a story that explores the seamy side of New  Orleans' underworld as well as the glitz and political maneuvering that goes  into the making of an international pop-music star. How, or can, Sal ever free  himself from the relentless, narrow-eyed killers stalking him? We've taken a  blood-oath never to tell.  </P> <P> The "what if?" story line has tantalized novelists since the beginning of time  ("what if" the South had won the Civil War?), but few have had the temerity to  apply it to a dramatic episode so recent in time, and so loaded with characters  whose survivors are still extremely powerful, as has George Bernau.  </P> <P> In Candle in the Wind (Warner Books: $19.95; 499 pp.), Bernau takes a bold  stance: What if the 1962 death of Marilyn Monroe by drug overdose hadn't  resulted in her death, and what if that overdose hadn't been either suicidal or  accidental but a botched homicide attempt? But, hey! We're talking fiction  here, so it isn't Marilyn Monroe, but Marilyn Lane, and the handsome movie star  who plays a key role and is related by marriage to the White House is,  actually, Paul Townsend (wink!). The attorney general of the United States is  Tommy Kerrigan (wink!); the President of the United States is Jack Kerrigan  (wink!), and Marilyn's ex-husband is a failed prizefighter instead of a  you-know-what (wink!)  </P> <P> Discovering the naked body of the love goddess, comatose and hovering near  death, in her Brentwood home, Townsend sends for a cynical Hollywood private  eye, Frank Galvan (private detective to the stars) to help spirit Marilyn to a  hospital for discreet treatment. A nice logical-enough beginning for a "what  if?" story, right? Except that the star disappears; her private doctor turns up  murdered; a housekeeper also is dispatched, and the capable Galvan sudfdenly  finds himself surrounded by villains of all shapes and descriptions as his hunt  for "the most popular movie star in the world" leads him into the bowels of  Baja California.  </P> <P> He is far from alone in his search -- there are Mexican desperadoes after her,  a shadowy hired assassin (in whose employ?) and equally shadowy CIA and White  House agents. Which of them, like Galvan, are out to save Marilyn? Who are out  to finish the Brentwood job?  </P> <P> Bernau, whose earlier work, "Promises to Keep," was well-received, does a  masterful job here in weaving fact, prevalent myths and artful fiction into a  fast-paced thriller that races from Los Angeles to Baja, back to Los Angeles  and then to the East Coast -- Washington and then a narrow wooden bridge over  the chill waters of Triondak Bay near the Maryland coast. There are plots  tumbling on top of subplots, and there is enough skulduggery -- at the  international level, the national level, the Hollywood level and at the  human-passion level -- for a dozen books.  </P> <P> This is an ingenious puzzler with tightly paced transitions of time, place and  character that make it almost impossible to put down. Not once -- and this is  the critical measure -- is there a note of incongruity . . . not one temptation  to say: "Ah, c'mon, it couldn't have happened that way!" Unshakeably: It could  have. And who among us can say it didn't?  </P> <P> In Lois Battle's new work, The Past Is Another Country (Viking: $19.95; 412  pp.), we have an absorbing tale of three women who had been together as girls  at a strict Catholic school, St. Brigid's, in the remote western area of  Australia -- three women with widely divergent backgrounds who go on to lead  widely divergent lives, but whose paths cross as adults and who, in retrospect,  have crossed paths with each other more than any would have dreamed.  </P> <P> Consider, for instance, Megan Hanlon, who had lived in Australia with her aunt  and uncle while her American parents had worked in America, and who is now a  promising American screen director on the verge of winning her first Oscar for  a documentary and who is looking for financial backing for her first feature  film. In the meantime, shy, retiring Greta Papandreou Burke is an Australian  farm wife married to the internationally known surgeon, Tasman Burke. Finally,  there is Joan, the Mother Superior of St. Brigid's, formerly Sister Mary  Magdalene, the youngest and most unorthodox (and, therefore, the best liked)  teacher that Greta and Megan had had.  </P> <P> Brought back together by a high-society party feting international film makers  lured to Australia by the Academy Awards, the three are reunited -- and the  villain, time, has made profound changes in their lives. Joan, under the new  freedom permitted by the Catholic church, has taken back her own name, gone to  college and fallen in love with her professor -- has almost strayed from the  church for him -- but has returned to her first love, and duty, as Mother  Superior at St. Brigid's. Megan and Greta -- the former with a failed marriage  behind her and the latter feeling the need to break away from her dominating  surgeon husband to exercise her own creativity -- are equally restive. The  reunion will resolve the hunger for independence that both of them feel -- and  that Joan, in her own way, has solved.  </P> <P> This is a story of three strong-willed women, each grasping for her own niche  in life and ultimately finding it.  </P></p>

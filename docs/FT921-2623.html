			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Clinton takes stronger lead in fight to run for Democrats GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas early today took a further big stride towards winning the Democratic party's nomination for a likely run-off against President George Bush in the US presidential election in November. Early returns and exit polls suggested Mr Clinton had won substantial victories in his party's Illinois and Michigan primaries while Mr Bush appeared finally to have curbed the right-wing challenge of fellow Republican Mr Patrick Buchanan. Mr Clinton had apparently won more than 50 per cent of the Democratic vote in Illinois, and 48 per cent in Michigan. The vote of Mr Buchanan, the television commentator, dwindled below the 30 per cent level that has so irritated the president and the Republican party establishment. Ms Angela Buchanan, the challenger's sister, conceded that snatching the nomination 'looks as if it's not going to be possible'. Governor Clinton's victories, on top of his triumph in last week's 11-state Super Tuesday contests, widened his lead over former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, who came second in Illinois. In Michigan, former California governor Mr Jerry Brown came a surprise second with an estimated 29 per cent of the vote, pushing Mr Tsongas into third position. While Governor Clinton has appeared comfortably ahead of both Mr Tsongas and Mr Brown, with deeper campaign funds, smoother organisation and support from a broader range of voters, his successes had previously come almost entirely in the south, where he held an advantage as the regional candidate. The Midwest states of Illinois and Michigan, besides offering 295 delegates to the Democratic convention in New York in July, represented neutral territory. The campaign was ferociously fought, as Mr Brown launched a vicious and inaccurate attack on Governor Clinton and his relationship with his wife's law firm. Mr Brown sought votes among Michigan's unemployed carworkers. But according to exit polls, Mr Clinton not only won 75 per cent of black votes, he also won 53 per cent of the trade union votes that Mr Brown had courted.</p>

Domestic enterprises will actively proceed with  civilian-level industrial cooperative projects with the five  subcommittees of the ROK-PRC Industrial Cooperation Committee,  which will be organized on the occasion of President Kim's China  visit for the automobile, electronic, aviation, electronic  exchanger (TDX), and nuclear energy fields.    They are now holding consultations with China on specific  problems in promoting those projects by dispatching joint  delegations or management-level personnel to China. In  particular, our government is consulting with domestic business  circles over nominating a head company in each field to improve  efficiency in promoting economic cooperation with China through  a unified channel for each sector.    The government is considering nominating Daewoo Motors as  the  head company in the automobile field, the Korea Electric Power  Corporation in the nuclear energy field, Kumsong Dacom in the  electric exchanger field, and Samsung Electronics in the  electronic field, which includes high-definition television.  Samsong Aviation Company and Korean Air are competing with each  other for the leadership in the aviation field. The government,  however, is struggling because business circles oppose the  policy of nominating head companies and insist on liberal  competition.    Daewoo Motors and China's Changchun No. 1 Motor Company  agreed to invest jointly $1.5 billion in building a  joint-venture plant capable of producing 300,000 automobile  parts and 150,000 completed automobiles a year and they are now  proceeding with this project. Hyundai Motors is also planning to  invest individually to manufacture ordinary automobiles.    China has requested that the Korea Electric Power  Corporation  provide technological support and investment for its nuclear  power facilities. It has already dispatched a technological  support team to maintain the No. 1 and No. 2 nuclear power  plants in Guangdong, China.    It has been learned that China has promised our business  circles that it will consider adopting ROK electric exchangers  as a standard system in building the national communication  network in the future. Kumsong Dacom and Samsung Electronics are  now expanding their investments in this field in China.    The ROK Government plans to promote cooperation with China  by  organizing a consortium with an ROK head company and the  aviation industries of China, a company designated for the  consortium by the Chinese side. In the meantime, Samsung  Aviation Company, Korean Air, Daewoo Heavy Industries, Halla  Heavy Industries, and Seil Heavy Industries are independently  promoting joint projects with Chinese companies.</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Arts: Pierre Bonnard - Exhibition 'I would like to appear with the wings of a butterfly before the young painters of the year 2000,' wrote Pierre Bonnard a hundred years ago. Bonnard: the Happiness of Paintings, the title of a comprehensive new exhibition in Dusseldorf gathered from public and private collections across Europe and America, speaks for both the man and the work. In huge canvas after huge canvas, Bonnard distilled his preoccupations with a contented, domestic life in images of iridescent colour and Arcadian brightness. No painter invites so closely a feeling of instant introduction into an everyday scene, of joining the family in the garden, the couple by lamplight, or even the cat peering over the tablecloth. Picasso hated this untroubled charm and called Bonnard 'piddling'. Like his friend and fellow intimiste Edouard Vuillard, Bonnard suffered for much of this century from modernist dismissal as bourgeois, decorative, superficial. In the last 20 years, his work has swung back into favour; the scholarly catalogue (DM39) to this show teases out roots in 18th-century French art as well as the influence of Gauguin, the other Nabiss and the Symbolists, and proposes Bonnard as a precursor of Americans such as Jackson Pollock. But walk into any room here and it is Bonnard the pure painter who matters and attracts. Personal and intimate, with a dash of humour never found in Vuillard, he is always fresh and loyal to his own vision, a perfectionist in each minute detail. Years after he had sold a work to a museum he used to sneak in, wait for the curator to move to another room, and furtively whip out a brush and tube of paint to alter a fragment that still bothered him. He was born in 1867 into a liberal bourgeois family who did not object when he gave up law for art. His sister married the composer Claude Terrasse in 1890 and it is the Terrasse family that features in the early, monumental group pictures of uncles and children and dogs and outdoor tables laid for lunch, such as L'Apres-midi bourgeoise. Like the work of his contemporary, Proust, this is the quintessential idyll of bourgeois indolence and elegant leisure; it is also a wonderfully ironic comment on social stiffness and ennui, with the family lined up in a row, each with enough room to stand or sit but not to unfold or relax. Thus did Bonnard charge his cosy sunlit spaces with psychological overtones. After he settled down with his wife Marthe, social pictures were rare. The Bonnards were reclusive, living first in Normandy a few miles from Giverney  -Monet used to drive over to see the latest work; 'of the two,' said a witness, 'Bonnard spoke rather more, but that was hardly at all' - then in a village near Cannes. From both homes, Bonnard painted landscapes, trees, blossoms, fruit, brought within the bounds of his own world. The exterior plays against the interior so that the viewer must find his way - to the vista seen through an open window, across a veranda, from a table on a terrace. In the enclosed, luxuriant gardens in mauves, pinks and oranges that are Bonnard's lifelong motifs, the close-ups, the bowl of fruit, the check tablecloth, are the lasting images. The piquant and personal are the joys of Bonnard: the composition of The Cherry Tart, with its red fruit, blue table and green foliage screening the landscape beyond, might have been set up for him to paint the greedy eyes of the dog whose nose just reaches the tart. The round, childish face and slender body of Marthe, muse and model, is often the sole figure here; in the 1912 Nature morte a la figure, she is caught so still and calm that she seems part of a still-life. In the famous 'bath tub' series, delightfully brought together for this show, she is a naked, known woman unlike any other nude. Even Degas' simple nudes washing and drying have a mix of sensuality and gracelessness where Marthe is delicate, unsophisticated, hips and breasts unemphasised, body in its shimmer of light almost more abstract than the interwoven surfaces, mirrors and coloured tiles, which luminously reflect her figure. Bonnard does not try to explain her or anyone else; even in the last Self-portrait of 1945, painted after the deaths of Marthe and Vuillard, he stares, frail and alone, from the other side of a glass, his gaze directed beyond us. Some of the sparkling decorative pictures, suffused with well-being and memories of happiness, that he painted at the time of the portrait appear with it here; they show an aging Bonnard still true to the claim he made in the 1890s: 'I belong to no school. I only want to do something of my own.' Bonnard: Das Gluck zu Malen, Kunst-sammlung, Dusseldorf, to April 12.</p>

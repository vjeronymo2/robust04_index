			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Liliya Kuznetsova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 6 Apr -- To stop the increase in the number  of people in Russia who find themselves beyond the poverty line  -- this is the main objective of the state social policy in  1994. Yuriy Yarov, deputy chairman of the Russian Government,  said this today at a meeting between heads of ministries and  services of the social bloc and journalists.    In his opinion, the fight against hyperinflation and social  stabilization in society should not be set against each other;  one should not put financial interests above those common to all  people, while at the same time one should not forget that  people's lives cannot be improved without improving the economy  and reducing inflationary processes.    The social policy, Yuriy Yarov said, is the first to be  affected by a fall in production. Reduced budget revenues have  resulted in a situation whereby the Finance Ministry's debt to  the social sphere in 1993 amounted to 228 billion rubles. In  addition, although last year's debts are being paid off,  non-payments for the first quarter of 1994 are growing: as of  today the debt amounts to 500 billion rubles.    At the same time, the deputy chairman of the Russian  Government said that only 12.4 trillion rubles have been  allocated to resolving all social problems, which is 9.5 percent  of the budget. In his view, at least 15 per cent of the federal  budget's assets are necessary just to resolve the most painful  problems in the sphere.</p>

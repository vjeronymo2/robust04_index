			<p>BFN     [Text] At the end of the evening sitting of the State Duma  Friday, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia  (LDPR), Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, made a statement on behalf of his  faction. He said that it was against any contacts with NATO as  well as Russia's joining the program Partnership for Peace and  the Council of European.    Zhirinovskiy said that before a Russian parliamentary  delegation left for Strasbourg, the State Duma should take a  vote on what kind of position it should take there. "The  delegation to Strasbourg must have powers," he said.    Zhirinovskiy pointed out that the LDPR was against any  military exercises which involved the participation of foreign  troops on Russian territory. The Russian military taking part  in such exercises together with Americans would lose their  shoulder stripes if another regime came to power, he was quoted  as saying.    Zhirinovskiy called on the deputies to take a stance in the  wake of the initiative by Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev  on Kazakhstan's joining Russia and Belarus in the united ruble  zone and demanded the resignation of a number of ministers.  However, he did not indicate to whom he was referring.    As a sign of protest, the deputies of Russia's Choice left  the hall as soon as Parliamentary Speaker Ivan Rybkin allowed  Zhirinovskiy to take the floor. For his part, Zhirinovskiy  asked the health care minister to prescribe them some medicine,  because the faction of Russia's Choice had been clinically dead  for the last four months, he said.</p>

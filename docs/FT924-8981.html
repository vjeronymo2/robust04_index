			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Arts: How to juggle artistically with money - Off the Wall THE ARTS world should Expect nothing in the way of extra Government funding in 1993-94: that will ensure that it is not disappointed. The rumours from Whitehall are depressing, with the new Heritage Secretary, Peter Brooke, being asked initially to report on the consequences of actual cuts in his budget. The comparative smallness of his empire, with largesse this year totalling Pounds 931m, plus yet to be determined running costs for the expanded department, may work in his favour - any savings would not be worth the hassle. But arts companies will be lucky to get away with frozen grants in 1993. They were promised a 3.5 per cent increase under three year funding, (former Minister Richard Luce's innovation which was to take the uncertainty out of the future), but that was only a planning figure, and since the arts has received increases in the past two years way ahead of the three year plan, it can hardly complain if the cards fall the wrong way this time. Peter Brooke will have some freedom to distribute funds around his new conglomerate. This year his main clients were the performing arts, financed through the Arts Council, which got Pounds 236m; museums and galleries which took Pounds 214m; the heritage with Pounds 199m; and libraries with Pounds 141m. Brooke could switch heritage money, especially from unorganised areas like the Royal Parks, to the performing arts. There could also be less allocated to the new British Library, which seems to be out of favour with the government. But the easiest fudge could be over running costs. Nobody knows how much it will cost to run the enlarged Heritage department which will move into a new home next year. A few millions saved here could ensure that the major arts organisations do not suffer real cuts in their grants. This week the British Phonographic Industry held a celebratory dinner for its director John Deacon which raised Pounds 300,000 for charity. It was the kind of thing the record industry does well: the internecine battles between record companies; between companies and artists; and artists and managers hidden beneath well lubricated bonhomie. And Deacon deserves a tribute for making the BPI one of the most effective lobbyists in the UK, even if the Government still fails to acknowledge that pop music has been the most lucrative British export market of the last 30 years, with one in five of every record sold in the world containing a bit of Britain in its make up. Why no knighthood for Cliff?. The record industry is amazing for the continuity which survives all the changes. Retail outlets may shrink to less than 1,000; the hardware gets so refined that the day fast approaches when anyone can summon into their home the music they want at that moment; the software metamorphoses within five years, yet the same few companies - EMI, Phonogram, Warner, and CBS-Sony - stay supreme, with two thirds of sales. This year the old vinyl LP will virtually disappear - only 10m were sold in 1991 and it is fading fast, while the CD has jumped 20m in two years to top 66m. The single is on a slower decline, but it now only requires sales of 6,000 to make the pop charts. Deacon takes a pragmatic view of it all, and sees sales of pop music set to rise, not because the songs are getting better but because the number of teenagers is on the increase. In contrast the much trumpeted revival in classics could already be faltering. Traditionally classical music held just over 7 per cent of the market and the record companies largely ignored it. Then came Pavarotti and Nigel Kennedy and sales rose to 12 per cent. This year they are down to 11 per cent. But as the number of teenagers is set to rise so are the ranks of pensioners. It could be that the rock revival albums that currently dominate the charts will fade as the middle aged swingers fall off their purchasing perches. It takes some imagination to see Jersey as a rival to Geneva as the main European auction centre for top quality jewels. But Bonhams, the smallest but cheekiest of the London salerooms, has managed the jump. It held a sale there this week and found buyers prepared to pay up to Pounds 77,000 for an emerald and diamond ring. The attraction is that you pay no VAT in the Channel Islands. With London's position as the world's leading art mart under threat from EC tax hounds, anxious to impose VAT on art works imported there for sale, the Islands could suddenly be the perfect off-shore haven. Not that Bonhams has yet proved the point: half its jewels sale was unsold. But it is trying again on November 16, this time with a house sale on Guernsey. Antiques dealer Peter Heraty so loved his new home in St Peter Port that he has beggared himself furnishing it. As a result he is forced to sell the contents, and virtually squat. Being a dealer the mainly Georgian furniture is of impeccable taste; being Irish it is also slightly oddball. The Pounds 300,000 estimate seems modest.</p>

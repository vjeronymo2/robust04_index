			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Poles sign enterprise pact: Government tries to boost faltering support for reforms THE Polish government yesterday signed a tripartite 'enterprise pact' with trade unions and employers in an attempt to bolster faltering shop-floor support for the country's free market reforms. The government wants to speed privatisation while giving workers a say in management of private companies. The pact signed yesterday for the government by Mr Jacek Kuron, the labour minister, was first mooted last autumn. It is also designed to ease tax burdens on state-owned enterprises and introduces the principle that macro-economic indicators are to be agreed in a national tripartite council composed of government officials, trade unionists and employers' representatives. Mr Kuron said after signing the pact with Mr Marian Krzaklewski, head of the Solidarity trade union, and Mr Andrzej Machalski, head of an employers' group, that 'the transformation of the economy without compromises' could end dangerously but that the signing of the pact meant that there would be 'a major acceleration' of reforms. Mr Kuron later signed the pact with the OPZZ trade unions representing the former pro-communist movement. The radical Solidarity 80 union was conspicuous by its absence. Under the pact, which will be turned into legislation, workers are to be given six months to decide on the form of privatisation for their factory. If they fail to do so the Privatisation Ministry will be free to take the decision. Workers are also to be given 10 per cent of the shares in their factories at privatisation, and financial conditions are to be eased in cases where employees take over a factory and lease the machinery and buildings from the state. Workers are also to be represented on non-executive boards of directors and both private and state-sector plants employing more than 2,500 are to have at least one worker in top management to represent their interests. The pact includes the plan to restructure enterprise and bank debts for some 2,000 companies. The pact also removes the dividend, an outdated profit tax on the state sector. It is replaced with an arrangement under which one third of company profits can be spent on wages as long as one third is spent on investment, and one third paid in corporate tax.</p>

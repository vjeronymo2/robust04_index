			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: German equities There has been a tentative reordering of investors' priorities in the German equity market. Bank stocks, poor performers for most of 1993 and 1994, have recently picked up: shares in Deutsche Bank, for example, have outperformed the market by 7 per cent since the beginning of October. By contrast cyclicals, which helped drive the market to its peak in May, have lost some of their lustre. Retailers too are down by 9 per cent relative to the market in the past month. These changes look like a search for a new direction in an equity market overshadowed by gloom in the bond markets. In the case of retailers, there has been no recent change in fundamentals, merely a heightened awareness of the poor consumer spending climate. But the modest shift from cyclicals to financials appears prompted by valuation anomalies. Share prices of chemicals companies stand at a multiple of 14 times next year's earnings, while those of steel group Thyssen are at 10 times. These ratings are high by historical standards. The opposite is true for banks, whose shares stand on extremely low valuations. Until recently investors have been willing to wait patiently for the full upsurge in profits from cyclical companies. But the moves over the past month suggest that such patience is wearing thin and shareholders are casting around for new areas of outperformance. For bank shares to rebound strongly there will need to be a change of mood in the bond markets. Canny investors may do well to make the switch now.</p>

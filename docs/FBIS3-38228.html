Markets and economic activities are becoming more  global at an increasingly fast rate. "Our national economic  policies must be adjusted to these realities," said Jean-Pascal  Delamuraz Thursday evening [27 January] at the opening of the  24th Davos Forum, in the company of Helmut Kohl and Nestle  President Helmut Maucher.    The [Swiss] Federal Council member felt that the current  globalization is "the most striking" development of the late  20th century. The drawing together of human groups is, however,  nothing new. "In fact it goes all the way back to man's  discovery of flint," Mr. Delamuraz said.    However, the pace at which the phenomenon is accelerating is  unprecedented. "And we were not prepared for it," continued the  head of the Federal Department of the Public Economy (DFEP). A  firm or a market both tend to be attached to a given country.  "Our economic policies are still largely geared toward this  national perception."  <H5>  Rapid European Integration </H5>   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl appealed for a "quick paced"  pursuit of European integration, five months before Germany  takes over the EC presidency. He agreed with Mr. Delamuraz in  stressing the need for increasing the convergence of the  European states' national policies.    "Only in this way will we obtain all the fruits of economic  and monetary union," said Mr. Kohl, who was also in favor of  increased openness in world trade.    Support for the new democracies of East Europe must be  renewed, continued the chancellor. The failure of the reforms  would be catastrophic, whereas success would offer the only  chance for peaceful coexistence in Europe.  <H5>  Bilateral Meetings </H5>   A number of figures combined their trip to Switzerland for  the Davos Forum with meetings with Swiss officials. Swiss  President Otto Stich was to meet Thursday evening with Uzbek  President Islam Karimov at the Lohn residence.    Flavio Cotti, the head of the Federal Department of Foreign  Affairs (DFAE), met Thursday in Bern with Madagascar Prime  Minister Francisque Ravony and in Kloten with Danish Foreign  Minister Niels Helveg Petersen.  <H5>  'Arafat in Bern </H5>   On Thursday, the DFAE stressed the importance of the first  meeting ever between Yasir 'Arafat, Otto Stich, and Flavio Cotti  planned for Monday in Bern. In doing so, Switzerland is  demonstrating its desire to continue making a contribution to an  "irreversible" peace process.    In the meantime, Flavio Cotti is to meet on Friday in Bern  with Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Mussa, and in Davos with his  Israeli counterpart, Shim'on Peres. Mr. Peres and Mr. 'Arafat  will hold talks in Davos, which will be the most awaited moment  of the Forum.    Mr. Delamuraz is to hold talks on Saturday in Davos with  Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and European Commission  Vice President Leon Brittan, and on Sunday with Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.  <H5>  Number of Participants Reaches Maximum </H5>   Some 1,200 figures from politics, economics, the arts, and  the sciences from more than 70 countries signed up for the 24th  Forum on the world economy in Davos. They will be able to  participate in some 500 sessions.    The number of participants was limited and the number of  journalists was restricted to 200. Among the figures expected  to attend, Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, who  is not well, had to cancel her visit to Davos.</p>

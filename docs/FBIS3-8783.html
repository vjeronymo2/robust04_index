			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] On 15 March, Hungary's national day, during the  time reserved for the members of the Chamber of Deputies to make  personal speeches, Mr. Imre Borbely, UDMR [Democratic Union of  Hungarians in Romania] deputy, marked that holiday and intended  to present the essence of his statement speaking in the  Hungarian language. His initiative was received with protests  on behalf of the members of the Chamber of Deputies and thus the  chairman of the session, Mr. Radu Berceanu, requested that in  the Romanian parliament Mr. Borbely should use the language of  the state of which he is a citizen. Despite this the UDMR  deputy, according to his own statement, still addressed the  chamber with a few words of greeting in Hungarian.    In their replies, independent Deputy Petre Turlea and  Constantin Ciurtin, a PUNR [Romanian National Unity Party]  deputy, protested the idea of celebrating the Hungarians'  national day on Romania's soil, considering especially the fact  that the UDMR leaders uphold the autonomy of the regions with a  majority ethnic Hungarian population, a fact that violates  Romania's Constitution.    The information bulletin published by the UDMR press bureau,  which we received last night via fax, terms the occurrence in  the Chamber of Deputies as a regrettable incident, as the UDMR  deputy was prevented from uttering a few words in the Hungarian  language.

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Survey of Malaysia (3): Driven by exports - The strains and stresses of economic success Like a runner who chalks up record lap after record lap, Malaysia's economy continues to run ahead at a dizzying pace. Last year Malaysia's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 8.5 per cent - the sixth successive year of plus 8 per cent growth. In the first quarter of this year GDP expanded by 8.6 per cent: predictions for full year growth now range from 8.2 to more than 9 per cent. There have been warnings that the economy is in danger of overheating and that such high growth cannot be sustained. Some analysts worry about growing imports and a rise in consumer spending. Malaysia is also in danger of losing competitiveness with wages rising faster than productivity. The government has to struggle to attract more inward investment. However, faced with a barrage of favourable statistics, such concerns are easily brushed aside by a government eager to promote the success of its economic policies. The goal that has eluded economic planners worldwide - achieving high growth while keeping inflation low - seems to have been achieved. Despite the years of economic expansion inflation has rarely risen above 5 per cent. The long term goal is to achieve full industrialisation by the year 2020 - a plan called Vision 2020 by the government's copywriters. To meet that target Malaysia's economy needs to grow by 7 per cent in each of the next 26 years. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, dismisses the idea that this is overly ambitious. He points out that for much of the period since Malaysia's independence from Britain in 1957, Malaysia's economy has grown each year by well over 6 per cent. 'I am confident that the targets of Vision 2020 are attainable,' says Dr Mahathir. 'The Government and its successors are committed to this vision.' The engine of economic growth has been the wholesale expansion of an export orientated manufacturing sector. Over the past 20 years Malaysia has been transformed from a commodity based to a manufacturing economy. In 1971, more than 80 per cent of exports were commodities - mainly tin, rubber and petroleum products. In 1993, manufactured goods formed more than 70 per cent of exports. 'There is no doubt that had we remained with tin and rubber, we would be a basket case today,' says Dr Mahathir. 'Manufacturing saved us.' One of the achievements of the Malaysian economy is that the expansion in the manufacturing sector and double digit rises in exports of recent years took place while recessionary winds were blowing through key export markets. Overall output in the manufacturing sector expanded 12.8 per cent last year while the value of manufacturing exports rose 26 per cent to MDollars 90bn. Now, with the economic outlook in the west improving, Malaysia is confident that the export growth of recent years can at least be sustained and fuel the continued expansion of the manufacturing sector. In the first quarter of 1994 output in the manufacturing sector grew by 13.7 per cent. The public finances are in good order. For the first time in more than 30 years Malaysia achieved a balanced budget in 1993. High rates of domestic savings, at about 34 per cent of GNP, provide a ready source of funding for onward growth. 'That we are on track for yet another robust year is very encouraging for us,' said Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the deputy prime minister and finance minister, in June. However, economic success has brought its problems. The number one priority of Malaysia's monetary authorities has been the fight against inflation. Encouraged by the buoyant economy and a stockmarket that rose by nearly 100 per cent last year, massive amounts of foreign funds have washed into the country. Speculators also pushed funds in, hoping to gain from a rise in the ringgit, the Malaysian dollar. Bank Negara, the central bank, was forced to mop up MDollars 40bn in excess liquidity from the banking system last year in order to stop the build up of inflationary pressures in the economy. Malaysia has embarked on a large scale programme to build up its infrastructure. New airports, power stations, roads and railways are being constructed. Such projects, besides relieving some of the bottlenecks that have built up in the economy, will further fuel growth. However, imports of expensive capital equipment associated with such projects - particularly in relation to yen denominated Japanese goods - have caused balance of payments problems. A strong revival in domestic spending has increased economic activity but has also spurred a rise in imports. A Bank Negara prediction made earlier this year of a 1994 MDollars 9.3bn surplus in the merchandise account of the balance of payments is generally regarded as over optimistic: a widening deficit in the services account - projected at more than MDollars 15bn - is likely to lead to a current account deficit of more than MDollars 6bn. Of more concern in the long term are a number of structural problems within the economy. Chief among these is a shortage of labour which in turn has led to upward pressures on wages. Till now the government has managed to dampen wage demands by, on the one hand, keeping down inflation and, on the other, by importing hundreds of thousands of workers, mostly from Indonesia and Bangladesh. In many sectors of Malaysia's plantation industry immigrant workers make up more than 60 per cent of the workforce. Officials realise that such dependence on immigrant labour could cause long term social problems. Using unskilled imported labour to keep down wages is unlikely to be an option as Malaysia seeks to enter a new, more skills-orientated phase. Already there are signs of a widening wages/productivity gap. A recent survey found that nationwide wages rose 7.3 per cent in the first six months of 1994 while productivity increased by only 2 per cent. 'We will do everything we can to make sure the welfare of workers is protected,' says Mr Anwar. 'But we do not want this to be at the expense of productivity or Malaysia losing its competitiveness against its neighbouring countries.' On one level Malaysia's leaders realise that the country is no longer an ideal low cost, labour intensive investment site. 'If you are looking for cheap labour and lower technology, Malaysia is not the place for you,' Mrs Rafidah Aziz, the trade and industry minister, told US investors. 'We are looking for jobs with more brain power required, not just brawn power.' However, Malaysia's manufacturing sector has yet to mature into a high tech, skills based industry. The country has severe skills shortages. It spends very little on R&amp;D. It still has a narrow industrial base: electronics and electrical appliances account for about 60 per cent of manufacturing exports. Much of the electronics industry, dominated by foreign multinationals, is still devoted to labour intensive assembly work. About two thirds of manufactured exports have import ratios of between 60 and 80 per cent. A 66 per cent drop in foreign investment last year was shrugged off by the government as only a temporary phenomenon. Investment from abroad did indeed pick up in the first six month of 1994, though to nothing like levels earlier in the decade. The government is now emphasising the need to encourage investment from domestic sources: but a lot of foreign expertise and capital is necessary to develop high tech industries. The Malaysian economy is running ahead at full steam. The big question is whether it has sufficient strength to stay the distance and complete the race to full industrialisation.</p>

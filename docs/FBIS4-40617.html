			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Manfred Quiring report from Moscow: "No Suitable Successor </F> for Yeltsin"]    [Excerpts] In the opinion of Ivan Rybkin, president of the  Russian State Duma, social explosions in Russia are very  unlikely, despite predictions to the contrary. Before  yesterday's anniversary of Russia's sovereignty declaration of  12 June 1991, the Moscow politician said yesterday in an  interview with BERLINER ZEITUNG that he currently does not see  an alternative to President Yeltsin. [passage omitted]    He affirmed that in the Russian Duma there is a far-reaching  consensus on the development of all forms of ownership -- both  state and private ones. "All parliamentary groups, also the  communists, advocated this." There are only differences on the  share of the state property in the economy -- at present, it is  still two-thirds.    Duma President Rybkin regularly meets with President  Yeltsin.  He had just visited him in the Kremlin, in order to discuss  important domestic and foreign policy questions, he reported  rather casually. "My relations with President Yeltsin -- on a  factual level -- are the very best, they are constructive." The  relations between the parliament and the president -- marked by  confrontation in the time of the old Supreme Soviet -- have also  changed. Rybkin is convinced that a vast majority in the  parliament and the state structures proceeds on the assumption  that President Yeltsin will exercise his full powers until June  1996, which is, according to the Constitution, the scheduled  date of new elections.    Talks on candidates at a time when the present president  will  be in office for another two years are simply not correct.  Moreover, he does not see a suitable candidate anywhere. "I  know those who want to become president very well and I can tell  you: With the limited experience that they have, the  presidential responsibility will simply collapse on the day  after the election and nothing will be left." In order to  anticipate the consequences of decisions made in Moscow for the  most distant parts of the country, great experiences of life and  leadership are required. All the differences that exist in  Russia have to be unified, he said.    He admitted that the previous economic policy has resulted  in  an extreme differentiation of the living conditions in Russia.  The rich earn 45 times more than the poor. However, the Duma  president claimed that, during his numerous trips through the  country, he ascertained that "the reserves of endurance are  sufficiently large." The people keep above water with second  and third jobs, he said.    Meanwhile, the majority in the country has realized that  "the  time of speedy solutions" is over. He is convinced that "the  people have understood that daily work is in demand now." The  president's latest edicts and the Duma's work is now aimed at a  revival of production, on the one hand, and at letting  ineffective enterprises go bankrupt, on the other, he said.</p>

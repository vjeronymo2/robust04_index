			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTORCYCLE COMMUTERS  </P> <P> Why does this debate about a mandatory helmet law exist? Answer: the insurance  industry (who else?). If the insurance people would get their act together and  triple the medical premiums for those motorcyclists who choose not to wear a  helmet (to reflect the much higher costs of an accident), I'm sure the cyclists  would decide having the wind in your hair isn't that important after all.  </P> <P> DAVE DeHERAS  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

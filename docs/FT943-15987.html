			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Good rally at the close of a nervous session - Market Report A nervous day which had been spent waiting for the US Federal Open Market Committee to meet closed with a good rally in UK equities as early losses in British government bonds were reduced. A firm opening on Wall Street as US markets returned from the Independence Day holiday helped sentiment but London remained nervous that the Federal Reserve might raise its key interest rates without waiting for this weekend's meeting of G7 ministers. A fall of more than 25 points on the FT-SE 100 Index at mid-afternoon was reduced significantly in later trading. At the close the index stood at 2,965 for a loss of only 5.4 on the day. At the high of the session it reached 2,978.2 but the stock market was then undermined by weakness in UK gilt-edged securities. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, less closely linked to the derivatives markets, finished 5.4 up at 3,435.8. Uncertainty ahead of the G7 meeting was fuelled by reports that the German Finance Ministry would not propose the dollar exchange rate for discussion at Naples. The market's next hurdle is on Thursday when the Bundesbank meets. The final picture was somewhat mixed, with evidence of selective buying interest in several sectors of the market. However, there was little immediate response to comments on the domestic outlook from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer. Late firmness in the Dow Industrial Average, which was 20 points up in UK hours, showed chiefly in a firm oil share sector. It was a slack day for data on the UK economy but analysts commented that today's UK industrial production statistics for May will be keenly examined for signs of further expansion in the core manufacturing sectors. The April production figures sparked a firmer trend in UK equities. Trading volume, as measured by the Stock Exchange Seaq electronic network, remained low, with the day's share trading at 481.5m shares, against 483.3m in the previous session. On Monday, retail, or genuine customer, business was worth only Pounds 991m, an unexciting total by comparison with this year's average figures. The strategy team at Nikko, the Japanese based securities house, commented that markets are currently being dominated by futures instruments and featured by high volatility on low volume. It echoes other market firms in stating that equities offer 'good value' at present levels but that any solid rally is unlikely until the British government bond market can stage a genuine recovery. Strauss Turnbull warns against undue pessimism over the implications of dollar weakness on UK equities. The firm says that British equities are now around 12 per cent lower in dollar terms this year, while the rest of Europe is only some 2 per cent down. This situation, says Strauss, has in the recent past been a trigger for overseas, and especially US, investors to regard the UK stock market as undervalued. Although UK stocks have been marking time while waiting for the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bundesbank and the G7 countries to resolve the dollar's problems, the undertone in the equity market appears to have held firm. Some traders believe this would provide the base for a good advance in share prices if the US currency and the bond markets can be settled down.</p>

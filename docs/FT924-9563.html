			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / US fails to win support for anti-EC sanctions: Threat of trade war is temporarily averted THE THREAT OF a trade war was temporarily averted yesterday after the US failed to win support for a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) package of sanctions against the European Community. Punitive tariffs on food and drink imports into the US from the EC could, however, still be imposed, scuppering hopes of a world trade agreement. Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva, asked Gatt's governing council to authorise trade reprisals of up to Dollars 1bn on EC exports to the US as part of a long-standing dispute between the US and the EC over the trade in oilseeds. The US, he said, had shown 'uncommon patience' in the five-year dispute over subsidised oilseed production. The Dollars 1bn figure represents the trade which Washington claims its soyabean farmers have lost as a result of EC oilseed subsidies. The Gatt council, which has twice condemned the EC subsidies, expressed sympathy for the US position but refused to endorse sanctions. It opted to 'receive' the US statement. Mr Tran Van Thinh, EC ambassador to Gatt, warned that a Gatt endorsement of US sanctions 'would have fatal repercussions on the Uruguay Round'. The two sides were 'on the brink of an agreement', he said. Washington's failed attempt to escalate the dispute follows the breakdown on Tuesday of talks in Chicago between Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, and Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner. These aimed to resolve the long-running dispute as part of a broader accord on farm subsidies. Mr MacSharry, chief EC negotiator in Chicago, said 'the Community has no alternative whatsoever but to retaliate' if the US went ahead with punitive tariffs. He added that if Washington proceeded this would make clear the US doesn't want a Uruguay Round settlement, which is a disgraceful situation'. He said that 'a very good agreement' to settle the farm chapter of the Uruguay Round was close. But in the end, senior EC officials say, the US moved backwards on the separate but linked oilseeds dispute by trying to set a lower and permanent production limit for the EC. Mr MacSharry received support from the European Parliament agriculture committee and the trade committee of the Council of Ministers. But he is understood to be dismayed at the lack of support from Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president. There were strong rumours that he had decided to take no further part in the Gatt negotiations, handing responsibility to Mr Delors. One senior EC official says Mr Delors phoned Mr MacSharry in Chicago to say he would oppose the Gatt deal taking shape, and that France and another unspecified member state would try to veto the package in the Council of Ministers, by invoking overwhelming national interest. Officials in Brussels have already drawn up a list of counter-measures if the US goes ahead with its sanctions threat. Washington has not completely ruled out further negotiations. Last night Mr Bill Clinton implicitly endorsed the Bush administration's authority to complete farm trade negotiations and if necessary impose sanctions. Mr Clinton listed issues on which he looked forward to working closely with Mr Bush, including 'making progress toward a good agreement on our world trade talks'.

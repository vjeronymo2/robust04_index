			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Turchenko report: "Thefts and Borders. Russia's </F> National Wealth Is Leaving for the West by Train"]    [Text] The "democrats'" apocalyptic regime has scored a  great number of specific achievements -- from the total collapse  of industry to the mass closure of maternity homes and  kindergartens as being not wanted. But one of the "victories"  most worthy of this power is probably the unprecedented  flowering of crime in its particularly wild manifestations.  Precisely 2,799,714 registered crimes -- this is the record  figure for 1993.    There is also at first glance a more modest but essentially  terrible figure. Last year 9,477 crimes associated with the  misappropriation of raw materials and strategic materials, which  are being exported on a vast scale to the West, which applauds  the anti-Russian reforms, were brought to light. This is not  just robbery. Having stripped the shirt off the back of the  present generation of Soviet people, the pro-Western regime has  organized the total robbing of our children, grandchildren, and  all subsequent descendants by sending the country's natural  riches abroad.    The process of misappropriating strategic materials has  reached such a terrifying scale that indistinct, albeit somewhat  timid, grumbling has begun even in Yerin's department. Some  facts and figures were divulged at a recent meeting of  journalists with leaders of administrations of the Russian  Federation MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. Last year the  illegal export of 17,800 tonnes of metals, 97,900 tonnes of  petroleum products, and 157,400 cubic meters of timber worth a  total of more than 18 billion rubles was prevented. This is  just the tip of the iceberg. It is difficult even to imagine  what quantity of strategic materials nonetheless went to the  West.    Militia Major General Vyacheslav Saltaganov, chief of the  Russian Federation MVD Main Administration for Economic Crimes,  cited the following data. All sorts of output and strategic  materials worth 10.6 billion francs arrived in France alone from  CIS countries during seven months of last year. And yet this is  not the country with the biggest penchant for Russian riches.  There are far more greedy countries.    Whose hands are plundering our country? In Saltaganov's  opinion, commercial structures, primarily joint ventures, are  the chief active force here. They issue orders for thefts of  strategic raw materials and then resell them to nearby and  distant foreign countries.    "During the two years since the breakup of the USSR,"  Mikhail  Vanin, chief of the Administration for Combatting Smuggling and  Violations of Customs Regulations, said, "this problem has  passed a critical point. Stable groups of smugglers, who  control the process of the extraction and production of  strategic materials and export them, have been formed all over  the country. They have set up ramified structures in  enterprises and export groups, and there are 'windows' on the  borders....    "In the USSR there was a state monopoly on foreign trade,"  he  blurted out in a temper, "and so the confusion that exists now  did not exist then!"    But why do the MVD and the State Customs Committee keep  quiet  about this and not strive for a normal state approach to  protecting our national riches from plundering? Vladimir  Vorozhtsov, chief of the Russian Federation MVD Public Relations  Center, made things clear:    "If we were to raise this question, we would at once be  called antimarketeers and opponents of reforms!"    Well, well! It turns out that MVD officials are perfectly  well aware of who is pilfering our riches, why, and for whom.  They are also aware that, within the framework of the present  regime, not only is it impossible to secure a state monopoly of  foreign trade, but it is also dangerous to personal well-being  to speak aloud about this.    It only remains to add that the "democratic" power is  programmed to work for the West and in the interests of the  West. While this regime lords it in Russia, the strategic  plundering of Russia will only increase.</p>

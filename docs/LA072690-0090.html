			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: DUARTE;  </P> <P> BUILDING ORDINANCE OKD  </P> <P> The City Council has temporarily prohibited second-story additions to  single-family homes while the Planning Department finishes a study on such  additions.  </P> <P> The urgency ordinance prohibiting additions was approved unanimously Tuesday  night. Ed Cox, director of community development, said the department is not  considering prohibiting second-story additions, but rather wants to find better  ways of building them so they do not harm adjacent properties.  </P> <P> Cox said a report is tentatively scheduled to be presented to the Planning  Commission Aug. 20. It could then come back to the council for consideration by  Sept. 25.  </P></p>

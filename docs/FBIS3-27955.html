The  package includes expanded investment in public works, increased  investment in housing construction, and the easier acquisition  of land, with the scale of projects in these three areas alone  exceeding 8 trillion yen (Y).    The government and the ruling coalition parties are now  making final adjustments on the pending question of how large  the cuts in income and residential taxes should be and where the  revenues to cover the shortfalls arising therefrom should come  from. They are seeking a conclusion on this by 2 February. As  far as the question of whether to increase the consumption tax  rate as a source of revenue is concerned, however, they plan to  ask Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to make a political  decision. With all the measures combined, the total package is  likely to surpass Y14 trillion in scale, the largest ever in  history.    The comprehensive economic package is in the process of  being  finalized under a schedule of the coalition parties announcing  their proposal on the morning of 3 February and the government  announcing its final proposal on the evening of the same day.  The draft version of the announcement on the economic package  says in its preface that the nation needs the greatest possible  measures to put the chaotic economy back on track as quickly as  possible in 1994. This is necessary for the country to attain  stable growth in 1995 and thereafter, and to take up the midterm  tasks in preparation for the advent of the aged-population  society, it adds.    A main point of the package is that a total of Y4 trillion  worth of projects -- including the advanced acquisition of  public-use land -- will be undertaken to expand public works  investments. These include Y2.9 trillion in public works  projects and Y300 billion in independent regional projects. In  the area of improving facilities, emphasis will be given to  those related to education, research, medical care, and social  welfare -- to attain an improvement in people's lives and the  infrastructure for research and development.    With respect to the tax system concerning housing  construction, whereas at present the housing loan tax applies to  those earning more than Y20 million and building a house whose  floor space exceeds 240 square meters, such a rule will be  abolished over a certain period. In addition, to make land  transactions easy, the "tax to promote the efficient use of  land" will be introduced. Under the new taxation system, if  someone who has owned land for more than five years wants to  sell it for use in a good-cause project needed for the  development of cities and towns, he can have his tax on transfer  profits reduced to 20 percent (from the current 39 percent). In  the case of corporations, an additional 10 percent in corporate  taxes will no longer apply.    As for the efficient utilization of land, the package  proposes appropriating additional project funds through  establishing a special account for road construction and a  special account for city development fund loans. It also  proposes that the government pay interest on loans to buy land  now owned by the Japan National Railway Settlement Corporation  and to purchase farmland within city limits.</p>

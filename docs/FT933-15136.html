			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Bernard Matthews poultry workers win RSI case SIX POULTRY workers yesterday won claims for repetitive strain injury (RSI) against Bernard Matthews, the poultry processor, in Norwich County Court. Solicitors for the TGWU general workers union, which backed the workers, said the case was the first to focus on training, job rotation and systems of work in relation to RSI. Previous cases had focused on whether employers had given adequate warnings to workers about the risks associated with their jobs, the union's solicitors said. The term RSI is used to cover a range of conditions affecting the neck, shoulders, arms and hands. In the past it was chiefly associated with manual jobs, but is now affecting office workers who use keyboards. The six awards - to three men and three women - ranged from nearly Pounds 6,000 to less than Pounds 650. The six worked on various tasks in the manufacture of turkey products at two of Bernard Matthews' East Anglia factories. A further three cases were rejected on medical grounds. The TGWU said there were between 70 and 100 other RSI claims waiting in the company. Mr David Joll, Bernard Matthews' managing director, said that Royal Insurance, the company's insurers, had wanted to test the cases in court. Representatives from several other insurance companies had attended the hearings, he said. The company, which employs 2,600 workers, said it had not yet had time to consider the judgment in detail. It added that it had 'always placed the well-being of its employees high on its list of business objectives'. It had at no time underestimated the potential risk to its employees.</p>

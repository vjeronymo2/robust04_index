			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Service industries gain in Manchester MANCHESTER plc, the notional 'company' created by combining the results of the top 100 companies by turnover in greater Manchester, seems to have weathered the recession with increased turnover, profitability, investment and tighter cost control. But the results seemed to present a rosier picture than the reality, according to KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm. Its analysis of the 26 new entrants in the top 100 revealed a substantial reconstruction of the local economy, with a steady shift from manufacturing to service industries. Strongest net growth was found in the retail, food, leisure and media sectors. However, the level of turnover of the 100th company remained unchanged, indicating that new entrants made the list through sales growth. The analysis showed overall sales growth of nearly 5 per cent to Pounds 26.87bn following 3 per cent the previous year. Pre-tax profits were nearly 17 per cent up at Pounds 1.42bn, yielding 10.2 per cent on capital employed compared with 9.5 per cent the previous year. The recession still bit, however: the combined operating profit margin rose from 5 per cent to 5.6 per cent - well below the late 1980s peak of 9.1 per cent. Fixed-asset investment levels were maintained at Pounds 1.2bn for the past two years. But long-term liabilities rose 15 per cent and long-term loans 20 per cent. Pay per employee in the 100 companies averaged Pounds 11,210 compared with Pounds 10,695 a year before. Employees in the leisure and media sectors were the best paid and those in manufacturing the worst.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo active The leading pharmaceuticals group in the UK, Glaxo Holdings, put on a volatile performance as it disappointed many in the market with its full-year figures but managed to hold on to its fans. The shares were down almost 20p after the company revealed profits of Pounds 1.84bn, against expectations of around Pounds 1.9bn, and a loss of Pounds 115m through bond holdings - analysts had expected a hit of about Pounds 95m. The subsequent statement was described by one dealer as 'dull, listless and bland' and did not provide a floor to the share price. Detractors, such as Goldman Sachs, failed to discover much joy in the figures and retained their negative stances. However, supporters Hoare Govett and Smith New Court remained bullish. Hoare's Mr Nigel Barnes said: 'It was a solid set of figures and Zantac (Glaxo's headline anti-ulcer treatment) appears to be holding up very well against generic Tagamet in the US.' The shares ended 7 off at 609p.</p>

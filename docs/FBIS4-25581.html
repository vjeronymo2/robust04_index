			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yang Jianbai (2799 1017 4101) of the Economic Research </F> Institute of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences: "On Planning  and Macroregulation and Control in the Socialist Market Economy"]    [Text] Market Mechanism-Led Disposition of Resources    A market economy is an economy in which the operation of  social production changes with the market and the supply and  demand of commodities is regulated by the market mechanism. In  the context of a market economy, in order for products to attain  market share, production operators must follow the market  mechanism in utilization of resources (manpower and physical  resources). Once the utilization of resources is determined and  implemented, it works on the entire process of production.  Market mechanisms are reflected through commodity price  signals. Price changes are always caused by quantitive changes  of supply versus demand. Therefore, one can observe the market  demand on the variety and quantity of commodities through price  changes. It is by such observation and judgment that production  operators determine utilization of resources in determining  parameters and making projections. This is the very role of  market mechanism.    As we know, the operation of social production starts with  the utilization of resources and ends with the realization of  market share. In the continuous operation of social  reproduction, market reaction to past production must be used as  a link to consider and arrange utilization of resources for  current production. If all production units can correctly  analyze and master the objective reality of market changes based  on market share of the foregoing period and make accurate  projections and properly utilize resources, they should be able  to help utilization of resources society-wide move toward  optimization and promote smooth and unobstructed development of  a market economy. However, we should also be aware that the  continuous development of a market economy is driven by the  mechanism of competition. Competition among different operation  units in pursuit of their own interests promotes development on  the one hand, and, on the other, inevitably also has some  blindness, causing a market economy to experience imbalance,  fluctuations, and even crisis from time to time.    It is necessary to point out here that what is called the  role of market mechanisms means the operation and role of the  law of value in a theoretical sense, because the law of value is  brought into play via market mechanisms. What is called market  mechanism-led utilization of resources is in fact an issue of  conscious application of the law of value. The law of value is  the basic law of a commodity economy. It is in essence a law  which describes changes of value and price and, through such  changes, subsequently describes changes of supply and demand.  The basic function of the law of value lies in determination by  value, i.e., using value as the yardstick for measuring cost and  efficiency. High-efficiency products can bring high profits as  their resource consumption is less than the average; on the  other hand, low efficiency and high consumption will cause  losses. This mechanism also reflects the mechanism of  competition. It encourages the advanced and spurs the backward.  Only with outstanding efficiency can an enterprise become a  winner in competition, or else it will be eliminated.  Therefore, a production operator must be good at consciously  applying the law of value to match the utilization of resources  with the objective reality of market changes. Whether or not  the utilization of resources is appropriate finally has to be  tested by market share through economic operation.    The above discussion is based on a market economy in the  context of large-scale socialized production. This includes a  developed market system (incorporating production element  markets) and subjects of operation with independent  decisionmaking power. To achieve market mechanism-led  utilization of resources, our country naturally should create  the necessary conditions, so that it will not end up being  nothing more than empty talk.  <H5>  Market Economy Under Macroregulation and Control </H5>   In the context of a market economy, microeconomic units  always conduct their respective disposition of resources in  accordance with the requirements of supply and demand on the  market. Generally speaking, this will roughly lead to a  balanced relationship between supply and demand and therefore  lead the social economy to develop in a normal way. However, a  market economy is all-powerful, because disposition of  resources, after all, reflects human social behavior. It is  inevitable that operators engage themselves in blind competition  in pursuit of greatest profits and give rise to a state of  anarchy, which in turn lead to market mistakes, loss of market  effectiveness, and even economic crisis.    In today's China,  some blind worshippers of the market economy believe that men  are rational and rationalization of the utilization of resources  can be achieved with the "invisible hand." This assumption is  probably too naive. In fact, this theory was long ago falsified  by the experience of capitalist market economies. In modern  times, since Keynesian theory appeared, state intervention in  market economies in capitalist society has been a widely  accepted fact. Even before this, as Samuelson, an authority on  capitalist economics, put it, a capitalist market economy had  never reached the realm of total laissez-faire. Since the late  19th century, in almost all countries, the role of government in  the economy has been increasing. Today, all countries  practicing a market economy see state intervention as a routine  practice. For example, the United States, known for its  capitalist freedom, also conducts macroregulation and control on  its market economy through legal means, such as taxes and import  restrictions. Germany follows the mode of a social market.  Japan's economy is industrial policy-led, "manipulating the  economic lever with a visible hand," and is a  government-coordinated market economy. Since 1955, Japan has  drawn up 12 medium- and long-term economic plans and has now  begun to implement an economic development strategy for moving  into the 21st century. France practices what is called  "planned" market economy. Since World War II, France has never  stopped making analytic and prognostic plans and controlling its  economy with plans. As to the so-called "Asia-Pacific mode" of  the market economy, like that in the Republic of Korea, Taiwan,  and Singapore, the strength of its macrocontrol is even greater.  This was the very basis on which their economic takeoff was  established. Naturally, however, all countries and regions  practicing macroregulation and control follow the principle of  not infringing on the role of market mechanism and their purpose  is to increase orderliness in the market and reduce blindness in  market competition. Our country's socialist market economy is  naturally no exception in exercising macrocontrol, which is also  an integral part of the socialist market economic system.    The socialist market economic system is one under a  socialist  system. A socialist country should naturally take advantage of  the strengths of market mechanisms to promote the development  and prosperity of social economy. But in the meantime, it  should also use "a visible hand" to minimize blindness in market  competition and solve problems that cannot be solved with market  mechanisms alone. The intrinsic characteristic of a socialist  economy is the public ownership of the means of production.  Generally speaking, microeconomic units based on public  ownership should be receptive to state guidance to reduce  blindness in economic development. However, the reality is not  that simple. Because our market development is far from perfect  and market legislation and standards have yet to be established  or improved, such phenomena as plunging into hot fields in  swarms, blind investment, reckless starting of projects, and  overlapping production keep happening. This shows that the task  of macroregulation and control in our country is indeed an  arduous one and will take a long time to accomplish and that the  establishment and improvement of a macroregulation and control  system is truly the top priority.    As to the macroregulation and control system, the "Decision"  of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  pointed out that it is necessary to establish a mechanism that  coordinates planning, banking, and finance, so that overall  plans can be made. It also gave clear instructions on their  respective functions, which will not be repeated in this  article. Here, I would like to discuss only the issue of how to  understand the great significance of macroregulation and control.    Some people have a very incomplete understanding of  macroregulation and control, thinking that it is like "treating  the head for a headache and the foot for a footache," i.e.,  making adjustments wherever there is a problem. There is no  denying that it is necessary to find a specific remedy for any  problem that crops up in the economy and try to solve it.  However, this is not everything about the important value of  macroregulation and control. Take for example the disposition of  resources under macroregulation and control. Before  microeconomic units have even done this, there is no knowing  where the disease is. At this point, should we treat the head  or the foot? Thus it seems that the important value of  macroregulation and control should be realized with the  government establishing an overall control target for  socio-economic development and subsequently pointing out the  right direction of development for microeconomic units even  before the latter begin their disposition of resources.    The so-called control target, to put it in a nutshell,  refers  to the definition of what to encourage and what to restrict in a  country's development and the definition of what necessary  economic policies and measures to adopt toward the encouraged or  restricted industrial sectors. The publication of this target  should guide microeconomic units to conduct their own  disposition of resources and economic activities with this as  the beacon and road sign. In fact, when economic operation runs  into problems, a country's macroregulation and control should  also be conducted with this set target as criterion and  yardstick. It is in no way an aimless, no-principle practice of  "treating the head for a headache and the foot for a footache."  It goes without saying that the control target for on-going  economic development is also based on the market economy.  However, though it comes from market realities, it is higher  than this. In other words, it has gone through distillation and  become a beacon for the development of market economy.    Macroregulation and Control and Planned Management    The development of socialist market economy is based on  market mechanisms and led by macroregulation and control. The  two elements are mutually complementary and bring out the best  in each other. Together, they promote social and economic  development and prosperity. In the past, some people had too  many doubts and worries about commodity and market economies, a  fear of slipping down the capitalist road. In fact, the  intrinsic distinction between socialism and capitalism lies in  the difference of ownership and distribution systems. But a  market economy is a shared form of economic operation in the  context of large-scale socialized production.    Since the beginning of reform and opening up, people have  changed and gradually improved their understanding of the  importance of commodity and market economies. But some people  are dreaming of a laissez-faire market economy and lack a  correct understanding of the necessity of macroeconomic control  and planned management in the development of market economy, as  if planning is something that should be done away with. Some  people are frightened of the thought of planning, avoid talking  about it, and even play down its significance, for fear of a  resurgence of "planning."    Before reform started, there were indeed many mistakes in  our  planning system and work, such as excessive, overly strict, and  overly rigid controls, centralism, pushing through of mandatory  plans, and acting on administrative orders. As a result, the  planned economy became a command and monopoly economy, with the  euphemistic epithet of "the superiority of a planned economy"  which gave a sense of pride. Back in the 1920's, Lenin warned  that "the biggest danger is to bureaucratize the issue of state  economic planning.... The complete, all-inclusive, and true  planning equals `bureaucratic fantasy.' Do not pursue this kind  of fantasy." Regrettably, however, our mistake happened to be  the pursuit of this kind of fantasy and we happened to commit  the mistake of this "biggest danger." Our reform in planning is  to eliminate this planning system, in which "bureaucracy kills,"  and the many long-standing maladies deriving from it. It does  not mean we do not need planning any more.    By suggesting that the future society should have planning,  Marx meant that it was necessary to use planned, organized  production to replace the state of anarchy so that proportionate  and orderly social and economic development could be maintained.  He did not mention how to implement this idea specifically.  Lenin said: Any plan is a yardstick, criterion, beacon, road  sign, and so on and so forth. In our reform, we must firmly and  thoroughly eliminate all maladies of the old planning system.  But this does not mean we do not need planning. We must not  throw out the baby with the bath water.    In the past two years, authorities at all levels have been  emphasizing macroregulation and control. This is perfectly  correct. In my opinion, macroregulation-control and planned  management are "one and the same." All the tasks related to  macroregulation and control, such as the balance of total supply  and demand, structural optimization, and development speed, are  part of economic planning. As pointed out in the "Decision" of  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee,  planning means "determining a strategy for national economic and  social development, the targets of macroregulation and control,  and industrial policies; doing a good job in economic  forecasting; and designing major economic structures, the  pattern of distribution of productive forces, national land  improvement and development, and key construction projects."  This shows that macroregulation and control is based on  macroplanning and macroregulation and control targets. If  planned regulation is a means, the role of planning, the  "visible hand," is brought it into play by macroregulation and  control. One can see from the "Decision" that for  macroregulation and control, its function in facing the society,  mobilizing forces, and executing tasks in the economic forefront  should be emphasized, while for planning, its function as an  economic advisory sector of a macrostrategic and policy nature  should be highlighted.    The planned management of our country since reform began has  been mainly medium-term and long-term planning, focusing on  guidance and coordination. The macroregulation and control  system comprises planning, banking, and finance, all of which  are concerned with overall interests. However, banking and  finance aim at giving play to their respective roles in monetary  credit, fiscal, and taxation fields. It is planning and  planning alone which oversees the overall development of the  economy, and brings together and coordinates economic relations  among various quarters. The planning organ is a brain trust and  the designing institute of social-economic development, which  draws grand blueprints. Accomplishing this important task  requires the guidance of superior political-economic ideas and  scientific viewpoints. The crux of the matter is that the  subjective should correctly or relatively correctly reflect the  objective, and subjective initiative should be integrated with  objective law in an organic way.    As far as short-term  planning is concerned, it is naturally necessary to be led by  market mechanisms and to base planning on the law of value,  i.e., referring to market information, determining parameters,  making forecasts, and formulating rational and feasible  macroplans. I must point out here that state macroplanning is  not a simple simulation of the market. For instance, the  industrial structure and infrastructure are designed by the  state by considering the overall needs of social-economic  development and are for the purpose of showing enterprises the  right way to go in their development. As to medium- and  long-term planning, it is even less likely that a solution could  be found by merely relying on market mechanisms.    Medium- and long-term plans should also proceed from the  current market economy and result in future economic development  forecasts, but the market cannot throw much light on the  long-term future. Furthermore, a market economy arouses the  initiative of people in competing for benefits, but low-profit  or nonprofit undertakings will not receive any attention. State  macroplanning, on the other hand, must consider the needs of  overall social development. Medium- and long-term planning for a  number of years to come mainly serves the purpose of  establishing the orientation and goal of strategic development.  Therefore, it is imperative to stand high and see far by taking  into account the domestic and international political and  economic situations, analyze and predict their trends and  changes, and use them as the basis for formulating medium- and  long-term plans. Such plans should cover unified arrangement  for the balance of total supply and demand; optimization of the  industrial structure; rationalization of distribution of  productive forces; development of high and new-technology;  establishment of new industries; attaching importance to such  soft infrastructural facilities as scientific research and  education, while attending to such hard infrastructural  facilities as energy and communications; showing concern for  ecological balance and the protection and improvement of  environment; fair distribution; social welfare undertakings; and  so on and so forth. These grand and long-term strategies are  both plans and policies. Only when decisionmaking is built on  the basis of science and democracy can its feasibility and  effectiveness be enhanced. When a medium- or long-term plan is  broken down to yearly plans for implementation, it should  naturally be specified in light of the current market needs.  The implementation of macroplans, which are usually of a  guiding nature, requires the cooperation of microunits. All  this should be standardized by way of legislation.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   The development of a socialist market economy should be  subjected to macroregulation, macrocontrols and planned  management to improve its orderliness. However, fundamentally  speaking, it depends on the perfection and development of the  market system, in particular, the establishment and improvement  of the production elements market. If this market fails to  developed, the so-called market mechanism-led utilization of  resources will be a bubble. In the meantime, it is also  imperative to decontrol prices, because adjustments in market  mechanisms are signalled by price changes. Controlled and  distorted prices cannot reflect the true developments of market  mechanisms.    The subjects of enterprise operations in the behavior of a  market economy should be independent economic legal persons  which make decisions for themselves. Only such operational  subjects have the courage to go all out to come to the top in  market competition. Therefore, the state must, instead of making  promises only, truly let state-owned enterprises become  independent economic entities with decisionmaking power.  Without true enterprises, a true market economy is not  possible. In the meantime, with regard to enterprises operating  at a loss, the state should stop the absurd practice of taking  infinite responsibility for all losses. And, if they fail to  end loss-making and begin profit-making, leaders of enterprises  which suffer from losses caused by mismanagement should be  subjected to the punishment that they deserve. Only by so doing  can enterprises "responsible for profits, but not for losses,"  come back onto the right track. After ownership and management  authority are separated, no government at any level can  interfere in routine enterprise operations and management.  Legal responsibility should be affixed for those who abuse  their powers and arbitrarily interfere. (See "Regulations on  Changing the Operational Mechanisms of Industrial Enterprises  Under Ownership by the Whole People") The state is the owner of  state-owned enterprise property; the government manages and  supervises them on behalf of the state and collects profits in  proportion to the volume of investment. This is actually  performance of investor duties, not exercising state power. In  the past, those two were confused. Now, such confusion should  be put right. In my opinion, this is not a matter of changing  government functions. It is high time we stopped incorrectly  drawing a parallel between investor functions and the exercise  of state power. I would like to say in passing that the general  management functions performed by the state toward the social  economy, such as taxation, industrial and commercial  administration, macroregulation and control, and planning and  guidance apply to both non-state-owned and state-owned  enterprises. There is no question of changing functions.    In short, we must create necessary conditions for the  development of a socialist market economy and conduct necessary  macroregulation-control and guidance to standardize the market  economy and enable it to operate in an orderly way. This way,  the market will be active and the economy prosperous,  increasingly so by the year.</p>

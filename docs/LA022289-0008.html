			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND CONGESTION  </P> <P> Fielding's column was interesting and had some excellent suggestions but it  certainly did not focus on the cause of downtown congestion -- too many people  driving into the downtown area. The reason more and more people are coming  downtown is plain enough to see if you come downtown -- high-rise office  buildings of 40-plus stories. It is these hives that attract the bees.  </P> <P> It is obvious that the more hives you build the more bees you will attract and  the more congestion you will have. Does this mean that our mayor and the  developers want more congestion or don't see the connection between beehives  and bees? Of course not. They know. But they have a plan to relieve future  gridlock -- the subway at $259 million a mile.  </P> <P> Will the subway relieve congestion? It hasn't in San Francisco, Miami or any  other city where it has been tried. They are all multibillion-dollar white  elephants that have to be subsidized by the taxpayer. But the Los Angeles Metro  Rail will be different say its sponsors. It will be as successful as New York  City's subway. At the rate we are building high-rises downtown that may well  prove true. I can hardly wait.  </P> <P> JOSEPH S. DUARTE  </P> <P> Whittier  </P></p>

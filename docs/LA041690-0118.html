Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> WALDEGAARD'S 4TH SAFARI VICTORY  </P> <P> Sweden's Bjorn Waldegaard romped home to his fourth victory in the grueling  Safari Rally today after leading the diminished pack of cars for most of the  five-day 2,480-mile race through rain-drenched mountains, plains and bushland.  </P> <P> Waldegaard, 48, his face creased with a winning smile and his Toyota Celica GT4  lathered with mud, revved onto the ramp in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi to end  the 38th East Africa rally.  </P> <P> He lost 8 hours, 39 minutes, 11 seconds during the ordeal to claim his fourth  victory in 10 years.  </P> <P> Finland's Juha Kankkunen, driving a Lancia Delta Integrale, finished second  about 40 minutes later, having shed 8:41:23. Mikael Ericsson, also in a Toyota  Celica GT4, was third after losing 10:26: 58.  </P></p>

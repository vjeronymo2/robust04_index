			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Slavko Perovic, president of the Liberal </F> Alliance of Montenegro, by Marko Vukovic; place and date not  given: "Anschluss of Montenegro to Herzegovina"]    [Text] Momir Bulatovic, president of the republic,  furnished the topic for the interview of the president of the  Liberal Alliance [LSCG] when he hinted at a union of Montenegro  with Herzegovina. The increasingly frequent demands to ban the  LSCG and SDP [Social Democratic Party] [as published] made by  certain members of assemblies of northern Montenegrin opstinas  were of equal interest.    [Vukovic] What would union with Herzegovina mean for  Montenegro in the sense of its status as a state and to  Montenegrins from the nationality standpoint?    [Perovic] It is not a question of any union with  Herzegovina.  It is a question of annexation or, if you like, Anschluss, of  Montenegro to Herzegovina, so that Montenegro would forever,  according to the conception of the Serbian expansionists, be  part and parcel of the future maxi, midi, or mini Serbia. So,  Montenegro must at any price be included in Serbia. Because of  its coast from the geostrategic standpoint, because of its  history, which, using the formula of the Montenegrins as the  purest Serbs, as a people of Serbian origin, and so on, rounds  out, according to the Serbs, the overwhelming truth not only of  the five centuries of enslavement, but also, as far as the  church is concerned, of collaboration with the Turks. When  things are taken to their ultimate consequences, we learn that  Montenegro is the backbone, but also the Achilles heel, of the  Serbian expansionist project. Nikolaj Velimirovic put it this  way: "Serbism without Montenegro is like a body without bones."  So, following a de facto annexation, the Montenegrins would very  quickly be presented a demand to become Serbs, since, as  President Bulatovic threatened with the authority of his  authoritarian state, the Montenegrins are of Serb origin, so  that it is truly illogical, when they are of Serb origin, for  them not to be Serbs today, but Montenegrins, a Comintern  nationality invented somewhere else. In any case, when it  becomes part of Herzegovina, a major change occurs in the ethnic  structure to the advantage of Serbs, who will then vote for  regionalization of the future unitary Serbian state, in which  nothing would be left of Montenegro but the folklore. So, this  is a betrayal of the national interests of Montenegro....    [Vukovic] One gets the impression that the development of  events in Bosnia, I am referring above all to the U.S.  initiative to create a Muslim-Croat federation, which would then  enter into a confederation with the Republic of Croatia, could  favor the suggested integration.    [Perovic] It is my impression that the Americans and  Russians  have taken over Bosnian territory. The Russian side, make no  mistake about it, is cooperating with the Americans. It is  merely helping Milosevic and Karadzic to celebrate every defeat  they experience, in keeping with Serbian tradition. The entire  world saw Karadzic's celebration after withdrawal under the NATO  threat. And it is clear on this occasion that if Yeltsin had not  made the request, Karadzic and Mladic would have given NATO a  kick in the rear. It is my belief that Bosnia will be buttoned  up, that the confederation will turn out to have been only a  lure to join the negotiations. I am convinced that Bulatovic  "fired off" Herzegovina only in order to throw out a new bone  for this unhappy people to gnaw on, a trick to make it forget  the fact that it is imprisoned and that this was done to it by  the Montenegrin-Herzegovinian-Serbian separatists, who have made  of it their own reservation on which, so they hope, they will be  the chiefs for a long time yet....    [Vukovic] Many refer to Mr. Bulatovic's statement as an open  claim to territory of neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina, which  has been internationally recognized. How do you assess the  effect of that act on the attitude of the international  community towards Montenegro?    [Perovic] The idea of union with Herzegovina has the  additional goal of destroying any thought of any Montenegrin  position in foreign policy. Bulatovic's move subjects Montenegro  to a defeat and mockery in the international arena and will  contribute to its being globally satanized once again. This is  all being done intentionally in order to destroy Montenegro. The  result is the same as achieved at one time by Prevlaka, then  Dubrovnik, then Zhirinovsky.... This question should be put to  Montenegro's foreign minister, since the ministry still has not  spoken out, which might be interpreted as support for the views  of Bulatovic and Djukanovic; otherwise, the moral thing to do is  resign.    [Vukovic] Do you believe the idea of creating the Republic  of  Montenegro and Herzegovina, as they say it would be called, was  conceived in the head of President Bulatovic?    [Perovic] Bulatovic and Vucurovic are excellent friends, and  they are both entirely devoted to Slobodan. It is clear than an  idea like this could not have been conceived in the heads of  those two, since they are not here to create, but to execute.  The idea is Belgrade's, the execution is Podgorica's, just as  January 1989 established. If things take that course, the idea  is strategic in the sense that Montenegro is killed off for good  within the framework of some alliance of Serbian states,  countries, cantons, or whatever they might be.    [Vukovic] How would the LSCG react if a referendum were  called for unification of Montenegro with Herzegovina?    [Perovic] That referendum, if it should come about, will be  carried out under the same conditions as the recent referendum  on annexation of Montenegro to Serbia. We boycotted that  referendum, we would boycott this one as well.    [Vukovic] What impact would that event have on interethnic  relations in the republic?    [Perovic] It would heat them to the glowing point. There  would be no place in this state for Montenegrins, Muslims,  Albanians, and the few Croats who have remained in Montenegro.  At the same time, I think that the Montenegrins would be in the  worst position, since the other groupings would be protected by  the international community, but it will not protect us, since,  as Bulatovic says, we are of Serb origin, that is, Serbs. In  that scenario even the Serbs in the People's Party will be  undesirable, since the entire project was conceived as an act of  destroying Montenegro's statehood, so that the question of the  sea would be solved for the Serbian side once and for all. The  existence of a state bothers them, since that is the means by  which the sea is kept out of their complete control, regardless  of whether it is a Serbian or Montenegrin state. And that is the  only reason why Seselj and his office were set up in Montenegro  and that is why even Kilibarda is a traitor from their  standpoint.    [Vukovic] Now that we have touched upon the topic of  interethnic relations, which it seems have been additionally  strained by the arrests of the leaders of the SDA [Democratic  Action Party], we should note that there have been more frequent  demands to ban the LSCG and the SDA!    [Perovic] We are precise in our views, and they expose the  Serbian expansionist project, which ultimately, or even above  all, is disastrous for the Serbian people itself. We get in the  way, since we are a party of the authentic liberal democratic  option, that is, of the civil option; we further our objectives  exclusively by democratic means, which even the world at large  has recognized through my foreign political contacts, and has  supported us in this. That is why we are an embarrassing  opponent, that is why they need to ban us, not only because of  our objective, an independent Montenegro, but because of the  truth that we convey and communicate unashamedly. All the  groupings in Montenegro have been armed by the government --  either directly or under its tranquil eye. Those who were naive  took the weapons, not realizing that weapons could not solve  anything, since this is not 1784, but 1994. Those weapons have  turned into a trap for those who accepted them, and the  government will take advantage of this regardless of the  religious, ethnic or other allegiance of those who possess them,  since political accounts are settled with arrests like the  arrest of the SDA, using the form of protecting the public  order. Someone decided the Muslims need to be intimidated once  again, perhaps pushed once again in the direction of Bulatovic,  who mentioned them in such mellifluous terms at the recent  congress of the DPS [Democratic Party of Socialists]. Perhaps an  election is being prepared. Who knows what they are up to. I  have information that something is being prepared for us and for  me in particular. One would say that it is our turn. But,  whatever happens, we are ready for him!    [Vukovic] Along with the "spontaneous" demands to ban the  LSCG, an attempt is being made to cast your party in the image  of a terrorist organization. To that end the Montenegrin  ministry of internal affairs has been showing a surprising  propensity toward graphomania.    [Perovic] The Montenegrin public is aware of all the  government's efforts to satanize the LSCG. This has had a  definite impact with a certain number of people. But we have  managed to achieve the opposite result with an immense number of  people. We were not taken in by the provocations, by the plants,  by the offers of posts in the government, by the threats, nor  will we be. We are aware that we are being infiltrated by  "spies," by agents provocateurs, that at some point an agent  provocateur will be activated to portray us in the light they  want. We know that, we see them, it is all right. That is their  technology for holding onto power, but nothing will stop us,  nothing....</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] On 4 May the European Parliament (EP)  passed a motion in Strasbourg reminding Italy, which is  currently organizing a new government that includes members of  the neofascist National Alliance (AN), that it must continue  adherence to the principles it endorsed as a founding member of  the European Union (EU). Reaction in the Italian press has  varied from condemnation of the motion to demands that the AN  formally reject fascism.    The motion, which passed by one vote, stated: "The European  Parliament demands that EU members let the president of the  Republic of Italy clearly know that his government must be  faithful to the fundamental values upon which the European  Community was founded, after the horrors of fascism and Nazism."  Only the Italian-language version of the motion contained the  reference to the "horrors of fascism and Nazism," which prompted  an apology and a promise to investigate the matter from EP  President Egon Klepsch, according to the Turin daily LA STAMPA  of 5 May.  <H5>  Top Leaders React </H5>   An article in the Milan daily IL SOLE--24 ORE of 6 May  reported that Italy's top political leaders denounced the EU  motion. According to the daily, the motion prompted a "harsh"  reply by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. The president of the  Senate, Carlo Scognamiglio, and of the Chamber of Deputies,  Irene Pivetti, wrote letters to Klepsch expressing their "strong  regret" for the approval of a motion which to many "seemed like  interference in national sovereignty." The article reported  that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Luigi Abete, president  of the General Confederation of Italian Industry  (Confindustria), lauded Scalfaro's reply, as did outgoing Prime  Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. According to the article,  Berlusconi said the EP is "incapable of understanding the new"  and is guilty of "reasoning with the old schemes." National  Alliance (AN) leader Gianfranco Fini said the motion was "an  instrumental polemic carried out by the Left, destined to be  deflated as soon as the government receives the confidence of  parliament." Northern League ideologue Gianfranco Miglio said  it was a "classic case of limitation of sovereignty." The  leftist opposition, from Democratic Party of the Left (PDS)  Secretary Achille Occhetto to Communist Renewal member Ersilia  Salvato, were less offended and said they could not understand  Scalfaro's reaction, because the motion in no way damaged  Italy's independence and was a "legitimate" and even "opportune"  political act, the article reported. Outgoing Foreign Minister  Beniamino Andreatta of the Italian Popular Party said the motion  expressed the "sentiment that is widespread among European  leaders."  <H5>  Invalidating Motion Considered </H5>   An article by IL SOLE's EU correspondent Adriana Cerretelli,  which appeared on the same date, reported on efforts by Klepsch  to smooth things over by saying he "deplored the assembly's  undeserved unwarranted interference in the affairs of a member  state" and did not exclude that the vote could be invalidated  because of the difference in the text between the Italian  version and those in other languages. Italian Social Movement  Eurodeputy Cristiana Muscardini has requested that the vote be  invalidated, saying the motion was "unjust interference in the  nomination process of Italian ministers and a serious injury to  the dignity of, as well as discrimination against, the new  majority which resulted from democratic elections." According  to Cerretelli, certain "ill-intentioned" individuals connected  the affair to PDS leader Occhetto's presence at the parliament  during the vote.  <H5>  Commentaries Assess EU Jurisdiction, AN Values </H5>   In a commentary in Milan's PANORAMA of 14 May, Gianni Baget  Bozzo wrote that in trying to exert power the EP often exceeds  its jurisdiction, but that it has never gone as far as its  recent instructions to Scalfaro on the moral and political  standards of the new government. According to Baget Bozzo,  Italy's longtime loyalty has been repaid by an insult. It is  understandable, he wrote, that the mere fact "postfascists" will  sit in the EP could upset some individuals, but the concern is  excessive and self-serving. After having accepted for years  that Italy was a country where communism was different because  of national character, it was incorrectly believed Italy's  European partners would think the same about the neofascist  party. Baget Bozzo suggested that Italians explain to their  European counterparts that the neofascists have been members of  Italian democracy since 1947 and have in fact been regularly  used in the political game by both the Christian Democrats (DC)  and the Communists. The DC used them as allies and the  Communists never wanted the party outlawed for fear their votes  would go to the DC, giving it an absolute majority. Thus the  European partners have collaborated with a political system in  which the neofascists were a functional part, Baget Bozzo wrote.  It is precisely because it is so old that the Italian  neofascist party cannot be compared with the French, German, and  Austrian nationalist movements. The National Alliance is more  postfascist than the progressives are postcommunists, Baget  Bozzo maintained. In any case, Baget Bozzo argued, no EU  institution can dispute the composition of the government of a  member state.    PANORAMA correspondent Renzo Rosati wrote on the same day  that the verb "demand" is not part of the regular Europarliament  vocabulary. It has never been used in reference to the highest  institutions of an EU member. Rosati thus found Scalfaro  entirely justified when he wrote the EU that "Italy's loyalty to  the principles which are at the roots of Europe is a clear and  undisputed fact that does not need reminders or instructors."    Commentator Marcello Sorgi wrote in the Turin daily LA  STAMPA  of 5 May that, although the Parliament's motion "constitutes an  absolutely exceptional incident and unprecedented interference  by a supranational organ in the political and institutional life  of a member country," it is also a fact that the current  situation in Italy is seen throughout West Europe as an anomaly.  To date, little emphasis has been placed on the problem of  having postfascists in a government that is a member of the EU,  Sorgi maintained. Thanks to the European reaction to this  phenomenon it can no longer be ignored.    In addition to its news reports on the incident, LA STAMPA  of  6 May reported the comments of former Chamber of Deputies  President Nilde Iotti of the PDS. Iotti said she could  understand how the Italian situation may be viewed as worrisome  but added that the Europarliament's resolution was a little  "overbearing." She could not recall a position of this type  ever being taken before and called it an interference in Italian  internal affairs. Iotti termed the motion "something unusual  and of a certain seriousness." She said that President  Scalfaro, rather than express offense, should have tried to  offer the Europeans some guarantees.    Also on 6 May, LA STAMPA ran a front-page commentary by  journalist Sergio Romano in which he said that although no  European forum exists that can dictate regulations on the  formation of the Berlusconi government, an "Italian problem"  does exist which can "upset foreign observers." If the First  Republic had not gone into crisis, Romano wrote, the AN would  still be an outsider and no one would have asked AN leader Fini  to cut his ties with the hardline members of his party.  According to Romano, Fini seems determined to promote democracy  in his party; he must, therefore, recognize the two souls of the  AN, reject the undemocratic one, and bring to full completion  the democratization process begun a few months ago. Fini must  do this, Romano wrote, because the people have a right to know  exactly what the AN is, what its ideology and political values  are, what programs it intends to work for. If he does this  quickly, Romano concludes, "no one will pay attention to the  `Catos' in Strasbourg; if he continues to hesitate, the  Berlusconi government will be born with an `original sin' for  which everyone will end up paying."    Angelo Bolaffi's commentary in the Rome daily IL MESSAGGERO  of 6 May tried to assess whether the "Italian case" was provoked  by "unjustified reactions and ill-intentioned insinuations." He  concluded that the EP motion expressed a real problem in the  wrong way. Thus the motion cannot be ignored and rejected as an  inadmissible intrusion in the internal affairs of the country.  According to Bolaffi, the way the vote was held was a mistake,  as it split the Parliament in two. Since those who voted  against the motion can hardly be suspected of being fascists, it  is evident, he wrote, that the motion distorted the facts in a  way that damaged the image of European institutions. "Why  criticize Berlusconi's intentions without first waiting to see  what the outcome will be?" Romano asked. A real problem does  exist, he added, observing that during AN demonstrations the  fascist "Roman salute" is still in use and Fini pretends not to  see it. More clarity is needed from the AN, especially a formal  condemnation of the fascist era. The AN must do what the old  Italian Communist Party did--make a formal act of abjuration.  Otherwise, it will continue to be politically excluded in Europe.    The Rome daily LA REPUBBLICA of 6 May published a front-page  commentary by journalist Alberto Cavallari saying that the clash  between Scalfaro and the EP over the entry of neofascists in the  Italian Government presents some real problems. First, it is an  interference by the EU in the internal affairs of a member  state. Second, it shows a lack of respect for the will of the  Italian people, which was violated by the warning issued in  Strasbourg. Third is the international isolation Italy is  risking with a government that includes neofascists; the  Rome-Strasbourg clash confirms this possibility. While the EP  motion has created these problems, Cavallari nevertheless wrote  that the EP has a right to make appeals and issue instructions  to its member states because it was legally elected by those  states. The EU is no longer an economic community but a  European political union that is headed towards  supranationality. It therefore has the legitimate right to  issue ethical and political guidance to its member states. Were  that not the case, the EP could never vote on decisions that in  any way modify the sovereignty of its members. Europe,  Cavallari observed, is not "foreign": "We are this Europe; its  parliamentarians are ours."</p>

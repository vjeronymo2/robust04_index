			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> POLICE PROBE OF STOCK SCANDAL URGED  </P> <P> Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy called today for a police investigation into  an insider-trading scandal surrounding the takeover of New York-based Triangle  Industries Inc. by Pechiney, a French state-owned firm.  </P> <P> Signaling a change of tactics by the Socialist government, he said a legal  inquiry was necessary whatever the outcome of an investigation by the COB,  France's stock exchange watchdog.  </P> <P> Beregovoy was answering questions from a parliamentary committee about the  "Pechiney affair" in which government insiders are accused of exploiting  confidential information to make large profits on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> "All the truth must be known. This affair, which is causing problems, will not  be covered up," he told a public session.  </P> <P> The inquiry was launched after a tip-off by the U.S. Securities and Exchange  Commission over active trading in the shares of Triangle just before news of  its purchase by Pechiney, an aluminum company.  </P></p>

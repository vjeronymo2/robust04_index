			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 3 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Russia  agreed Thursday to jointly develop a natural gas field in  Yakutia Autonomous Republic in eastern Siberia to supply gas  through a pipeline to Seoul.    President Kim Yong-sam, visiting Moscow until Saturday, and  Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed to invest 10 million U.S.  dollars apiece in a year-long feasibility study of the project  at their expanded summit meeting, a senior member of Kim's  entourage said. The project, costing 15-20 billion dollars in  total, will include development of gas fields and construction  of a pipeline connecting Yakutsk, Khabarovsk and Wonsan in North  Korea to Seoul -- and further to Japan if things go well, he  said.    The two governments signed an agreement to develop the Yakut  gas field in 1992, but could not narrow their differences on the  project's details. "But President Yeltsin proposed that each  country invest 10 million dollars this time, so the agreement  could be reached," he said.    He added, "It may take one or two years to decide if the  field is worth developing, and if it is worth it, the two  countries will have to further study the field's feasibility  more closely for another two years." If all goes well, he added,  the two nations will be able to start the project in 1998.    Eleven South Korean companies including Korea Petroleum  Development Corp., Daewoo, Samsung and Yukong Ltd. have already  formed a consortium, while Russia and Yakutia have set up their  own consortiums.    "In addition to promoting the economies of the two  countries,  the project may contribute to forming a basis for unification of  the two Koreas since the pipeline goes through North Korea to  the South," he said.    Seoul and Moscow plan to discuss securing the development  rights to the gas field, whose estimated deposits come to 590  million tons, and consult with North Korea on construction of  the pipeline.    Meanwhile, Kim and Yeltsin also agreed to push for other  projects that help promote South Korean investment in Russia  such as construction of a trade center in Moscow, designation of  a wharf for exclusive use by South Korean ships, construction of  a bonded factory and preparation of an industrial complex for  South Korean businesses.    The two countries inaugurated three research and development  centers in Moscow to promote bilateral technological cooperation  and commemorate President Kim's visit to the Russian capital.</p>

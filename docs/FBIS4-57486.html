			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 19 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, official  sources reported the Government of the Dominican Republic has  denounced the alleged interference of journalists and  international observers in Monday's electoral process.    The Foreign Ministry warned that if state security is  violated, the authorities will try to stop these actions, which  are considered "antidemocratic" and which have sometimes been  carried out in a "veiled" manner and "brazenly blatant" in  others.    In a communique issued this evening, the Foreign Ministry  stated that the alleged interference of the media and  international envoys is part of an "international conspiracy to  unite Haiti and Santo Domingo." The document, signed by Foreign  Minister Juan Aristides Taveras, added that the actions carried  out during and after the electoral process by the media and  international observers "is definitely unacceptable."    In an interview with the U.S. network Telemundo, Dominican  President Joaquin Balaguer said the reports of fraud issued by  the opposition do not alter the social peace that prevails in  Santo Domingo after the general elections. "I believe this is  an international plot rather than a result of Pena Gomez'  claims; this has something to do with the Haitian problem, and  it is the old idea of integrating the two countries," the  87-year-old Balaguer said.    On Thursday [19 May], the Dominican Revolutionary Party  (PRD)  began to gather the necessary evidence to prove the alleged  fraud perpetrated in Monday's general elections. Social  Democrat Francisco Pena Gomez ordered his lawyers to prepare the  corresponding writs and lists, with names and voters numbers, of  party members who were not able to vote in different provinces.    Pena Gomez said the complete set of documents will be  delivered to the Central Electoral Board (JCE) and "to the world  as proof of the colossal fraud perpetrated against us."</p>

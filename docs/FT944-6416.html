			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Akzo Nobel's hydro-power operations put up for sale Akzo Nobel, the Dutch-Swedish chemicals group, is planning to sell its hydro-power operations to Stockholm Energi, Sweden's third-largest energy producer. Analysts said the deal could be worth more than SKr2bn (Dollars 160.7m) on a debt-free basis. The move will end a century-long involvement by Nobel in the energy business and is in line with its strategy of focusing on core businesses. Akzo Nobel, formed this year through the merger of Sweden's Nobel Industries and Akzo of the Netherlands, has a 40 per cent stake in Njordkraft, which owns four medium-sized and three smaller hydro-power plants in Sweden with a combined production capacity of 940 gigawatt hours. The plants have traditionally met about 50 per cent of the group's Swedish energy needs. The remaining Njordkraft shares are held by financial investors, mainly pension funds and insurance groups. Akzo has options to purchase these shares next year, enabling Stockholm Energi to gain full control of the concern. Mr Dag Stromqvist, managing director of Eka Nobel, said: 'We are not in the power business. We are in the chemicals business.' He declined to disclose terms, saying talks were at an early stage. Stockholm Energi produces around 13 terawatt hours of electricity a year. Half its output is generated by nuclear power and 35 per cent by hydro-electric power.</p>

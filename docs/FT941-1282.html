			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: US banks move to protect their margins - A look at the industry's response to rising interest rates US banks had seldom had it so good. The falling interest rates and steep US yield curve of the 1990s had created an ideal banking environment. How, though, will they cope with a reversal of these benign factors? The question has bedevilled bank stocks since last October, when the rally in long-term Treasury bonds first hit a block and yields began to climb. Now, with long-term bond yields a full percentage point higher, and seven weeks after the Federal Reserve first moved to push up short-term rates, the banks have made their most direct reply to the Fed. Led by NorWest and BancOne, a raft of money centre and regional banks pushed up their prime lending rates by a quarter of a percentage point late on Wednesday and yesterday, to 6 1/4 per cent. It was the first general rise in prime rates - used as the basis for pricing mainly small business, credit card and some other consumer loans - since 1989. By the banks' calculation, the move will help to protect lending margins, which remain at historically high levels. Bank net interest margins last year were around half a percentage point higher than they had been at the start of the decade - some 3.75 per cent at money centre banks, and 4.5 per cent at the big regional banks. Strong consumer loan demand has made it easier to raise rates. According to BancOne, the Ohio-based bank with one of the country's biggest regional groups, demand from consumers was up 20 per cent in the final months of 1993, compared with a year before. Although dented slightly by the bad weather of January and February, that demand continues strong, it says. Even commercial lending is looking up, after three years of declines. Commercial loans are up 3 per cent, BancOne reports. The fact that the prime rate rise was restricted to a quarter of a point, though, indicates lending margins will inevitably narrow as market interest rates rise. The rise falls short of the half point increase which the Fed has engineered in market rates since the beginning of February. As a result, the spread between the Federal Funds rate and banks' prime rate  -a key determinant of lending margins - has fallen to 2 3/4 percentage points, from 3 percentage points. But the prime move is only one of several factors affecting bank margins. For a start, the interest rates charged on residential mortgages - the fastest-growing category for banks last year - are tied directly to bond yields, and have ratchetted up in recent months. Competition for some types of asset, such as credit card loans, has also already forced margins down. Chase Manhattan, for instance, saw its average credit card loans fall slightly last year, to Dollars 5.9bn, as a result of 'aggressive offers made by new entrants in an already competitive marketplace'. Its response: to cut the average interest rate on its cards during the year to 16.66 per cent, from 17.48 per cent in 1992. As interest rates rise, it will be difficult for credit card companies to increase their borrowing rates, putting pressure on what are still substantial lending margins. While these factors suggest bank margins will fall, a secular shift in their business suggests they also have ways to mitigate the damage. With big companies turning to the capital markets for finance, banks have lent more of their money to the smaller businesses and consumers who pay higher interest rates. Four years ago, some 47 per cent of Chase's lending in the US was to consumers: by last year, that proportion had risen to 65 per cent. While banks wrestle with the question of how far to push up the pricing of their loans, bank treasurers face a different dilemma. For the past three years, their treasury departments have boosted bank profits, partly by investing their floating rate money in the fixed-income markets. The opportunities have diminished: the spread between three-month and 10-year Treasury notes, at 355 basis points at the start of 1993, had fallen to 265 basis points by the start of this year. (Rattled by the Fed's February increase, it has since edged back up to 300 basis points.) Bank treasurers have also used the swaps market to enhance their margins, agreeing to make floating rate payments in return for receiving fixed rate payments. How far have swaps boosted margins - and to what extent will rising rates affect the position? Given the lack of published information about how banks use the swaps markets, those questions bemuse analysts and have added to the uncertainty surrounding bank margins, helping to destabilise stock prices. Even serious attempts at keeping the markets informed seem destined to fail. Mr John McCoy, chairman of BancOne, whose big swaps book had long been an object of investor concern, made an unprecedented attempt to educate analysts and investors last year about how it used these derivative financial instruments. His reward: the bank's stock fell even further, undermining at least one all-stock takeover it had planned.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (7): Cash flow is the main problem - Furniture industry LOREDANA SARTI says she was convinced the Italian furniture industry could fail at any minute when she joined the Milan-based employers' organisation, Federlegno-Arredo, as an economist some 15 years ago. 'I kept trying to explain the miracle of its survival,' she said. 'It had no logic, as it is based on small, family-owned companies without access to capital. But the logic is that these continue to invest in bad times, renouncing profits.' That remains largely true of Italy's 35,000 furniture companies - only 4,500 of which have more than 15 employees - when the industry is suffering a 4.2 per cent fall in production, according to Federlegno figures for the first five months of 1993. The independent CSIL institute in Milan, which monitors the furniture industry and whose forecasts are much respected, predicts a 5 per cent fall for the whole year because of the contraction of the domestic market. 'We have done everything we can to hang on, but it is undeniable it is not an easy time,' says Ms Sarti, pointing out that new kitchens and three-piece suites slip lower down a family's shopping list during a recession. She estimates, however, that only one company in a thousand is going out of business and says that cash flow, rather than lower sales, is the biggest problem, with long delays in settling bills. But relief is provided by exports for which all the familiar winning cards of Italian manufacturing have come into play. Design flair and an emphasis on high-quality, customised products have turned Italy into the world's leading furniture exporter, overtaking Germany five years ago. In fact 33 per cent of Italy's sales are to overseas customers, mostly within the EC. The devaluation of the lira helps to explain the 16.3 per cent rise in first-quarter exports reported by Federlegno for this year but this will be countered by the higher cost of imported raw materials, 80 per cent of which come from abroad. On a turnover of L24,000bn in 1992, exports of L8,300bn dwarfed imports of L790bn. Although Italian industry in general began to lose ground during the second half of 1990, the minimal impact of furniture imports on the domestic market meant that sales held up well until the latter half of last year. In fact, turnover increased slightly last year, from L21,000bn in 1991. The sector hit hardest in the domestic market has been office furniture, which accounts for 10 per cent of production, partly because businesses are saving costs on fittings and also because the 'Tangentopoli' bribes scandal has brought public sector projects largely to a standstill. A total of 180,000 workers are employed in making household and office furniture. The industry, betraying its artisan roots, is grouped in four geographical areas and dominated by second or third generation, family-owned companies. There is the Brianza district in Lombardy, stretching from north Milan to Lake Como. Another formidable cluster is in the Veneto, with chair production based on Udine, while kitchen furniture features prominently in the third area, Tuscany. Pesaro on the Adriatic provides the fourth group and exports heavily to the Middle East. Family ownership still dominates even the big companies. But this year, Natuzzi, Italy's leading maker of leather furniture, surprised its rivals by floating part of its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. With a turnover of more than L300bn and 1,700 workers, it is unusual in that it is based in the south, at Bari in Puglia. Partly because of its isolation it has developed a vertically-integrated structure, allowing start-to-finish production of its upholstery. Another rare case among the big companies is the Brianza upholsterer, Cassina, which has been taken over by a foreign concern - Strafor, the European arm of Steelcase of the US. The fragmented nature of the industry does prompt concern. 'I think the pace of concentration could and should be quicker,' says Mr Mino Politi of CSIL. Federlegno is of the same view and believes the industry is moving in this direction: in the Veneto, for example, several companies have come under the umbrella of a holding company, Arc Linea Arredamenti. This fragmentation is reflected in a poor distribution network, which is perhaps the industry's main weakness. A multitude of dealers supply 25,000 retail outlets, but chains such as Ikea of Sweden are beginning to enter the market. Greater concentration of outlets with guarantees of high quality products and good after-sales service, as in the toys and electric goods markets, cannot come too quickly as far as Mr Aldo Alberti is concerned. His company, Alberti, manufactures kitchens at Bovisio Masciago, a village in the heart of the Brianza. 'In Brianza we have paid too much attention to the product and not enough to the structure of the business,' he says. 'We need more than a good product; we need synergy.' Mr Alberti and his two brothers have developed the company started by their father into a high-quality kitchen manufacturer with 20 workers and a turnover of L4.5bn. Innovative products such as one-piece mini-kitchens have built up their exports since the late-1980s to 25 per cent of sales. Devaluation has not aided them greatly, he says, because quality and design are more relevant to their output than price. But this year the company has still unveiled new products and is refurbishing the factory. 'In moments of crisis I believe you have to support the business with extraordinary measures,' he says. 'Either you reduce investment or you put your hand in your pocket, taking savings and using profits.' The same philosophy guides one of the top players, B&amp;B Italia, which is also in the Brianza and has 500 workers. Run by the Busnelli family, it expects to increase 1992 turnover of L155bn to L210bn this year. 'Thanks to the competitive lira we have managed to cover the fall in domestic demand with exports,' says Mr Giorgio Busnelli, managing director. Besides office furniture and a wide range of household products, B&amp;B Italia has a marine division, fitting out ships, which is performing strongly. The previous high interest rates have forced the company to plough back profits, rather than borrow, when it comes to investment. But as a big group with fixed costs, including 14 managers and 25 research staff, 'we can't follow a policy of staying at home, with no more investment or advertising,' says Mr Busnelli. 'The only way to survive is to invest.' Flexibility and family ownership, as demonstrated by Alberti and B&amp;B Italia, will remain key characteristics of furniture-making for some time to come. But this is a relatively young industry and greater concentration is sure to follow.</p>

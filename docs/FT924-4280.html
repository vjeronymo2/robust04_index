			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Customs to advise on tax avoidance HM CUSTOMS &amp; EXCISE is to issue guidelines on what constitutes 'unacceptable tax avoidance', Sir Brian Unwin, chairman, told the public accounts committee yesterday. It has been delayed by the difficulty in distinguishing avoidance from legitimate 'tax mitigation', he said. Customs defined mitigation as attempts to reduce the tax burden within the spirit of the law, while avoidance is not and may be challenged by officials. Sir Brian said he was aware that businesses wanted to be told by Customs what was acceptable, but Customs did not want to set guidance 'in concrete'. 'That might deny ourselves room for manoevure,' he said.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Granada stock sold off The first of the expected bouts of selling of Granada shares following Friday's successful bid for LWT was said to have come from Warburg Pincus, the US venture capital group which had been a firm supporter of the London broadcaster. Dealers had initially thought that the sellers might be LWT directors, who have a combined stake of 10 per cent in LWT and are widely expected to be among those seeking to sell their new Granada shares. Some 112m have been issued as part of the Pounds 760m takeover. The US group was not returning calls yesterday. Dealers said a number of institutions which are holders of both stocks and are now overweight in the combined group are also likely to be restructuring their portfolios, adding to the selling pressure. There was some confusion over the size of the Warburg Pincus stake, with market sources putting the number of shares at 9.4m, while the Seaq ticker registered twice that amount being bought at 543p, with large trades going through the other side at 548p. Dealers said Cazenove and Hoare Govett had placed the stock, although it was unclear as to whether all the shares had been successfully sold. Granada fell 7 to 555p, with turnover reaching 32m.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Oxford St store sold for Pounds 34.5m LEGAL &amp; GENERAL, the insurance company, has sold the DH Evans department store in Oxford Street for Pounds 34.5m to a private German investment company. The deal is the latest in a series of purchases by German investors of large amounts of London property over the past six months. However, the deal bucks this trend in that it concerns a retail property, rather than an office, and it was struck at a relatively low yield (the ratio of income to capital value) of 7.2 per cent. The relatively high price paid reflects the possibility that the building might be partially converted into offices or smaller shop units at a later date. The building of 335,000 sq ft is let to House of Fraser Stores on a lease that has 90 years to run. The current rent, which was settled in 1991, is Pounds 7.50 a sq ft.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Chinese using Apec to force pace on Gatt China appears intent on slowing progress towards agreement on an Asia-Pacific free trade zone pending resolution of its dispute with the US over membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the granting of unconditional Most Favoured Nation trading status. Mr Li Zhongzhou, director-general of the Department of International Trade and Economic Relations, yesterday indicated that Beijing would use the Apec card to exert pressure on the US in Gatt negotiations. China objects to continued US refusal to grant unconditional MFN as part of a Gatt agreement and says this violates a 'fundamental principle' of international trade. 'China is basically in favour of trade liberalisation, but on the condition that we enjoy the same kind of privileges as other members of Apec,' said Mr Li just weeks before leaders of member economies are due to meet in Indonesia to discuss the free trade zone proposal. China is locked in difficult discussions with the US on Gatt accession, with the Americans demanding further trade liberalisation as the price of entry. Washington has also made it clear that US law prevents it granting China unconditional MFN. Mr Li said members of Apec should proceed cautiously in trade liberalisation. 'Taking into account the diversity of the economies in this region it may not work properly if you take a decision to liberalise immediately.' He was commenting on an Australian proposal that would turn the Asia-Pacific region into a free trade zone by the year 2020. Australia hopes the Apec meeting scheduled to begin on November 14 will endorse such an aim. The Chinese official indicated acceptance in principle of Australia's proposal for an Asia-Pacific free trade zone, but stressed that China's acquiescence would be linked with Gatt accession and a resolution of the MFN issue. China and the US have been negotiating terms for Gatt entry since August following presentation of a 900-page Chinese proposal to a working party in Geneva. US officials say progress has been made, but 'more work' is required on such issues as tariff reduction and market liberalisation. Beijing is anxious to be a founder member of the World Trade Organisation when it succeeds Gatt either on January 1 or July 1 next year. But Mr Li warned that China would find it difficult to make further concessions on key issues. 'We have negotiated for eight years,' he observed. 'If the contracting parties are not ready to accept China, it might be better for us to say there is no use pursuing this further. . . We would then do whatever we deem necessary to accelerate our economic development.'</p>

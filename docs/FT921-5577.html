			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Bosnia edges closer to civil war FIVE PEOPLE died in ethnic violence in Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday after Serb gunmen opposed to independence for the Yugoslav republic disrupted the capital, Sarajevo, with barricades. The violence heightened fears of a civil war in the republic, which managed to stay on the sidelines during the recent bloody conflict between Serbs and Croats in breakaway Croatia. With tension high, Bosnian authorities persuaded Serb militants to pull down at least some barricades last night, but gunfire rang out in the streets as agreement was being announced. The makeshift barricades of buses and lorries sprang up just hours after the close of voting in a referendum on independence for the republic of Serbs, Croats and Muslims. Provisional results showed more than 90 per cent voted for independence, though with only a 60 per cent turnout. The Serbs, a third of the population, boycotted the referendum. Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of Bosnia's Serbs and a close ally of Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, said on television: 'We are not going to accept an independent Bosnia-Hercegovina.' Tanjug news agency said one person was killed and two others wounded when an evening peace march by 1,000 young anti-Serb demonstrators carrying candles was fired on from a barricade. A hospital doctor said four people were shot dead earlier in the day. As some barricades came down, it was unclear whether a blockade of the city was being lifted entirely. Earlier, on the outskirts of the city, a masked gunman at the barricades said Serbs had sealed off the city to 'punish the murderers' of a Serbian man, killed at a wedding party on Sunday. Serbs make up 31 per cent of the 4.3m population of Bosnia. Moslems comprise 44 per cent and Croats, 17 per cent. 'Serbs, Moslems and Croats lived here in peace for years. We never thought that this could happen,' said Mr Samir Dzubic, a newspaper vendor, and the son of a Serbian father and Moslem mother. 'Everything is now being destroyed.' The European Community, which said it would accept the outcome of the poll provided half the electorate voted, condemned the violence. The EC recognised the independence of the two former Yugoslav republics of Slovenia and Croatia on January 15. It made recognition of Bosnia conditional on a republic-wide referendum. Mr Karadzic, in Belgrade for talks with the Serbian-dominated rump presidency of Yugoslavia, said 'if the conflict develops into a civil war, then the Irish problem would look like a seaside holiday.' The presidency wants Bosnia to remain part of a smaller Yugoslavia - without Slovenia and Croatia. Moslems and Croats want to live in an independent Bosnia. However, nationalist Croats want to be part of a greater Croatia, and nationalist Serbs want to join with neighbouring Serbia. If Bosnia was formally split between both republics, it would leave the Slavic-speaking Sunni Moslems without a home.</p>

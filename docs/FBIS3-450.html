			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by J Saunders] </F>   [Text] Port Elizabeth March 7 SAPA -- The elections should  be postponed to ensure a fair and inclusive settlement Inkatha  Freedom Party [IFP] President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on  Monday [7 Monday]. But he gave no indication of when he had in  mind. "Without an all-inclusive election we really do run the  risk of our country sliding into the abyss we are so clearly  staring in the face," he told about [word indistinct] guests at  Port Elizabeth's German Club. "But if the IFP is to take part  in the election, then attention will have to be directed at  possibly postponing the election to a later date. It is grossly  unfair that the IFP be put at an unfair disadvantage in fighting  the election when we have devoted our undivided attention to  achieving a dispensation which will ensure democracy and  prosperity."    Citing Angola as an example, he told the guests the election  was not a magic wand that would make the country's problems  disappear. The Angolan elections were observed by a myriad of  monitors but "just look at what's going on there now".    "While many observers feel that delaying the election would  precipitate increased violence, I do not agree. It is far  better to spend a little more time in ensuring that we achieve  an all-inclusive constitution that works, than to rush a  settlement which will not be worth the paper it is written on."    Mr Buthelezi said the interim constitution as it stood now  was spawning a liberation election. "The fight is about which  party will emerge to write the next constitution. I think the  small parties will concentrate on policy issues, but the larger  parties are going to be locked into a battle for the commanding  position to be the only party which can introduce a new  constitutional text to the constitution-making body, the  constituent assembly. For the African National Congress [ANC]  it will be a last act in a grand revolutionary strategy."    Mr Buthelezi said neither the IFP nor the Freedom Alliance  would instigate a worsening of the civil war South Africa was  facing. Rather, he believed, "there will be terrible fights in  elections to gain the position in which your party can dictate  the constitutional future".    "The parties which made bids for this awesome power, and  lost, will not smile and settle down to working under a ruling  party...This constitution and the elections under it are going  to polarise our county and sow the seeds for future conflict."    Mr Buthelezi said the latest so-called confessions by the  ANC  made no concession on provincial powers and functions. Under  the interim constitution, regions had less powers than the  kwaZulu government already had. "There is not one area where  the regions will alone have the final say over matters affecting  only them. The arrogance of the ANC indeed holds no bounds. It  seems to escape the ANC that the Freedom Alliance will not  participate in the election until all our bottom line demands  are met. I am sorry to say that even the fact that we  registered last Friday for elections does not necessarily mean  we are going to participate if mediation does not take place  before that."    Mr Buthelezi said a meeting was under way in Cape Town on  Monday to decide the kind of international mediation the IFP  would settle for, and the party's national chairman would meet  the ANC on Tuesday. "With due respect, even bodies like the  United Nations are not right to deal with this question."</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: NSM cuts deficit to Pounds 1.16m LOWER UK interest rates and the sale of non-core businesses helped NSM, the heavily-indebted international coal mining group, reduce its loss before tax from Pounds 1.37m to Pounds 1.16m in the half-year to September 30. Operating profits fell to Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 4.81m) on lower sales of Pounds 56.8m (Pounds 90.7m) reflecting the sale of its Bison building materials arm and the closure of the building division. Further disposals are planned. These include air-conditioning and plastics companies and property, valued at more than Pounds 20m. About two thirds of operating profits are generated from the sale of UK coal, mostly to the two generators, National Power and PowerGen. Mr John Jermine, chief executive, is lobbying ministers to proceed with the privatisation of British Coal, which he believes would end the current limit on private contractors of 250,000 tonnes per site. He also expects that privatisation will lead to a reduction in the Pounds 5 a tonne royalty payment to British Coal. NSM currently sells its coal for an average of Pounds 21 per tonne. Mr Jermine said: 'The government has got to pull its finger out and end the uncertainty in the industry. We hope it will press on with the privatisation of British Coal while ending coal imports and the subsidy to the nuclear industry.' Interest charges dropped by 23 per cent to Pounds 4.77m (Pounds 6.18m) despite borrowings rising to Pounds 94m (Pounds 88m) because of Pounds 8m of capital expenditure on a US deep-mine commissioned in May. Another Pounds 4m of capital expenditure is earmarked for the next half year on another US deep-mine. The company hopes that its US deep-mine operations in Pennsylvania will match the annual Pounds 1.8m tonnes generated by its US opencast production. Borrowings are expected to fall to Pounds 85m by the end of March because of further disposals. An extraordinary item of Pounds 813,000 reflected the write-off of goodwill on businesses sold. Losses per share were reduced from 6.1p to 5.8p.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Panama turns down US plan for Haitians Panama's President Guillermo Endara withdrew his offer to house 10,000 Haitian refugees late yesterday, throwing US policy on Haiti into turmoil. Mr Endara told a news conference in Panama City he wanted an agreement with the United Nations, not with the US alone. But according to some reports, Mr Endara wanted only US guarantees it would pay to house and feed Haitians in camps to be established on US military bases in Panama. Several Panamanian groups criticised Mr Endara's earlier decision to take boat people. Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House spokeswoman, said 'obviously we're disappointed' but the US would continue to seek other havens for Haitians. Panama was to have played a crucial role in a Clinton administration plan announced on Tuesday to bar Haitian boat people from receiving asylum in the US, but to offer them safe havens in Panama, Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda. The US military was to have begun flying refugees from the US base at Cuba's Guantanamo Bay to Panama today. Earlier yesterday officials had been trying to clarify their day-old policy on Haitian boat people, saying refugees would face easier standards to get into safe havens in Panama than they had when seeking asylum in the US. The administration - under pressure from human rights groups - agreed in negotiations with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to allow a transfer to safe havens for all Haitians who say they fear persecution. Previously boat people had to provide evidence of persecution or be returned to Haiti. There was no immediate sign the new US policy was discouraging refugees from taking to the sea. More than 1,500 Haitians were picked up yesterday by the US Coast Guard. The Pentagon would not confirm reports yesterday that over 1,000 special forces troops staged exercises a fortnight ago designed to simulate an invasion of Haiti. There were such rehearsals before the 1987 US invasion of Panama. Meanwhile, a navy amphibious assault group carrying 2,000 US Marines yesterday left for Haitian waters, where it will be on station to evacuate US or other foreign citizens.</p>

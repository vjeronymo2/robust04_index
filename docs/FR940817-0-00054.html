			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 242.2(a)(1) and 287.7(a)(1)_Detainers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenters stated that the authority for issuance of detainers in &sect;&sect;242.2(a)(1) and 287.7(a)(1) of the proposed rule was overly broad because the authority to issue detainers is limited by section 287(d) of the Act to persons arrested for controlled substances offenses. This comment overlooked the general authority of the Service to detain any individual subject to exclusion or deportation proceedings.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8 U.S.C. 1225(b), 1252(a)(1). The detainer authority of these sections of the proposed rule were promulgated pursuant to this general authority. The statutory provision cited by the commenters places special requirements on the Service regarding the detention of individuals arrested for controlled substance offenses, but does not delimit the general detainer authority of the Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 287.8(d)_Vehicle Transportation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenters suggested that the Service install seat belts in all vehicles transporting people. Current regulations under which all motor vehicles, except buses, are manufactured require the factory installation of seat belts. While the Service strongly agrees with the substance of the suggestion, it would be inappropriate to include any additional requirements within an administrative rule. The reference to seat belts has been deleted in the final rule because the standard governing the use of seat belts will be thoroughly addressed in Service training programs, guidelines, and enforcement manuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 287.8(e)_Vehicular Pursuits <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenters stated that the provisions of this section provided inadequate protection to public safety from accidental injury and death resulting from collisions following high-speed vehicular pursuits. The commenters suggested that the rule provide that a vehicular pursuit may not be initiated ``when there is imminent danger to the life and safety of innocent third parties.'' In response to a number of publicized incidents, the Service revised its guidelines and procedures governing vehicular pursuits. However, it would be inappropriate for the Department to codify the standard suggested by these commenters in the final rule. The standard is both unduly restrictive and underinclusive. Actual operating standards for Service officers must permit greater discretion and also specify in greater detail the criteria that should be considered in deciding whether to undertake a pursuit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter also suggested that officers should be required to successfully complete a separate course in vehicle pursuit prior to having authority under this section. The Department agrees that only those officers specifically trained in pursuit techniques should be authorized to undertake a vehicular pursuit. The only such officers at present who have received such training are border patrol agents. Accordingly, this section has been amended to delete the designations of special agents and deportation officers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

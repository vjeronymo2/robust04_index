			<p>BFN     [Text] Podgorica, 21 Apr (TANJUG) -- The latest situation  in Bosnia-Herzegovina indicates that the most critical stage of  the crisis has not ended and that the war threatens to spread.  So says a statement sent to TANJUG by Montenegro's Foreign  Minister Miodrag Lekic. In his opinion, these are the latest  tragic consequences of the proclamation and recognition of  Bosnia-Herzegovina without securing a consensus of all three  constituent peoples beforehand, a principle that was explicitly  defined in the constitution of that republic at that time.    Lekic, however, notes that the fundamental causes of the war  do not exonerate the warring adventurers belonging to the sides  in Bosnia-Herzegovina from responsibility for the activities  which not only continue to cause further suffering among the  innocent population, but also further diminish the possibility  of finding a peaceful solution. To unquestioningly give in to  everything that comes from the top brass cannot be in the  national interest. This particularly refers to those things  which irresponsibly undermine the efforts aimed at restoring  peace. True patriotism, he adds, can be seen in those who, in  addition to promoting national interests, advocate peace and  respect for the rights of others and an end to the suffering of  the population.

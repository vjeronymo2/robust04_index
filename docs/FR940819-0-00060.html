			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Sales Restriction_Effective Date for Recordkeeping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 82.166(a) establishes a recordkeeping requirement for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persons who sell or distribute any class I or class II substance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for use as a refrigerant. Since no effective date was specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for this particular requirement, this provision became effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> June 14, 1993, the effective date of the Refrigerant Recycling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations. However, the restriction on selling or distributing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of ozone-depleting refrigerants is not effective until November  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14, 1994, pursuant to &sect;82.154(n). EPA does not believe it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to maintain records regarding the sale and distribution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of refrigerant in advance of the effective date of the actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sales or distribution restriction. Furthermore, such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement places an unnecessary burden on industry. Without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the existence of a sales restriction, the usefulness of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records is dubious. Therefore, through this action EPA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change the effective date for maintaining records regarding sales  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and distribution of refrigerants from June 14, 1993 to November  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Proof of Employment of Certified Personnel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 82.166(b) allows the purchasers of any class I or class II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigerants who employ certified technicians to provide evidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of each technician's certification to the wholesaler who sells  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> them refrigerant. The wholesaler will keep this information on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> file. The purchaser is further required to notify the wholesaler  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding any changes in a technician's certification or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment status. Concerns have recently been brought to EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attention about the practicability of implementing this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision. Large organizations often employ large numbers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified technicians that may be situated at various locations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> around the country. Tracking and notifying wholesalers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee status may result in an overwhelming responsibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA did not intend this requirement to place any undue burden on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the employers of large numbers of technicians. In fact, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed that allowing employers to purchase refrigerant for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their technicians, instead of requiring the technician to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physically present at the point of sale, would actually decrease  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the burden for the technician, the wholesaler, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technician's employer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, EPA is modifying this requirement to read:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Purchasers of any class I or class II refrigerants who employ  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified technicians may provide evidence that at least one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technician is properly certified to the wholesaler who sells them  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigerant; the wholesaler will then keep this information on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> file and may sell refrigerant to the purchaser or his authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative even if such purchaser or authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative is not a properly certified technician. In such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases, the purchaser must notify the wholesaler in the event that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the purchaser no longer employs at least one properly certified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technician. The wholesaler is then prohibited from selling class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I or class II refrigerants to the purchaser until such time as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the purchaser employs at least one properly certified technician.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At that time, the purchaser must provide new evidence that at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least one technician is properly certified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that this requirement will still have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended effect of lessening the likelihood that refrigerant is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sold for use by non-certified personnel, while providing a more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable means for purchasers to comply with the sales  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restriction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Appendix A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA adopted an industry standard in the final rule based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Air-conditioning and Refrigeration Institute (ARI) Standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 700&hyph;1988. This standard appeared as Appendix A to Subpart F_Specification for Fluorocarbon Refrigerants. EPA was aware of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efforts to revise ARI 700&hyph;1988 while the final regulations were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being drafted. However, the revised version was not completed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time for incorporation into this appendix by EPA. As discussed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, the updated version, known as ARI 700&hyph;1993, includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in three areas: it adds purity standards for eleven  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional refrigerants; it increases liquid phase contaminant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water levels from 10ppm in ARI 700&hyph;1988 to 20ppm in ARI 700&hyph;1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for R&hyph;11 and R&hyph;113 only; and, where ARI 700&hyph;1988 allowed 0.5 as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the maximum percentage by weight of ``other refrigerants,'' ARI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 700&hyph;1993 allows 0.50 as the maximum percentage by weight of ``all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other organic impurities, including other refrigerants.'' The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inclusion of all organic impurities in the limit effectively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tightens the standard, and the change from 0.5 to 0.50 reduces  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the tolerance of the standard by a factor of ten. EPA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewed ARI 700&hyph;1993 and believes it should be substituted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because it covers additional refrigerants, it increases liquid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> phase contaminant water levels, and broadens the maximum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage of weight requirement to include all other organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impurities instead of just other refrigerants. Through this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action EPA will substitute the standard based on ARI Standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 700&hyph;1988 with a standard based on ARI Standard 700&hyph;1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Appendix B  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

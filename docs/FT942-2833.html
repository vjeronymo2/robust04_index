			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Technology (R&amp;D Scoreboard): Anomalies in the reporting system - Andrew Jack describes why UK financial disclosure methods need updating Sipping Frascati does not normally bring accountancy to mind, but it has proved a heady legacy for those struggling with current UK financial reporting standards on research and development. Existing requirements are based on the work of a paper prepared by the Frascati committee of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development in the 1960s for its own data collection. SSAP 13, the accounting standard that deals with R&amp;D, was introduced in 1977 and last revised in 1989. It still uses these same OECD guidelines for the recognition of R&amp;D. But David Tonkin, head of Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monitor of accounts that compiled the R&amp;D Scoreboard for the Department of Trade and Industry, says: 'There's a problem of definition.' He says the OECD concentrates on an outdated science-based definition, split between pure and applied research and development. It misses out areas of spending such as intellectual property, including computer software development. He also highlights a number of other limitations to reporting requirements on the topic in the UK. For example, foreign-owned companies with British operations do not have to disclose their spending in the local accounts if it is funded from abroad. To add to the confusion, there are differences between the accounting standard in the UK and elsewhere, such as in the US where all such expenditure must be taken against the profit and loss account and not capitalised, says Ken Wild, accounting technical partner at Touche Ross. An issue for UK standards setters is whether companies should similarly be allowed to allocate R&amp;D between the profit and loss account and the balance sheet. Deferral is currently allowed for expenditure on projects if their technical feasibility and commercial viability can be assessed with reasonable certainty. 'It is very subjective,' says Tonkin, who opposes making the guidelines more restrictive. 'In my view this is precisely what we want out of disclosure: for directors to make judgments and to put their reputations on the line.' The result of all these anomalies is that companies can in good faith find themselves struggling to represent fairly all their R&amp;D expenditure because of the guidelines' limitations. There is nothing to stop them providing additional voluntary disclosures outside the scope of the standard, to reveal what they consider to be a fairer view. They now also have scope in the Operating and Financial Review, the new set of voluntary guidelines circulated last year by the Accounting Standards Board. Few do so, however. There is considerable evidence that many companies are failing to even disclose the minimal amounts required by SSAP 13, with all its current faults: something to which regulators need to pay greater heed. An analysis of R&amp;D undertaken for the Financial Times by Company Reporting for 521 companies with year-ends up to the end of May 1994 shows that 213 provide some indication of research and development activity. This is normally in the form of commentary in the chairman's statement, or an accounting policy note. In three-quarters of these companies, the value is disclosed and charged to income. In a smaller number of cases, companies disclose spending in the directors' report rather than - as the law requires - the accounts. However, in 22 per cent of cases there is no disclosure of the income effect provided anywhere in the financial statements. Examples include Asda, BAA, Bass, Cable &amp; Wireless and Guinness. In response, some companies argue that the amount concerned is not material. Others that it would make them vulnerable to competitive disadvantage if they disclosed the amount to their rivals. Tonkin disagrees. 'Companies should be debarred from making disclosures about items that are not material,' he says. 'It is misleading. Otherwise the chairman is going on about something that doesn't exist.' Meanwhile, the OECD is in discussions over a revised version of its own R&amp;D definitions. Readers of accounts can only hope that its members do not get too carried away drinking Frascati before they finish their drafting.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             TOP 20 INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES BY R&amp;D EXPENDITURE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                          Current                R&amp;D as a                                         R&amp;D spend      Sales     percent                                        Pounds '000   Pounds m   of sales  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All companies composite  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        104,486,377  2,153,633      4.85 General Motors, USA                      4,075,633     93,423      4.36 Daimler-Benz, Germany                    3,519,772     38,041      9.25 Ford Motor, USA                          3,393,714     73,349      4.63 Hitachi, Japan                           3,035,313     45,639      6.65 Siemens, Germany                         2,996,263     31,779      9.43 Int.

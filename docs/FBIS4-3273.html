			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Zi Jian (4793 0494): "Sound of Air Raids in </F> Bosnia-Herzegovina `Safe Zones'"]    [Text] Two U.S. F-16 fighter planes dropped three bombs on  the Serb armed forces at Gorazde, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, at 1620  GMT on 10 April. This was the first time NATO had carried out  air strikes against this region since the Bosnia-Herzegovina  civil war broke out two years ago.    According to the U.S Pentagon, the air strikes were  conducted  at the request of 12 UN military observers stationed in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Not long before this, these military  observers submitted a request to Yasushi Akashi, UN special  envoy to the former Yugoslavia, expressing the hope that  protection would be provided for Gorazde so that it would not  suffer from the Serbs' armed attacks. Yasushi Akashi  immediately approved their request and gave the order to provide  "strict air assistance." In addition, General Ross, commander  of UN troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina, disclosed that he had warned  Serb military officers on three occasions not to continue their  advance toward or shelling of Gorazde, but subsequently, a Serb  tank opened fire on Gorazde, so Ross requested air strikes in  the region.    Gorazde is an important city in Bosnia-Herzegovina and is  also a place full of bloody clashes and dangers. It was an  enclave of Bosnia-Herzegovina Muslims. In 1993, the UN Security  Council declared Gorazde, Sarajevo, Bihac, Tuzla, Srebrenica,  and Zepa to be six "safe zones," but these "safe zones" are not  safe.    In the last two weeks, Gorazde has become even "hotter"  because of Serb attacks against the city. Reports say that the  Serb armed forces are advancing toward the city from the south  and the north, while carrying out armed attacks. During this  period, almost 100 people in the city have died in these  attacks, and more than 400 have been wounded; many UN personnel  in the city also are threatened, including relief personnel,  military observers, and ground navigators for the air strikes.    The air strikes in the "safe zones" have temporarily stopped  the shelling of Gorazde. At that time, UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali, U.S. President Clinton, and the German  Government commented on the air strikes. Butrus-Ghali's  spokesman in Geneva said that Butrus-Ghali "did not hesitate at  all" on the question of using air strength to protect Gorazde,  nor did he hesitate on carrying out air strikes again to protect  those UN "safe zones." Analysts pointed out that this indicated  the secretary general's determination to protect these unsafe  "safe zones." Outside the White House, Clinton said: "What we  want to do is promote talks." The German Government hoped that  in the course of promoting talks, air strikes would force the  Serbs to withdraw their troops.    Since the promulgation of the "ultimatum" in early February  and the downing of Serb planes, the current air strikes were  another major military move by NATO. After the promulgation of  the "ultimatum," the Bosnia-Herzegovina capital city of Sarajevo  -- one of the "safe zones" -- remained comparatively calm. In  its current air strikes, NATO possibly intended to expand the  "Sarajevo formula," but the Bosnia-Herzegovina civil war is long  drawn-out, all sorts of conflicts are cropping up, and some  regions are full of mountains and forests. The three bombs may  have calmed the situation in Gorazde, but the path to peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina still remains long and tortuous.</p>

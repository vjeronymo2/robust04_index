			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 6 (CNA) -- A delegation from the  southern Holland city of Den Bosch arrived in Taipei Sunday [5  June] to court Taiwan investors and business partners.    Mayor Don Burgers of Den Bosch, who led the four-member  delegation for the second visit here this year, said his city is  joining hands with two other cities in the vicinity to become an  electronics hub in Europe.    One of the cities, Eindhoven, is the home of world-renown  electronics company Philips.    To attract Asian investors, Den Bosch, a sister city of  Hsintien in Taipei County, recently set up a Far East trade and  business center which includes duty-free warehouses, rental  offices and other facilities, Burgers said in a news conference.    Burgers said Taiwan businesses can use Den Bosch as a  springboard to other markets in the European union.    Den Bosch is located near Holland's Amsterdam and Roterdam,  Germany's Dusseldorf and Belgium's Brussels, he said.    Burgers, who is on his fifth visit to Taipei, said more than  10 Taiwan companies have established production centers in Den  Bosch. Among the Taiwan companies, First International Computer  Inc. has made Den Bosch its operation headquarters in Europe.    An optimistic burgers estimated that the number of Taiwan  companies in Den Bosch will double in two years.    The city government has even helped Taiwan businessmen  establish a Taiwan school in Den Bosch, further improving the  city's appeal to Taiwan investors.</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TICKET THEFTS  </P> <P> The article on airline ticket thefts kept me until the last paragraph (Part A,  Jan. 9). It was at the end, however, that I laughed out loud at the complaints  regarding airlines' inability to properly check tickets.  </P> <P> Airlines say they use profiles to spot bad guys. Joe Whitby of British Airways  wants a magnetic strip on each ticket. Give us a break!  </P> <P> Haven't any of these overpaid security experts ever heard of bar codes? What  could be simpler than running a small light pen over a bar code? Airlines spend  millions on their computer systems. Can't they find a simple software package  that'll take the bar code readout and compare it to the list of stolen tickets?  </P> <P> I have no sympathy for the airlines that could implement an instantaneous  ticket check procedure right now. Instead they moan and groan about their  losses!  </P> <P> MICHAEL V. STRATTON  </P> <P> Brea  </P></p>

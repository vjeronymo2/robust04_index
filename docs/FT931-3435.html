			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Watmoughs rises 51% to Pounds 12m and wins magazine contract WATMOUGHS (Holdings), the Bradford-based printer, yesterday announced a 51 per cent increase in 1992 full year profits and said it detected a 'slight improvement' in the UK newspaper colour supplement and magazine markets. At the same time Mr Patrick Walker, chief executive, revealed that the group had won the contract to print the News of the World's Sunday colour supplement, Britain's biggest circulation magazine with a weekly print run of 5.2m copies. Mr Walker said News International had signed a letter of intent for the group to begin printing the supplement in April next year, when the present contract with a German printer expires. Watmoughs has yet to decide on whether to buy a new press to service the contract. Pre-tax profits for 1992 increased to Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 8.1m) on turnover which rose to Pounds 118.9m (Pounds 107.4m) despite difficult trading conditions, industry excess capacity and pressure on margins. After adjusting for the Pounds 22.3m rights issue early last year, earnings increased to 26p (20.6p). A recommended final dividend of 8.8p makes an 11.5p (10.5p) total. The profit improvement reflected the recovery from a temporary downturn experienced in the 1991 second quarter, coupled with lower interest charges of Pounds 456,000 (Pounds 2.54m) following the receipt of the proceeds of the rights issue and lower interest rates. Mr Walker said the group had managed to increase its share of the market for high quality long run colour supplements, magazines, mail order catalogues and retail brochures. Export sales from the UK continued to grow reaching Pounds 5.86m (Pounds 3.75m) last year. Supported by its strong cash flow the group has been investing heavily in new technology and expanding its presence in continental Europe. Capital expenditure last year totalled Pounds 59.3m including a substantial investment on new presses in the UK and Pounds 31.6m on the group's new gravure plant in Madrid which begins printing next month. The group ended the year with net borrowings of Pounds 26m and gearing of 29 per cent (30 per cent). COMMENT Watmoughs has been investing heavily in its future. In the three years to December 1993 it will have spent Pounds 58m on capital investment in the UK and Pounds 46m in Spain and Hungary. The Madrid plant will begin with three titles, the group's recently acquired Hungarian subsidiary, Revai,is already contributing profits and, helped by a weak pound, the group is winning business back from the Continent. Meanwhile in the UK it has won new orders for substantial retail catalogues and says it detects a upturn in the newspaper supplement and magazine markets. But even without a recovery, profits should grow to about Pounds 14.2m this year producing earnings of some 30p per share. The stock has been climbing since last summer and, after gaining another 15p to reach a new high of 620p yesterday, is trading on a lofty prospective p/e of 20.7.</p>

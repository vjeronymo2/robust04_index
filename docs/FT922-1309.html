			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Boundary proposals attacked THE NUMBER of people eligible to vote in England and Wales might be as much as 1.7m higher than the number registered, Mr Alistair Darling, shadow home affairs spokesman, asserted yesterday. He was moving a Labour amendment to the government bill which seeks to ensure that changes in the boundaries of constituencies are implemented before the next general election. Labour's amendment would allow boundary commissions to delay submitting their reports to the government if they were satisfied that the register on which they were basing them was inaccurate. While it was known electoral registers were inaccurate in many areas, boundary commissions were nevertheless expected to report on the basis of the information they contained, Mr Darling said. He laid much of the blame for the unsatisfactory situation on the poll tax, which had made 'breaking the law an acceptable act to many people who would never ever have contemplated it in the past'. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, insisted that British rates of voter registration were high by international standards. The Labour amendment fell by 59 votes (303-244). Individuals earning more than Pounds 50,000 a year will be Pounds 21,000 better off this financial year than if 1978-79 income tax rates had simply been indexed, the Treasury said in a parliamentary written answer last night. Those earning less than Pounds 5,000 will be just Pounds 150 better off.</p>

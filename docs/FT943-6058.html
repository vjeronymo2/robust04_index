			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Economic Watch: Dutch growth beats forecast Dutch second quarter gross domestic product rose a provisional 2.3 per cent year-on-year, the Central Bureau of Statistics said yesterday. Analysts had forecast a rise of about 1.9 per cent. Without the effect of an extra working day in the period, growth in the second quarter would have risen around 1.7 per cent from the same period in 1993, the CBS said. Corrected for seasonal factors, GDP rose 1.1 per cent from the first quarter of 1994. The growth in the most recent quarterly reporting period was led by expansion of nearly 3 per cent in the private sector, the CBS said, while public sector growth was measured at a more moderate 1.5 per cent. The value of goods produced rose approximately 3 per cent. Stronger growth in the construction sector, including activities abroad, in the second quarter compensated for a decline in the first quarter. Hungary's trade deficit widened to Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1bn) in the first half of 1994, compared with Dollars 1.53bn in the same period last year, the central bank said yesterday. The current account deficit was Dollars 1.96bn, up from Dollars 1.83bn in the first half of 1993. The government devalued the forint 8 per cent in August in an attempt to boost exports and keep the trade deficit for the year below Dollars 3bn. Greece's retail sales index rose 13 per cent year-on-year in May after a 21.4 per cent rise in April, the National Statistics Service said. The rise exceeded the 11 per cent year-on-year increase in the consumer price index in the same month.</p>

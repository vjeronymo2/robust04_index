			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wu Yadong (0702 0068 2639): "Plant Our Feet on </F> Solid Ground, Fulfill the Great Trust Placed in Us -- An  Interview With Abulaiti Abudurexiti, Newly Elected Chairman of  the Autonomous Region"]    [Text] "I will accomplish nothing without the support of  the masses." This was the first sentence uttered by Abulaiti  Abudurexiti, newly elected chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur  Autonomous Region, during an interview with our reporter. His  words lead us to believe he is a modest person.    Chairman Abulaiti Abudurexiti graduated from Xinjiang  Engineering Institute in the 1960's and spent more than a decade  at a drawing desk. His leadership and understanding of work  concerning the overall situation gradually matured after he held  the posts of autonomous regional planning commission chairman  and autonomous regional vice chairman. The great trust placed  in him by the party and people have made him feel that his  responsibility is heavier now. He said: "The burden is  heavier, but with the correct leadership of the party Central  Committee and the autonomous regional party committee; with  support and help from people of all nationalities in Xinjiang  and veteran comrades who have accumulated rich experience; with  the sound foundation laid and rich experience accumulated by  previous governments which governed from the period of the  autonomous region's founding to the time when Comrade Tomur  Dawamat was in charge; and with the formation last year of the  Eighth Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional People's Government --  a good working body which is united, pragmatic, and full of  fighting power -- we will be able to fulfill all tasks entrusted  to us by the party and people by uniting closely, lending each  other support, fully enhancing collective wisdom and functions,  being honest in performing official duties, and fulfilling our  duties and responsibilities." Chairman Abulaiti Abudurexiti  smiled and was full of confidence.    After becoming autonomous regional vice chairman, Abulaiti  Abudurexiti was put in charge of capital construction in the  autonomous region. In the past few years he travelled from the  north to south of Tian Shan to capital construction sites. Upon  arrival, he would consult with relevant experts and scholars on  technical questions concerning the construction projects,  conducted inspections and surveys, and provided guidance at the  sites. For a few months each year, he was busy rushing about  among the grass roots. He therefore has a clear understanding  of the extent of development of various undertakings in the  autonomous region. He said: "During the transition from an old  to a new system, a frontier ethnic minority region like ours,  which has a weak foundation, will face some new conflicts and  questions and many difficulties in reform, opening up, and  economic development. Therefore, we should further emancipate  our minds; take into consideration Xinjiang's realities when  focusing on the central task of economic construction; fully  arouse the enthusiasm of all sectors; enhance our natural  resource assets and geographical superiority; consolidate and  develop the political situation characterized by stability and  unity; complete all tasks awaiting this government with one  heart and one mind; and attain the objective of increasing the  total annual value of goods and services for the autonomous  region 5.66 times by 1997, in order to lay the foundation for  increasing the total annual value eight times by the end of this  century.    In conclusion, Chairman Abulaiti Abudurexiti indicated that  he will, as always, use his pragmatic workstyle and do all he  can to justify the great trust placed in him by people of all  nationalities in the region, and show his gratitude for the  people's support by producing actual results.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edgard Barberena S.] </F>   [Text] President Violeta Chamorro has approved and ordered  the publication in the official newspaper LA GACETA the changes  to Articles 192 and 195, in compliance with an agreement reached  between the Political Council of Blocs [Consejo Politico de  Bancadas] and the Executive Branch, thus easing the tension in  relations between the Presidency of the Republic and the  Legislative Assembly.    After signing the changes, which opened the door to in-depth  change of the Political Constitution through a project reached  by consensus among the seven blocs, the president sent a letter  to Legislative Branch leader Dr. Luis Humberto Guzman.    The essence of the presidential letter reads: "I think,  however, that it is my duty as president of the Republic and  chief of state to say clearly that I have reservations about the  legality of these constitutional changes, because they change  the procedure for guarantees established by the National  Constituent Assembly that allows the regular National Assembly  to enact partial changes to the Political Constitution of the  Republic."    The president added that "this is why I had not yet  promulgated these, because my first and most important duty and  responsiblity is to comply and enforce compliance with the  Constitution of the Republic."  <H5>  SPEAKS OF DANGER </H5>   The president thinks that "these changes jeopardize  constitutional order because they leave the Constitution  unprotected and exposed to changes by the parliament as if it  were a regular law." But, "aware of the need to ease tension in  relations among institutions and to build understanding between  these two state branches, I have proceeded to promulgate them,  in the understanding that subsequent changes to the Constitution  will necessarily be the product of basic political consensus, at  least between the state branches, as a guarantee of the  feasibility of such changes, to ensure that they receive  national approval."    Finally, the president pointed out to the chief of the  Legislative Branch that "for this reason I will support those  changes that serve the homeland or common good above partisan  interests or specific situations."    Chamorro's decision is historic because this is the first  time that changes to the Basic Law have entered into force.  This law was approved by the AN [National Assembly] in late  1986 and entered into force on 10 January 1987 during a ceremony  at Revolution Square, where 202 articles of the Constitution  were signed by Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega.  <H5>  TIMELY DECISION </H5>   Legislative sources told us yesterday evening that the  presidential decision came right after the expiration of a  deadline that the Executive Branch had established for the  Political Council of Blocs regarding the sanctioning of the  first changes to the Political Constitution.    It was reported that the package of changes to the Political  Constitution that continues to be secretly held by the Political  Council of Blocs will be officially presented to the Legislative  Branch within two weeks, at the latest, to comply with  legislative procedures, which will necessarily lead to the  establishment of a "special commission to change the Political  Constitution."    This "special commission" must -- within a prudent period --  establish a timetable for consultations on the project that will  change a little over 50 percent of existing constitutional  articles.</p>

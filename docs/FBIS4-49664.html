			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 10 (AFP)--China's ambition to gain  readmission to the GATT by year's end is still far from being  realised, the world trade body's chief warned here Tuesday,  stressing that political will alone was no guarantee of  membership.    "I can give no assurance whatsoever that the negotiations  can  be concluded by the end of the year," said GATT secretary  general Peter Sutherland prior to crucial talks with top Chinese  foreign trade officials that will have a significant bearing on  the outcome of China's bid for readmission. There are  considerable difficulties ... and it is quite clear that a great  deal remains to be done," Sutherland said in an interview with  AFP.    China, which was a founder member of the General Agreement  of  Tariffs and Trade (GATT) but left after the communists came to  power in 1949, has made it clear it attaches great political  significance to being readmitted before the institution is  replaced by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on January 1.    "But there is so much that can be done within a limited time  frame," Sutherland said. [sentence as received] "Whether we have  enough time or not remains to be seen."    While GATT members are unanimous on the importance of China  to the WTO, strong reservations persist over its ability to  conform with requirements on a whole range of trade issues,  especially the question of trade transparency.    "Its trade rules and regulations and their availiability for  analysis are in dispute and there are those who would say there  is not an adequate degree of clarity as yet," Sutherland said,  citing questions over licensing mechanisms, quotas and  non-tariff trade barriers. There is a sense of a lack of  understanding that needs to be overcome, and this requires  pro-active work by China in persuading and explaining. It's not  merely a question of political will," Sutherland said, adding  that negotiations between now and the end of the year would  require "enormous engagement."    Sutherland was scheduled to hold a series of high-level  talks  Tuesday afternoon with Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi, assistant  minister Long Yongtu and vice premier in charge of foreign trade  Li Lanqing.</p>

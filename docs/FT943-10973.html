			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Pearson pursues stake in HK TV Pearson, the media and entertainment group, is in negotiations to acquire up to 10 per cent of Hong Kong's Television Broadcasts (TVB), Asia's premiere television company. The negotiations, if successful, will result in Pearson paying about Pounds 150m for a 9.9 per cent stake in TVB - a level of investment that will not require Hong Kong government approval. Lord Blakenham, chairman of Pearson, whose interests include the Financial Times, was in Hong Kong and China last week discussing a deal. Pearson declined to comment yesterday. The UK group, which has decided to concentrate on media and information, has become particularly interested in expanding into Asia. TVB has in the past been courted by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and by Time Warner, of the US. Mr Murdoch faced regulatory problems because of his then ownership of the South China Morning Post, the Hong Kong newspaper. He went on to buy control of Star TV, the Hong Kong-based satellite television company, with which Pearson tried unsuccessfully to negotiate a deal. TVB is controlled by Sir Run Run Shaw, its founder, and Mr Robert Kuok, the Malaysian financier who last year bought a controlling interest in the Morning Post from Mr Murdoch. Mr Kuok, who owns about 24 per cent of the television company, is understood to be the seller. TVB is Hong Kong's dominant terrestrial television provider, having a 72 per cent audience share. It is also the television of choice for viewers in southern Guangdong in China. The main attraction of the company is, however, its programme making and its library of Chinese-language material. The company produces 1,000 hours of original television a year and has a library of 25,000-35,000 hours of resaleable stock. This is important as TVB seeks to penetrate the Chinese mainland and Taiwanese markets. It is also active in south-east Asia where it is developing production facilities and has video sales and rental businesses. TVB's profit after tax was HKDollars 520m (Pounds 44m) in 1993. Analysts expect the company's earnings per share to grow by about 15 per cent a year.</p>

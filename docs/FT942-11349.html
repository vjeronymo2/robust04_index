			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / PLO denies being unready to take control Palestine Liberation Organisation officials said yesterday the full deployment of Palestinian police would take at least a week longer than expected, but denied the PLO was unready to assume their new powers under the Gaza-Jericho agreement, as suggested by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister. Mr Nabil Shaath, the chief PLO negotiator, said the first 22 'leading police officers' were already deployed in Gaza and that further 'district commanders' would arrive today. The PLO said arrival of the first 1,000 police, which should have been in place by today, had run into 'technical problems' and that they would not now arrive until next week. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, seeking to bolster Israeli support for the peace process vowed the Jewish state would never return to the teeming Strip packed with refugee camps and squalid townships which have been in open revolt against Israel for the past seven years. 'There is no testing period. The die is cast and there is a decision,' he said. 'There is no going back. We won't go back to Gaza, Gaza won't come back to us.' Mr Shaath said the remaining 6,000 policemen, who will be arriving from six Arab countries, would be in place within two weeks, rather than the scheduled seven days to police the 800,000 Palestinians in Gaza. Mr Shaath said the fact that the PLO had not yet handed a final list of the 24 Palestinians to serve on the Palestinian authority, which will assume the powers accorded under the new deal, was allowed for under the terms of the agreement. He was referring to the period within which Israel is committed to complete its military pull-out. Nevertheless, as the second day of self-rule passed, Palestinians and Israelis woke up to the fact that the PLO is hopelessly ill-prepared to take over the complex administrative and security functions of running the Strip. The lack of planning on a more serious policy level was confirmed yesterday by Mr Hassan Abu Libdeh, the PLO official in charge of the 'Technical Committees' which were supposed to have in place a full scheme for Palestinian control over all services. 'We are not ready to receive authority,' he said yesterday. 'For example environmental questions are really new to us. It is not a matter of being weeks away but it may take three to six months before we are really ready.' Many Palestinians said the problem lies with Mr Arafat's authoritarian style of leadership, his inability to delegate and tension between the leadership in exile and those who have emerged in the seven year uprising against Israeli rule. Institutions were created at PLO headquarters in Tunis and in the territories but did not co-ordinate their activities. Delay in implementing the agreement will further erode Mr Arafat's fragile support base. In Gaza many Palestinians appeared disappointed and frustrated at the little concrete signs of an immediate change in their lives. Israel, however, continued yesterday to wind down its occupation in Gaza, completely emptying the city's notorious central prison. But despite the snail's pace of implementing self-rule many in Gaza still had hopes for the future. Moustapha Sawafiri, a taxi driver said he didn't care whether it took the police days or weeks to deploy. 'We have been waiting all our life.'</p>

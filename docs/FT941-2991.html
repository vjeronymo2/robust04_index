			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / World Trade News: US-Russian space venture in key deals A US-Russian joint venture to launch satellites using Russian Proton rockets has secured over Dollars 600m (Pounds 411m) in contracts, including an agreement to launch up to five satellites for a European television broadcaster, officials of Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energia International announced. The latest contracts make LKEI a serious contender in the Dollars 1.6bn world commercial satellite launch market. Mr Charles Lloyd, LKEI president and chief executive, said: 'This is an extremely important contract for us, because we beat the French in a deal with a European customer.' Ariane, the France-based European consortium that controls about 60 per cent of the world's satellite launch business, also bid for the contract, Mr Lloyd said. LKEI will launch up to five satellites for Societe Europeene des Satellites (SES), a Luxembourg-based company that is building a satellite broadcast network called DirectTV. The contract is in addition to an earlier agreement to launch up to five satellites for Space Systems/Loral, of California. The first launch is set for early next year. Before the formation of LKEI last year, the Russian partners reached an agreement to launch communications satellites for Motorola. The post-cold war venture initially raised concern in Washington that low-cost Russian launch services could undermine the US commercial satellite launch industry. 'LKEI has continued to work hand-in-hand with the US government to ensure fair competition among launch services providers,' Mr Lloyd said. Under a US-Russian trade agreement signed last year, Russian launch bids cannot undercut the lowest western bid by more than 7.5 per cent. The agreement also limits Russian launches of western satellites to eight a year. 'The LKEI venture is extremely important to us,' said Mr Anatoly Kiselev, president of the Khrunichev Space Center and co-chairman of LKEI. 'We see this effort as critical to the Russian aerospace industry.' Mr Lloyd said LKEI was identifying work needed to improve the Baikonur launch facilities in Kazakhstan, and has begun talks with insurance underwriters.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle held two news  conferences today. At the first, Peterle spoke about current  Slovene-Italian relations and commented on statements made by  certain Italian politicians. At the regular monthly news  conference that he held in the afternoon, Minister Peterle spoke  about the Foreign Ministry's activities. Here is a report by  Igor Juric:    [Begin Juric recording] Minister Peterle first said that our  state does not take the statements made so far as official  stands as they were not made at an official level.  Nevertheless, it remains to be seen how interstate relations  will further develop. He assessed the cooperation with Italy  thus far as positive on the whole; our cooperation within nine  state commissions as well as on the economy had been good. Soon  after Italy's recognition of Slovenia, the issue of the  succession of agreements with the former Yugoslavia had been  settled. Within this framework, the question of the property of  Italian refugees that some people are bringing up anew was  settled. In this respect, Minister Peterle said that within the  process of joining Europe, it is no problem for us to take on  the obligation that foreign citizens should also have the right  to purchase real estate, as we have never differentiated among  people. Therefore, Peterle sees no reason for Italy to be  placing further obstacles in the way of us joining European  integration, as has happened. It is true that Italy always  withdraws its statements in the end.    Minister Peterle does not think that the new politicians  might aggravate relations with us, as the European Union does  not want to deal with any more problems. He sees Italy in the  future as a strategic partner, with whom we will enjoy good  neighborly relations that would set an example to others.    As regards the initiative for Istria as a European region,  Peterle said that Slovenia supports ideas on close border  cooperation, but by no means supports an establishment of some  kind of supra-state region. However, his opinion is that it is  not right for the Italians to speak about the position of their  minority in Slovenia and Croatia, as if there were no  differences between the states. Namely, the position of  minorities in Slovenia is established according to the highest  European standards.    At the afternoon news conference, Minister Peterle expressed  pleasure that the Economic-Social Council of the European Union  adopted a statement today saying that our state will be ready  for full membership of the Union by the end of the century.    As regards the talks in Pineta [about the Slovene demand for  Bosnian refugees to be evacuated from Slovene holiday resorts to  the Croatian Adriatic coast], Peterle said that his ministry  does not have any instruments to help it transfer the refugees.  The only thing that we possess is the Croatian Government's  assurance.    There has been a standstill in relations with Croatia  regarding the border issue, as the other side is showing no real  will to do anything. [end recording]</p>

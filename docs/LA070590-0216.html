			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FEISTY HORSEWOMAN ON THE TRAIL OF THE MIGHTY IRVINE CO. SAYS SHE GOT THE . . .;  </P> <P> LAST LAUGH  </P> <P> She was a millionaire by birth, a horsewoman by choice, a gadfly by  inclination. But what she was not, says Joan Irvine Smith, was a woman who was  taken very seriously, not by the men who ran the Irvine Co., the vast barony  her great-grandfather founded.  </P> <P> "I had years and years of people saying, 'Now dear, don't worry about your  assets, we'll take care of them for you. You just have a good time,' " she  remembered.  </P> <P> Over the years she married four times, gave birth to three sons, raised horses  for fun and profit. And she battled the Irvine Co., at board meetings and  public hearings. When it came to her family birthright, Smith wouldn't be  brushed off, or married off, or bought off.  </P> <P> Through the years her business opponents tried to match her up romantically,  she said, figuring that would get this pesky woman out of their hair.  </P> <P> "It's a joke," she said. "Every time you turn around, you find somebody running  some man in on you. . . . They figure if you are a woman, they can get you  sidetracked. It is the male ego. They think a woman can't possibly function  except on an emotional basis and 'if we can find her the right man, we will  just have her right where we want her.' "  </P> <P> As it turns out, they never did get her right where they wanted her. Last week  a Michigan court referee decreed that the giant development company pay Smith  and her mother, Athalie Clarke, $149 million for their share of the company  they agreed to sell in 1983 to Donald L. Bren, the company chairman.  </P> <P> The award ended a lengthy and complex lawsuit and left both sides claiming  victory. The Irvine Co. reasoned that the amount was far less than the $330  million Smith was asking; Smith noted that it was 31% more than the $114  million Bren offered her in 1983. Once the court totes up the interest and  decides who pays the lawyers, the award is expected to hit at least $250  million.  </P> <P> Within days of the award, a fit and relaxed Smith granted a rare interview at  her oak tree-studded ranch to reminisce about the past and consider what her  money might bring.  </P> <P> One of her favorite stories has been how years ago she "embarrassed" the Irvine  Co. into adopting a master plan for development of its extensive agricultural  landholdings, which once spanned a fifth of Orange County, and donating the  land for the campus that became UC Irvine.  </P> <P> Now, with her millions, she offers: "There are a lot of things that can be done  in medical research. . . . I am still very interested in doing something for  the University of California, Irvine."  </P> <P> For years she has pushed for an on-campus teaching hospital at UCI, despite the  presence of such a hospital off campus now and despite the opposition of the  local medical community. Will she push the project again? "We'll see," she  laughed.  </P> <P> Another project will be to expand her business of breeding, training, showing  and selling top thoroughbred horses, not only at the 22-acre Orange County  ranch but also at her spread in Virginia.  </P> <P> In fact, she wore pants and boots for a riding tour of her Orange County  operation, the Oaks, after the interview. The stable's tack rooms and offices  blaze with colorful prize ribbons, and the ranch landscape was bedecked with  plants and flowers that she buys by the truckload.  </P> <P> Smith, 57, her hair now a mixture of gray and blond, is a woman of great energy  who rises at 5 a.m., retires at midnight and talks with incessant urgency in  her voice.  </P> <P> Always a minority shareholder and the only female member on the company's board  of directors, Smith has used whatever method was available -- including the  courts, Congress and the press -- in a fight to protect her inheritance and  make known her opinions. And she says she will not "let up one inch until I  have my money in the bank."  </P> <P> So she continues to attend meetings of city councils, county supervisors and  water boards, and to bombard Irvine Co. executives and government officials  with synopses of the meetings and cover letters that she types herself -- a  regimen she has followed for 13 years, accompanied in recent months by Skippy,  a small brown-spotted dog that she nursed back to health after it was hit by a  van.  </P> <P> Smith recalled that last January when she fell from an unruly horse and  dislocated the knuckles of her left hand, she took care of the injury herself  by using some veterinary painkillers and other remedies at her stable. "I  wasn't going to go to the doctor and have him tell me I had to have it wrapped  up," she said. "I had to keep typing with the damn thing."  </P> <P> Smith traces her battles with the company that has been her nemesis for decades  right back to the time she took a seat on the firm's board of directors. The  year was 1957. She was 24.  </P> <P> Her grandfather had died in 1947, and the foundation he set up to run the  company after his death had a board with a few directors she believed were  trying to use the company to enrich themselves. So she fought. In the 1960s,  fed up with low dividends the Irvine Co. was paying on her stock, Smith lobbied  Congress for seven years before winning passage of tax legislation in 1969 that  forced the foundation to sell its controlling interest in the company.  </P> <P> In 1975, she sued to block the foundation from selling the Irvine Co. to the  Mobil Oil Corp. for $200 million. As it turned out, that suit was a  scene-setter for a bidding war in 1977, which ended with Smith and others  buying the company themselves for $337.4 million.  </P> <P> The sale was hailed across the nation as a victory for Smith, proof her claims  that the Mobil bid was far too low were correct. But there was a downside, too.  Smith said the new owners forced her to reduce her ownership of the company  from 21.1% to 11%, though she did receive $76 million for the stock she sold.  </P> <P> This forced Smith to give up her dream of gaining control of the company by  taking it public, while still being its single largest shareholder.  </P> <P> "It would have been the best thing that ever could have happened because if you  could have given the people of Orange County an opportunity to invest in the  Irvine Co., it could have made a lot of the development easier," she said. "But  the foundation didn't want that."  </P> <P> And after the 1977 sale, Smith had to contend with Bren, the powerful, debonair  local builder who had his own plans for gaining control of the company. In  1983, Bren bought out his other partners for $560 million, valuing the entire  company at $1 billion. Smith's share came to $114 million. After failing in  court to block Bren's bid for controlling ownership of the company, Smith  decided to sell all her shares and get out.  </P> <P> The only matter left to be settled was how much money she would get. She took  Bren to court in Michigan, where the Irvine Co. is incorporated, when his  original offer was, in her opinion, too low.  </P> <P> The company argued that Smith had no basis for questioning the business  judgment of the other shareholders, which included the likes of automobile  baron Henry Ford II, shopping center magnate A. Alfred Taubman and Herbert  Allen, a prominent New York investment banker.  </P> <P> But Smith says the judge's decision proves that her challenge "was not a  frivolous lawsuit." Because she is a woman, Smith said, she never has been  taken seriously by her business associates.  </P> <P> She lugged out a large scrapbook, plunked it on a patio table and opened it to  reveal newspaper clippings that chronicled her battles with the Irvine Co. for  more than three decades. The photographs accompanying many of the stories, some  of which appeared in foreign publications, showed that it was Smith's  glamour-girl looks and audacity, as much as what she had to say, that drew  attention. "Dazzling Blonde to Sue for Million," said one headline.  </P> <P> In fact, Smith has sacrificed much of her personal life to do what she felt was  necessary to protect her legacy.  </P> <P> She said that her last marriage to Morton (Cappy) Smith, a horseman, ended  because of the tremendous amount of time she spent away from their home in  Middleburg, Va., to attend to her lawsuits against the company.  </P> <P> "I did what I had to do," recalled Smith, who is still a business partner and  close friend of her ex-husband, who operates her farm in Middleburg.  </P> <P> More recently, Smith's self-appointed role as Irvine Co. watchdog has made her  something of a prisoner, unable even to visit her horse farm in Virginia. It  was her need to have some diversion from 12-to-18-hour workdays over the past  13 years, Smith said, that led her to develop her South Orange County horse  ranch, where she spends most of her spare time.  </P> <P> But now Joan Irvine Smith is on the verge of finally breaking free and gaining  personal control of her business affairs and her fortune. "You can't imagine  how much I am looking forward to it," she said. "I want to be in control of my  own destiny."  </P> <P> Smith's feisty personality is often compared to that of her late grandfather,  James Irvine Jr., known as J.I., who defended his ranch against trespassers and  the railroad, at gunpoint if necessary. But she says she is certain her  grandfather would approve of her decision to sever her ties with the land  rather than remain a minority player. "My grandfather was in a control position  with the company. He wasn't there in a minority position. He wouldn't have  tolerated it," she said.  </P> <P> By contrast, at her ranch Smith is in command. She has hired two trainers and  is striving to create a stable of champions, maybe even a future Olympics entry  or two. She also is trying to give the sport of show jumping a higher profile  on the West Coast. For five springs Smith and her mother have hosted the Oaks  Classic, a jumping extravaganza and fancy bash that attracts top-notch  thoroughbreds from around the country as well as the cream of Orange County  society.  </P> <P> Smith stables 40 of her horses at the ranch, about 14 of which she said she has  added since last fall in anticipation of a resolution of her lawsuit. Also, she  has plans to build a house on the ranch and to begin some much-delayed  improvements on her farm in Virginia. When loose ends on the litigation are  tied up, she will be freer to travel and to enter horses at shows on both  coasts. She plans to ride some of them herself.  </P> <P> Further down the trail, Smith intends to write a book about her life, which she  expects to be highly controversial. "When I get around to it, it is going to be  about the litigation and the intrigue and a lot of things that a lot of people  aren't going to want to have exposed," she said. She also muses that "making a  movie of it would be fun. But it would have to be toned down for prime-time  showing."  </P> <P> As to possible additional plans for the money, she is reticent, except to speak  of the possibility of business opportunities with social import. She said she  has gotten very interested in the field of toxic waste cleanup. But she doesn't  want to say too much until she actually gets the cash.  </P> <P> When the day comes, she said, she intends to ride to the bank with the check on  a horse who has grown old and swaybacked waiting for the chance. The horse's  name? "Last Laugh."  </P></p>

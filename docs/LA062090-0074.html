			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. OPERA'S 'OKLAHOMA!' WON'T BE OPERATIC;  </P> <P> STAGE: THE RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN LANDMARK OPENS FRIDAY AT THE CHANDLER  PAVILION. 'THE KEY PHRASE HERE IS "MUSICAL THEATER," ' SAYS ITS DIRECTOR.  </P> <P> With its simple story line and unlikely opening -- a woman churning butter on  stage while an offstage voice sings about the beautiful mornin' -- it's hard to  think of "Oklahoma!" as a revolutionary stage work.  </P> <P> But when it premiered on Broadway in 1943, this maiden effort of composer  Richard Rodgers and lyricist-librettist Oscar Hammerstein II was hailed as the  first musical to seamlessly integrate book, songs and dance to tell its story.  The songs and Agnes de Mille's stylish choreography broke custom by defining  and advancing the plot rather than serving as diversions. The show ran for more  than five years and 2,200 Broadway performances -- a record unsurpassed until  "My Fair Lady" in 1961 -- and set the standard for musicals for decades.  </P> <P> Why, then, is this quintessential slice of musical theater being staged by an  opera company?  </P> <P> "Because the key phrase here is 'musical theater,' " said Charles Abbott,  director of the Los Angeles Music Center Opera production, which opens Friday  at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for 12 performances, through July 1.  </P> <P> "This is a part of our theater heritage, the only stage form America has  contributed. Why shouldn't opera companies have it in their libraries? For  economic reasons, most Broadway shows today don't have casts this big -- 44  people and a horse -- and certainly touring shows don't. So only an opera  company can have a cast that size.  </P> <P> " 'Oklahoma!' is simple, sophisticated and quietly classy," he added. "It's not  a step back for opera companies to do it. They're keeping our heritage alive,  and at the same time, it's good business."  </P> <P> Starring in this classic about young love in the expanding American West are  Jean Stapleton as Aunt Eller and Rodney Gilfrey and Rebecca Eichenberger as the  on-again-off-again couple, Curly and Laurey. Also featured are Lara Teeter as  Will Parker, Jodi Benson -- the voice of Disney's animated "Little Mermaid" --  as Ado Annie, Larry Storch as comic peddler Ali Hakim and Michael Gallup as  menacing farmhand Jud Fry.  </P> <P> The L.A. Opera production was initially designed two years ago by Abbott,  choreographer Mary Jane Houdina and set designer John Lee Beatty for the  Minnesota Opera, with a subsequent staging by Opera Omaha.  </P> <P> "Our approach to staging this hasn't been different because it's an opera  company," Abbott noted. "What is different is the casting -- we have an  interesting marriage of opera singers, musical-theater singers and celebrities  with musical-theater and acting backgrounds.  </P> <P> "My task is to lead the opera singers to mute their performances, while also  trying to have the musical-theater performers sing as finely as they can. We've  found that everyone's nurturing each other -- it's a very enriching  experience."  </P> <P> Stapleton is perhaps best known for her TV work: her eight-year, three-time  Emmy-winning run as Edith Bunker on "All in the Family," and this season's  "Bagdad Cafe" (which has been renewed). But her early career was on the stage  and she has appeared in four Broadway musicals, including "Damn Yankees" and  "Bells Are Ringing" in the mid-'50s.  </P> <P> Her role in "Oklahoma!" as the strong, independent farm woman has only solo  lines rather than songs, but Stapleton quickly dismissed the notion that she  was cast because of her celebrity status and audience drawing power.  </P> <P> "Fame is something that's imposed. It has its advantages, of course, but it's  not reality when it comes to the work," she said after a rehearsal last week.  "That's not in the script. You're an ensemble, and you always will be."  </P> <P> Having performed "Oklahoma!" twice before (the last time in the early '80s),  Stapleton said, "The only real difference in doing this show with an opera  company is that they take the day off before we open. That's an opera  necessity. Otherwise, we're doing a musical."  </P> <P> While Stapleton has made minimal performance adjustments, it has been a vastly  different story for castmate Gallup, who plays the brooding, dangerous Jud Fry.  An L.A. Opera veteran particularly known for his comic buffo roles, the  bass-baritone said that his first musical-theater role is "quite a stretch for  me, a dramatic, physical and vocal challenge. I can't get 'opera,' ever. I  can't do (big) gestures. In rehearsal, Charles might say, 'That turn is too  operatic. Make it real.' I have to modulate my voice to sound more like I'm  speaking, and since I'm wearing a body mike, I can't let my voice go because it  would fry the system."  </P> <P> Though Gallup's song of romantic frustration, "Lonely Room," is often likened  to an aria, he still must adapt to the musical-theater style. "In opera," he  explained, "a lot of questions of tempo, dynamics and emotion will be answered  by the music, what the composer has written. In musical theater, you're freer  -- you can vary the tempo because you don't have musical constraints. I may  have a whole bunch of eighth-notes" -- he sings an excerpt from "Lonely Room"  -- "but it's all conversational. There's no way you could notate exactly what I  sang, and I probably wouldn't do it again in exactly the same way."  </P> <P> In this new medium, Gallup is also contending with dialogue -- in Oklahoma  vernacular, no less -- dancing and stunts. And, he said, "All the  musical-theater people are so much more in shape -- they sing, dance, act, even  mime. Even though I lost 25 pounds for this role, I still feel chunky."  </P> <P> While this "Oklahoma!"is very much in the musical-theater tradition, Abbott  notes that some elements do differ from the original production. "It was always  my intention to cut into the length of the dances," he said. "In 1943 there was  no such thing as television, so entertainment lasted longer. Now, audiences are  used to their entertainment happening in a much shorter time span. Mary Jane  Houdina and I did our research and knew what each dance had to be about, but  she did original choreography, with a nod in style to Agnes de Mille.  </P> <P> "The design is not as lightly balletic," he added. "They used backdrops, as you  would for ballet. John Lee Beatty has used the paintings of Grant Wood as an  influence. The colors are brighter and deeper, and the forms are more sumptuous  and earthy. Because of that, I think the choreography is earthier."  </P> <P> Musical theater -- not to mention the world in general -- has changed a lot in  the near half-century since "Oklahoma!" debuted. What does a show about cowboys  and farmers, whose major issue was whom to take to a "box" social, have to  offer 1990 audiences?  </P> <P> Said Stapleton, "It's a human story, one of your few basic plots -- instead of  an evening of marvelous theatrical wizardry -- which is rare in musical theater  today. You can't beat the lyricism and the melody. And the dream ballet -- what  a wonderful way to introduce children to ballet."  </P> <P> Director Abbott is more succinct. "It's a damn good score and a damn good  book," he said.  </P></p>

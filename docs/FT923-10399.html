			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: Du Pont lifts underlying profits DU PONT, the leading US chemicals company, managed a 3 per cent rise in the level of its underlying second-quarter net profits. Although the company's Dollars 440m net income for the quarter was 19.9 per cent down year-on-year, the profits were actually 3 per cent higher when extraordinary items were subtracted from the quarterly figures this year and last. The 1992 second quarter included a previously announced Dollars 134m one-time charge for additional costs related to the recall of its Benlate DF fungicide. Earnings per share were 65 cents for the quarter, against 81 cents a year ago. For the first six months of 1992 earnings per share were Dollars 1.36 against Dollars 1.69 in the same period last year. Revenues in the second quarter were Dollars 9.8bn, an increase of 4 per cent after adjustments to reflect a new coal venture accounted for under the equity method. Combined sales for chemicals, fibres, polymers and diversified businesses were 3 per cent above last year. Volume was 6 per cent improved, but prices were down by an average of 3 per cent. Combined earnings for these businesses were 37 per cent higher, excluding non-recurring charges. Earnings from the Conoco energy business were down by 65 per cent, the only division to suffer an underlying slump. Du Pont attributed this to lower worldwide refined product margins, an absence of benefits from the kind of crude oil forward sales achieved in 1991 and lower natural gas prices. Mr Edgar Woolard, chairman, said a number of Du Pont's businesses were achieving 'solid sales and earnings growth in spite of an uneven economic recovery'. He said the group continued to benefit from improvements in operating costs and productivity. The resulting gains more than offset the downturn in the petroleum sector. Wall Street seemed to agree and reacted favourably to the Du Pont results, marking the share price Dollars 2 3/4 higher to Dollars 52 3/8 . Mr William Young, a chemicals industry analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette in New York, said he was impressed by the results: 'I think they are doing quite well. Volumes are up considerably year-to-year. Their cost cutting is having a major impact and if you look at the big four chemical companies in the US, Du Pont is the only one to have an underlying profits increase.'</p>

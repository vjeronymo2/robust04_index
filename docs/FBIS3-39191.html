			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Pierre Lefevre commentary: "NATO's Message"] </F>   [Text] The ultimatum which NATO has just sent the Bosnian  Serbs has wider implications than appears at first. Its main  aim is certainly to rapidly free Sarajevo from its mortal  stranglehold. From now on, the person carrying out a new blind  shot against a civil target in the Bosnian capital has been  warned that he is exposing himself to immediate punishment. And  in 10 days the main part of the threat should have disappeared.  In this respect it can only be regretted that this decision  came so late and that last Saturday's [5 February] horrible  massacre was necessary for it to be taken.    This ultimatum means that the international community has  found a burst of new energy, just as it was starting to become  tired of its impotence in the Yugoslav conflict and was ready to  let go. With this regained will and firmness, this community  can start to regain some credibility. In this respect too, it  was high time.    The determined NATO intervention could also mark a turning  point in the Bosnian crisis. "Sarajevo first of all," the  French foreign minister said, indicating that there is no  question of renouncing the demands of the other besieged  enclaves. If it bears fruit, the therapy applied to the Bosnian  capital could also be extended to Tuzla and Srebenica, and  tomorrow to Mostar or the other towns and regions where the  warring parties, be they Serbs, Croats or Muslims, are attacking  civilians. For the rest it is hard to imagine that with one of  the sides having been brought back to its senses, another could  carry out the same exactions with impunity.    The Atlantic Alliance is now applying a strategy of  dissuasion- persuasion. It does not want to carry out air  strikes or increase the level of violence. On the contrary its  aim is to avoid them and to exercise military pressure so that  negotiations lead to the demilitarization of Sarajevo, then its  administration by the United Nations, the first step in the  realization of the peace plan proposed by the Europeans. This  could be the start of a new dynamic.    The threat of reprisals could certainly cause a hostile  reaction from the Serbs and lead them into a build-up of  violence. However, they know that the relationship of forces is  less favorable to them at present and that by engaging  themselves against far more sophisticated technology they would  risk losing their heavy weapons, which are one of their main  advantages. There is no doubt that they will think twice before  exposing themselves to Western aviation. By forcing NATO to  attack them, they would also remind the world that they are the  main aggressors in this conflict which they have virtually won.    Russia too is raising its voice, but the message also  applies  to it. In reality the authors of the ultimatum attach little  importance to its protests, but are inviting it to join the  peace efforts and put maximum pressure on its Serbian allies so  that they will hear reason. NATO's decision is also, in this  respect, a sort of answer to Moscow's neo-imperialist  temptations, telling it that there is no place for a return of  its influence on its former satellites, and that it must make a  choice between cooperation or exclusion.    Finally the Europeans and Americans have rediscovered the  virtues and effectiveness of cooperation. Just as the United  Nations and NATO have found a new articulation and  complementariness. The lesson is for the West itself, which has  displayed its divisions during the 22 months of the Bosnian  conflict. Even if NATO's reaction is late, it means that there  is a politically operational guarantee of stability in Europe in  the uncertain period following the end of the Cold War. Those  who could have thought that anything was allowed in Europe now  know that there is a limit to the infamy.</p>

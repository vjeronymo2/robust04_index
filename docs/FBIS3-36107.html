			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mircea Dascaliuc report from Chisinau] </F>   [Text] President Mircea Snegur's counselor, Ceslav Ciobanu,  today characterized the demand recently made by the leader of  the Tiraspol separatists, Igor Smirnov, namely that the Republic  of Moldova should join the ruble zone as soon as possible, as  telling proof of his lack of vision about the economic future of  the region and his defiance of the actual situation of the  Republic of Moldova and the Eastern rayons.    We have started the reform program in accordance with the  memorandum negotiated with the IMF, Mr. Ciobanu also added,  whereas nothing is being done in the self-proclaimed Dniester  Republic, no kind of reform is carried out.    Through the intention of joining the ruble zone, the  Tiraspol  authorities want to perpetuate their power and to preserve the  status quo of the separatist leadership. Moreover, they want to  reestablish -- through various ways and means -- the situation  of the former Soviet Union, Mr. Ceslav Ciobanu, President Mircea  Snegur's counselor in charge of economic issues, emphasized.    Also today, a meeting was held in Tiraspol by the City  Soviet  at which a report on the activity of the Executive Committee and  on the budget for the current year were presented. The request  by some deputies to include into the agenda other problems, such  as rationing foodstuffs, the dismissal of the public education  chief, Mrs. Vera Dvoreanu, who is defending the Latin writing in  schools in that area, led to fiery discussions, which ended with  the initiators leaving the hall in the hope that they would be  able to block the proceedings.    On behalf of the Union of Civic Movements and political  parties in the Dniester region, Igor Smirnov was asked to  dissolve the Tiraspol City Soviet until the elections for local  bodies, which are scheduled to be held in April this year.  Until then, it was demanded, the local leadership should be  handled by Vladimir Emilianov as the representative of Igor  Smirnov, the local correspondent of the Chisinau  radio-television reports.</p>

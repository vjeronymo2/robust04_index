Puolimatka is renovating a  hospital for burn victims in central Moscow. The project is  valued at around 50 million [Finnish] markkas. The project is to  be commenced before the end of the year, since Puolimatka has  already received the advance payment that was a requirement  before work could start.    The hospital renovation will provide jobs for around 10  Finns  and about 150 local workers. Makers of construction materials  and other subcontractors will also benefit.    The [Russian] joint partner and supplier of hospital  technical equipment is Medko Medical Ltd. An operating room and  62 bed places, of which 10 are to be reserved for intensive-care  patients, will be renovated in the hospital.</p>

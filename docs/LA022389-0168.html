			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Mediator Meets With Airline: A federal mediator began meeting with  representatives of Eastern Airlines and the Machinists union in a last-ditch  effort to reach a settlement before a 30-day cooling-off period expires. The  airline rejected the National Mediation Board's offer of binding arbitration to  end the 16-month dispute. That rejection triggered the 30-day period, after  which the union will be free to strike and the airline free to impose its  disputed terms on workers. In a related development, Eastern's pilots said they  would cross Machinists union picket lines if there's a strike next month,  provided the troubled carrier's owner grants them concessions in their own  contract.  </P></p>

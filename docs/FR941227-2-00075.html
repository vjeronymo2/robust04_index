The contractor's submission of an invoice constitutes a representation that the supplies have been delivered to a post office, common carrier, or point of first receipt by the Government; and the contractor agrees to replace, repair, or correct supplies not received at destination, damaged in transit, or not conforming to the purchase/delivery order. In the case of services, submission of the invoice means that required services have been satisfactorily performed.

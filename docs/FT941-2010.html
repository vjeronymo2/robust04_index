			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Channel 5 television 'should be digital' Plans to launch television channels using existing technology should be frozen until a full analysis can be carried out of the economics of digital television, a report being published today suggests. Mr Dermot Nolan, a director of Convergent Decisions Group, a new consultancy, argues that the launch of a new Channel 5 service in the UK using present analogue technology would be trapped in 'a twilight era'. Mr Nolan, who until recently specialised in digital broadcasting and tele-communications issues at consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, says digital channels - broadcast from terrestrial transmitters - will be operational in the next five years. The Independent Television Commission has made it clear that it wants to readvertise a Channel 5 licence but has asked the government whether the necessary frequencies are still available. Both the national heritage department and the Department of Trade and Industry are looking into the issues involved. Mr Nolan concedes that going ahead with Channel 5 would cause very little disruption to the roll out of digital terrestrial television. The average number of national digital channels available would be reduced from 10 to eight in a period when existing channels - such as BBC1 - would still have to be transmitted in the old form. This would cater for those who did not have digital receivers. There is a growing belief in industrialised countries that the radio spectrum is a vital resource and that it is inefficient to use it for analogue rather than digital television. Mr Nolan says: 'A fundamental overhaul of broadcasting and telecom-munications legislation is now required to retain UK competitiveness in broad-casting and telecommuni-cations, in order to exploit the benefits of digital television.'</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH CHINA MOVE STIRS CAPITOL HILL CRITICS;  </P> <P> POLITICS: DEMOCRATS AND A SPRINKLING OF REPUBLICANS VOW TO SEEK REVERSAL OF  TRADE BENEFITS.  </P> <P> Congressional Democrats and a sprinkling of Republicans denounced President  Bush's renewal of trade benefits for China on Thursday and vowed to enact  legislation reversing the decision.  </P> <P> Within hours of Bush's announcement that he plans to extend China's  most-favored-nation trade status for a year, measures to nullify the action  were introduced in both Senate and House.  </P> <P> Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) called the President's  decision "inconsistent with American values . . . contrary to American  interests and . . . profoundly wrong."  </P> <P> "I'll tell you one thing: China is not my most favored nation," said Sen. Alan  Cranston (D-Calif.), chairman of the Asia subcommittee of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee. He scheduled a June 5 hearing on the issue.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Bush's opponents face an uphill battle to muster the necessary  two-thirds majority in both houses to override the President's certain veto of  a resolution of disapproval.  </P> <P> Despite the emotional criticism of the President's action, the  most-favored-nation bill enjoys substantial support among U.S. firms that do  business with China. Leaders of these companies can be expected to make their  views known on Capitol Hill before the matter is brought to a vote sometime  this summer.  </P> <P> Bush narrowly averted defeat last January when the Senate fell four votes short  of overturning his veto of legislation protecting Chinese students in the  United States from deportation. The Senate action came after the House had  voted overwhelmingly to override the veto.  </P> <P> The President had far less support in the business community for his position  on the student bill than he enjoys on the most-favored-nation issue. Also, the  vote on the earlier measure was taken when the memory of the Tian An Men Square  crackdown was fresher.  </P> <P> Still, the initial reaction on Capitol Hill was overwhelmingly critical.  Although Democrats were the most numerous, some conservative Republicans,  including Sens. Alphonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) and Jake Garn (R-Utah), joined in.  </P> <P> "Sought-after trade concessions should not be given to the butchers of  Beijing," D'Amato said. "America must have only one standard for human rights.  MFN for China at this time is a repudiation of everything this country stands  for: freedom, human rights and democracy."  </P> <P> Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said that Bush's decision "puts the United  States on the wrong side of human rights. . . . "  </P> <P> Sen. Alan Dixon (D-Ill.), co-author with D'Amato of one resolution to reverse  Bush's decision, told a press conference that the Chinese leadership's record  on human rights abuses has gotten worse since the Beijing massacre, despite  Bush's efforts at "appeasement."  </P> <P> "The government of the People's Republic has stepped up persecution of the  Roman Catholic Church and other groups and has purged or persecuted Chinese  academics, journalists, police and government officials who expressed any  support for the democracy movement," Dixon said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Shawn Pogatchnik contributed to this story.  </P></p>

"The United States and North Korea virtually agreed at a  series of contacts in New York last month to simultaneously  resolve the issues of the third round of North Korea-U.S.  high-level talks, North Korea's acceptance of full-fledged  nuclear inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) and exchange of special envoys between South and North  Korea," the senior official said Monday. "So we expect a great  change in inter-Korean relations this year."    He said that Washington and Pyongyang will have another  working-level contact to reach final agreement and he expects  direct consultation between the IAEA and North Korea to resume  soon.    An IAEA inspection team could enter North Korea as soon as  Jan. 10, he said. On the day the team enters North Korea, Seoul  will announce suspension of its "Team Spirit" joint military  exercise with the United States, and Washington will announce  the holding of a third-round of high-level talks with Pyongyang,  he added. The two Koreas are expected to have a working-level  contact for exchange of special envoys.    "Pyongyang and Washington are expected to have the third  round of their high-level talks as early as around the end of  this month to find a thorough and broad solution of the North  Korean nuclear problem and discuss improvement of  Pyongyang-Washington relations," he said.    Former opposition leader Kim Tae-chung, who is engaged in  the  study of unification, said on New Year's day that he expects  great progress and even an inter-Korean summit this year if the  nuclear problem is solved.    The government should lay emphasis on solving the nuclear  problem and then on resumption and revitalization of  inter-Korean economic cooperation, Kim said.    At the end of last year, President Kim Yong-sam told  journalists that he saw signs of change beginning to show and  there would be an important turning point in inter-Korean  relations in early 1994.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [BELINFORM-TASS report: "Will the Ruble Come to </F> Belorussia?"]    [Text] Whether the Treaty on Monetary Union with Russia  goes ahead or not now depends on the results of Belorussia's  [Belarus'] presidential election, Vyacheslav Kebich, chairman of  the Republic's Council of Ministers, told a public meeting in  Grodno Oblast.    He also stressed that "this is not so much monetary union as  economic union, and it is being signed not for two or three  months but for centuries to come. I am confident that this  union will go ahead, just as I am confident that Ukraine will  also join it." According to the prime minister, in the near  future Tajikistan will also state that it is joining the  economic union.</p>

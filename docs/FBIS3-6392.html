Hideaki Kumano, vice international trade and industry minister,  told a press conference that Tokyo is doing its utmost to expand  foreign chip buying.    Kumano was responding to newspaper reports that the United  States has urged Tokyo to formulate new action plans on chip  trade, including the government encouraging the auto and  telecommunications sectors to step up foreign chip buying and  extending the current chip accord calling for the 20 percent  foreign share in the Japanese market for additional years. The  reported U.S. requests are similar to those shown in the  bilateral chip trade talks in January, Kumano said.    Washington may renew these demands in the ongoing Hawaii  talks to assess the chip trade performance in October-December  of 1993 but Japan has no intention of taking new measures,  Kumano said.    Kumano said the latest accord between Tokyo and Washington  over cellular phone trade cannot be applied to auto and other  trade issues covered under the "framework" talks.    The comment came in response to Washington's reported  request  in the past several days for Tokyo to ensure results in auto  trade areas on the basis of the approach used in settling the  trade dispute between Motorola Inc. and Nippon Idou Tshushin  Corp. (IDO).    Telecommunications trade is different from autos, Kumano  said, explaining that the former sector is under government  regulations, allowing room for government intervention.    It is "impossible" for the government to force automakers to  guarantee the size of their parts buying from the U.S., Kumano  said. Such a request would strip Tokyo of its willingness to  make efforts to get the stalled framework talks rolling again,  he said.</p>

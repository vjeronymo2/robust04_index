Has Russian and U.S. Pressure Yielded Results?'']    [Text] Recently Ukraine has speeded up the dismantling of  the nuclear missile potential it has inherited. On 20 December  Valeriy Shmarov, Ukrainian vice premier in charge of the  military industrial complex, announced that 17 nuclear SS-24  missiles (in all there are 46 SS-24's in Ukraine) have been  taken off alert. Combat nuclear units (more than 100) have been  taken down from missiles, yet they still remain in silos.  Before the end of the year Ukraine has promised to dismantle  warheads from yet another three SS-24 missiles. And in 1994,  according to Valeriy Shmarov, the remaining SS-24 missiles  located on Ukraine's territory are to be taken off alert status.  This, in spite of the fact that back on 11 August Grishchenko,  head of the Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Ministry's Arms Control  and Disarmament Department, announced that, in Kiev's opinion,  the Ukrainian SS-24's do not come under the START I Treaty and  therefore may legally be kept.    The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed that 17 warheads have  indeed been taken down from SS-24 missiles. In addition,  according to the Russian Defense Ministry, nuclear units have  been dismantled from 41 Ukrainian SS-19 missiles (more than 200  units) while part of the SS-19 missiles have already been taken  out of their silos for subsequent destruction. Therefore  approximately one-third of the Ukrainian nuclear missile  capability has been taken off alert. Clearly the joint  Russian-U.S. diplomatic and economic pressure has finally  resulted in appreciable shifts in Kiev's position. A U.S. State  Department spokesman in Washington welcomed Ukraine's latest  moves as ``a step in the right direction.''    True, full elimination of all nuclear missile disagreements  between Moscow and Kiev is still a long way off. Valeriy  Shmarov said that Russian specialists continue to service the  nuclear charges located on Ukraine's territory, and described  the Russian Government statement that such servicing has been  stopped as ``populist and uncalled for.'' Nonetheless, Colonel  General Yevgeniy Maslin, chief of the 12th Main Directorate of  the Russian Defense Ministry (earlier a highly classified branch  of the Soviet Army whose specialists deal with all matters of  storage, use, and transportation of nuclear units and are  generally responsible for all nuclear charges adopted for  service), assured SEGODNYA's correspondent that ``there are no  Russian military servicemen from the 12th Directorate in  Ukraine.'' However, the 43rd Missile Army deployed in Ukraine  includes former specialists of the 12th Main Directorate who  have ``stayed'' in Ukraine together with the army and sworn the  Ukrainian military oath, and can not now be considered Russian  servicemen.    Furthermore, only three defective SS-24 missile warheads  have  been delivered to Russian territory and transferred to  specialists of the Atomic Energy Ministry (former Sredmash).  The other decomissioned missile nuclear units are so far in  Ukraine. As before, the 43rd Army's combat unit storage  facilities remain overloaded in excess of all norms (six to  eight times, according to the 12th Main Directorate).    The question about the form and size of compensation to  Ukraine for nuclear disarmament also remains open.</p>

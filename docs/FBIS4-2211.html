			<p>BFN     [Text] Wu Yi minister of foreign trade and economic  cooperation, is to head a trade delegation to the United States  to attend the Eighth Session of the Sino-US Joint Committee on  Commerce and Trade scheduled for April 13-14. On March 17,  Beijing Review correspondent interviewed Minister Wu.    QUESTION: Minister Wu, you are preparing to lead a large  trade delegation to the United States. What is the goal of your  trip?    ANSWER: The most important mission of my participation is to  jointly preside over the Eighth Session of the Sino-US Joint  Committee on Commerce and Trade to be held on April 13-14 in  Washington, D.C., with US Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown. As  an annual government-level meeting between trade representatives  of the two governments, the committee session is the most  important channel for discussions of bilateral economic and  trade relations and other related questions. The session will  be another major event following the Sino-US summit meeting in  Seattle and the Eighth Session of the Joint Committee on  Economics presided over jointly by the Chinese minister of  finance and US finance secretary.    During the forthcoming session, the two sides will discuss  trade and investment policies, and cooperation in various  industrial sectors, including those related to information,  energy, transportation, chemical industry and environmental  cooperation, and legal issues.    As part of an effort to promote bilateral trade and US  investment in China, our delegation will launch trade and  investment negotiations in Los Angeles and New York on April 11  and 19 respectively. I hope the negotiations will allow  American industrialists to gain greater insight into the  situation in China since the introduction of the reform and  opening policies, and will provide them with access to China's  vast potential market. I also hope the meetings will attract  more American business people to trade with China and invest in  our country. The purchasing group which will accompany the  delegation to the United States will make purchases depending on  advances made during the bilateral business talks.    Q: What will be the focus of the purchasing, and what will  the level of purchases be in terms of funds?    A: The purchasing plan includes petroleum exploration and  production equipment, motor vehicles, various technologies and  light industrial products. The amount of purchases will depend  on advances made during the talks.    Q: What about Sino-US trade and investment negotiations?  What items will be included?    A: The large-scale negotiations designed to promote  investment and trade are being held in the United States for the  first time since China introduced the reform and opening  policies 15 years ago. They will be sponsored jointly by the  Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation,  Graham &amp; James of the United States and the US Asian  Association. The 200-member Chinese negotiating team will  include senior officials in charge of investment and trade from  eight ministries and commissions under the State Council, three  corporations and 25 provinces and municipalities, as well as  experts and entrepreneurs. Representatives from the six major  corporations under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation will also participate in import and export  negotiations.    The chief aim of the delegation's trip is to introduce  China's reform, opening policies and economic development, in  order to enhance mutual exchanges and understanding, and to  develop and expand economic and technological cooperation and  trade between the two countries. The delegation also intends to  encourage US business people to invest in China and further  expand investment and trade cooperation between the two  countries.    About 800 key investment projects will be offered during the  negotiations, including 60 hydroelectric and thermal power  stations, 100 highway, railway, airport and wharf construction  projects, 200 projects involving machine-building and electrical  equipment, 100 electronics projects, 100 petrochemical projects,  50 projects related to metallurgy and other industrial raw  materials, and 30 projects involving agriculture, livestock  breeding and forestry.    Q: How many similar purchasing delegation has China  organized  in the past, and how much have they influenced the development  of Sino- US trade?    A: The Chinese government has consistently attached  importance to the development of Sino-US economic and trade  relations. Since 1990, China has sent four large purchasing  delegations to the United States, two for comprehensive  purchases and two for automobiles and aircraft. All have yielded  good results. The delegations have purchased products valued at  over US$3.5 billion, including aircraft, motor vehicles, grain,  chemical fertilizers, cotton, petroleum, and machinery and  equipment. The purchases have promoted the expansion of Sino-US  economic and trade relations. Another purchasing delegation will  be sent to the United States during the joint committee's  forthcoming session. The actions indicate that the Chinese  government attaches great importance to increasing the volume of  imports from the United States.    Q: China experienced deficits in foreign trade last year,  will substantial increases in imports from the United States  further expand the deficit, and what influence will they exert  on China's overall imports and exports?    A: Deficits in Sino-US trade are unavoidable. We believe  that  a basic balance should be maintained between imports and  exports. However, instead of reducing imports, we insist on  attaining the goal by expanding exports. Our goal is to import  advanced technology and equipment needed for our modernization  drive and materials which are in short supply domestically. The  value of imports during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period  (1991-95) is expected to reach US$400 billion. At present, about  80 percent of our country's foreign exchange earnings come from  exports. If the deficit continues to grow due to the sluggish  increases in exports, our foreign exchange income will  definitely fall and will in turn adversely affect imports. I  hope our trade partners will increase their imports of our  commodities, in order to help maintain the coordinated  development of bilateral trade.    Q: The Chinese economy has developed rapidly and the whole  world has expressed great concern about the opening of China's  market. What is the current situation regarding the country's  market?    A: Opening to the outside world was the basic principle  adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central  Committee of the Communist Party of China in late 1978. In  recent years, we have further flung wide our market as part of  our efforts to open our doors wider to the outside world. Since  1991 alone, we have cut import taxes on 6,537 types of  commodities and have abolished the import regulation tax. We  have also abandoned all import substitute lists and will refrain  from making such lists in the future. We will gradually cut  licensing controls on 53 kinds of commodities currently subject  to import licence controls. Furthermore, we will bring the role  of the market economy into full play as the basis for the  optimized allocation of resources, strengthen the guidance of  industrial policies, and gradually reduce administrative  examination procedures and control. Reform of the management  mechanisms of state-owned enterprises has expanded their  management autonomy and has granted them more power in terms of  imports. Thanks to the series of policies we have adopted to  open the market further, the country's imports have grown  steadily over the past three years. In 1991, our import value  hit US$63.8 billion, up 19.6 percent over 1990. The figure rose  even further to US$80.6 billion in 1992, up 26.3 percent over  1991, and to US$103.95 billion in 1993, a rise of 29 percent  over 1992. Imports for this year will stay at or above last  year's level, and the total import value over the coming seven  years is expected to hit US$1,000 billion. The country plans to  import 210 key technological items valued at US$30 billion  between 1993 and 2000. Along with the reform of the foreign  economic and trade system, measures will be taken to further  open the market and bring it into line with the international  market. Given the above- mentioned facts and well-based  predictions, any reasonable person would conclude that China's  market is indeed open to the world. I believe that the deepening  of the reform of China's foreign economic and trade system will  offer even more chances for the entry of foreign commodities  into the Chinese market.    Q: What is the current status of Sino-US economic and trade  relations?    A: As everyone knows, Sino-US trade has expanded rapidly  since the two countries re-established diplomatic relations in  1979. According to statistics released by China's General  Customs Administration, bilateral trade jumped from US$2.45  billion in 1979 to US$27.7 billion last year, a net 12-fold  increase. During the same period, investments by US businessmen  increased on an annual basis. At present, the number of  US-funded projects in China has topped 8,000 with combined  contracted investments of US$11 billion, ranking first amongst  all overseas investors. More than 50 of the top 500 US firms  have established business bases in China. Although some  problems occurred in Sino-US trade relations last year,  bilateral trade and US investment in China continues to grow.    In my view, a major reason for the rapid development of  bilateral trade and cooperation rests with the fact that the  economies of the two countries have a strong nature of mutual  supplementation. The United States possesses advanced  technology and funds, while China has vast labor resources and  potential markets. Each year, Chinese imports from the United  States include large numbers of aircraft, and vast quantities of  wheat, chemical fertilizers and other products, as well as  machinery and electrical equipment, all of which are well  received by Chinese clients and consumers. Along with the  constant growth of the Chinese economy, imports from the United  States have increased annually, with the value reaching US$6.6  billion, US$8 billion, US$8.9 billion and US$10.7 billion for  successive years between 1990 and 1993. Although deficits  occurred in foreign trade last year, our imports of raw  materials and energy, which faced critical shortages, and  machinery and telecommunications equipment needed for further  economic development increased considerably. This once again  shows that China is a market with tremendous potential and is a  market open wide to the outside world.    I believe that the sustained growth of China's economy and  the country's grand economic development plan will create even  more favorable trade and investment opportunities for American  enterprises. We sincerely hope the US side will take positive  and practical actions, cast aside man-made obstacles, lift  controls on technology exports, and quickly resume the US Trade  Development Agency's (TDA) financial aid for project feasibility  studies, while at the same time providing US investors with risk  guarantees from the US Overseas Private Investment Co., and  reinstating preferential loans from the American Import and  Export Bank to relevant construction projects in China. Such  actions will help to further tap the vast potential of China's  imports from the United States and US investments in China.</p>

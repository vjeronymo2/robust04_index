			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Congolese Workers' Federation; </F> place and date not given]    [Text] The Congolese Workers' Federation [CSTC] has issued  a communique pointing out that its 25 January ultimatum to the  government expires at midnight on 6 February. In view of the  government's silence, which is certainly due to the fact that  the prime minister was away on an official visit in France, and  in order to show its good faith and readiness to negotiate, the  CSTC executive council renews and reiterates its proposal to  negotiate with the government and employers on the major issues  outlined in the ultimatum. This should take place within a  period of 10 days, starting from 7 February, that is, from 7  February up to and including 16 February. Once that deadline  has expired, a strike notice will be issued to embark on an  indefinite nationwide strike.    [Signed] Louis Gandou, CSTC secretary general.</p>

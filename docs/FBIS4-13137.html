			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "False and Rejected Allegations!"] </F>   [Text] Following the fedayeen operations carried out by  Palestinian citizens inside the "green line" in 'Afula and  Hadera in reply to the massacre at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque  in Hebron, the leaders of Israel have begun to utter threats and  level accusations indiscriminately. The most recent threats  were uttered by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres, who accused Jordan of allowing the free  movement of Hamas [the Islamic Resistance Movement] on Jordanian  territory. They also said that the official Hamas spokesman  claimed responsibility for the 'Afula and Hadera operations!    It is true that a media official sympathizing with Hamas has  boastfully claimed responsibility for these operations.  However, the real announcement about this responsibility came  first from loudspeakers in the Abu-Khudayr Mosque and other  mosques in Gaza. Thus, Israel's allegations that Jordan allows  freedom of movement for Hamas--only because a media official  claimed responsibility for the two operations--are false and  rejected allegations. The threats uttered by the Israeli prime  minister and foreign minister are only one link in the chain of  pressure and blackmail pursued by the Israeli leadership  whenever it feels distressed and encircled.    It is known to both us and Israel that Hamas has no  political  or military organization, nor do its members or sympathizers  carry out activities of a military nature, outside occupied  Palestine. The whole story is that certain sympathizers in the  Arab countries and other countries express support for, and  sympathy with, Hamas in the occupied territories. Moreover,  those who carried out the 'Afula and Hadera operations were  Palestinians from the occupied territories; they carried out the  two operations inside Israel despite the cordon and siege  imposed on the occupied territories.    Jordan, which has rejected such threats in the past and  which  rejects them today, will not accept this tone by the Israeli  leadership, and will not yield to any pressure or blackmail from  any party whatsoever. Jordan also believes that the Israeli  leadership should realize that its procrastination concerning  the peace process, its failure to recognize the Palestinian  people's legitimate rights, and its failure to withdraw from the  occupied territories are the reason and driving force for all  acts of violence. This leadership should be aware that a just,  comprehensive, and lasting peace would guarantee regional  stability and entrench security. Threats and insistence on both  occupation and aggression will only yield more bloodshed,  victims, and violence.</p>

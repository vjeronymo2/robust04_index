			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Northern League loses clean image after arrest The populist Northern League has been deeply embarrassed by the disclosure that Mr Alessandro Patelli, the movement's former treasurer, failed to declare L200m (Pounds 80,700) received from the Ferruzzi-Montedison group for the 1992 general elections. The rise in the League's popularity in northern Italy has been based in good measure on its image of honesty and rejection of corruption. Mr Patelli, who managed the 1992 general election campaign finances for the League, was arrested and imprisoned on Tuesday on charges of illicit party funding. He was released on Wednesday after he reportedly confessed to receiving L200m from Ferruzzi-Montedison. His alleged confession was given widespread coverage in yesterday's media. Mr Umberto Bossi, the League's leader, who has consistently claimed his party's finances were above suspicion, has been quick to defend Mr Patelli, a close aide, and declare his faith in the Milan magistrates conducting the investigation. He has also denied suggestions he might have discussed contributions to the League during a meeting with Mr Carlo Sama, the head of Montedison. Mr Francesco Speroni, head of the League group in the senate, said: 'We must see if Patelli took these monies for the League or for some company which he ran - if it is the second thesis, then it is no longer a question of illicit financing of the party. 'If on the other hand, the money ended up with the League, then this was irregular and Patelli would be at fault.' The affair comes at a delicate moment for the League, with the movement divided over whether it should seek political alliances to fight the next general election. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate, has been making overtures to form a new centre-right political alliance including the League.</p>

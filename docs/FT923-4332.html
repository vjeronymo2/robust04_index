			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Hizbollah emerges as top party The pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God) is likely to control the biggest single bloc in the Lebanese parliament after scoring sweeping victories in the country's first election in 20 years, Reuter reports from Beirut. Hizbollah and its pro-Syrian allies were well ahead of their political opponents in early results yesterday following Sunday's third and final round of voting in an election boycotted by most mainstream Christians. Diplomats said the once politically dominant Christians had thrown away much of their power by boycotting the election in protest at the presence of Syrian troops in Beirut. Diplomats and political analysts said it was unlikely that a Hizbollah victory would radicalise parliament with demands for an Islamic state and the elimination of Israel, which controls a security corridor in the south. Christians, arguing the poll would only strengthen Syria's hold over Lebanon, failed to win a delay in the election until after the planned Syrian withdrawal from Beirut later this month.</p>

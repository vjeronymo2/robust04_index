			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Second half boost for Storehouse IN FOOTBALL parlance, it was a game of two halves at Storehouse last year. After a pretty dismal first six months in which it lost Pounds 13.9m, the retailing group, which includes BhS, Mothercare, Habitat, Richards and Blazer, recorded a strong improvement in the second half with trading profits for the period bouncing to Pounds 27.3m compared with Pounds 13.2m the year before. Over the same period sales grew from Pounds 572m to Pounds 606.4m. At the heart of Storehouse's turnround was a strong recovery from BhS, the clothing and homeware group, which has undergone something of a metamorphosis under the direction of its chief executive, Mr David Dworkin - who it was announced yesterday would replace Mr Michael Julien as group chief executive. BhS contributed Pounds 22.1m (Pounds 21.6m) to full year trading profits and Pounds 634.7m (Pounds 617.7m) to sales. But Mr Dworkin believes there are further significant benefits to be reaped from BhS. 'My own view is that the month we are in is the best we have ever had. Last year we had our 'May mania' when everything that was not tied down was on sale. But even so we are beating the living hell out of those numbers this year,' he said. However, it was not the same story across the group. Although Storehouse said the sales trend had improved since Christmas, the Mothercare childrenswear business experienced a sharp fall into a Pounds 3.9m loss for the year reversing a previous profit of Pounds 6.8m. This decline was blamed on increased costs and intensified competition. Sales were slightly down at Pounds 233.8m (Pounds 234.8m). Habitat, the furniture group, also had a tough year recording losses of Pounds 8.8m against Pounds 11.9m. Its French arm made a strong contribution, but the UK was weak and Conran's Habitat in the US lost Pounds 7.7m although remedial action was promised this year. Habitat's sales also fell marginally to Pounds 201.2m (Pounds 205.9m). The Richards womenswear chain recorded a small increase in operating profits but Blazer made a small loss. Together, they accounted for Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 1.7m) of profits and Pounds 110.1m (Pounds 103.2m) of sales. Staff numbers were cut by about 500 to 14,260 during the year. Storehouse devoted Pounds 45m to capital expenditure but is stepping up its investment programme this year to more than Pounds 60m.</p>

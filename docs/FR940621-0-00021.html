This third temporary deviation retains the requirement for the bridge to open on signal as soon as possible for vessels of the United States, state and local vessels used for public safety and vessels in distress. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Request for Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in evaluation of possible changes to the regulations governing the Padanaram Bridge over the Apponagansett River by submitting written data, or arguments for or against the deviation.

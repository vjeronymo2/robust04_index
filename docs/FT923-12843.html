			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Taunton offer only 30.1% subscribed THE PUBLIC has subscribed for only 30.1 per cent of the shares on offer in Taunton Cider, making the west country drinks group the latest newly-floated company to fail to attract widespread support. Another 15.3 per cent of the 29.13m shares on offer to the public at 140p were taken up by sub-underwriters as part of offset arrangements to the 29m share institutional placing which was successfully concluded last week. While Taunton shares have failed to fire the public's attention and may initially trade at a discount next week, the company has been relatively more successful than other recent companies to float. The public took up only 23 per cent of The Telegraph Group's shares, 15 per cent of the shares in MFI, the furniture group, and only 6.4 per cent in Anglian, the double-glazing group. When Anglian began to trade yesterday the shares closed at 204p, a 6p discount to the issue price. Kenwood Appliances, the first new company to float in the post-election rush, was only 1.2 times subscribed. It opened at a premium to the 285p offer price and is now trading at a small discount. Mr Michael Cottrell, Taunton's chairman, said he was delighted with the strong institutional interest in the issue. An adviser said the support was satisfactory given the recent run of undersubscribed issues and the state of the markets and that the institutional interest was a positive sign for the aftermarket.</p>

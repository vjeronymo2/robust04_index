			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>   [Text] Yerevan, 14 May -- The Armenian Foreign Ministry is  pinning certain hopes on the new visit to the region by a  delegation of the Minsk group of the CSCE, adviser to the  Armenian Foreign Minister Aram Safaryan told an ITAR-TASS  correspondent on Friday [13 May] evening. In his opinion, the  visit demonstrates an increased interest by the international  community in the settlement of the Karabakh problem.    The Armenian spokesman thinks it is indicative that for the  last two and a half years Vladimir Kazimirov, plenipotentiary  representative of the Russian president, has arrived as a member  of the CSCE mission. Armenia would like to see in this joint  mission the symbol of expanding cooperation between the CSCE and  Russia in uniting initiatives in the interests of the settlement  of the Karabakh conflict, Aram Safaryan said.    It is absolutely obvious, he thinks, that the degree of  hostility between the conflicting parties requires an adequate  interference by international authorities who have weight and  influence on the conflicting parties.    We think, the Armenian spokesman continued, that Russia is  the only country at present that will agree to have a contingent  of peace-making forces in the conflict region to disengage the  forces. He said not only Russia but also some other countries  could participate in the contingent and admitted that it was  obvious that the willingness and readiness of Russia alone to  resolve the conflict was not enough. Without such organizations  as the United Nations and CSCE, it is difficult to imagine a  comprehensive and long-term settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh,  Safaryan said.</p>

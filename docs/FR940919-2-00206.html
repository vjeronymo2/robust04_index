			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The Commission will provide bidders a limited opportunity to cure defects in FCC Form 175 specified herein except for failure to sign the application and to make certifications. These are defects which may not be cured. See also Section 1.2105. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) In the Narrowband PCS, applicants will be permitted to amend their Form 175 applications to make minor amendments to correct minor errors or defects such as typographical errors. Applicants will also be permitted to amend FCC Form 175 to make ownership changes or changes in the identification of parties to bidding consortia, provided such changes do not result in a change in control of the applicant and do not involve another applicant (or parties in interest to an applicant) who has applied for any of the same licenses as the applicant. Amendments which change control of the applicant will be considered major amendments. An FCC Form 175 which is amended by a major amendment will be considered to be newly filed and cannot be resubmitted after applicable filing deadlines. See also Section 1.2105. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Section 24.429 is amended by deleting paragraph (b) and redesignating paragraphs (c) and (d) as (b) and (c), respectively, to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Sec. 24.429&blank;Ownership Changes and Agreements To Amend or To Dismiss Applications or Pleadings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Applicability. Subject to the provisions of Sec. 1.2105 (Bidding Application and Certification Procedures; Prohibition of Collusion), this section applies to applicants and all other parties interested in pending applications who wish to resolve contested matters among themselves with a formal or an informal agreement or understanding. This section applies only when the agreement or understanding will result in: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A major change in the ownership of an applicant to which Sec. 24.423(c) and 24.423(g) would apply or which would cause the applicant to lose its status as a designated entity under Section 24.309, or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The individual or mutual withdrawal, amendment or dismissal of any pending application, amendment, petitioner or other pleading. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) If the amendment would cause the applicant to lose its status as a designated entity under Section 24.309, the applicant must notify the Commission of this change in status and must comply with the obligations imposed by Sections 24.308, including increasing its down payment to the level required as a non-designated entity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The provisions of Section 22.927 will apply in the event of the individual or mutual withdrawal, amendment or dismissal of any pending application, amendment, petitioner or other pleading. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Section 24.430 is revised to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Sec. 24.430&blank;Opposition to Applications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Petitions to deny (including petitions for other forms of relief) and responsive pleadings for Commission consideration must comply with Section 1.2108 and must: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Identify the application or applications (including applicant's name, station location, Commission file numbers and radio service involved) with which it is concerned; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Be filed in accordance with the pleading limitations, filing periods, and other applicable provisions of Secs. 1.41 through 1.52 except where otherwise provided in Section 1.2108; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Contain specific allegations of fact which, except for facts of which official notice may be taken, shall be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof, and which shall be sufficient to demonstrate that the petitioner (or respondent) is a party in interest and that a grant of, or other Commission action regarding, the application would be prima facie inconsistent with the public interest; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Be filed within thirty (30) days after the date of public notice announcing the acceptance for filing of any such application or major amendment thereto (unless the Commission otherwise extends the filing deadline); and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Contain a certificate of service showing that it has been mailed to the applicant no later than the date of filing thereof with the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A petition to deny a major amendment to a previously filed application may only raise matters directly related to the amendment which could not have been raised in connection with the underlying, previously filed application. This does not apply to petitioners who gain standing because of the major amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) parties who file frivolous petitions to deny may be subject to sanctions including monetary forfeitures, license revocation, if they are FCC licensees, and may be prohibited from participating in future auctions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23176 Filed 9&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6712&hyph;01&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING> Z <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=39 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

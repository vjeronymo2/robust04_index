			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The management of Lithuanian Radio and TV has  officially announced the partial curtailment of the relay of the  Ostankino TV channel if Ostankino does not pay its debt to  Lithuanian communications men by the beginning of April. The  decision has been taken, ANI agency notes, despite the fact that  the Ostankino TV channel is the only Russian TV channel relayed  throughout Lithuania and has the highest rating in the republic.  According to the calculations of Lithuanian communications men,  the debt of the transmitting station in Moscow equals  approximately 1 billion lits or $250,000. Evidently it is  appropriate to remember that in all civilized countries of the  world it is the receiving side that pays for the transmission of  broadcasts but in our country it is the other way round.</p>

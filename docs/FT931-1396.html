			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Repo is unchanged THE COST of German call money fell yesterday after the Bundesbank offered short-dated funds to German commercial banks at an unchanged rate, writes James Blitz. There had been strong speculation on Tuesday night that the Bundesbank would accept bids for money market funds in its weekly operation at levels well above established rates, tightening conditions in the cash market. Many banks had been preparing to bid aggressively for funds so as not to fall foul of Germany's new minimum reserve requirements at the end of the month. As it turned out, the repo rate was unchanged at 8.25 per cent. In part, this was because the Bundesbank made another generous provision of liquidity to the tune of DM10.2bn. Most of the bids were reported to be between 8.25 per cent and 8.27 per cent, and this also suggested that the Bundesbank encouraged some participants to bid for funds at the lower end of the range. The repo allocation eased call money rates, which fell to 8.52 per cent from 8.58 per cent at the start of the day. The June Euromark contract also rose 4 basis points from its opening level, to peak at 92.94, although it later fell back to close at 92.86. At this level it is pricing 3-month money in June at 7.14 per cent, some 75 basis points below yesterday's level for 3-month cash. Sterling markets were very quiet. There were difficulties removing a small shortage forecast by the Bank of England at Pounds 550m, and this forced the overnight rate close to 7 per cent towards the end of the day. This may have been one reason why 3-month money closed slightly firmer at 6 1/8 per cent. The prospect of another cut in UK base rates is dimming in the medium term, and some dealers are wondering whether the short-dated sterling yield curve might now go positive. 'We now have rates flattish at 6 per cent, and there will be plenty of traders eager to climb aboard the positive curve if it materialises,' said one dealer yesterday. Others remain bullish on rate cuts. According to one dealer, a strong incentive for another cut is that 5-year gilt yields are too low compared to 1-year cash if they are to attract the Pounds 50bn of investment sought by the government. Five year gilt yields are at 6 3/4 per cent compared to 5 7/8 per cent for cash.</p>

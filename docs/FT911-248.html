			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Making faces in the mirror The market seems to be feeling like I do some mornings. The telephone rings; perhaps if I go back to sleep it will go away. Despite thin trading, stock prices go on behaving as if the institutions were flooded with cash. Reality breaks through for a day, always with some utterly predictable bad news, and then fades. The ostrich mood was perfectly expressed by a broker interviewed by one of the wire services in London on Friday evening. Asked to comment on the week's profit warnings, he was ready: 'I don't believe it's as bad as they say.' In a sense, it never is as bad as they say; once a board steels itself to issuing a warning, it always tries to make sure that it will not have to issue a second. There is no reason at all, though, to assume that boards are shading their warnings more than they usually do. Costs are still rising, sales are very weak, and interest rates are being held deliberately high; the average company is bound to suffer. The UK economy is not going through a normal cyclical downturn, but a savage morning after. Every country which has joined the European monetary club as a cure for structural inflation has suffered some years of acute discomfort. Britain, by doing so after a period of financial excess, has ensured that the adjustment will be more painful than many. The corporate escape from the credit squeeze, at least, has been well mapped: the steady stream of rights issues, each greeted with unaccountable shock. Efficient market theorists will argue that all these uncomfortable facts are discounted in present price levels, and some cite the high dividend yields of UK equities in support of this idea. But the international yield gap is normal, and the reactions to news which ought to have been expected suggests that the news is not discounted. On the contrary, it suggests that the market is indulging in the wishful thinking always found at bull market climaxes - reading its picture of reality from its own price level. This is as rational as raising morale by grinning at yourself in your shaving mirror. This used to be quite a habit on Wall Street. The official US leading economic indicator formerly gave more weight to stock prices than it does now. The result was that when the market had a good run, the leading indicator rose, and this was taken as confirmation that high stock prices were justified. The Street grew wiser after 1987, and so did the statisticians. Stock prices have been de-emphasised, and the market takes less notice of the leading indicator. In other respects, the buoyancy of Wall Street is easier to justify than that of London. The consensus forecast is for a recovery, and the Fed is doing all it can to encourage one. Unfortunately, it remains a matter of jam tomorrow; the current news continues to be, mainly, worse then expected. Consumer spending, which is supposed to energise the recovery, remains depressed, despite the reported rise in confidence - not perhaps as surprising as it may look, since real disposable incomes in the US have taken their sharpest fall in 15 years. Investment is dropping, construction is still on its slow way down, and exports are not dynamic. Only the weakness of imports makes the fall in output relatively shallow. Yet while expectations about the US economy are probably drifting into touch with reality, equity prices still make inadequate allowance for debt problems. Something like last Friday's crisis at First National, the Californian life insurance company, should have been discounted. It has been obvious all along that in a depressed economy some companies which issue junk bonds would be in trouble, and so would some companies that held the bonds. Junk bond yields show that the bond market has been rational; but the 50-point fall in equities after the First National announcement suggests that reality stops there. The bond market, however, is being unrealistic in another way. Market comments, with some notable exceptions, are full of dire warnings about inflation - warnings which may in fact prevent the Fed from easing any further for some time. In fact, though, the only sign of inflation is in the level of bond yields; and this owes more to German (and Japanese) inflation expectations than to those in the US. As long as the US Treasury has to compete with the Germans for long bond funds, it must compete on yields. In the real US world, producer prices have fallen for four of the last five months, and the prices of inputs are still very soft; price expectations in industry are as weak as for the best part of two decades, wage rates follow their usual sluggish American course, and productivity has been rising as companies adjust to a soft market. It would take a much more vigorous recovery in demand than even the wildest optimists are now predicting to stretch capacity to the point where margins can be pushed up aggressively. Current estimates are that US output could rise at a 3-4 per cent rate for two years or more before any constraints began to appear, but that is still in the unknown future. In such a time frame US long bonds would surely look highly attractive; but the disappointing response to last week's auctions confirm that this is not yet the market view. The danger is that if the market does come to believe in the low-inflation scenario, while bond yields are still held up by German problems, the yield gap between bonds and equities can only be closed on the equity side. In this sense, the US equity market is potentially more vulnerable to good news than to bad, while the London market may well be more vulnerable to Wall Street than to reality. Finally, a footnote about insider trading. Mr Alistair Alcock, a former director of corporate finance at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, now at the University of Buckingham, has sent me a couple of spirited articles he has written on the subject in the New Law Journal, which may not be on your normal reading list. He suggests that the insider trading law should be renamed the Protection of Market-Makers Act, which gives you the tone. Try reading law for a change.</p>

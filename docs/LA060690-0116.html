			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. MAKES IT A GOOD DAY FOR INCUMBENTS  </P> <P> Despite their occasional gripes, Orange County voters appeared to be returning  two supervisors and most of the other incumbent county officers, including  Sheriff Brad Gates, to their jobs, according to early election results Tuesday.  </P> <P> A third incumbent supervisor facing reelection, Harriett M. Wieder, and Dist.  Atty. Michael R. Capizzi were also leading, but both faced multiple challengers  and needed more than 50% of the vote to avoid runoffs in November.  </P> <P> Election officials predicted that voter turnout would be close to a historic  low in Orange County after their last check at 6 p.m. showed that only 24% of  the electorate had voted. They predicted that the final turnout would be around  40%, boosted by a record number of absentee ballots for a June primary.  </P> <P> "The level of enthusiasm for this primary has been the lowest among volunteers  since I've been in this position," County Republican Party Chairman Thomas A.  Fuentes said at a party gathering in Costa Mesa shortly after the polls closed.  "You always want to see people vote as much as possible, but when we don't have  a heated race on the ticket, the voters don't turn out."  </P> <P> Fuentes said a low turnout favors incumbents, and most were leading after early  returns, including the two county supervisors on the ballot, Don R. Roth and  Thomas F. Riley.  </P> <P> In Irvine, Mayor Larry Agran and a slate of his political allies appeared  headed toward a sweep of the City Council election, but an Agran-supported  effort to preserve two pedestrian overpasses on Yale Avenue was on its way to  defeat. Agran was challenged by his longtime council antagonist, Sally Anne  Sheridan.  </P> <P> "I think my victory will mean ratification of the progressive path we have been  on, a path that sees local government as an instrument for environmental  protection, to bring about transportation solutions and address social issues,'  Agran said.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), the only state legislator in the  county to be challenged in the primary, was leading by almost a 2-1 margin in  the early returns. The conservative Ferguson was opposed by moderate Republican  Phyllis Badham, who had campaigned on her support for abortion rights and  protection for the environment.  </P> <P> In the 58th Assembly District, where five Republicans were vying to succeed  retiring incumbent Dennis Brown (R-Los Alamitos), Long Beach orthopedic surgeon  Dr. Seymour Alban was leading Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays. The  district which straddles the county line is predominantly Republican, and the  winner of the GOP primary would be a favorite to assume the seat after  November.  </P> <P> In the Democrats' most contentious race in Orange County, former Assistant U.S.  Atty. Tom Umberg had a healthy lead over Jerry Yudelson in their battle for the  Assembly seat representing parts of Garden Grove, Anaheim and Santa Ana. The  winner will face Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) in November.  </P> <P> For Riley, 77, it was his fifth campaign for the supervisors post representing  South Orange County, which has some of the area's most rapidly developing  territory. Riley was appointed to the board in 1974 by Gov. Ronald Reagan. He  was first elected in 1976, and was reelected in 1978, 1982 and 1986.  </P> <P> Roth also faced an opponent who did not actively campaign. Wieder, however,  drew four opponents, partly because she was considered vulnerable after a  losing campaign for Congress in 1988. She also was the target of an  unsuccessful recall attempt launched after she voted in favor of a development  in environmentally sensitive Laguna Canyon.  </P> <P> Still, political experts consider supervisors' seats among the most protected  among incumbents in the county. The three supervisors recently reported a total  of about $300,000 in their campaign accounts contrasted with less than $20,000  for their five opponents.  </P> <P> Together, the incumbents represent a majority on the all-Republican five-member  board. That board voted 3 to 2 in 1987 -- without Roth -- to build a jail near  Anaheim, prompting area residents to place an initiative on the ballot that  would require all future jails to be built in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Measure A was losing by a wide margin in early returns, even though proponents  originally thought it would pass easily. They now admit that the issue lost  some of its urgency in the past year and residents no longer feel so threatened  by the possibility of a jail being built nearby.  </P> <P> In statewide races, Orange County was closely watching some of its politicians  as they tried to reach higher office.  </P> <P> In the Republican primary for lieutenant governor, state Sen. Marian Bergeson  (R-Newport Beach) held a slight lead over Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) in  early returns statewide. In Orange County, the early returns had Bergeson with  a sizable lead.  </P> <P> State treasurer candidate Angela (Bay) Buchanan of Irvine was trailing the  incumbent, Thomas Hayes, in the GOP primary. Buchanan was losing significantly  in statewide and Orange County results.  </P> <P> In the first-ever election for state insurance commissioner, Huntington Beach  City Councilman Wes Bannister was leading a field of five Republican candidates  seeking the GOP nomination for the post.  </P> <P> Bergeson and Seymour, both involved in Orange County politics for more than 10  years, brought anguish to many in the county when they launched their competing  bids for their party's nomination for lieutenant governor. Many Republicans in  the county like them both and were distressed at having to choose between them.  A Times Poll of Orange County voters last month had Seymour leading Bergeson  slightly, but a third of the Republican voters said they were still undecided.  </P> <P> In many parts of the county, the local elections were all but invisible.  </P> <P> All five of the GOP congressmen who represent parts of Orange County sought  reelection, but none was challenged by a fellow Republican in the June primary.  </P> <P> Of the county's seven Assembly members up for reelection, only one -- Ferguson  -- was challenged in the primary. All of the incumbents are Republican; each  will face a Democrat in the general election.  </P> <P> In the state Senate, only one of the eight seats representing a part of Orange  County is up for election this year. It belongs to Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim).  Royce also has no primary challenger, although he too will face a Democrat in  November.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Ted Johnson contributed to this report.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANIMAL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS  </P> <P> The weakness of your argument lies in couching it in "either-or" terms.  </P> <P> You view life as a hierarchy. It's not -- it's a monarchy. When we seek to  advance humankind by experimenting, inflicting pain, and, ultimately killing a  fellow creature we do so by sacrificing all semblance of human character. We  are called as stewards, not despots. To advocate that these must die that we  may live is the mentality that has turned the earth into a dunghill.  </P> <P> RICHARD DUNKERLY  </P> <P> Whittier  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POST-UNITY APATHY GRIPS GERMAN VOTERS  </P> <P> On the surface, it is a cozy tableau: The spicy fragrance of hot mulled wine  warming a frosty evening as families thread their way through the annual  Christmas market, stopping to buy hand-dipped candles or to treat their  children to pony rides.  </P> <P> Wolfgang Meckelberg, an earnest high-school teacher campaigning for Parliament,  patrols the crowd, trying to hand out pamphlets and miniature flags.  </P> <P> "Get lost!" someone mutters as the candidate passes by.  </P> <P> The sentiment is hardly unique to this gritty industrial valley as Germans  prepare to vote Sunday as a united nation for the first time since Adolf Hitler  came to power in 1933.  </P> <P> In Gelsenkirchen, at least, the mood seems more "Bah, humbug" than "Ho, ho,  ho."  </P> <P> Even the politicians are having a hard time getting excited about what by all  rights should be a significant election.  </P> <P> "I'm afraid people won't even rouse themselves to go vote this time," said  Joachim Posz, the district's incumbent Parliament member and a Social Democrat.  The liberal party traditionally carries an enthusiastic majority here in the  Ruhr Valley of western Germany.  </P> <P> "People are just drained emotionally," Posz explained. "We've lived through so  much in this past year, with the Berlin Wall opening and reunification."  </P> <P> His Christian Democratic challenger agrees.  </P> <P> "Maybe outsiders see this as a time for jubilation across Germany again," said  Meckelberg, "but that's not how the Germans themselves see it."  </P> <P> Now, the prospect of choosing someone to lead united Germany into a new  European era seems anti-climatic. The campaign, too, has been passionless, with  no polarizing issues to separate the main parties, as East-West rivalries and  disarmament did in the past. Opinion polls for months have forecast an  overwhelming victory for Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his center-right Christian  Democrats.  </P> <P> "An election battle without a fight," summed up the liberal Munich daily  newspaper Sueddeutsche.  </P> <P> "All other issues -- ecology, unemployment, social services -- were put on the  back burner throughout this yearlong happening," said Gelsenkirchen City  Manager Klaus Bussfeld. "Unification, emotionally, was like having Christmas,  New Year's Eve and your birthday all come on the same day."  </P> <P> Campaign managers made a few gimmicky attempts to recapture the drama.  </P> <P> For example, the Social Democrats consider one of the high points of their  campaign here the day they made a replica of the Brandenburg Gate out of  bedsheets.  </P> <P> The party urged passers-by to stroll through the wash 'n' wear gate on  Unification Day in October to vicariously share the thrill of Berliners whose  once-divided city is now reconnected at the famous gate.  </P> <P> This coal-and-steel town of about 300,000 people shares many of the problems  that bedevil the five new states that once made up East Germany: unemployment,  a severe housing shortage, environmental damage.  </P> <P> And as inhabitants here watch billions of marks pour into the east in an effort  to bring it up to western German standards, cynicism, apathy and a growing  bitterness appear to have replaced the euphoria and optimism of Nov. 9, 1989,  the day the Wall opened.  </P> <P> "Why don't they send some of that help our way, do something to finance us,  too?" demanded Wilhelm Katt, who works for a large foundry.  </P> <P> "Did you hear about the railroad workers over there (in the east) going on  strike for wages equal to ours?" he asked. "That's a provocation. They only pay  a fraction what we do in rent, and they don't produce as much. Why should they  earn the same?"  </P> <P> Siegfried Dulog, a trade unionist, also complained of high expectations by the  former East Germans.  </P> <P> "In all fairness, everybody pays for unification, easterners as well as  westerners," Dulog said. "But the problem is that we spent the past 50 years  building our country up and now they want everything overnight. They expect too  much too soon.  </P> <P> "The mood here is no good."  </P> <P> Monika Kandelbinder, 26, is similarly disgruntled and sees little point in  going to the voting booth on Sunday.  </P> <P> "What's it matter, anyway?" she asked from the booth where she sells her  mother-in-law's ceramic crafts at the Christmas market.  </P> <P> "I've been out of work for six years now," Kandelbinder added, "and I doubt the  election is going to change that.  </P> <P> "It hardly matters who governs us now. Their promises are the same, and so are  their lies," she said.  </P> <P> "All anybody cares about is how much unification is going to cost and who has  to bear the cost," Kandelbinder said. "Well, it's going to be the same as it  always is, I can tell you now. The money will go right into the pockets of the  big shots and, as usual, the little guy will be the one paying for it all."  </P></p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Arts: Worlds Apart - Theatre The Theatre Royal in Stratford East must be the friendliest theatre in London. Many of its performances go straight back to the comedy shows like Take It From Here that used to give such universal pleasure on the old BBC Radio: full of silly jokes, some of which are very funny. Worlds Apart, the new work by the theatre's resident writer Paul Sirett, is far too good-natured to be much of a satire and too loosely structured to be much of a play, but it would be difficult not to enjoy it. As the genesis of a television series it would probably run for years, for there is no limit to what the immigration officers at London's Heathrow airport might get up to. Heathrow is where the piece is set, or more precisely the SEA, which stands for the secondary examination area. British immigration officials are the 'last blue line - after us, Armageddon]' They are there to stop foreigners getting in, particularly if they are anything other than white and most of all if they use the dreaded words 'political asylum'. Any bureaucratic excuse will do to send them back. The piece is quite clever about this. The word 'colour' is never mentioned by the immigration authorities: the law is against discrimination of this kind. Still, the old prejudice lingers on. Those held up for examination in the SEA include a black American air force man coming for a weekend from Wiesbaden, a successful East African Asian who has long been a British citizen and was once voted young businessman of the year, a pregnant woman from Zaire coming to see her husband, a not very white looking Spanish dancer arriving for an international competition, and a Tibetan artist trying to get away from Chinese persecution by having stowed away on a freight plane from Angola. Only the Tibetan is a genuine candidate for asylum. The authorities respond by saying that he can stay if, in effect, he agrees to spy on other Asian immigrants. Worlds Apart is clever again in that the main conflicts take place more between the detainees themselves than with the authorities. The East African Asian, who has become more English than the English, takes a particular dislike to the black American. The latter plainly does not think much of Britain, regardless of colour. The immigration officers are a less than homogeneous group as well. One of them spends his time composing scripts for pornographic telephone calls. Another leaks the presence of the Zairean lady to a liberal lawyer outside the airport. The explanation for this lack of solidarity is that the officer in question is not only gay; he is Welsh. If the description makes the piece sound earnest, it is nothing of the kind. One suspects there will be a lot of topical ad-libbing from night to night. The East Africa Asian, played with effortless superiority by Madhav Sharma, passes the cricket test. On Monday he commiserated with the English over the dreadful collapse before the Indians in Calcutta: then he took a swipe at the Pakistanis. The Spanish dancer has had planted on her some photographs to be delivered to a tabloid newspaper. Only the East African Asian recognises who is being exposed and wonders what the Conservative Party is coming to. Like his detention at the airport, he says it would never have happened under Margaret Thatcher. Some of the jokes are low. One of the women in the immigration service left the police force because of sexual harassment. 'God, they must have been desperate,' says one of the men. It is old radio comedy brought up-to-date and made multi-ethnic, though still broadly unilingual. Jeff Teare directs and while Sirett could take his talents to television there is huge pleasure in seeing Worlds Apart on stage with a live script and a lively audience.

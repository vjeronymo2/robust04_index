			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, Jan 25 (AFP) -- The 39-nation UN Conference  on Disarmament opened here Tuesday [25 January] with French  Ambassador Gerard Errera denouncing North Korea's [DPRK] refusal  to allow international inspections of its nuclear sites.    Errera, chairman of the conference, said Pyongyang's refusal  cannot be "treated as only a regional issue."    He said the world's major nuclear powers -- the United  States, Russia, France, Britain and China -- could not "accept  to impose nuclear constraints on themselves if other countries  continue to secretly develop nuclear weapons programs."    North Korea suspended inspections of its nuclear sites by  the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in January 1993 and  three months later threatened to pull-out of the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty, sparking fears that it was developing  or had already developed a nuclear bomb.    Errera added that Iraq had also raised fears within the  international community that it was developing its nuclear  capability and that the breakup of the Soviet Union was  threatening the implementation of the non-proliferation treaty.    There are fears that stocks of fissionable material have  been  sold or otherwise channelled from former Soviet bloc countries  to countries secretly engaged in nuclear research.    The UN conference here, aimed at securing pledges from the  nuclear powers for a comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT), is to  set up an ad-hoc committee to negotiate the treaty.    The United States has already expressed reservations about  Iraq being a member.    UN representative Vladimir Petrovskiy said Tuesday that he  would be in favor of enlarging the committee to include  additional members.    Errera, in his opening statement, also said that "today's  reality does not reflect the past where two superpowers could  negotiate between themselves a disarmament treaty and then  present it for ratification by the international community."    The five nuclear powers nevertheless have their own  reservations about a CTBT.    The United States, Russia, France and Britain have for  example suspended their tests, whereas China carried out an  explosion as recently as last October and appears in no hurry to  conclude testing.    In any event, signing a test ban treaty would in no way  imply  that the nuclear five were ready to give up their nuclear  stockpiles or abandon the doctrine of nuclear deterrence.    Errera said he could not predict how long the conference  would last. "The main thing is that the talks should be taken  seriously so that we can work towards a treaty acceptable to  everybody."    It appeared unlikely that they would conclude before the  1995  expiry date of the current Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  (NPT) which the Western powers wish to extend for a period of  several years.</p>

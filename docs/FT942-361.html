The company also announced that Mr Anthony Turnbull intends to step down as chief executive at the beginning of next year.

The company, which last year merged with Bernard Thorpe, has expanded its regional network as well as increasing international operations. Mr Richard Lay, chairman, said that the results showed that the policies were starting to bear fruit. On the general state of the commercial property market, he said: 'We have seen a reversal in the trends of previous years and a significant recovery in the capital values of commercial investment property as yields have fallen to reflect the reduction in short term interest rates. 'However, we have not yet seen any return to growth in rental values across the country and until this does occur we shall not enjoy a sustainable recovery in our markets.'</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Refugee camp blaze kills 17 Vietnamese At least 17 Vietnamese refugees were burnt to death and more than 100 injured in a blaze that broke out during a brawl in a boat people's camp in Hong Kong last night, Reuter reports. Riot police fired smoke bombs to stop the fight, which started as people prepared for Lunar New Year celebrations at Shek Kong camp in the New Territories. Firemen found the incinerated bodies in the remains of a hut. There have been several pitched battles over the years in Hong Kong's Vietnamese refugee camps, where the number of boat people reached 64,000 last year. The Shek Kong camp houses 9,000 Vietnamese in a collection of huts built on a military air base in a narrow valley.</p>

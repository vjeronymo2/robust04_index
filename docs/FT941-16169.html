			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Clinton in Europe: Nato moves closer to Bosnian air strikes Nato leaders yesterday moved closer to using aircraft against Bosnian Serb forces, threatening air strikes if obstacles to the UN in two Bosnian 'safe areas' were not removed. The threat to use US and allied air power in pursuit of specific objectives came as the result of a joint French-British initiative adopted at the Nato summit. Allied heads of government called on UN military authorities in former Yugoslavia to draw up urgent plans to get fresh UN troops into the Moslem enclave of Srebrenica and examine ways of opening the airport at Tuzla for humanitarian relief. The latest threat, designed to respond to increasing pressure on Nato to take effective action in Bosnia, was added to a joint declaration by the 16 leaders at the end of their two-day meeting. The declaration said Nato was determined to eliminate obstacles to the UN Protection Force (Unprofor) in accomplishing its mandate. However, Mrs Tansu Ciller, the Turkish prime minister, said she was disappointed that the threat did not amount to an explicit ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs. US President Bill Clinton said he strongly supported the initiative. However, according to French officials, the US pleaded with France before the summit not to put action on the two Bosnian safe areas on to the agenda. Mr Clinton, who warned the other allies during the meeting against making empty threats, said Serb activities in either area 'could require the use of Nato, including US, air power'. Mr Manfred Worner, the Nato secretary-general, said there was 'a stronger determination' to implement the threat of air attacks which allies issued last August. The situation in Srebrenica, where a contingent of Dutch troops is due to relieve 300 Canadians but are being blocked by Serb forces, was described as 'intolerable' by Mr John Major, the British prime minister. 'It is quite clear that if it is necessary to use air power to achieve (the rotation of forces) then we would be prepared to use it,' he said. President Francois Mitterrand of France said he expected Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, secretary- general of the UN, to approve the plan. However, although all allies signed up to the new policy, Mr Clinton admitted there were still divergences. 'Some of us, I think it's clear, were stronger than others about the appropriateness of it,' he said. Mr Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister, said bombing was a last resort. 'We always said we are not enthusiastic about air strikes,' he said. Earlier, Greece and Denmark also expressed reluctance about attacking the Serbs. Mr Clinton said he had insisted on keeping Nato's earlier threat to employ air power to help relieve the shelling of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, but accepted that this was the subject of differences among the allies, some of whom were worried about reprisals against their troops on the ground. But, with UN troops increasingly endangered, Nato was 'closer to real unanimity', the president added.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tale Sotirovski: "Modest Consumption Is a </F> Virtue!"]    [Text] Bearing in mind the financial indicators and  the size of the state apparatus, unquestionably the Macedonian  State [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] is  among those who function most efficiently and economically.    In administering the state, it is only the most  necessary jobs that are filled, and they are most strictly  controlled.    The cost of legislative work has increased.    The representative missions operate on a subsistence  level with obsolete equipment.    Given the situation in which we find ourselves today, with a  variety of economic difficulties, increased social tensions, job  insecurity, declining living standards, and so on, we encounter  a variety of comments, divided thoughts, and different views.  One of them that is frequently heard, most likely triggered by  the latest price increases, is the following: One cannot build  a new state at no cost. Unquestionably, this is quite true, as  is the second view, which seemed to be the precise opposite of  the first: that under the circumstances in which we are creating  and building an independent and sovereign Macedonian State,  costs should not matter. Based on our possibilities, we should  build the state on a firm and stable basis.    In all cases, regardless of the various shades of meaning,  one way or another the two views lead to the same question:  What kind of state are we developing, be it expensive or  inexpensive, and at what cost, even though we are dealing with a  relative concept.  <H5>  Small Steps </H5>   The answer to this question, however, is not nor could it be  simple or, even less so, claim to be accurate. To reach it,  even if within a certain global framework, we must include a  large number of parameters and perform a number of mathematical  computations. However, this does not mean that we could not  reach some more specific knowledge as to the nature of our state  and the cost of its functioning.    According to Dr. Josif Talevski, secretary to the government  of the Republic of Macedonia and a specialist in state  administration, if we are seeking the answer as to how much the  state is costing us in the financial indicators, which would  include the state agencies and management and administering  organizations, according to the projected Republic budget for  1944 [as published] submitted by the end of last month, we could  generally say that the total will exceed 48 billion denars.  This includes all the expenses of all agencies, starting with  the office of the president of the Republic, the Assembly, the  government, the ministries, and all the way to the lower-level  services and agencies. Compared to other countries, the cost is  low, particularly taking into consideration the average wages of  state officials, which are public knowledge. As we know,  furthermore, this year's budget for state authorities and  organizations has been considerably reduced as compared to last  year's. Furthermore, according to the Budget Law the recipients  of the budget in the legislative, executive, and judicial  branches must use their funds strictly for their specific  purposes, efficiently and economically.    Such an economical approach, however, involves more than  simply the use and handling of funds. The emphasis is on having  a less costly but not less efficient state and on having these  attributes become part of all aspects of the work of state  agencies and administrations. Incidentally, these bodies are  less cumbersome than the impression they project. This is  further confirmed by data: Excluding the Ministry of Internal  Affairs and Defense, they total 1,753 employees. There is  pressure to increase this number. According to Dr. Talevski,  increasing the administration is a typical phenomenon inherent  in and affecting all systems.    Dr. Talevski says that an increased administration is  directly related to increased state and public affairs. We  cannot claim to have avoided this phenomenon. It should be  pointed out, however, that in 1993 the number of employees of  budget-supported state agencies substantially declined for a  variety of reasons (retirement, attrition, etc.). More  precisely, it is only the most necessary positions that have  been filled in accordance with the systematization regulations.  Again, for this year, according to the budget laws no new  personnel may be hired unless specific funds have been  stipulated in the budget for that purpose, based on a resolution  passed by a special commission to be set up by the government.  <H5>  Extensive Meetings </H5>   According to Talevski, in discussing the size of the  administration we must always bear in mind that it must be  consistent with the size of the population and must meet the  needs of the citizens. It would be difficult, he said, to name a  country that knows precisely the size of the administration its  needs. Improving and updating the state administration presents  no problem.    "Modernizing the administration is necessary to make it more  efficient. We are still far from claiming to have a modern  administration in terms of facilities. The conclusion is that we  cannot accuse the administration of inefficiency if we do not  invest in its modernization. It is enough to take a look at our  local offices and their facilities. Updating them may increase  the cost of state management, but if we want efficiency the cost  is inevitable."    The legal authorities of the state cannot be ignored in  determining whether the cost of running the state should be  higher or lower. In this specific case, more funds would be  required to ensure the unobstructed work and functioning of the  Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia. Among others, we must  provide for the salaries of the 137 Assembly officials, the 76  permanent paid representatives, and the 53 managers and experts,  and cover other expenses. Such expenses have not declined. As  of 8 January 1991 [as published], for example, so far 72  sessions have been held, many of which have been extended. A  large number of them were initiated and not completed.  Therefore, adding this all together it turns out that, in  practical terms, the parliament was in session one day out of  three. On the other hand, it has been calculated that an average  session, including the cost of printing, public facilities,  toilet articles, and per diem and travel expenditures, costs  about 300,000 denars. Here is another piece of information: The  cost of the 68th parliamentary session was 34,570 denars for per  diem expenses; payments to the representatives for the 11 months  of last year totaled 18.329 milion denars.  <H5>  Transportation </H5>   The premises of the representatives of the Macedonian State  are furnished with obsolete and worn-out equipment, and their  transportation fleet is very modest. The service in charge of  general and Assembly work for the Macedonian Government, which  services all state authorities and organizations, has only two  small airplanes and about 35 various vehicles, most of them of  inexpensive models. The fleet is quite obsolete and should be  updated. However, there are no financial possibilities  whatsoever to update it. As the service officials have stated,  they will wait for better times.  <H5>  Obsolete Facilities </H5>   Based on the sums we have quoted, it is quite obvious that  the Macedonian State is not among the rich. Despite the existing  economic circumstances, it insists that the necessary functions  be performed with a modest amount of the people' money. However,  this does not mean that this situation can last forever. With  the expansion of international and other activities, and the  opening of diplomatic and other missions within Macedonia and  Macedonian missions abroad, commitments will increase and so  will demand for funds. In this connection, another topical issue  is that of representational facilities. It is a fact that our  country still has no proper residence in which to house heads of  state or government or any other high guests. It is true that  Skopje and Ohrid each have two cottages used to house  representatives of foreign countries visiting Macedonia. They  are in such poor condition, however, that we should not even  list them as representative facilities. They have remained  virtually unchanged since they were built, with worn-out and  obsolete amenities, and they have a large number of other  unsolved problems. In terms of their purpose, they are  dysfunctional.    According to Boris Treneski, who heads the Service for  General and Assembly Projects of the Macedonian Government, it  is precisely for such reasons that we must concern ourselves  with these facilities and bring them up to modern standards. In  that sense, the government has already passed a resolution on  renovating the four cottages -- "Makedonija," and "Vodno" in  Vodno, and "Biljana" and "Ohrid" in Ohrid -- and on refurbishing  the Representatives Club in Skopje, making it suitable for  receiving foreign delegations. Furthermore, possibilities will  be sought to provide proper premises for an international press  center. Considering the economic situation, this will not be  easy. However, we have no choice.  <H5>  Who Receives What? </H5>   Office of the President of the Republic: 22,663,000    Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia: 162,478,000    Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia:  11,349,000    Government of the Republic of Macedonia: 56,758,000    Ministry of Defense: 3,532,097,000    Minister of Internal Affairs: 2,895,533,000    Ministry of Justice and Administration: 70,123,000    Ministry of Finance: 21,245,616,000    Ministry of the Economy: 139,436,000    Ministry of Development: 11,504,000    Ministry of Urbanization, Urban Communications, and Ecology:  251,525,000    Ministry of Agriculture, Forests, and Water Resources:  2,828,849,000    Ministry of Labor and Social Policy: 5,745,099,000    Ministry of Education and Physical Culture: 6,386,191,000    Ministry of Science: 295,509,000    Ministry of Culture: 796,899,000    Ministry of Health: 138,613,000    Ministry of Information: 108,546,000</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / On the road to righteousness / Assessing the Brazilian economy two years after President Collor took office Outside the petrol stations along Rio's Atlantic coast road lies evidence of a sea-change in Brazilian attitudes. Large discount signs mark the country's first fuel price war. Those with the best offers are rewarded by queues of cars outside. The price war is a symbol of a trend President Fernando Collor has set in motion during his first two years in office: one of the world's most state-regulated countries is finally discovering the benefits of a free market. A year ago, it was illegal to discount government-set pump prices. Mr Collor may not yet have succeeded in bringing inflation under control or in stimulating the world's ninth-largest economy, but he has persuaded the people that Brazil can no longer resist the global move towards the market. 'Collor has succeeded in implanting a liberal agenda and this process is irreversible,' says Mr Cesar Maia, an economist from the Democratic Movement, the main opposition party. It is now possible openly to suggest ending the monopoly of Petrobras, the state oil giant - heresy a year ago. A project to deregulate the country's inefficient ports is before Congress. Discussion on the Dollars 120bn foreign debt focuses not on whether to pay it, but how. The once zealously enforced ban on computer imports ends in October. The stock market has opened to foreign investment. Regulatory discrimination against foreign companies is being stripped away. The most outstanding demonstration of the change is the acceptance of privatisation. The first big sale finally got under way last October amid bloody riots. Only five months later, Mr Luiz Antonio de Medeiros, leader of Forca Sindical, a trade union, is asking the government to speed up the sale of steel companies so that they can compete better. The old Brazil is still visible. The car producers threaten mass unemployment at every mention of reducing import tariffs. The airlines still collude to reduce routes and decide prices, and manufacturers still tend to react to recession by lifting prices. But these are the last gasps of a dying animal. The change of direction should not be underestimated. Until March 1990, Brazil was one of the world's most closed economies. Imports represented just 5 per cent of gross domestic product and 1,500 products were banned altogether. Prices had been controlled for many years. Moreover, this state-run model was accepted throughout society. Mr Mailson da Nobrega, an economic consultant and one of many former finance ministers, says: 'In Brazil, economic nationalism was not just the product of a small elite but demanded by everyone - the military, intellectuals, politicians, business, students, workers, fascists, communists, even liberals.' And until the last decade it seemed successful. Brazil built a huge industrial base while amassing the developing world's largest foreign debt. From the 1940s to the 1980s it was one of the fastest-growing economies. Even when inflation started spiralling upwards in the mid-1980s, wages and prices were so highly indexed that the disruption experienced by its continental neighbours was not felt in Brazil. Consequently Brazil has been the last Latin American economy to face reality. It is behind its neighbours in the reform process. While Mexico, Chile, Venezuela, Argentina and Peru were putting their finances in order, liberalising and deregulating over the past decade, the Brazilian government was still spending. As a result, it now has the highest monthly inflation rate, at 21.5 per cent, and highest import tariffs in Latin America. It is in its third year year of recession. As growth started to flag, the government looked outside for a scapegoat, blaming the creditor banks and the International Monetary Fund. Mr Pedro Motta Veiga, director of the Foreign Trade Foundation, says: 'It was like eating to one's heart's content in an expensive restaurant without the money. Now we realise it means an awful lot of washing up afterwards.' The big question is whether, having introduced a market model for the economy, Mr Collor can go on to stabilise it. While his first two years were characterised by maladministration and confrontation, there are some indications that the 42-year-old former playboy has grown up. The Collor government of March 1992 has changed greatly from that of March 1990 - all but one of the original team has been replaced by older figures who are skilled at negotiating with the business, political and religious establishment. Chief among them is Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, the mild-mannered economy minister, who in 10 months has restored the government's credibility at home and abroad and is personally responsible for its recent accords with the IMF for a Dollars 2.1bn loan and the Paris Club for the rescheduling of its Dollars 21bn official debt. He has freed prices and unblocked half the Dollars 80bn in savings frozen by his predecessor, while managing to avoid the hyperinflation that characterised the Brazilian economy for years. For the first time, monthly inflation fell four percentage points last month in the absence of artificial measures, such as price controls. Above all he has, for the moment, convinced the nation that shock plans do not work and the only way to kill inflation is by tight fiscal and monetary policy, and sacrifice. There has already been some fiscal improvement. Domestic debt has been almost halved and the annual budgetary deficit (high-spending states and municipalities more than offsetting the central Treasury surplus) has been brought down from 7.3 per cent of GDP to 2.5 per cent. The country is seeing rewards for its new responsibility in terms of an increased inflow of foreign capital. Last year gross inflows doubled to Dollars 11.6bn and more than Dollars 1bn has entered the stock market since last July. In five months, foreign exchange reserves have gone from critically low levels to more than Dollars 12bn and Brazil is expecting a total of Dollars 2bn in foreign credit from the Japanese Eximbank and the World Bank following its recent accords with official creditors. The aim now is to impose a further squeeze on state company spending, bring in a new tax regime in April, and continue the privatisation programme. The government is hoping for a 10 per cent increase in exports to boost the trade surplus from last year's disappointing Dollars 10.6bn (33 per cent down on 1989). However, there are serious obstacles to the economy minister's objective of reaching monthly inflation of 2 per cent by 1993. Although this is the first time in recent years that a Brazilian government has really tried the fiscal recipe, economists believe it is relying far too heavily on monetary policy. There is a good reason for this in the form of political and constitutional hurdles which impede fiscal adjustment. The 1988 Constitution was designed to amplify the role of the state. It gives lifetime jobs to civil servants and even lays down hours for freelance photographers. So constrained, Mr Collor requires amendments to balance his books. He needs approval from a Congress where the governing bloc holds a minority of seats and where he must negotiate with 17 parties. With Congress more preoccupied by the municipal elections scheduled for October, economy ministry officials admit that the necessary changes will have to wait until next year. In the meantime the government is relying on tight monetary policy to suppress consumption - real interest rates are at 40 per cent. Industry is bearing the brunt and last month saw a record number of bankruptcies in Sao Paulo, the industrial heartland. The government's efforts to balance its budget are also in jeopardy. Falling tax receipts resulted in a 73 per cent drop in Treasury revenues last month, to their lowest level since Mr Collor took office. Mr Roberto Macedo, the economic policy secretary, admits: 'It would be crazy to continue just using monetary policy - it would damage the economy and increase the domestic debt  -but in the short term we don't have alternatives.' Suggestions for holding down inflation range from an incomes policy, price controls on basic products and indexing the economy to the dollar  - the type of heterodox solutions that have been tried before, though never alongside genuine fiscal discipline. Mr Maia complains: 'The situation is like a war with the troops entrenched. You can hold tight for a while but finally you must strike or the enemy will first. Our enemy is inflation.' Nor is it clear that Brazil, with the world's worst income distribution, can bear the social cost of a long adjustment programme. But Mr Macedo insists: 'There may be a social cost but think of the cost of non-adjustment - we have already lost a decade through procrastination.'</p>

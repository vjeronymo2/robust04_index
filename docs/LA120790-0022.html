			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIXING AN AWKWARD PROBLEM  </P> <P> There may not be any easy or quick fix to the pathetic Gilbert Lindsay  situation. It's sad, but that's how it looks.  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley opposes, with good reason, the city attorney's suggestion  that the Los Angeles City Council can appoint a temporary replacement for their  incapacitated colleague. Nice try, but no dice.  </P> <P> The 9th District certainly needs representation, but not from a temporary  caretaker who serves until Lindsay recovers or his term expires in 1993. Now  that Bradley has shot down that option, he should vigorously support an  amendment to the city Charter, which would allow the removal of council members  who are incapacitated. Council President John Ferraro and Councilwoman Joan  Milke Flores, to their credit, are working on an amendment that would prevent  this disgraceful and tragic situation from happening again. The council should  move quickly on the Ferraro and Flores proposals.  </P> <P> Lindsay was partially paralyzed by a stroke on Sept. 2 and has remained  hospitalized for more than three months. The 90-year-old councilman cannot  speak, and according to his stepson, does not recognize visitors.  </P> <P> In his current state, the veteran councilman cannot effectively represent his  district, which includes downtown and much of South-Central Los Angeles. The  Charter, however, provides no way to remove him from office before his term  ends unless his constituents mount a successful recall, a difficult and  expensive process.  </P> <P> The Charter does allow, however, the removal of a member who is out of the city  without excuse for 60 days. In an effort to remove Lindsay on those grounds,  the council stopped excusing his absences last month. Lindsay was in an  Inglewood hospital, but he has since been moved to a Los Angeles hospital.  </P> <P> After 27 years of public service, Gilbert Lindsay can no longer perform his  duties. The residents of the 9th District deserve better, and that includes a  chance to vote on their next council representative as soon as possible.  Unfortunately, that can't happen until voters approve a Charter amendment.  That's the way city government sometimes works. Poorly.  </P></p>

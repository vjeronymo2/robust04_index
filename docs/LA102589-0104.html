			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. SENDS 12 EXPERTS TO AID QUAKE WORKERS IN THE BAY AREA  </P> <P> Orange County by late Tuesday had dispatched a team of 12 experts, including  structural and civil engineers, building inspectors and a geologist, to help  assess the earthquake damage in the Bay Area, which may result in a temporary  slowdown of building inspections in the county, officials said.  </P> <P> The team, which included 11 county employees and a former county employee who  volunteered his services, is needed in San Francisco for critical tasks ranging  from determining whether homes are safe to occupy to determining any lingering  hazards on bridges and roadways, Orange County officials said.  </P> <P> Ronald J. Novello, director of regulations for the county's Environmental  Management Agency, said the team represents about a fifth of his engineering  staff and about 10% of his building inspection staff. The employees' absence,  he said, will slow down the processing of building plans from private  developers.  </P> <P> "This will affect production by about 10% to 20% and may cause us to slip  (behind) on our schedule two or three days," Novello said.  </P> <P> It was not known how long the team would be needed in Northern California, but  the county will be reimbursed by the state for the salary and expenses of those  employees sent to the disaster area, officials said.  </P> <P> Emergency management officials worked around the clock Monday and Tuesday to  round up engineers from both the public and private sector. But they revised  earlier estimates that another 80 engineers would be sent to the Bay Area on  Thursday, saying they have yet to get a formal request for more help.  </P> <P> As for the shortage of building inspectors and engineers in Orange County, John  W. Sibley of the county administrative office said: "Essentially we'll just  double up here with the (staff) that's left, which is not atypical of an  emergency response. . . . I can assure you our workload will be covered, but  our first concern is the emergency."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus by </F> Oldrich Zabojnik in Bratislava; date not given: "R. Filkus: We  Are Not Contemplating the Third Way"]    [Text] There are many officials in the Moravcik government  who are not very well known, even to the Slovak public. This  does not apply to the finance minister of the Slovak Republic,  renowned Slovak macroeconomist Rudolf Filkus, who granted the  following interview to the HOSPODARSKE NOVINY Bratislava  correspondent:    [Zabojnik] What are the principal objectives for your work  in the ministerial post?    [Filkus] We must prove our efforts aimed not only at  macroeconomic stability but also at microeconomic stability. We  want to continue in the steps already made and never again  contemplate some third way to the market. We have already  passed through trade and price liberalization, the internal  convertibility of the currency, privatization, and the  restrictive macreconomic budgetary and monetary policies.  Because of the conditions that emerge here, we will continue on  this path.    [Zabojnik] Can you be specific about the monetary policy,  for instance?    [Filkus] The finance minister should not speak about what  the monetary policy should be like. That is the business of the  National Bank of the Slovak Republic [NBS], and no one should  interfere. The NBS is here to choose the steps according to its  criteria, foreign currency reserves, inflation, or the deficit  budget. Of course, mutual consultations and joint  considerations of future steps are possible, but only insofar as  I, as the minister, must help to seek such solutions, given the  deficit budget, that would not accelerate inflation. I am  thinking of the combination of banking, monetary, and economic  tools.    [Zabojnik] Which sector of the Slovak economy do you see as  the most troubled?    [Filkus] At present, the economic microsphere is the most  risky one because it lives not off its results but off the  principal. This is directly connected to insolvency, and  especially to privatization, not only from the point of view of  its acceleration, but also from its depolitization. This  important tool of the transformation process has become here a  tool of concentration of political power.    [Zabojnik] You were not enthusiastic about this year's  Slovak budget when you were in the opposition. What specific  outlet for these opinions will you use now as the minister, at  the time you are contemplating an amendment to the Law on the  State Budget? I would be interested most of all in how you want  to deal with the expenditure side of it.    [Filkus] Many of our predecessors proceeded in such a way  that, if they wanted to balance the budget, they were little by  little cutting expenditures. The minister and the ministry must  also be very interested in the revenue channels rather than in  just keeping on cutting expenditures. Hence, I must also be  interested in taxes and customs, where there are tremendous  reserves in scrutiny.    [Zabojnik] Thus, you indirectly agree with your predecessor,  who said that, when the coffers are empty, you can whistle for  it?    [Filkus] O.K., but we have several handicapped sectors, like  education, health care, and culture, where we cannot effort to  reduce expenditures.    [Zabojnik] Given the objective possibilities of Slovakia,  can this government proceed in relations with the Czech Republic  any differently from the way Meciar did?    [Filkus] First of all, we must reach such an agreement that  the results would be in the best interest of both parties. This  applies to the certificates, customs union, and clearing  accounts. We have to accommodate each other. In the customs  union, for instance, the point of departure must be advantageous  for the two sides, but one must also note the disadvantages for  either party. Regarding the certificates, we made an  accommodating step that will facilitate the continuing validity  of the treaty on the mutual recognition of Czech and Slovak  documents, and a situation such as there was before will not  arise at the border. We have also unanimously agreed that the  old lot of the clearing account [obligations originated before  the currency division on 8 February 1993] must be abolished, but  this also depends on parliament.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku, 19 May (TURAN)--The session of Azerbaijan's  Democratic Congress completed last evening. The agenda included  only one question -- return of Russian troops to Azerbaijan.    The participants of the session unanimously adopted the  resolution which condemns the activities of the current  leadership of the republic aimed at "return of Russian troops to  the country". The resolution reads that "if Russian troops be  brought to Azerbaijan, the Democratic Congress reserves right to  conduct rallies of protest."    The Democratic Congress was founded on 23 March 1994. It  includes five opposition parties: Musavat, the Popular Front,  the Democratic Party, the Party of Nation's Liberty, and Ana  Torpag Party.</p>

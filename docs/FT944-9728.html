			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of Greece (9): Following the Greek pattern / Profile of Citibank Kallithea, a noisy middle-class Athenian district of apartment blocks and small businesses, is the site of what Citibank executives call their banking laboratory. Citibank's Kallithea branch, one of 18 around the Greek capital, is the model for developing the US bank's consumer operations worldwide. Its know-how is now being transferred to Hungary, where Citibank will become the first international bank to enter the retail market. Avul Vohra, general manager for consumer banking in Hungary, says: 'We expect to follow the pattern of Greece, because of some basic similarities in the market. Like Greece, Hungary is a cash society with a large number of small businesses.' Citibank's first consumer branch in Hungary will open next spring in Budapest, where the bank already has a sizeable corporate presence. The consumer network is expected to grow to five branches within three years. The bank's new Hungarian staff have had training in Greece using systems developed in Athens for the local market. The Hungarian network will also be supervised from Greece and linked with Citibank's technology platform for Europe, based in Germany. Mr Vohra says: 'We're introducing 1995 technology for customers right away and combining it with local needs.' Citibank intends to offer its Hungarian customers a savings and checking account, to be followed by credit cards and investment products, also on the Greek model. The Kallithea branch has pioneered new electronic services such as 24-hour telephone banking and paperless deposits and withdrawals, which will be available in Budapest. 'As one of the bank's most successful operations abroad, Greece was a suitable place for experimenting. We had lots of resources and a very committed staff,' says Sophie Palimeri, business manager for consumer banking. Citibank has the largest operation of any foreign bank in Greece, with assets of Dr540bn and extensive shipping finance and investment banking activities. In Kallithea, where the branch caters to small depositors and local businesses, the number of accounts has increased by 20 per cent since the new services were launched. Traffic through the branch has also increased by 20 per cent since it was redesigned to eliminate queues by providing a 'greeting' service to customers and making account officers more accessible. Circe Psychogiou, branch manager, says: 'The day we re-opened after the changeover, the customers looked quite bemused. But it changed the quality of the relationships: everyone's much more polite.'</p>

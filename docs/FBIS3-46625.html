			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Core" column by editorial staff member Tadahiko Nasa and </F> political department reporter Uichiro Oshima: "`Butrus-Ghali's  Diplomacy Toward Japan' Has Changed"; first paragraph is  newspaper introduction]    [Text] After finishing a five-day visit to Japan, UN  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali headed toward Korea on 22  December. It was his second visit to Japan following his visit  last February. Compared to his first visit, which gave an  impression that "the UN secretary general is a hard-liner," his  remarks during his recent visit on such issues as Japan's  Self-Defense Forces' [SDF] participation in UN peacekeeping  operations (PKO) were extremely moderate. In his talks with  Japanese leaders, he expressed his strong hope that in the near  future Japan will play a nonmilitary role as a permanent member  of the UN Security Council [UNSC]. The following is a report on  the purpose of the visit by UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali,  whose position on Japan has softened.  <H5>  Stand of "Paying Attention to Japan" </H5>   Although it is unusual for the UN secretary general to visit  Japan twice in one year, there was a reason.    In Egypt, UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's homeland,  there  is a prominent poet named "Hafez Ibrahim" [as published], who  wrote a poem called "The Mikado" [Emperor] which praises Japan's  victory in its war with Russia as a model for the Third World.    This poem is very famous in Egypt and is even in a textbook.  UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, who is 71 years old now,  said he also learned from this poem in his younger days and then  deepened his understanding of Japan. The fact that his  itinerary for both the first and second visits specially  included a visit to the Togo Shrine in Harajuku, Tokyo, reflects  his interest in Japan.    In a 22 December news conference at the National Press Club,  the secretary general said "Japan's winning a permanent seat on  the UNSC will lead to strengthening the United Nations," showing  his stand of attaching importance to Japan. It can be said that  underlying such remarks is his understanding of Japan, which he  fostered in his younger days.    Meanwhile, however, we felt that the secretary general, who  is regarded as "an experienced politician" (from a Foreign  Ministry source), made such remarks in consideration of the  Hosokawa government, which is regarded as being "fragile." In  preparation for his visit to Japan, the secretary general  reportedly gathered detailed information from Yoshio Hatano, the  ambassador accredited to the United Nations, on the ruling  coalition's internal situation, Prime Minister Hosokawa's  political position, and other problems facing Japan.    In separate talks with Prime Minister Hosokawa, Foreign  Minister Hata, and leaders of the ruling and opposition parties,  UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali stressed that "there seems to  be a misunderstanding in Japan that the dispatch of military  members to the UN PKO is the precondition for Japan's winning a  UNSC permanent membership." He also said: "Of UN activities,  the PKO accounts for about 30 percent and the remaining 70  percent is for environmental protection, economic development,  and the other activities." In this way, in an attempt to help  promote the people's interest in gaining a UNSC permanent  membership, he emphasized Japan's greater contributions to  nonmilitary affairs.  <H5>  "Bitter Experience" in February </H5>   Behind the UN secretary general's strong desire for a  Japanese visit in December is his bitter experience during his  last visit in February. Before he visited in February, he had  said in an interview in New York that "Japan should take part in  the UN peace enforcement troops, even by revising its  Constitution." This remark shocked Japanese Government  officials including (then) Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.    Shocked at his remark, Yohei Kono, the then chief cabinet  secretary (currently the president of the Liberal Democratic  Party], in his meeting with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali,  affirmed that, "Japan has no intention of becoming a UNSC  permanent member." (Then) Prime Minister Miyazawa also showed  cautious views on Butrus-Ghali's remarks on the plea of "Japan's  Constitution" and "the people's feelings."  <H5>  Issues Facing the United Nations </H5>   There are other reasons for UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali's taking a favorable position on Japan. One is  that he, in his two-year service so far, has come to realize how  Japan holds an important position in the United Nations.    Although Japan's current assessed contribution to the United  Nations is 12.45 percent, it seems it may be raised to about 13  percent starting in 1995. In addition, Japan, in line with  Prime Minister Hosokawa's attendance at the September UN General  Assembly session, generously contributed approximately $100  million to PKO activities. For the United Nations, which is  facing financial difficulties, Japan is an important sponsor.  Therefore, it is natural for the secretary general to consider  it expedient to win Japan over to his side.    Another reason is that because of a PKO success in Cambodia,  the secretary general himself has started considering that a  traditional PKO method is more realistic than a forcible method  under the "peace enforcement troops," which he proposed in July  1992. Under the traditional PKO, there would be room for Japan  to make human resources contributions.    As far as Japan's PKO is concerned, what is drawing UN  attention is how Japan will deal with the issue concerning  former Yugoslavia. The Japanese Government has announced its  plan to send fact-finding missions there early next January.  After the completion of the fact-finding survey, attention will  then be focused on whether Japan will make personnel  contributions in addition to its financial cooperation.    On the issue of personnel contributions, Mr. Yasushi Akashi,  chief of the UN peacekeeping forces [PKF] in former Yugoslavia,  has recently expressed the hope that Japan will take part in  rear-echelon support troops. Although the connection between  his remarks and Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's position is not  clear, the government is negative about sending SDF troops to  former Yugoslavia at present.    The Defense Agency [DA] was nervous about UN Secretary  General Butrus-Ghali's Japanese visit because it feared that  "Butrus-Ghali might ask the government to send the SDF to former  Yugoslavia."    Underlying the DA's anxiety is the fact that just before  Butrus-Ghali's visit, Yasushi Akashi, who is to head the UN PKF  in the former Yugoslavia, indicated his view that it is possible  for Japan to join the PKF under the current PKO cooperation law  if Japan's activity is limited to rear-echelon support.    In response, DA Director General Kazuo Aichi met with Prime  Minister Hosokawa and indicated the DA's cautious view on  Akashi's proposal; and senior DA officials, including Shigeru  Hatayama, DA administrative vice minister, also indicated a  cautious attitude in an effort to check General Secretary  Butrus-Ghali's move. A voice within the DA has been expressed  that what made Butrus-Ghali refrain from referring to this issue  is "the DA's defensive move" (according to a senior DA  official), thus reflecting DA officials' relief.    The reason the DA is cautious about sending the SDF to  former  Yugoslavia is that its dispatch would be criticized for running  counter to the PKO cooperation law that stipulates that "a  cease-fire agreement should be reached between conflicting  parties" before the dispatch of Japanese troops.    Since a cease-fire accord has often been scrapped in former  Yugoslavia, the DA points out that the case in former Yugoslavia  is different from that in Cambodia, wherein the DA says "the  cease-fire accord was kept although there were sporadic  conflicts." In this way, the DA stresses that "it is not a  matter of a type of PKO activities there but of the PKO law."    With regard to Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's remarks,  there is a voice within the DA that "Butrus-Ghali now fully  understands Japan's difficult position on the PKO." Meanwhile,  among senior officials, another view has also been expressed:  "Secretary General Butrus-Ghali must have given priority to  Japan's contribution in such areas as financial affairs other  than PKO activities."</p>

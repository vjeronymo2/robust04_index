			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENTREPRENEUR KOONS  </P> <P> The toxic waste that Jeff Koons' "work" represents is not merely a symptom of  the troubled art world but also a cause.  </P> <P> Acknowledging him as an "artist," however ambiguously, with your Jan. 22  article, "The Art World Is Ripe for Me," has aided his marketing and  manipulation. Because he is such a media monger, the only antidote against the  Koons disease is suppression of all his media coverage.  </P> <P> KAREN SHEN  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> IT'S ANCHORS AWEIGH FROM L.A. TO THE GULF WITH CARGO FOR MARINES;  </P> <P> MIDDLE EAST: THE CAPE BORDA AND FOUR OTHER VESSELS WILL CARRY MILITARY  EQUIPMENT TO BE USED BY 1ST MARINE BRIGADE IN SAUDI ARABIA.  </P> <P> The first of five huge cargo vessels slated to carry tons of military equipment  from the Port of Los Angeles to the Persian Gulf is being loaded and will sail  within days, military officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> The 515-foot Cape Borda is capable of carrying up to 20 million pounds of  supplies and heavy equipment including tanks, personnel carriers and  155-millimeter howitzers. The so-called break-bulk ship is designed so that  cargo can be lifted to and from its deck with giant on-board cranes.  </P> <P> Specifically, the Oakland-based vessel and four others not yet in the port will  carry enough cargo to support the deployment of the 1st Marine Expeditionary  Brigade to Saudi Arabia. The 15,000-Marine brigade from Kaneohe, Hawaii, is  scheduled to leave within a week, joining two Marine brigades already in Saudi  Arabia, military officials said.  </P> <P> When all five vessels arrive in the Middle East, they will carry enough  military equipment to sustain the 1st Brigade for 30 days of combat, officials  added.  </P> <P> Three weeks ago, the merchant vessels Cape Ducato and Meteor were the first  cargo ships to leave the harbor for the Persian Gulf as part of the Navy's  Military Sealift Command. But those ships left the port without cargo, heading  first for Beaumont, Tex., one of the nation's busiest military seaports since  the Middle East crisis began. The Cape Ducato picked up military supplies there  and is steaming to the Persian Gulf. The Meteor is en route to Beaumont.  </P> <P> Like the Meteor and Cape Ducato, the Cape Borda is part of the U.S. Maritime  Administration's Ready Reserve Force of ships available to the Navy on as  little as five days' notice. The Cape Borda, built in 1967 in Avondale, La.,  has been part of the reserve force -- operated by the Maritime Administration  -- for five years.  </P> <P> The deployment of Cape Ducato and four other cargo ships chartered from private  companies has been planned for some time as part of the Military Sealift  Command's role in the Middle East operation known as Desert Shield, military  officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> "This is just part of the natural progression of deployment for the operation,"  said Marge Holtz, director of public information for the command. Holtz  declined to say when the Cape Borda would depart the harbor. Likewise, she  refused to name the other four ships that are scheduled within days to arrive  in the port to pick up cargo.  </P> <P> She did, however, say the other vessels slated to pick up military cargo in the  harbor will not be part of the ready reserve force. Instead, she said, the  vessels will be chartered from private companies for the military operation.  </P> <P> Pentagon spokesman Marine Lt. Col. Stuart Wagner said the deployment of the  cargo vessels has been long anticipated and was vital to supply the 1st Brigade  as soon as possible after its arrival in Saudi Arabia.  </P></p>

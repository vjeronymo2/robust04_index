			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE '80S A SPECIAL REPORT;  </P> <P> THE TASTE MAKERS;  </P> <P> PRESENTING THE BIG PLAYERS AND MAJOR IDEAS THAT -- FOR BETTER OR WORSE --  SHAPED THE 1980S. THIS IS CALENDAR'S FIFTH ANNUAL TASTE MAKERS REPORT, EXPANDED  THIS TIME TO COVER THE LAST 10 YEARS IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: SHOW BUSINESS  EXECS, FILM PRODUCERS, FILM DIRECTORS AND WRITERS, STAGE, TV, MUSIC, DANCE, POP  MUSIC, JAZZ, COMEDY, RADIO, ART AND RESTAURANTS.;  </P> <P> DANCE;  </P> <P> GREGORY HINES  </P> <P> As his star rose in the '80s, this consistently innovative and remarkably  humane actor-dancer (now 43) became a symbol of the Tap Revival, one of the  decade's happiest cultural reclamation projects. Hines' style of tap, however,  was disarmingly earthy, streetwise, personal and distinctly of the moment --  without the painted smiles, oily audience courting and facile virtuosity that  had placed tap specialists on the Endangered Species list.  </P> <P> Indeed, in the audition scene of "Tap" (the movie), Hines made a federal case  out of not smiling, just as in the jailhouse solo early in the film -- and the  climactic "murder" solo in "The Cotton Club" -- he unleashed a brooding,  improvisational, ultimately cathartic style.  </P> <P> Yes, he could look almost conventionally elegant and nonchalant when required:  in the Broadway revue "Sophisticated Ladies," early in the decade, for  instance, or in a supersuave duet with Tommy Tune on a PBS "Dance in America"  episode just this year. But those achievements were in homage to the past while  his rebellious, rock-era approach to tap in the movie "White Nights" arguably  reached out to a whole new audience.  </P> <P> He had two daring solos -- one emotionally explosive, the other spatially  extravagant -- that gave his character a dimension missing in the screenplay  and confirmed that he had become one of the great dancers of our time.  </P> <P> The Taste Makers project was edited by David Fox, assistant Sunday Calendar  editor.

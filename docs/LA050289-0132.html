			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EX-NORTHROP ENGINEER FROM YORBA LINDA PLEADS GUILTY IN JUMP JET CONSPIRACY CASE  </P> <P> A former Northrop Corp. engineer from Yorba Linda pleaded guilty Monday to  participating in a defense fraud conspiracy and admitted that he helped fake  test results on key stabilization systems for the Navy's AV-8 Harrier jump jet.  </P> <P> Howard Hyde, 48, who was a senior engineer in an arm of Northrop's Precision  Products Division in the San Gabriel Valley, acknowledged in federal court that  he helped falsify vibration test results for 189 rate sensor assemblies that  Northrop made for the Harrier fighter-bombers, which were built by  McDonnell-Douglas Corp.  </P> <P> The government paid $1.6 million for the rate sensor assemblies to stabilize  the jet, which can take off and land vertically like a helicopter.  </P> <P> Hyde, who pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United  States and two counts of making false statements to the government, faces up to  15 years in prison and a $750,000 fine when he is sentenced by U.S. District  Judge Pamela Rymer on Aug. 21.  </P> <P> Hyde was one of five current or former Northrop workers named in a 167-count  indictment handed down last month by a federal grand jury.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Marshall Schulman said after the hearing that Hyde pleaded  guilty because the government has "overwhelming evidence" against him.  </P> <P> "He is very contrite and feels bad about the whole situation and is accepting  his responsibility," Schulman said.  </P> <P> Hyde worked at the Western Services Department until August, 1987. The  department, located in El Monte and later in Pomona, was closed in late 1987  after reports about the faked tests became public.  </P></p>

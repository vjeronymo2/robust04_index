			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUST SAY RELAX  </P> <P> So you're 11 years old and your dog ate your homework, your bike had a flat and  you're having a crummy day in the classroom. It isn't easy being a child in the  stressful '90s.  </P> <P> Relax.  </P> <P> That's the advice of teacher Betty Mehling at Lupin Hill Elementary School in  the Las Virgenes School District. More than advice, it's part of the lesson  plan. For Mehling, relaxin' is the fourth R.  </P> <P> "Teaching children to relax is giving them the answer of how to deal with  stress and tension," says Mehling. "Today's young are bombarded with the  negative -- say no to drugs, drinking, smoking and sex."  </P> <P> Mehling, who has instructed children in the art of relaxation for 10 years,  teaches exercises that build and then release tension, enabling her students to  feel their muscles relax and their stress disappear.  </P> <P> There's no extra credit for snoring.  </P></p>

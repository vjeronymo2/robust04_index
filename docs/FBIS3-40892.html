			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant Colonel Luong Xuan Ba: "Organizing </F> Militia, Self-Defense Forces Under Conditions of Multisectoral  Economy"]    [Text] As we know, production is always linked with market  and has its own laws. National defense as a field of activity  and organizing and building the armed forces also have their own  laws. These laws are (relatively) independent from one another,  but they are closely interrelated--production always being  closely linked with protection of the production of different  installations and localities, as well as of the country as a  whole. "Building the country is closely linked with defending  the country" and "building socialism must be closely linked with  protecting socialism." These are the necessary laws.    The militia and self-defense forces (MSF) are the armed  forces of the masses and are closely linked with production,  social life, and political movement at the basic level. At  present, the new production mechanism directly and regularly  acts on the MSF in many ways:    -- The laws on value, competition, and regulation of  production act on them.    During the time when state subsidies still existed, Military  Region 5, like other localities, had organized its MSF mainly on  the basis of the collective state-operated production. The  implementation of Resolution 10 of the Political Bureau in  agriculture and Decree 217 of the Council of Ministers calling  for abolishing state subsidies, granting autonomy to production  installations, practicing profit-and-loss accounting, and  working with an adjusted market mechanism had created a fierce  challenge for two-thirds of state enterprises, namely, 90-95  percent of enterprises at district and city levels being forced  to dissolve, the scope and authorities of agricultural  cooperatives being reduced, and production units no longer  exerting any influence. From 90 to 95 percent of fishery  cooperatives had gone bankrupt and had been dissolved.    Private production, in the meantime, had been developing in  many forms: Private enterprises put their capital together  through the sales of shares; joint enterprises, through  cooperation with the outside world, attracted most of the work  force.    The common tendency in production organization today is to  lighten the administrative management machinery and to reduce  the number of nonproductive intermediary layers. In  state-operated enterprises, contracts are signed with shops,  shifts, and groups, and on the basis of various means of  production. In agriculture, contracts are signed on the basis of  unit prices and with individual workers, with households being  considered autonomous economic units in production.    The common form is to organize appropriately small and  flexible enterprises in accordance with the market mechanism,  with the fact that workers have no job security due to their  contractual status, and so on. This is a great difficulty in the  organization and management of the MSF.    Many illogical aspects and irreparable discrepancies between  the interests and obligation of citizens and production units  have appeared in the system of procedures and policies  applicable to the MSF and reserve troops that was adopted to  guarantee their training and activities. There are policies and  regulations that are no longer effectively usable. Sectors and  echelons, both central and local, and production installations,  production units, and citizens have not yet properly resolved  the relationships between the two strategic tasks of the party.    The situation still exists in which to do economic work and  to develop production fails to be closely linked with the  national defense and security task; in many localities,  production installations have neglected their national defense  and military task, which occupies no place in their activities.    This is one of the reasons that directly create great  difficulties for the efforts to organize and build the MSF,  particularly in the case of the state-bloc self-defense force.  It is due to this problem that, in many developed production  installations, workers earn high incomes but have no budget to  cover expenses for training and other activities. In the last  two years, in Military Region 5, training and other activities  took place each year at only 10-15 percent of its production  installations. MSF organization existed in name only or in some  localities, was reduced to a minimum level, that is, in each  village (subward), local production installations had only five  to 10 people forming their professional protection force.    This is a situation that conforms wrongly to the  characteristics, function, and task of the MSF.    As we face the above-mentioned situation, do we organize the  MSF in the various economic sectors? What are the policies that  guarantee them? And so on. In our opinion, this is a difficult  and rather complicated problem, but first of all we must assert  the following: Since production is multisectoral, the  organization of the MSF cannot limit itself within just a few of  the economic sectors. This is an objective necessity and also a  part of the renovation in connection with the organization and  building of the MSF in the new situation. This originates  from the line on renovation as it is recommended in the  resolutions of the sixth and seventh party congresses for the  period of transition to socialism and for continuing to build  the multisectoral commodity economy, with socialist regulation  and preset direction. At the same time, this is an urgent need  in connection with the protection of production and the fight  against the enemy's strategy of peace development, rioting and  overthrow, and destruction that each and every locality and  production installation is required to satisfy.    If we invest in production without investing in protection  of  production, our efforts and assets will soon vanish. Or if we  avoid the task, adopt a wait-and-see attitude, and rely on  others to provide us with protection, we will be acting against  the instinct for self-preservation and the view of our party and  nation on independence, self-rule, and self-sufficiency.    To build the MSF in the various economic sectors also is  based on the view on the people being considered the roots, on  the nation's traditions, and on the real needs of production  today.    In the war of resistance against the French, we were  building  our forces by going from zero and from small to large scale. The  armed forces that had come from the people had shown  revolutionary understanding, hatred for the enemy, and the  voluntary desire to hold arms to fight the enemy and to wage a  great people's war to score victory. At that time we had not  yet organized any state-operated and collective production.    In the course of changing our direction and reorganizing our  forces, we need to thoroughly understand these needs:    -- Organizing the MSF must conform to the party leadership  system; ensure all aspects of direct leadership by the party  committee echelons and chapters in production installations;  remain closely linked with administrative units; and reorganize  production units, shifts, sectors, and occupations in all  economic sectors so as to facilitate activities and management.    -- On what scale to organize the MSF depends on how advanced  our management and command capabilities are and our efforts to  avoid being formal and imposing our will.    -- On the basis of the task to remain combat-ready, to  fight,  and to maintain political security, let us fight the enemy's  strategy of peace development, rioting, and overthrow in  different regions and develop our ability to ensure such a task  so as to have the right scale for organizing appropriate forces.    By adopting the three above-mentioned needs as the point of  departure, Military Region 5 has been organizing its forces in  all areas and in economic sectors as follows:    1. For Rural Areas and Streets    To organize the MSF on the basis of such administrative  units  as hamlets, villages, wards, and population centers and to  consider them the basic MSF units, being linked with the party  chapter (or party cell) leadership, with the hamlet system of  administration, and with association chapters of political  organizations in production installations. To set up hamlet  military unit commands to replace the former local platoon and  company commands. In 1991, throughout Military Region 5 more  than 3,600 hamlet military unit cadres were organized.    Some favorable aspects of the organization of hamlet  military  unit commands include the fact that they are closely linked with  procedural operations at a level lower than that of production  installations, thus being closer to the masses and to the MSF  themselves. As these military commands are based on territorial  division, their authorities are greater than those of platoon  and company commands; they serve both as the staffs for party  committee echelons and the administration and as the local MSF  commanders and managers, and in addition, they also manage the  reserve forces and fulfill other military functions in the  localities. The scale for organizing the local forces is as  follows: to organize them from squads and several squads,  instead of organizing companies and platoons.    2. Organizing MSF on the Sea    The MSF on the sea are organized around the state-operated  and collective sectors as their hard core; at the same time,  they are organized in the private economic sector, provided  favorable conditions prevail there and the work is done in  steady steps. As an immediate task, let us consolidate anew the  state-operated enterprises and collective production units. As  for the private economic sector, it is necessary to select those  people who satisfy the following requirements:    -- They must be people with permanent household registration  in the localities and with permits to work on the sea.    -- Their employment is stable; first of all, the people  being  selected are those who work on boats and junks and who are both  workers and partners having contributed their shares of  capital.[.sup]1[/]    -- Politically speaking, they are reliable people.    As an immediate task, let us select the boats and junks  having 100 percent of laborers considered politically qualified,  or at least 50 percent of the crews, including their captains  and stokers, being politically qualified, to organize the force.    Formula and scale of organization: They must be crews of the  same boats and junks, be in the same fishing units, have the  same occupation, fish in the same fishing grounds, share the  same fishing lanes (open-sea fishing, inshore fishing, and  onshore fishing), and be in the same administrative units in  order to make sure that they are organized on the right scale  and in the right form.    The above-mentioned "same" requirements are aimed at  achieving the goal of making things more convenient for  management, command, daily activities, training, and combat  action.    As we carried out the above-mentioned guidelines in our  military region, in the last two years there were changes in the  MSF operating on the sea, namely, after the period of 1990-1991,  the private economic sector accounted for 68.5 percent of the  MSF and the state-operated and collective enterprises accounted  for only 31.5 percent of the MSF, as compared to the  cooperatives accounting for 80 percent and the state-operated  enterprises, 20 percent, as in the past.    3. Organizing Self-Defense Forces in Private and  Jointly Operated Foreign Enterprises    -- Self-defense forces are organized only in localities  where  party organizations exist. In localities where there are no  party organizations, self-defense forces are organized where  there are private enterprises. These forces are placed under the  leadership of the party committee echelons in the local  administration and receive direct military command from the  areas, villages, and subwards concerned.    -- Organizing self-defense forces in jointly operated and  jointly associated enterprises: Only Vietnamese workers with  permanent household registration in the localities are to be  selected, as mentioned in Article 23 of the MSF Statutes.    4. Organizing Self-Defense Forces in Organs,  Enterprises, Work Sites, State Farms, and State Forests    First we need to organize the MSF among official workers and  workers with long-term contracts. We must to rely on fixed work  units like shifts, shops, and production units to organize  appropriate forces in terms of their scale and form. We  organize these forces only where we have enough squads. The  largest scale is company and multicompany; there must be limits  and it is unnecessary to organize battalions.    To ensure participation of the MSF in training and regular  activities, all echelons must loosen procedures and policies and  ensure fairness and rationality in terms of interests and  obligation, in accordance with today's market mechanism.  Financing comes from these sources:    -- Money taken from the spending and budget of the  localities  and production installations--including provincial, district  (city), village (subward), and production installation levels.    -- The people's contributions in the form of fixed amounts  set for each production and farming unit; production  installations being encouraged to set up MSF support funds, on  the basis of the motto, "the people discuss, the people appoint,  the people support," and the people control and supervise.    -- Money earned by the MSF from land and forests being  assigned to them for doing productive work and providing  services.    -- Shares of bonuses earned as the result of good  activities.    Of the four above-mentioned sources the one that results  from  security activities aimed at protecting the lives and properties  of the people and collectives and maintaining political security  in production installations is the most effective source, which  must be used to promote other sources.    To organize and manage the MSF under the conditions of the  multisectoral production of commodities and to act in accordance  with the present market mechanism is a new multifaceted  ever-changing complicated issue that requires military workers  in production installations and people having to deal with these  installations to change the ways they think and do things in  order to seek the right formula for organizing MSF management.  To revise the procedures and policies having to do with the MSF  in order to keep pace with the present mechanism is a task of  realistic significance that will help to fight and defeat the  enemy's peace development strategy in production installations.  Footnote    1. In Military Region 5 there are three forms of being  capital-contributing partners: a) Families invest capital in  buying the means of fishing and do the work themselves, or hire  a few laborers. b) Many household families contribute to the  capital used to buy the means, or to bid successfully for the  means put on sale by a cooperative at the time of its  dissolution. c) Owners buy the means and hire laborers to do the  work. Of the three forms, the first and second ones involve  stable labor.</p>

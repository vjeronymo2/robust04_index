			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 14 May (PL) -- Cuba and Colombia will sign  here on Tuesday an agreement that will permit the establishment  of regular airline flights to link the capitals of the two  countries.    A Cuban civil aviation source confirmed to PRENSA LATINA  today that the signing of the document will conclude the current  negotiations under way between the Colombian Aeronautics  Directorate and the Cuban Civil Aeronautics Institute (IACC)  aimed at achieving the objective noted above.    Fernando Zarama heads the Colombian delegation that will  hold  meetings with the IACC representatives on Monday in order to  give the final touches to the agreement.    Currently Cubana de Aviacion and Medellin Aeronautics  Association (SAM) charter flights are made periodically between  the two Latin American nations and contribute, among other  things, to developing bilateral tourist trade, especially from  Santa Fe de Bogota to Havana and Varadero.    The agreement, which should conclude with the signing of the  treaty this coming week, seeks to determine the frequency and  characteristics of the regular flights, which will further  increase permanent air transit between the two countries.    In addition to SAM, the Venezuelan VIASA and Chilean LADECO  companies have flights between Cuba and Colombia.    The agreement that is about to be signed further strengthens  Cuban-Colombian relations, which showed a great improvement  early this year.    The Colombian Naval Training Ship ARC GLORIA is scheduled to  arrive this coming week in Havana on a goodwill visit and as  part of the training that Colombian midshipmen receive.    Colombian Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos is also  expected to visit Cuba to sign the expansion of the current  partial agreement, which will expand bilateral commercial  activities.    A delegation of Colombian businessmen, who are interested in  investing in Cuba, are also expected soon in Havana, Colombian  Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin has announced.</p>

The spokesman said scientific U.S. and European circles  emphasize that the mysterious disease that U.S. and British  servicemen caught in the Gulf war could be traced to the  intensive use by American forces of uranium-coated projectiles  mounted on tanks and antitank aircraft.    An official spokesman for the Kuwaiti Ministry of Health  recently admitted nuclear radiation was detected in tank and  truck chassis north of Kuwait City, the Iraqi spokesman noted.  This is in addition to reports published by U.S. circles, like  the Nevada-based RURAL ALLIANCE [name as received] about  attempts by the U.S. Department of Defense to suppress the side  effects of these substances on the crews manning U.S. tanks and  aircraft to avert insubordination.    The Iraqi spokesman's statements are in reaction to an  allegation made by Senator Donald Riegle before the Senate  yesterday that, in the late '80's, a U.S. firm sold Iraq the  biological substances that it might have used in the war.    The U.S. senator's contentions are yet another silly and  pointless attempted whitewash to deflect attention and influence  the course of investigations. The senator, the spokesman added,  might have sought to bring the real explanations to light and  used his legal powers to bear instead of lying to Congress and  the U.S. public.</p>

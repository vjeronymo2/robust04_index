			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: CI returns to black with Pounds 0.34m midway CI Group, the Wolverhampton-based engineer, returned to profit during the 1994 first half as trading performance improved after taking losses in the second half of the previous year. Pre-tax profits for the six months to July 31 were Pounds 337,000 against Pounds 905,000 in the 1993 first half and a loss for the year to January 31 1994 of Pounds 1.53m. 'We are showing an improvement which we believe will be on-going,' said Mr Rob Yates, the chief executive. In the second half of last year, CI suffered difficult trading and charged the costs of a redundancy programme and the disposal of a lossmaking French company. Turnover was Pounds 35.9m, against Pounds 35.3m, including Pounds 3.13m from discontinued activities, resulting in a 12 per cent increase in continuing operations. Earnings per share were 0.26p (0.69p) against losses of 1.54p for the whole of the previous year. The interim dividend is being halved at 0.2p. The company said that all but one of its businesses enjoyed better trading than in the previous half year. Those supplying the construction industry improved largely through cost-cutting, while the re-rolling, foundry and reinforcement businesses, although trading better than at any time in 1993, faced raw material price increases.</p>

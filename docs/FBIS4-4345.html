			<p>BFN     [Text] Here is a continued report on the Pailin  battlefield from 26, 27, 28, and 29 March:    I. On 26 March, the people and National Army of Democratic  Kampuchea [NADK] further attacked the invading forces. Some  continued to cut the enemies' throats: 1. from Suosdei to  Pailin; 2. from Suosdei to Krek; 3. from Phnum Kon Damrei to  Sala Krau; and 4. completely cutting off the invading forces'  transport lines from Kamping Puoy and Kap Chen and along the  Mongkolborei River. Others were split into groups to attack the  invading forces in many areas -- they especially attacked the  forces moving along the roads, including tanks and ground  troops, causing them to sustain constant damage.    In sum, the situation on 26 March was that the people and  NADK initiated attacks on the invading forces by cutting their  throats, smashing their ground forces to pieces, and attacking  their tanks one after another, causing them to lose control  gradually in the perimeters or traps of Sala Krau and Pailin.    II. On 27 and 28 March, the people and NADK continued to  attack the invading forces. Some continued to cut off the  forces' narrow transport lines, in particular the routes linking  Suosdei and Pailin, Suosdei and Treng, and Phnum Kon Damrei and  Sala Krau. As for other roads, they were completely cut off,  causing the invading forces to lose control. Those in Sala Krau  and Pailin were surrounded by the people and NADK from all  directions. In this situation, the people and NADK attacked the  invading forces in many areas, including those in Pailin, Sala  Krau, and along the inner roads. We attacked both the ground  troops and tanks.    On 27 and 28 March, the salient situation was that the  invading forces began to lose control gradually:    1. They could not supply fuel, ammunition, and foodstuffs;    2. An increasing number of them were afflicted with Malaria  and typhoid and there was no medicine for treatment;    3. Soldiers, especially new recruits, continued to break  ranks in large numbers, making the invading forces extremely  short of troops. They were not even able to occupy the tiny  town of Pailin, the size of which is one square kilometer. They  ordered hundreds of their troops in Pailin and Sala Krau to  defend the two areas, but they were not able to because they  were constantly attacked by the people and NADK.    In sum, on 27 and 28 March, the people and NADK killed 67  invading soldiers and wounded over 70 others. They also  destroyed 40 assorted guns and seized 27 others. There was a  significant decrease in the activities of cannons -- during  these two days only a few rounds were fired. Tanks hardly dared  carry out activities; they only protected the invading forces'  bases. As for military leaders of the communist Vietnamese  puppets and two-headed government, they lamented in their  conversations over the difficult situation; the lack of  ammunition, food supplies, fuel, and medicine; and about the  malaria and diarrhea problem. Some soldiers defied commanders'  orders to fight in this or that area, while others said they  could no longer stay and asked for a transfer. This is because  if the troops, commanders, and tanks remained, they would be  smashed to pieces.    It is worth pointing out that within the perimeters of Sala  Krau and Pailin, the invading forces can only conduct their  operations with tanks, which were used as both combat forces and  as a means of transport. As for the ground troops, many of them  were killed and wounded every day. This situation terrified the  tanks because they had no ground support and no other vehicles  joined them in carrying out operations. As such, there was a  gradual decrease in the tanks' activities, causing the spirit of  the communist Vietnamese puppets and two-headed government  troops, which rely on tanks, to increasingly tumble. Moreover,  the continued rain downpours caused the invading forces to  become more terrified because it was extremely difficult for the  ground troops to move or to carry supplies from this or that  area. This was due to, on the one hand, the slippery and muddy  ground and, on the other, mines and attacks constantly mounted  by the people and NADK to cut them into several segments.    III. On 29 March, the people and NADK initiated an assault  on the invading forces. In particular, they:    1. Continued to cut off their supply lines;    2. Attacked Sala Krau from three directions -- the east,  north, and west.    In the fighting on the afternoon of 29 March, the people and  NADK destroyed two tanks and damaged two others, and they killed  more than 40 enemy soldiers and wounded over 60 others. On 29  March, it was the beginning of a new battle scene within the  perimeters of Sala Krau and Pailin in a situation where the  invading forces' throat was completely cut. From now on, it  will be fighting inside the perimeters of Sala Krau and Pailin  only. It is a battle inside a trap where the invading forces  are encircled from all directions and completely cut off.    The situation which has developed every day until 29 March  has more clearly demonstrated that:    1. The invading forces are unable to occupy Pailin. This is  in accordance with the concrete situation and also predictions  and assessments made by international observers since the  beginning of the attack on Pailin by the invading forces.    2. Cutting the invading forces' throat and the beginning of  the battle inside the perimeters of Sala Krau and Pailin,  especially on 29 March, show that the time for the people and  NADK to force the invading forces out of the Pailin region is  nearing rapidly.</p>

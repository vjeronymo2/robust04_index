			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Branson venture with TV-am wins national licence INDEPENDENT Music Radio, a joint venture between TV-am and Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group, has been awarded the second national commercial radio licence. It was the second-highest bidder. The Radio Authority, the regulatory body for the commercial radio industry, yesterday rejected Independent National Broadcasting Company's Pounds 4.01m-a-year bid for the pop music franchise. The official reason given was that under the terms of the 1990 Broadcasting Act the authority was not satisfied that INBC would be able to sustain its service over the length of the licence. It is believed that consultants' reports for the authority raised doubts about the viability of INBC's business plan. A prospectus designed to raise the bulk of INBC's capital was delivered to the Radio Authority only on Wednesday, the day before the decision on the licence was due to be taken. Independent Music Radio, which will broadcast a national pop service with an emphasis on rock music as well as news bulletins and headlines, now has six weeks to complete its financial arrangements. Mr Bruce Gyngell, the 62-year-old chairman of TV-am, was said to be 'delighted' yesterday. Mr Gyngell started his career in radio. The award to Independent Music Radio, which bid Pounds 1.883m a year, is a much-needed boost to the commercial breakfast station, which lost its TV broadcasting licence in last year's competitive tenders and which goes off the air on December 31. Mr Gyngell's aim is to use assets of more than Pounds 50m to try to build a cluster of media investments to keep TV-am alive as a broadcaster. The company has also bid for the commercial teletext licence. The first national licence for non-pop music went to Classic FM - also the second-highest bidder, because the highest bidder could not complete its financing. The third and last of the commercial national stations is likely to be speech-based. No date has yet been set for advertising this licence. In addition to its bid money, Independent Music Radio will have to pay 4 per cent of qualifying advertising revenue to the Treasury and an annual licence fee of Pounds 645,000 to the Radio Authority.</p>

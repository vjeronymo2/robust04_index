The first meeting, with  UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, lasted 45 minutes and took  place in an open and working atmosphere.    President Tudjman thanked the United Nations for its efforts  to achieve peace in southeast Europe. However, there can be no  peace until the issue of UN-protected areas in Croatia is  resolved. Croatia calls for effective control of its borders in  accordance with resolution 769 of the UN Security Council. It  insists on restoring Croatia's authority over the so-called pink  zones. In line with resolution 820 of the UN Security Council,  trade with the protected areas cannot be undertaken without  exclusive permission from Croatian authorities. Three UN  Security Council resolutions, 815, 847 and 871, which confirmed  that the protected areas are integral parts of the Republic of  Croatia, will continue to provide the foundations for resolving  this issue. In Croatia's view, the resolution of the issue of  the protected areas will release UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]  military units to perform other tasks and will at the same time  help to resolve the world organization's financial difficulties.    Croatia called for implementation of the UN General  Assembly's resolutions which provide for funds to finance the  reconstruction of the destroyed parts of Croatia.    Following his meeting with Butrus-Ghali, President Tudjman  met the UN Security Council. President Tudjman stressed  Croatia's readiness to cooperate with the UN Security Council  and the UN secretary general in implementing the UNPROFOR  mandate. The Washington agreements mark a watershed in the  peace process, President Tudjman said, and went on to emphasize  the major role played by the United States in reaching the  agreements. This positive development should be seized and used  to achieve peace in Croatia. Peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina will  not last unless there is peace in Croatia. Serb extremists  refuse to cooperate with Croatia and the authorities in Belgrade  have not been behaving in line with the agreement to normalize  relations between Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.    The positive experience from Bosnia-Herzegovina, where a  resolute threat of force proved effective, should be used in the  efforts to resolve the issue of the protected areas. Croatia  has offered a high degree of autonomy to the Serb population in  the areas where it was in the majority according to the 1991  census.    In conclusion President Tudjman called on the UN Security  Council and the world organization to help create conditions for  the resettlement of several hundred thousand refugees.</p>

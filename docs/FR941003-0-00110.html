			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, mention should be made of the conforming amendment under 24 CFR part 204, Coinsurance, contained in the proposed rule (58 FR 48566). On March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14809, Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1717), the Department proposed termination of its single family coinsurance program but the proceeding in Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1717 is still open. Until final action is taken, part 204 remains in effect and is being amended by this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart C_Multifamily Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 267.9, Definitions applicable to multifamily programs, extracts from &sect;267.2 of the proposed rule those definitions pertinent to multifamily programs. As with &sect;267.5, some editorial changes have been required to accommodate this separation of the definitions from the format in which they were proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 267.10, Qualified appraisers and appraisals, derives from &sect;267.3 of the proposal. It has been redrafted to fit exclusively multifamily programs. Note also that paragraph (a) provides for HUD employees performing multifamily appraisals to be qualified as certified general appraisers not later than December 31, 1996, unless the Assistant Secretary-Commissioner specifies otherwise in an individual case. It is FHA's goal to qualify its staff appraisers in accordance with the standards of a state as soon as possible. However, the Department is currently undertaking an extensive reorganization and restructuring of its field office functions and jurisdictions. Very likely, a number of HUD Multifamily appraisers, including some who have already attained certified general status, will be retiring in the near future. Time is required to recoup such losses and our current estimate is that we will not be able to achieve comprehensive certification of multifamily appraisers until the end of 1996. Some currently certified employees will remain, of course, and others will become certified before that time, but we cannot set a precise schedule because available training funds for the 1995 and 1996 fiscal years are not known nor is the retirement rate predictable with much accuracy. Moreover, the dispatch with which HUD can accomplish conprehensive certification of its staff appraisers will be directly proportional to the extent of training and experience required by different states so progress will undoubtedly vary from one field office to another. We have set a date of December 31, 1996 for achieving full staff certification in multifamily programs; however, in the event funding and attrition rates differ appreciably from our projections, we will adjust the effective date to make it earlier if possible, later if necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As is the case with &sect;267.7, which sets standards for single family appraisals, &sect;267.11 has been extensively revised both to reduce requirements and to extract specific_in this case multifamily_appraisal standards. In most respects, &sect;&sect;267.7 and 267.11 are alike, except that in &sect;267.11: 1) the prescribed appraisal forms are different; 2) the review of historical sales prices covers a three-year (or more), rather than a one-year, time span; 3) proposed rule paragraphs 267.4(a)(7) and (a)(8), concerning marketing period and factors that affect income and the absorption period, are relevant for multifamily sales and are included; and 4) the reference to valuation methods focuses on the greater concern with replacement cost in multifamily programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons cited above in the description of &sect;267.8, the provision regarding the assistance of others, &sect;267.5(f) of the proposed rule, has been deleted. However, &sect;267.12 contains a new paragraph (b)(2), inadvertently omitted from the proposed rule, that outlines the relationship between an appraiser and a Delegated Processor. Paragraph (b)(2) explains that HUD must review and approve each appraiser who works for a Delegated Processor, either as an employee or as an independent contractor. We also review and approve each appraiser employed under a Technical Discipline Contract (TDC).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of the Comments Received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> The Two Main Issues <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most of the comments addressed one or both of the principal objectives of the rule: to require the certification or licensing of appraisers for FHA-insured mortgages and to enable DE mortgagees to use appraisers of their own choosing for FHA transactions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters used the rulemaking as an occasion to raise matters outside the scope of this proceeding. It would be inappropriate to dispose of those matters at this time, but to the extent HUD deems appropriate, they may be the subject of subsequent administrative action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> The Certification/Licensure Issue <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As was pointed out in the proposed rule, the requirement that FHA appraisers must be certified or licensed, depending upon the nature of the transaction, is based on section 142 of the Reform Act, and parallels a similar Congressional mandate in FIRREA that only certified general, certified residential or licensed persons may perform appraisals involving federally related transactions. Thus, when section 142 was enacted, a system of state certification and licensing was already under development. This was beneficial in two respects. First, it obviated the need for HUD to develop its own regulatory structure with a resultant drain on staff and budgetary resources. Second, by drawing upon the FIRREA system as an established resource, HUD could fulfill its regulatory responsibility with a minimum of added expense to homebuyers. We believe that most appraisers will soon be certified and/or licensed in order to participate in the broad range of federally related transactions and also to enhance their own professional stature. The cost of added training and membership will then be distributed over a wide base of consumers. Moreover, there will probably be a dwindling pool of unlicensed and uncertified appraisers upon which mortgagees can draw so that, quite apart from the mandate of section 142, debate over the need for such accreditation in FHA programs will become academic. In any event, HUD retains its control over appraisal fees permitted for single family programs to make sure that they do not rise disproportionately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> The Appraiser Selection Issue <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to the DE mortgagee's right to choose appraisers, we specifically requested comment from the public. It is not possible for HUD to preclude that choice by rulemaking, since the mortgagee's right to choose has been mandated by Congress and is therefore beyond the scope of agency policy. However, we wanted to assess the extent and weight of public opinion in order to ascertain if there were a good case HUD might present to Congress for repealing the provision. We found that public opinion was fairly well balanced between support and opposition. Some commenters argued that lender choice would lead to abuse and distorted valuation; others that it would do no more than serve to simplify and speed the appraisal process. We turned, therefore, to an analogy with experience already gained, inferring that use of the staff appraisers employed by many major lending firms should have the same potential for abuse and the same tendency to encourage lender-dictated property values. Yet increasing experience with this practice has not indicated that the accuracy or thoroughness of lender staff appraisals has been compromised by pressure on the employee. We have concluded that serious concern about the integrity of lender-selected appraisers is not supported by current evidence and we do not plan to pursue the matter legislatively at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BAYLES' BIG QUARTER PROPELS CRESCENTA VALLEY, 74-65  </P> <P> For the first half of Crescenta Valley's Southern Section 4-A Division playoff  opener Wednesday night, it appeared as if Falcon senior guard David Bayles  would be relegated to a cameo role.  </P> <P> Reasoning that Bayles' poor outside shooting would not help Crescenta Valley's  cause against the 3-2 press of Newbury Park, Coach John Goffredo sat him down  58 seconds into the first quarter.  </P> <P> But Bayles' bid for playoff heroics wasn't over. When Newbury Park switched to  a 2-3 zone in the second half, Bayles caught fire.  </P> <P> Bayles scored all of his career-high 14 points in the fourth quarter as  Crescenta Valley ran off a late flurry to take a 74-65 win at Crescenta Valley.  </P> <P> Bayles' timely run and Crescenta Valley's superior balance was more than enough  to put away the Panthers.  </P> <P> Newbury Park forward Wayne Cook scored a game-high 30 points, but his team went  cold in the final three minutes. He made 13 of 27 field-goal attempts as the  team consistently looked to him for the big basket.  </P> <P> "He's our No. 1 player and the best athlete I've ever coached," Newbury Park  Coach Ken Barone said. "So he has to have the green light to shoot whenever he  wants."  </P> <P> But it was Bayles who shot down Newbury Park (13-11).  </P> <P> Trailing, 59-58, with 2:55 to play, Crescenta Valley (16-8) mounted a 14-6 run.  </P> <P> Bayles scored eight of the Falcons' points in the run, scoring on a jump shot,  two layups and a pair of free throws.  </P> <P> Cook tried in vain to answer Bayles, scoring seven of Newbury Park's final 18  points.  </P> <P> Cook, a senior who will attend UCLA on a football scholarship in the fall, made  three of six from three-point range.  </P> <P> Cook, however, was unable to do it alone. Crescenta Valley held a 48-47 lead  heading into the fourth quarter, but outscored Newbury Park, 26-18, over the  final eight minutes.  </P> <P> Cook was one of only two Panthers to reach double figures.  </P> <P> Chris Falzone scored 11 for Newbury Park and teammate Amir El Farra added  eight.  </P> <P> When it counted, Crescenta Valley knocked off Newbury Park with a depth charge.  </P> <P> John Gilmore scored 12 points and teammates Paul Matijasevic and Brian Cortes  each added 10.  </P> <P> Lamar Breeding, who was promoted from the junior varsity last week, scored a  career-high 15 points for Crescenta Valley, 13 in the first three quarters to  keep the Falcons close.  </P></p>

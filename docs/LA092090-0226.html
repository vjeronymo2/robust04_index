			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CYPRESS MAN KILLED IN FALL FROM CATALINA ISLAND CLIFF  </P> <P> A 19-year-old Cypress man died after he fell 70 feet while attempting to scale  a sheer rock cliff overlooking the surf just south of Avalon Harbor on Santa  Catalina Island, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Todd Gregoire, who was hiking with a companion, was pronounced dead at County  Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance about 10 p.m. Tuesday, three hours after  rescuers finally reached him below a vertical rock wall in treacherous surf  conditions, Deputy Gabe Ramirez said.  </P> <P> "It began as a casual hike. . . . That's how these things start off," said Lt.  John McKay, a Los Angeles County lifeguard spokesman. "But it was old, brittle  rock, and they carried no rock-climbing equipment."  </P> <P> Rescuers said they knew Gregoire's condition was deteriorating rapidly as they  struggled to reach him. But they were forced to climb slowly and could carry  only limited rescue equipment as they edged down the cliff to the spot where  Gregoire was sprawled on a ledge, McKay said.  </P> <P> "The water was surging and the tide was coming in," McKay said. "Our men were  almost getting swept off the rocks themselves. It was one of those situations  where we had to minimize the number of people on a rescue to minimize injury to  them."  </P> <P> One rescuer suffered cuts from falling rocks, and another nearly fell into the  water when a stretcher basket being lowered by a Coast Guard helicopter struck  him on the head. Both injuries were minor, McKay said.  </P> <P> After two rescuers climbed down to Gregoire, other rescuers had to dive in the  water from a patrol boat and ferry life-saving equipment to the base of the  cliff, McKay said.  </P> <P> Although a helicopter was called in, it was unable to maneuver close enough to  pull him up because of the rocky cliff and testy wind drafts.  </P> <P> Instead, rescuers lowered an inflatable life raft, loaded Gregoire in and  pushed the raft out into the surf, where it was tied to a patrol boat. As the  helicopter circled for a second attempt to lift Gregoire, McKay said, its  rotors churned up too much water, making a lift impossible.  </P> <P> "We could have saved some time with a direct lift into the helicopter, but we  just couldn't," McKay said. "We took the patient by boat about two miles to  Catalina Harbor and he flew from there to a hospital."  </P> <P> Authorities said that Gregoire had taken a ferry from the mainland and arrived  about 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday to met his friend, Shane Anderson, 20, of Cypress,  who had been working on the island.  </P> <P> The two friends, one garbed in jeans and the other in shorts, decided to hike  up to a 500-foot summit. They carried no rock-climbing equipment, McKay said.  </P> <P> About 75 feet up the face of a rocky cliff, both climbers could no longer find  any convenient holds for their hands or shoes. Unable to climb in any  direction, the two were trapped, Anderson told rescuers.  </P> <P> Gregoire then apparently slipped and fell. Anderson, who was several feet below  Gregoire, said he never saw his friend fall.  </P></p>

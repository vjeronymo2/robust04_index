(PANA) -- Nigeria and Ghana have  expressed concern over the delay in the implementation of the  Liberian peace accord, signed in Cotonou, Benin Republic in July  last year, a Nigerian Government statement said Wednesday [23  February]. The statement was issued in Nigeria's federal  capital, Abuja, after a Ghanaian envoy, Lt.-Gen. Arnold Quainoo,  had delivered a message from President Jerry Rawlings, to  Nigerian leader, Gen. Sani Abacha, on the Liberian crisis and  other issues.    Nigeria and Ghana have troops in the West African peace  keeping force in Liberia (ECOMOG) [Economic Community of West  African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], which has now been  expanded and includes battalions from Tanzania and Uganda.    Two weeks ago, Ghana served notice of its intention to  "review" its participation in ECOMOG unless the warring factions  showed commitment to peace within one month. Nigeria has the  largest contingent of about 12,000 troops in Liberia and there  is growing public impatience among Nigerians at the lack of  progress in the efforts to end the four-year-old war.    The statement said that Gen. Quainoo briefed the Nigerian  leader on the recent tour of Liberia by a Ghanaian military  delegation and "restated the country's (Ghana's) concern at the  non-implementation of the Cotonou peace accord".    It quoted Gen. Abacha as saying that Nigeria shared Ghana's  concern at the delay in resolving the Liberian crisis. He  expressed his belief that "Liberians must be willing to  cooperate among themselves for amicable resolution of the crisis  in the war-torn country".    Nigeria and Ghana also expressed the need for improved trade  cooperation between them as a catalyst for sub-regional economic  integration, the statement added.</p>

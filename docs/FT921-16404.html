			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Tax burden rises, official figures show: Publication of Treasury statistics suppressed for 18 months, says Labour THE government suppressed figures showing that the poll tax has significantly increased the tax burden on many households, Labour said last night. Treasury data on the impact on typical households of the poll tax, income tax, national insurance contributions, VAT and other indirect taxes show that only single person households or families on above average earnings are paying a smaller percentage of their incomes in tax than at the end of the last Labour government in 1979. Labour asked for the figures in July 1990 but Mr Peter Lilley, then financial secretary to the Treasury, delayed publication until data on the poll tax bills actually paid were published last month. Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: 'I don't think there is any doubt that the government wanted to suppress the fact that the poll tax had added to an existing trend.' The government has admitted that the total tax burden, excluding the poll tax, has risen for many households, undermining Tory claims to be the party of lower taxation. The latest statistics, which compare the poll tax with the old rates system, are likely to embarrass ministers further. Officials warned, however, that the estimates including the poll tax were only 'approximate'. The rise in VAT in last March's budget, which has not been included in the latest figures, almost certainly means the trend of rising taxation will continue. Labour used the figures to intensify its attacks on the government's handling of the economy. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment spokesman, said the government's credibility 'has been shot to pieces, first by the creation of the recession, and then by its arrogant misjudgment of its depth and extent.' Mrs Beckett warned that the government may raise VAT again, perhaps to fund cuts in income tax or increased public spending. According to the figures, a married couple on average earnings with two children paid 35.2 per cent of their gross earnings in tax in 1978-79. By 1990-91 that had risen to 37.5 per cent on average earnings of Pounds 306.20 a week. For a married couple, with two children, but earning just three quarters of average earnings, the rise in the tax burden has been still greater - increasing from 30.9 per cent of earnings in 1978-79 to 34.9 per cent in 1990-91. Of the households sampled, only those on 1 1/2 times average earnings have seen reductions in the tax burden, Mrs Beckett said. A family on three quarters average earnings, with two children, paid 6.2 per cent of their earnings on the poll tax in 1990-91. A similar sized family on 1 1/2 times average earnings paid only 3.4 per cent. Total personal wealth up sharply since 1976 Page 4</p>

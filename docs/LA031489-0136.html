			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR BODY: ORGANIC PRODUCE: WHAT IT MEANS AND HOW TO FIND IT  </P> <P> Does the growth regulator Alar make apples unsafe to eat? Do a multitude of  pesticides on other fruits and vegetables increase your risk of cancer?  </P> <P> With each new report about dietary health hazards comes added anxiety for  shoppers. To cope, some have switched to "organic" food -- and they're going to  great lengths to get it.  </P> <P> A case in point: Betty Line of Rancho Cucamonga who, after calling several  supermarkets in her area, drove 45 minutes to Glendale Saturday afternoon to  make certain her 2-year-old son Thomas would eat organic produce that night.  </P> <P> But once in the market, consumers often face a sea of signs describing fresh  fruits and vegetables. Equal in the eyes of Califoria law: organically grown,  organic, naturally grown, wild, ecologically grown and biologically grown.  </P> <P> All mean "no synthetically compounded materials have been used in the growing  or processing of the product," said Frank Nava of the food and drug branch of  the state Department of Health Services, the agency responsible for enforcement  of state Health and Safety Codes.  </P> <P> Under that law, growers who plan to market their crops as "organic" may not use  synthetically compounded fertilizers, pesticides or growth regulators from 12  months prior to planting through processing.  </P> <P> Produce that carries the words California Certified Organic Farmers or CCOF  certified has the blessing of the California Certified Organic Farmers, a Santa  Cruz-based organization of 450 growers, and "has been tracked from planting  through processing to insure that it's chemical-free," said spokesman Phil  McGee.  </P> <P> Growers applying for membership must wait at least 12 months, he said, while  information is collected to make certain state guidelines have been followed.  In addition, organic growers must improve the soil and fulfill several other  requirements.  </P> <P> Some labels don't attest to purity, Nava added. No sprays used doesn't  necessarily mean no pesticides, he said. And California grown means only that.  </P> <P> The term sustainable agriculture does not necessarily mean produce has been  raised organically, noted Mark Lipson, a spokesman for CCOF. Rather,  sustainable agriculture refers to an approach that attempts to minimize  negative effects on the environment and people while maintaining profitability  for farmers.  </P> <P> Yet another term, integrated pest management, indicates pesticide use has been  reduced but not eliminated.  </P> <P> In a survey of 900 consumers in Marin, San Diego and Sacramento counties, UC  Davis agricultural economist Desmond Davis found 22% regularly look for organic  foods, up from 3% in the early '70s, according to a U.S. Department of  Agriculture report.  </P> <P> Fighting Baldness  </P> <P> When topical minoxidil was approved last year for the treatment of baldness, it  was good news for some of the 50 million Americans with thinning hair.  </P> <P> But physicians and others who have been studying and prescribing minoxidil say  it doesn't work for some users and may pose risks for others with  cardiovascular problems. Regular check-ups, they add, are a good idea for all  minoxidil users.  </P> <P> Ideal candidates for topical use of the drug are men younger than 50 who are  just beginning to lose their hair, said Dr. Richard Odom, a UC San Francisco  clinical professor of dermatology who has prescribed the drug for four years.  </P> <P> Receding hairlines don't seem to respond as well as crown baldness, said Dr. H.  Irving Katz, a University of Minnesota clinical professor of dermatology. And  twice-daily applications appear to be a lifetime commitment: Those who  discontinued minoxidil use noticed further hair loss within two or three  months, said Katz, who recently published a review of minoxidil in the journal  Cutis.  </P> <P> Clinical trials sponsored by the drug's manufacturer, Upjohn Co. of Kalamazoo,  Mich., found 39% of men had moderate or dense hair growth with its use.  </P> <P> How minoxidil -- originally an oral treatment for high blood pressure -- works  to prevent hair loss still isn't understood, said Upjohn spokeswoman Kaye  Bennett.  </P> <P> Combining minoxidil with Retin-A, an acne medication also used to treat  wrinkles, appears to improve results, said Dr. Jack Jaffe, medical director of  Physicians Hair Center, one of two such clinics in the Boston area. "Both act  on the hair follicles directly," he said.  </P> <P> The Fitness Profile  </P> <P> Physically fit people are likely to be energetic, optimistic, perfectionistic  and competitive, a new study of physical fitness and personality suggests.  </P> <P> But the notion people who exercise vigorously do so to compensate for  psychological deficiencies wasn't borne out by the research of Joyce Hogan,  associate professor of psychology at the University of Tulsa.  </P> <P> Hogan, who published her findings in the Journal of Personality and Social  Psychology, administered physical fitness and personality tests to two groups  of male exercisers: 97 from the Navy, ages 18 to 33, and 35 applicants for law  enforcement jobs, 20 to 40. Both groups were above average in terms of physical  fitness and psychological health, she found. Their personality characteristics  are "the conceptual opposite of the disease-prone personality," she said, which  is marked by anxiety, hostility and depression.  </P> <P> Hogan believes her study dispels the notion that "people in very good physical  condition are driven by their own neuroses, such as lack of self-confidence. My  research shows there's no relationship between traditional psychopathology and  level of fitness."  </P> <P> Based on the results, Hogan speculates that "personality may moderate the link  between fitness and physical health."  </P> <P> "What she's describing is the Type A personality," said Steve Farrell, an  exercise physiologist at the Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas. "Those  people are more likely to adhere to their exercise program. But that doesn't  mean (the more easygoing) Type Bs won't adhere, too," he said.  </P></p>

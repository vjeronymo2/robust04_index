			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRAFTING GIFTS FROM NATURE'S STOREHOUSE  </P> <P> She has sketched the 300,000-year-old bones of ancient man and drawn the  fossils of the extinct ground sloth. She has peered through a microscope at the  hairs on a fly in a painstaking search for artistic accuracy.  </P> <P> Now Danish-born scientific illustrator Inger Achton Dix is channeling her  creative energies in another direction: She makes whimsical creatures from  nature's storehouse.  </P> <P> Dix, 80, heads a group of 10 other volunteers who craft gifts from peacock  feathers, twigs and seed pods at the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum.  </P> <P> They work in a wooden shed nestled in the 127-acre garden. Their all-natural  creations -- from painted walnut-shell skunks to prickly poodles fashioned from  liquidambar pods -- bring in more than $3,000 a year for the arboretum's gift  shop.  </P> <P> "We make funny little animals," Dix said, holding up what looked like a cross  between an aardvark and an armadillo, formed from eucalyptus pods, with stems  of magnolia seedpods for legs. The creature, like other whimsical animals in  the menagerie, sells for $2.95 to $4. Other handcrafted items are priced from  $1 for vases of straw flowers to $30 for basket arrangements and wreaths.  </P> <P> "Sometimes we do buy ribbon or silk flowers to add a bit of color," she  confessed.  </P> <P> Dix attended art schools in Copenhagen and Berlin. After she graduated, a  zoologist taught her scientific illustration.  </P> <P> She was hired to catalogue the 3,000-piece Mongolian collection of Danish  explorer Henning Haslund-Christensen at the National Museum of Copenhagen,  faithfully reproducing the ornate headdresses, tents and household items on  paper.  </P> <P> In 1947, she arrived in New York with $50 in her pocket and started work at the  Museum of Natural History. Her job was to sketch fossils for anthropologist  Franz Weidenreich.  </P> <P> Then she moved to Caltech, where she drew the bones of the ground sloth. She  stopped working as a professional illustrator in 1952 but continued to draw and  paint for pleasure.  </P> <P> In 1971 she exchanged her paintbrush and India ink for seeds, flowers and a  glue applicator when she joined the arboretum's 300-member volunteer corps. But  she hasn't lost her scrupulous attention to detail, and agonizes over traces of  glue on the crafts.  </P> <P> "She gives it everything she's got," said Grace Robinson, another volunteer in  the crafts group, which meets Tuesday mornings. "She's very fastidious about  what she makes. Everything has to be in good order before she lets it go to the  gift shop."  </P> <P> Dix estimates she spends about 50 to 70 hours a week at her arboretum "job." In  addition, she pots plants at the Huntington Library, Art Collections and  Botanical Gardens in San Marino and performs folk dances several times a year  at Danish clubs.  </P> <P> "I work harder now as a retiree than when I was paid!" she said. "I can't sit  still. I have to work with my hands."  </P></p>

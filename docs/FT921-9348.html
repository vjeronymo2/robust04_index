			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Observer: Media mad Could Martin Taylor, one of the vice-chairmen at Lord Hanson's court, soon be out of a job? The word is that Britain's tenth biggest company is looking for a high-powered in-house public relations person to add to its battalions of outside media advisers. Hanson already has a director of public affairs - Michael Shea, the Queen's former press secretary. But along with Lord Glenarthur, a former Tory minister, Shea spends an unusual amount of time polishing Hanson's political relations rather than fielding questions from the financial trade press. Oddly for a company of Hanson's size, this routine duty has been delegated to Martin Taylor, who should have more serious responsibilities to shoulder. Somewhat belatedly, Hanson seems to have accepted the need to mend its public, as opposed to its political, image. Friday's half-day investor presentation at the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre - organised by yet another well-connected public relations firm, Balfour Harley Associates - is a start. But Hanson is also looking for a permanent PR flak-fender whose job would be to ensure Hanson's noble lords more statesmanlike coverage in serious journals such as the Harvard Business Review as distinct from the Hull Daily Mail. Alas, as usual, all Martin Taylor will say is that he never comments on market rumours.</p>

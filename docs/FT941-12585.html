			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / BA pays Virgin Pounds 2.6m to settle row British Airways yesterday agreed to pay Virgin Atlantic Airways Pounds 2.65m plus costs to settle the first of the bitter disputes between the two airlines, Rachel Johnson writes. That dispute arose in 1988 when BA held a contract to maintain Virgin's aircraft. Virgin alleged that BA caused engineering damage to Virgin's aircraft on five occasions that year. One aircraft was grounded for two months during the peak summer holiday season, forcing Virgin to charter replacements, the company said. BA argued that the payout was 'modest in relation to the nearly Pounds 6m demanded' to settle the long-running dispute. Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman, said: 'This is the second time that BA have denied any liability and refused to settle a valid claim for damages and then capitulated at the 11th hour.' The maintenance settlement is separate from the 'dirty tricks' claim, which emerged in January last year.</p>

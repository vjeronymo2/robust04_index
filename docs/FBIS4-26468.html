			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sheel Kohli in London] </F>   [Text] As trading started in the foreign exchange capital  of the world yesterday, hardened City currency dealers were  waiting for signs that the rescue party for the U.S. dollar was  on the way. Until the G7 (Group of Seven) mobilised their  official banks into the markets the dollar would be on a one-way  ride, they warned. "If the central banks don't all step in  together soon, then we're going to see the U.S. dollar go into  free-fall because the speculators don't care. They want to see  how low it can go," said one London trader.    Late last night, European time, the Japanese yen dipped  through the emotive level of 100 yen to the U.S. dollar. At one  point, the yen was trading in Europe at 99.85 the lowest level  that the U.S. dollar has reached since the end of World War 11,  reflecting a new aggressiveness among global foreign exchange  speculators.    The consequences are far-reaching. For Japan, which is now  emerging from one of its longest recessions, the marketability  of the yen is paramount if a successful economic recovery is to  be achieved. This week saw what is believed to have been a US$1  billion injection by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) just before the  Tokyo close on Tuesday with the dollar being bought at  reportedly 100.4 yen, 100.6 yen and 101 yen.    Phil Luxton, a currency analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd  said there was a feeling that speculators wanted to see how long  it would be before the central banks of the G7 nations stepped  in. "They (the speculators) are probing all the time, and  trying to find the level at which the central banks will move  in."    Clearly, as the current low level of the yen has shown,  occasional intervention by the BOJ is not enough, and a  concerted effort is needed. What surprised the City yesterday  was the almost blase attitude that seemed to be adopted by the  U.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve towards any kind of  intervention. If a concerted effort is to be made, the Federal  Reserve will have to determine the timing, and several observers  expected key clues to be revealed in Federal Reserve chairman  Alan Greenspan's address to the House of Representatives' budget  committee last night.    Options available to the Federal Reserve were seen to be to  increase interest rates significantly to give added confidence  to the dollar, or to advocate concerted intervention by the G7  central banks. The market has for a long time been betting on a  rise in U.S. interest rates to six per cent by the end of the  year.    Nick Clube of Smith New Court said central bankers  everywhere  would be keeping a close eye on the effect that the currency  turmoil would have on the bond and equity markets. "It is to do  with bonds and equities, if they are being adversely affected,  the banks will feel more pressure to come in." Lee Ferridge of  Natwest Markets said banks were possibly waiting for the market  to become too short on dollars before teaching it a hard, sharp  lesson by intervening and pushing up rates significantly.    The question of central bank intervention also puts into  focus the mark-dollar relationship. Adrian Cunningham of Union  Bank of Switzerland said the delay over intervention might have  been caused by reluctance on the part of the Bundesbank, where  the mark was trading at a comfortable 1.5982/5992 to the dollar.  "The Bundesbank is not unhappy about the dollar-mark rate at  1.60. It isn't perceived by the Bundesbank to be a problem."  The decision by the Bundesbank to shave 0.05 per cent off the  repo rate to five per cent was in itself an act of support  without intervention because it buoyed sentiment in the belief  that Germany was happy to cut repo even though official rates  were on hold, he said. However, he suggested the Bundesbank  would need to fund the budget, and would be looking for finance  from a market which had faith in its currency policy.    Another story doing the rounds was that the United States  might be punishing Japan over their enduring trade dispute,  knowing that a strong yen would keep Japanese exports down. But  that theory was also dismissed because the United States would  be well-aware of the long-term economic damage such a policy  could wreak on its own domestic market.</p>

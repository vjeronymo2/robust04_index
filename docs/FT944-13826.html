			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / People: Departures Andrew Cracknell, who was appointed worldwide executive creative director of the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi-owned Bates (formerly BSB) advertising agency network less than a year ago, has left the company. Bates says Cracknell, 48, had left 'due to an as yet unresolved contractual dispute'. Cracknell has been part of the New York-based team, headed by Michael Bungey, chief executive, which has been attempting to inject new life into the flagging US part of the network. Bungey says he views Cracknell's departure, after seven years with the agency, with 'deep regret'.</p>

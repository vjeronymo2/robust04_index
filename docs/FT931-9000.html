			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Steep falls in US stocks as Clinton widens tax plan: Bond markets react positively on deficit hopes US STOCK markets fell sharply yesterday as investors took fright at President Bill Clinton's plans to raise taxes on a far broader range of taxpayers than expected. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 75 points in the first 90 minutes of business in heavy selling, triggering New York Stock Exchange rules that limit computerised trading. The restrictions failed to stem the selling in afternoon trading, and the Dow eventually closed down 82.94 at 3,309.49. In contrast, the bond markets welcomed Mr Clinton's tough talk on deficit reduction. The president said yesterday that businesses would be better off because his plans for reducing the budget deficit would yield lower, more stable long-term interest rates. 'The bond market's a better indicator, and that response has been very positive,' he said. After weeks of floating one idea after another, Mr Clinton warned Americans in a televised speech on Monday night that he had been unable to find any way to deal with the growing US federal budget deficit without raising taxes on the middle class. He promised that 70 per cent of the new taxes he will propose in a detailed address to Congress tonight would be paid by those earning more than Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 69,000) a year. A White House spokesman added yesterday that people making less than Dollars 30,000 were very unlikely to suffer any increase in taxation, while those earning between Dollars 30,000 and Dollars 100,000 would face 'modest increases across the board'. However, it appeared certain that higher income tax rates, which Mr Clinton promised during his campaign would be limited to the top 2 per cent of taxpayers, will be levied on much lower incomes. A new top income tax rate of 36 per cent may be imposed on incomes above Dollars 175,000, while a so-called 'millionaire's surtax' could be extended to incomes of Dollars 250,000, in effect creating a top marginal tax rate of around 40 per cent. White House officials also confirmed yesterday that they were considering a second round of tax increases, possibly affecting tobacco, alcohol, guns or insurance premiums, to pay for the expected Dollars 30bn-Dollars 90bn cost of extending medical coverage to everyone in a reform Mr Clinton will propose later in the year. Republicans have launched an all-out assault on Mr Clinton's economic programme, saying that he will simply raise taxes without undertaking any serious attempt to reduce the deficit by curbing government spending. 'All the sacrificing is going to be done by the people pulling the wagon,' said Senator Phil Gramm of Texas. Analysts said shares fell sharply because investors were worried that higher corporate and personal taxes, coupled with spending cuts, might hinder the economic recovery. The selling also reflected disappointment that the Clinton fiscal stimulus package will probably not be as big as the markets had once hoped. Drug stocks took an especially big beating on concern that the president's healthcare reforms will regulate pharmaceutical prices and limit drug sales.

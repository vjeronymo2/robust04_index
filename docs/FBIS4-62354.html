			<p>BFN     [Text] Stepanakert ("LRAGIR", "AZG" dailies), 05/13/94 --  Having signed the cease-fire agreement, Azerbaijan continues  carrying military operations in the zone of Karabakh conflict.    The Azeri Armed Forces attempted to break the Karabakh  defense positions in the Agdamskiy District at 0700 early in the  morning of 12 May. The Azeris involved 500 infantry, four T-72  tanks and three personnel carriers, attacking in the direction  of the village of Hovsepavan (Yusifdzhanli). According to the  RMK Defense Army Headquarters, the enemy was forced to retreat  with great manpower and equipment losses. According to  preliminary information, 35 Azeri soldiers were killed, eight  Karabakh fighters injured.    No significant changes of the front line were registered by  1700. Only positional shellings were reported.    Battles at the northern section of the front continue too.  The Azeri troops commenced several offensives in the  Mardakertskiy District, particularly in the direction of the  village of Leninavan. The enemy offensive was successfully  repulsed.    The RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] military  reconnaissance reports significant concentration of the Azeri  forces at the north of the Mardakertskiy District, particularly  in the environs of the villages of Talysh and Seisulan.    At the same time the Azeri Defense Ministry reports, the  Armenian units commenced an extensive offensive in the direction  of the Azeri positions in the Mardakertskiy and Agdamskiy  Districts.    An Azeri prisoner Melik Yakhiaev of Ujan district reported,  the Azeri command issued a secret order to establish a special  control over non-Azeri units fighting at the front, particularly  over Lezgins and Avars. Most worries are caused by Avar units  in the Belokan and Zakatala districts [last three placenames as  received], who have to fight in the most dangerous sections of  the front. "Jimahagh" ("People") National Liberation Movement  of Avars is becoming very popular in the mentioned districts.  "Jimahagh"s goal is to join the Zakatala and Belokan district  to Dagestan.</p>

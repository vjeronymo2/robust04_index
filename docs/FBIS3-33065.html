			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 15 Feb (EFE) -- Peruvian  President Alberto Fujimori today pledged in this city "to  convince other presidents" of the region to vote for Colombian  President Cesar Gaviria as OAS secretary general. President  Fujimori said this during a news conference he held in Santa Fe  de Bogota shortly before returning to his country following a  two-day official visit to Colombia. He said: "I will be  honest; I am personally going to talk to some presidents to make  this candidacy strong, with possibilities of winning."    Fujimori underlined President Gaviria's "leadership in  international forums" and stressed that Gaviria "has defended  Ibero-American interests, democracy, and the steadiness of his  position." The Peruvian ruler added that he will support  President Gaviria's aspiration to occupy the OAS post, if he  decides to run, and that he will do so "not only because of our  friendship, but because I believe he is a good candidate for the  job."    Although journalists were forewarned that only the visiting  head of state would answer questions, Gaviria attended the same  news conference. A few hours earlier, however, Gaviria had  indicated he would make a decision about his eventual candidacy  for OAS secretary general in the next few days.    Colombian Foreign Affairs Minister Noemi Sanin on 14  February  told the media that if the election for OAS secretary general  were held today, Gaviria would win. Regarding Sanin's comments,  the Colombian ruler, whose term ends on 7 August, said: "I hope  she is right." He added: "In any event, we have to wait and  see."    President Gaviria said that he is going to "evaluate all  opinions and requests from friendly countries before making a  decision" about running. He said that he is very thankful  nonetheless for "President Fujimori's advance support" for his  eventual [as received] candidacy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Franz Schoenhuber editorial: "Why Vote for the </F> Republikaner?"]    [Text] I think that the German heraldic beast, the federal  eagle, has lame wings. It has a left wing that is excitedly  fluttering, an inflated belly, and a limply drooping right wing.  This right wing must be strengthened again. Germany needs a  democratically legitimated rightist party. This is us, the  Republikaner. We understand ourselves as the party of social  patriotism. We categorically reject any hoorah patriotism,  which has not learned anything from history.    When we demand that German identity must be preserved, this  must not -- as the media constantly try to do -- be interpreted  as xenophobia. But we do not want to become strangers in our  own country.    We also understand ourselves as the party of law and order.  We do not want Germany to be liberalized to death. The  increasing moral decay must be counteracted. Young people must  be reminded of their responsibility toward their own people and  toward the older generation. The pact between the generations  has been virtually broken.    People should not be guided by personal or group egotism but  by the sense of responsibility toward a state, which, however,  must not limit its citizens' democratic room for maneuver and  must guarantee liberal basic rights.</p>

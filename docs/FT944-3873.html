			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Outdoors: A classic of British know-how - Motoring Why have four-wheel drive? Quite simply, to maximise traction. Normally, drivers exploit it to keep going across country - as I did in the Range Rovers I enthused about here two weeks ago - or when the tarmac disappears beneath snow and ice. But four-wheel drive also has a calming effect on high-performance cars. It makes fierce acceleration usable for fast, safe overtaking without risking loss of grip. On-road 4x4 cars are always well balanced and never feel as though they want to bite the hand that steers them. In the past few weeks, I have sampled three of them, all quite different. Two were Audi quattros: the A8 and Avant RS2. The third was the daddy of them all, the Jensen FF. Many people are unaware that Audi's turbo-charged quattro coupe of 1980 was not the first on-road 4x4. Jensen got there first in 1966. This small West Bromwich firm built 320 FFs between 1966 and 1971, plus larger numbers of the rear-wheel driven Interceptor on which the FF 4x4 was based. It was a great car but, sadly, not a commercial success; Jensen went bust in 1975. The benefits of all-wheel drive for road-going cars, along with anti-lock brakes - the FF pioneered those, too - were not appreciated widely at the time. Even if they had been, few could have afforded one. In 1967, the FF cost Pounds 5,339 - roughly as much as a Rolls-Royce. An Interceptor was only Pounds 3,742. Typical FF owners were aristocrats, showbiz people and professional golfers on a winning streak. Their Pounds 5,339 bought a beefy but elegant two-door, four-seater with a massive 6,276cc Chrysler V8 engine producing around 330 horsepower. All four wheels were driven permanently through Ferguson Formula (hence the FF) transmission and a three-speed automatic gearbox. The disc brakes incorporated Dunlop's Maxaret anti-lock system, used until then only on aircraft. The FFs were 20 years ahead of their time, and many survive. (In contrast to some of the rubbishy cars called classics nowadays merely because they are old, FFs really are classics worth saving.) You could call the Interceptor and FF barrel-chested cars. They look like identical twins, although the FF is a little longer and heavier. I found it to be sprung far more firmly than an Interceptor, while its agility made it very light on its feet. It was no less effortless to drive. The transmission shifted smoothly and the steering was amply power-assisted. Even by today's standards, it was extremely muscular, yet its manners were courtly. Inevitably, the 34-year-old FF showed its age in some respects. Compared with its 1994 equivalent, the Audi A8 quattro, which I had driven to Shepperton, its shallow windscreen made it seem beetle-browed. The minor controls were less ergonomic, the interior not so spacious. It seemed a broadsword of a car to the Audi's rapier but, in general, carried its years lightly. Audi claims a top speed of 163mph (262kph) and 0-62mph (0-100kph) acceleration in 5.4 seconds for the Avant RS2. I believe them. Having driven it for a week in the real world, not on a race track, what impressed me was the silkiness of the close-ratio, six-speed gearbox, complete lack of temperament in town, bullet-like acceleration and unbreakable tyre grip. Less agreeable was the harsh ride, aggravated by hard seats. Fuel consumption averaged 20-21mpg (14.1-13.4 l/100km).</p>

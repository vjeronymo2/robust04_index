			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview, under the rubric "Topical Interview," with Umud </F> Umudovich Melikov, director of the Baku Asbestos Cement and  Ceramic Items Combine, conducted by P. Leonov; date and place  not given]    [Text] The director of the Baku Asbestos Cement and  Ceramic Items Combine, U. Melikov, answers the questions of the  BAKINSKIY RABOCHIY correspondent.    [Leonov] Everyone needs the output which you produce, I dare  say: state and cooperative organizations, joint enterprises, and  individual citizens. Slate, Dutch tile, ceramic tile, and  sanitary equipment are necessary for construction, repair, and  everyday life. So why is it that we never have enough of them in  our country, and how do things stand now?    [Melikov] Even in the best times the republic supplied  itself  with only 30-40 percent of these materials and the rest of the  output had to be obtained outside its borders. Even though our  combine's capacity, according to accepted standards, is fairly  large and it used to increase every year. But the disruption of  inter-enterprise regional ties threatened the combine's very  existence. The unified national economic complex which was  formed in the past had its indisputable pluses and its enormous  minuses. The administrative system could not handle the problems  of long distance hauling, dependence on suppliers from other  cities, and the marketing of finished items. In accordance with  the program worked out at the top, our enterprise received  almost all its raw and processed materials from outside. And  those materials included up to 70 types of raw materials,  industrial cloth strainers for manufacturing slate, and spare  parts. This practice hampered initiative in local areas, created  feelings of dependence, and hindered the search for and  development of deposits of various types of raw materials right  in our republic, which is rich in various kinds of natural  resources. Now all this has also had a very negative effect on  production. Judge for yourselves how nepheline is obtained in  the city of Apatity, which is on the Barents Sea, and asbestos  in the Urals and in the Kazakh city of Dzhezgazgan, firebrick in  the Donbass, and ceramic paints in Voronezh! That is the  reason for the disruptions in the combine's work, the forced  downtime, and the drop in production of output. Now, for  example, the slate shop is idle. We are trying to rectify the  situation and reduce the enterprise's dependence on imported raw  materials. Along with the sectorial concern and the Building  Materials Institute, we are seeking particular types of raw  materials in Azerbaijan and organizing their extraction and  delivery. We have organized a cooperative engaged in working a  local deposit of perlite; in Shamkirskiy Rayon and on the  Sumgayytchay River we are creating production sections for  exploiting deposits of clay. The quality of the clay, as it  happens, is altogether suitable for producing superior Dutch and  ceramic tiles. This will reduce the pressure for supplying clay  from outside. There are also experiments underway on local  quartz sand, deposits of which used to be ignored. Dzhebrailskiy  Rayon will be completely liberated from the aggressor, and from  there we will be able to obtain volcanic ash used to manufacture  ceramic tiles. We have also adapted to the use of Karadagskiy  cement, instead of cement from Volgograd. Work in this direction  will be continued with increasing intensity. But even so, for  now and in the foreseeable future the combine will be unable to  operate successfully without close cooperation with partners  from other republics of the former USSR. However, considerable  difficulties of an objective and subjective nature put us on  guard here.    [Leonov] Most likely, first questions of mutual accounts  with  suppliers and customers, questions of payments. A lingering,  serious illness common to many people!    [Melikov] Within the republic, in the manat zone the  situation with payments is relatively favorable. Overall banks  are duly handling the transfer of money. True, sometimes, and  not so very rarely, there are delays. For example, money takes  half a month or even more to get from Salyany to Baku. At times  one gets the impression that the banks hold back the capital for  their own commercial transactions, since loaning it out and  charging interest is profitable. We do not have Russian rubles,  so we use barter in relations with suppliers from the CIS  countries. We settle accounts with our own finished output as  well, especially sanitary equipment and other items produced in  Azerbaijan which enjoy stable demand. But today it is very  difficult to cooperate with suppliers, Russian, Ukrainian,  Kazakh, Central Asian, and Georgian. The world has a golden  rule: everything that is not forbidden is permitted. In our  country, with almost every step of economic activity, we  encounter all kinds of obstacles, bureaucratic barriers and red  tape, acutely painful formalism, innumerable derivative legal  enactments, and arbitrary instructions and circulars. Any  transaction has to be reconciled with higher levels, even the  Cabinet of Ministers, and permission must be obtained from them.    As a result, valuable time is lost, you must endure damages,  and you may lose the supplier or the client. We reached  agreement with our colleagues from Georgia that they would give  us 26 railroad carloads of raw materials, perlite, and in  exchange we would give them 9 carloads of our own output, slate.  Our neighbors efficiently fulfilled their obligation. After a  long ordeal, we managed to ship out only two carloads of slate.  The documents for the other cars are wandering from office to  office and the authorities are in no hurry to give the "go  ahead." Lost days also mean lost money and additional troubles:  we have to conclude the contract all over again, because of  higher prices.    Business ties with producers from the near abroad are  complicated by the overly suspicious customs service. Customs by  no means wanted to allow in the ceramic balls which are used in  the technological process and came to us from Russia. We had to  spend a long time proving that these balls were not suitable for  other purposes.    I have been in Turkey and Czechia more than once, and, I  must  confess, I have watched with envy how quickly and freely,  without bureaucrats' intervention, major deals are concluded  there, financial transactions are conducted, and the transport  of freight within the state and hundreds or thousands of  kilometers from it is carried out.    [Leonov] Umud Umudovich, this is not the first year that as  an administrator with a respectable record and an experienced  specialist, you have headed an asbestos cement and ceramic items  combine, for before this you managed the Karadagskiy Cement  Plant, the Baku Glass Plant, and the Baku Building Materials  Combine. Tell us what, in your opinion, must be done so that  domestic sanitary equipment and our output earmarked for  construction and domestic needs will meet world standards and be  competitive on the international market. For it is no secret  that local items suffer badly in comparison with those foreign  models which are now sold in commercial stores at exorbitant  prices.    [Melikov] In terms of price, our items are on the average  one-tenth as expensive, but outwardly they are at a disadvantage  in most cases. A number of things are to blame for that. I dare  to reassure you that the thousand-member collective of our  combine is very skilled and people are able and try to produce  contemporary, high quality output and raise production volumes.  But the forced stoppages of technological lines have a  by-no-means good effect on their work. As I already said, our  slate shop has been down for a week because there is no  asbestos, which comes from the Urals. We have the very same  unfortunate problem with payments! Problems of supplying raw and  processed materials take up too much time and energy. We managed  to get several carloads of hardware for sanitary-porcelain items  from outside, and we were lucky: we have enough of it for 2  years. Gypsum delivered from Samara allows us to manufacture  better quality output. Under the present particular conditions,  it is fairly difficult to procure good paints, which is what the  quality of Dutch tiles largely depends upon.    A substantial part of our equipment has become obsolete, and  that includes equipment bought at one time in Italy and Germany;  that also affects quality. You cannot get spare parts from the  far abroad now. We are resourceful and make do with our own  efforts and hire Baku machine building plants. Units for  producing asbestos cement sewer pipes were installed at the  combine back in the 1940s. There is a great need for these  pipes, but we have had to shut down production. The equipment  was so worn out that it did not meet the elementary norms of  equipment safety. And, besides, it is intolerable to use  primitive "sledge hammer" technology in our time! The maximum  diameter of the asbestos cement pipes produced on this line  equaled 1 meter 200 centimeters, while these days Italy is  manufacturing equipment intended to produce pipes up to 3 meters  in diameter. We spend 48 hours to fire each batch of porcelain  items in the kilns. These kilns belong to the past, since in  enterprises similar to ours abroad there are kilns where firing  lasts not 48 hours but 24 or even 12 hours.    We do not have the hard currency to acquire the latest  foreign equipment, but we hope in the future to sign a mutually  advantageous agreement with foreign firms which are managing  construction of prestigious projects in Azerbaijan. Is it  reasonable for them to bring Dutch and ceramic tiles and  sanitary equipment from afar if they can get them at our combine  equipped, with their help, with contemporary, high technology  lines?!    But even so, despite the difficulties already named, the  collective is managing to raise the quality of our output. We  are manufacturing pretty two-tone Dutch tiles and various kinds  of attractive designs are being added to the surface of the  tiles at the decal section. "Tyulpan" [tulip] basins for  bathrooms done in light blue, pink, and other colors come off  the conveyor. We have also changed over to producing more  convenient models of other sanitary equipment. The enterprise's  chief engineer, Meymat Guseynov, and the laboratory chief, Tagir  Gadzhiyev, set the tone in the work to refine production and  incorporate new models. Incidentally, last year by common  efforts we managed to produce many more improved  sanitary-porcelain items than was planned.    [Leonov] It has become a common and unfortunate occurrence  that skilled workers leave state enterprises, which are in  turmoil, to go to all kinds of commercial structures where  earnings are higher and more reliable. Tell us, please, how  could you avoid the exodus of cadres and preserve the main  backbone of specialists?    [Melikov] I would like to have seen the results of the last  year more impressive, but we kept profitability at the level of  15 percent and obtained pure profit of 411 million rubles. The  average monthly earnings in January of this year reached 8,000  manats. As before we continue to handle housing construction for  our employees. Last year a 10-story housing block with 100  apartments was occupied, and in the first quarter of this year  another residential building with 50 apartments will be ready.  It has been decided to build a third building in shares with  Glavbakstroy [Main Construction Administration of Baku]. We  supply our own people with agricultural products at reduced  prices, subsidize the cost of lunches in the enterprise's  cafeteria, and opened a shop to bake bread on the combine's  territory. Special attention is lavished on the families of our  industrial workers who with weapons in their hands protect our  native land.    And overall people treasure their own enterprise to which  they are closely linked.    I think that all these factors certainly serve as a response  to the question posed.</p>

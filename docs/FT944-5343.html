			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: The pick of the publishing year - From politics to poetry, history to humour - our writers choose the best books of 1994 Biography and autobiography usually bring their subjects before us in striking dress, to prompt our curiosity the more. But if you would meet them naked, inspect their personal mail. Pirandello's Love Letters to Marta Abba (Princeton, Pounds 24.95) reveal to us the Italian playwright in the last decade of his life, passionately in love with a young actress, baring to her the feebleness, frailty, cupidity and egoism that underlie creative life. They also give us oblique and sometimes shocking glimpses of a world sliding into madness. Nicolaas Rupke's biography of Richard Owen - the man who coined the term 'dinosaur', meaning 'terrible lizard', and who was second only to Darwin among nineteenth century naturalists - is riveting (Yale University Press, Pounds 35). In relating bitter Victorian debates Rupke shows how science affected great social and religious questions still urgently relevant today. One of the year's most original and outstanding books is Theodore Zeldin's An Intimate History of Humanity (Sinclair-Stevenson, Pounds 20). In each of a variety of personal stories Zeldin finds the ends of threads that lead him into fascinating labyrinths of history and human experience, which he perceptively, insructively and absorbingly explores. This is a read to relish.</p>

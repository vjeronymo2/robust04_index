			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: RADIO  </P> <P> Geoff Edwards, the affable host of television's "Big Spin," was due back on  radio Wednesday night to fill in for Tom Snyder on Snyder's ABC call-in show.  In a telephone interview earlier in the day, Edwards said he has weathered the  storm that two months ago led to his resigning as a KFI talk show host. Edwards  objected to the station's promotion of fellow talk show host Tom Leykis' plan  to destroy Cat Stevens' recordings as a protest against the singer's  endorsement of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death threat against Salman  Rushdie. Edwards has received about 500 letters in support of his position, and  says, "If I had to do it all over again, I'd do exactly the same thing." ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

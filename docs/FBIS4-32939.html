			<p>BFN     [Text] Madrid, 31 May (AFP) -- In an interview published in  the June edition of Spain's ELLE magazine, Cuban President Fidel  Castro talks about his life, his struggles, the current problems  his country is going through, U.S. President Bill Clinton,  machismo, and harassment against gays in Cuba.    In an interview entitled "The Last Revolutionary," Castro  emphasizes that he has had a "fascinating" life and denies that  he wants to retire. "It is not my fault that I have not died  yet, or that the CIA (U.S. intelligence service) has not been  able to kill me. I am a revolutionary, and revolutionaries do  not retire, just as writers do not retire," Castro says. He  adds, however, "no one is indispensable, and I am in need of  rest."    The Cuban leader denies he is concerned about the place he  will be assigned by history. "Personally, I am not concerned  about myself. All of the world's glory can fit into a single  kernel of corn," he points out. Castro adds that it is more  important to worry "about what happens in terms of ideas than  about what happens to individuals."    After 35 years in power, Castro indicated to ELLE that he  has  "the same spirit" he had 48 years ago, when at age 19 he began  his struggle. "I believe that if I started my life over again,  I would do everything exactly the same," he insists.    With respect to what will become of Cuba after his death,  Castro replies, "The CIA should be asked that question."  Nevertheless, he adds: "Honestly, I do not believe anything  will happen. The government will adapt to the situation. We  have all of the necessary political and legal instruments set up  for it to continue the way it is going."    When asked about his opinion of Clinton, Castro says his  opinion on the U.S. President is "positive, but that if he says  something good about him, some officials in the administration  will complain because he has enemies who whine that he is too  soft on Castro. If I say something bad, then the situation will  be worse. So I better not say anything."    Castro says he would be delighted to see Ted Turner, the  head  of CNN network, become president of the United States. Turner,  according to his biographer, considers Fidel one of the two  great influences of his life. "Ted enjoys life and beauty. I  would relish seeing him become president of the United States,  although I should not say this because then he will never get  elected."    When asked by the reporter -- who wrote that Cubans are  "puritans" and that "the rule is that no one asks Castro about  his private life" -- Castro acknowledges that he has "less than  a dozen children." He says there not enough to be considered a  "tribe."    With regard to homosexuals, Castro stresses, "Revolutionary  homophobia is a simple extension of Latin American machismo."  Nevertheless, he adds that "he has never shared this feeling."    According to the reporter, the Cuban leader "turned pale"  when asked if his brother was behind the work camps for  homosexuals. It is said that Raul Castro was impressed with how  Bulgaria had handled the undesirables (homosexuals) issue.  "This is false," Castro says, roused to indignation.    The magazine also reminisces on the Cuban president's "great  admiration for feminine adroitness and fortitude." During his  years in the Sierra Madre, the revolution's crack troops were  comprised women only because they "are better soldiers" than  men, Castro points out.    The interview concludes with Castro's rowdy laughter to a  joke by the ELLE reporter. "What are the Cuban Revolution's  accomplishments? [no closing quotation marks as received]  Education, health, and sports. And the revolution's failings?  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Anyway, Castro replies that "to  eat too much is bad for one's health."</p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASKETBALL ROUNDUP  </P> <P> San Pedro 59, Banning 52 -- Forward Willie Sanchez, playing what Coach Jack  Kordich called his "best game," scored 32 points and pulled down 10 rebounds to  lead the Pirates to a Pacific League victory at home.  </P> <P> San Pedro led by 18 points in the third quarter as it evened its record at 3-3  in league play and 8-8 overall. Banning, which could get no closer than three  points late in the game, fell to 1-5 and 8-11.  </P> <P> Redondo 71, South Torrance 52 -- Mike Houck, Dave Dinnel and Kevin O'Brien each  scored 15 points to lead a balanced attack for the Sea Hawks, who stayed one  game off the pace in the Ocean League with an easy win at Redondo.  </P> <P> The Sea Hawks (7-1, 14-5) will play at first-place Morningside on Friday night.  South, which got a game-high 16 points from forward Lance Holmes, slipped to  0-8 and 3-14.  </P> <P> Dorsey 78, Gardena 72 -- Despite a game-high 24 points from senior guard Darryl  McMillan, the Mohicans dropped deeper into last place in the Southern League  with a loss at home. Gardena fell to 2-4 in league play, two games behind  Dorsey and Washington (both 4-2), and faces an uphill fight to make the L.A.  City 4-A playoffs. Crenshaw leads the standings with a 6-0 mark.  </P> <P> Dorsey led virtually the entire way, taking a 54-45 lead into the fourth  quarter. Darnell Hampton paced the Dons with 21 points.  </P> <P> Gardena (11-8 overall) got seven assists from leading scorer McMillan and 17  points from forward Kevin Sanders. The Mohicans resume league play Friday at  Crenshaw.  </P> <P> Carson 74, Narbonne 58 -- Suffering from a letdown after an emotional win over  rival Banning last Friday, the Colts still had more than enough to put away the  lowly Gauchos in a Pacific League game at Narbonne.  </P> <P> "The one highlight was our free-throw shooting," said Carson Coach Rich Masson,  whose team made 28 of 33 foul shots. Center Vince Washington had 13 points for  the first-place Colts, who improved to 4-2 in league play and 10-7 overall.  </P> <P> Narbonne stayed in the Pacific cellar at 0-6 and fell to 2-13 overall.  </P> <P> Rolling Hills 79, Beverly Hills 68 -- John Hardy's basket with 4:07 remaining  put the Titans ahead for good and enabled them to hold on to sole possession of  first place in the Bay League with an 8-0 record.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills (4-4 in league and 10-7 overall) had taken a 64-63 lead with five  minutes left on center Michael Moore's jumper, but Rolling Hills (17-3) roared  back with eight unanswered points. Following Hardy's basket, guard Steve Clover  sank a 3-pointer and was fouled. He made the free throw and the Titans led by  five.  </P> <P> Hardy, who finished with a game-high 36 points, and Clover, who contributed 19,  scored all but six of Rolling Hills' points in the second half.  </P> <P> Moore paced Beverly Hills with 23.  </P> <P> Morningside 79, North Torrance 52 -- It was business as usual for the Monarchs,  who parlayed another strong defensive effort and a balanced scoring attack into  their eighth Ocean League win without a loss at North.  </P> <P> Forward Eddie Scott scored 19 points and swingman Jon Madison added 18 for  Morningside (14-4 overall), which led by at least 15 points throughout the  second half. Guard Kenny Jones had six steals. TIM DERMODY  </P></p>

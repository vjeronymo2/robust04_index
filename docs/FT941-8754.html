			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Major and Reynolds to hold meeting before international game Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, prime minister of the Irish Republic, will hold only a short meeting before tomorrow's rugby international at Twickenham in London and expect to issue no formal statement. This emerged last night in a letter sent by the prime minister to the Rev Ian Paisley in response to the Democratic Unionist party leader's request for a meeting before the Irish leader's visit. The meeting between Mr Major and Mr Reynolds - which comes just a week before Sinn Fein's party conference - has been billed as a bid to restore a common front to efforts to find a political settlement in Northern Ireland. Mr Paisley said he now hoped to meet Mr Major 'possibly next week'. Mr Major had asked him meanwhile to write to him with any specific points he wished to raise before Mr Reynolds's arrival. Downing Street confirmed last night that the prime minister would be happy to see the DUP leader. His list of engagements had made it impossible to arrange a meeting at the time requested. The DUP leader - whose party is boycotting the political talks co-ordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister - said the first thing he wanted to talk to Mr Major about was the increase in violence. His comments came as Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, claimed in the Commons that loyalists had carried out 18 attacks on SDLP party members in recent months.</p>

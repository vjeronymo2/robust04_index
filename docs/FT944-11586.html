			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / NUT seeks talks to avoid continued tests boycott The National Union of Teachers said yesterday that it would continue its boycott of national curriculum tests in England and Wales for a third year. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary, said a survey revealed strong opposition to the measures announced in September by Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary. But he asked for talks with Mrs Shephard to end the boycott. All three of the main teachers' unions refused to oversee tests for 14-year-olds when they were introduced in 1993. The NUT was the only union to continue its action earlier this year. The survey, which covered NUT members in schools which must administer the tests, found that 84.4 per cent of respondents disagreed with Mrs Shephard's claim that the tests would 'reinforce teachers' professionalism'. More than 90 per cent rejected her package of improvements, which included allowing for tests to be administered by external markers, saying it had not met their central concerns. The NUT found strong opposition to the use of test results for publishing 'league tables' of schools' performance. Turn-outs among members affected was 25.4 per cent. Mr McAvoy made it clear that he hoped to end the boycott after talking to Mrs Shephard. He said: 'She has a political imperative and we have an educational imperative. It might be possible to get the two together.' Other teachers' unions doubted whether the NUT's stance could withstand a legal challenge. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers will next week advise its members that they can continue to boycott statutory assessments linked to the curriculum only if they create 'unreasonable' workloads. It advised teachers that this would increase the risk of action from employers, including withholding salaries. It wants members to administer the tests and report their results, and says boycotting them for educational reasons alone would be illegal.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Bryant &amp; May agrees to freeze match prices BRYANT &amp; MAY, the UK match manufacturer, has agreed to freeze the prices of its branded matches until the end of next year, after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found it had abused its dominant position in the UK market to make excess profits. Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said yesterday he had accepted statutory undertakings from Bryant &amp; May to hold prices for branded matches  -including Swan Vesta and Cooks Household brands - at the level which applied on April 1 last year. The company has also agreed to change its trading agreements to eliminate discounts, exclusive promotion and sales, and minimum stocking clauses applying to matches (whether branded or own label), disposable lighters and other smokers' requisites. Bryant &amp; May is part of Swedish Match, the Stockholm-based conglomerate recently provisionally acquired by Procordia, the Swedish food and pharmaceutical group. Its sale to Swedish Match in 1987 won approval by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.</p>

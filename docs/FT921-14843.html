			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Revamp at Gerber Products GERBER Products, the US baby foods group, is revamping part of its clothing manufacturing operations which will result in an after-tax charge to its fiscal 1992 earnings of about Dollars 16m, or 43 cents a share, Reuter reports. Certain operations will shut down, resulting in the loss of about 900 jobs. This will include the closure of the diaper weaving operations and consolidation of other basic textile production capabilities in order to increase overall productivity. Mr Al Piergallini Gerber, chairman, said the company was taking the action to improve long-term profitability. He added that there was a dramatic change this year in the cloth diaper market. This was caused by reduced environmental concerns about disposable diapers which significantly cut demand for cloth diapers. In addition, low cost, foreign-sourced cloth diapers captured the institutional market, he said. Mr Piergallini said the company could not effectively compete in the cloth diaper market with its high fixed-cost, vertically-integrated US manufacturing base. 'We intend to remain in the diaper business, but in a competitive, flexible manner,' he added. He said the margin improvement from this action would enhance future earnings and cash flows. He also said Gerber's disappointing diaper business results were already reflected in securities analysts' consensus estimates for Gerber's fiscal 1992 year - excluding the restructuring charge. Analysts estimate that Gerber's fiscal 1992 earnings will be in a range of Dollars 3.74 to Dollars 3.95 a share. For the year to end-March 1991, earnings were Dollars 3 a share.</p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES ETHICS BILL  </P> <P> In The Times, Council President John Ferraro "quietly" proposed a pay increase  of $24,635 for the council members, a salary increase of $41,000-plus for the  mayor and for the city attorney, an increase of $35,925 (Jan. 19).  </P> <P> Do these egotistical politicians actually feel they are worth this increase?  The article states, "The Council tinkered with the idea of the right of city  officials to accept gifts of ballpoint pens, candy, calendars and mementos."  Now there's a thought-provoking subject for further study!  </P> <P> I wonder how many homeless could be provided with food and shelter for this  amount?  </P> <P> How many elderly, poor and needy could be provided with health care?  </P> <P> MRS. LLOYD P. SAUL  </P> <P> Yucaipa  </P></p>

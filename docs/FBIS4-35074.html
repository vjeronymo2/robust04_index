			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "NTV" newscast] </F>   [Text] The second Caribbean Businessmen's Meeting has  concluded in Santiago de Cuba in an effort to link regional  trade and the world. All day long, the 250 participants,  including 115 foreigners, held bilateral meetings which resulted  in broad cooperation prospects. This is how Mauricio Martin  described the goal of these meetings:    [Begin Martin recording] The idea is for the Caribbean  Businessmen's Meeting to become a meeting of Caribbean  businessmen for trade with the world, not only with Cuba. [end  recording]    According to Martin, manager of Lafitel Enterprise, his  enterprise has already attained this.    [Begin Martin recording] Yes, I believe so. We have already  seen the interest of certain companies. Our goal is of course to  expand to the Caribbean, either in terms of exports to the  Caribbean or associations with Caribbean companies to modestly  fill a niche in the Caribbean market and also to contribute our  grain of sand to Caribbean integration. [end recording]    The meetings were held behind closed doors. Everyone's goal  is to take advantage of integration conditions and mutual trade.  As this meeting ended, the Expocaribe-94 Fair began promptly at  1800. Several countries and dozens of companies are  participating. This guarantees the success of a fair that  promises to be better than the previous ones.</p>

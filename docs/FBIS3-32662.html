PRD Deputy  Roberto Robles Garnica rejected the possibility that the rebels,  who rose up in arms in Chiapas in southeastern Mexico, will  participate in the presidential elections to be held on 21  August 1994.    The deputy said he was pleased that a peasant movement had  arisen in Chiapas because they are expressing what peasants  throughout the country have been demanding for decades. He  underscored that the armed conflict has made a significant  change in Mexican politics.    Robles also stated that it has been said that the EZLN is  only fighting for four small zones but that this is an attempt  to oversimplify events, as it has been proven that their demands  are the ones of all poor Indians and peasants.    Despite this, he insisted, it will be difficult for the EZLN  to participate in the next federal elections, "because if they  become a party it would a local one." However, Robles Garnica  admitted that the Zapatist rebels could support one of the  presidential candidates. He said, however, that he did not care  to comment on how they could go about entering politics.</p>

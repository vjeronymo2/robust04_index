			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Vodafone Heady growth in the UK mobile market is finally exacting a price from Vodafone. In the dash to sign on record numbers of customers in the six months to end-September, administrative procedures became overstretched with the result that fraud and bad debts shot up. The sums involved - roughly 1 per cent of turnover - are not huge. But the episode rams home the point that the quality of Vodafone's customer base is deteriorating as the market expands. This is also seen in the sharp increase in the company's annual 'churn' rate - the proportion of customers who leave - from 21.5 per cent to 26.5 per cent. Churn will now fall as procedures for signing up new customers are tightened but, in return, Vodafone will have to sacrifice some market share. In future, much of group growth will come from investment overseas. But, as yesterday's Pta89bn bid by Vodafone's consortium for a Spanish cellular licence shows, such expansion will not come cheap. Meanwhile, the UK business remains vulnerable in the medium term to price cutting. So far, Vodafone has managed to maintain prices despite the arrival of new entrants offering large discounts. But once the new networks achieve nationwide coverage, Vodafone will be under pressure to match their offers. Even if a value of Pounds 1bn is put on the group's international operations and its overseas losses are stripped out, Vodafone's shares still trade at a healthy premium to market. That looks unjustified.</p>

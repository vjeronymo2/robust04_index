The proposals mark the first reorganisation moves since three former Securiguard executives took over the management of BTG in October and follows a review of the group's activities. The company is paying up to Pounds 1.13m for Automatic Business Communications, a London photocopier and facsimile machine supplier. In the year to September 30 1992 ABC's service revenue was Pounds 1.04m. The consideration is made up of an initial Pounds 500,000 cash plus 1.25m shares and a maximum profit-related payment of Pounds 200,000 in cash or loan notes and Pounds 250,000 for stock. The company is placing 28.3m shares at 12 3/4 p with an open offer to existing shareholders on a 4-for-7 basis. The proceeds will be used to fund the cash part of the purchase, and provide working capital. Mr Alan Baldwin, chairman, said the review indicated a need for additional capital. BTG is also pulling out of the vending equipment market with the disposal of Ultimate Vending Systems.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Lawyer to probe union ballot The CPSA civil servants' union is to appoint an independent lawyer to investigate balloting irregularities that have forced a Pounds 100,000 repeat of its presidential election. A re-run of the vote among the union's 131,000 members was ordered by the High Court when Mr Alan England, a defence ministry branch official in Harrogate, challenged his omission from the list of candidates in the ballot. Mr England discovered that his name had been obliterated with typewriter correction fluid from presidential nomination forms. The CPSA leadership said yesterday it was concerned about the circumstances in which Mr England, who had been a member of the union for five months, had earlier sought executive office in the NUCPS higher-grade civil servants' union. Membership of more than one union is allowed under recent employment legislation. Both unions said Mr England had described himself in an NUCPS national executive ballot as a member of a black racial group. The union's rules allow for the election of black members with a much lower number of votes than those for other candidates.</p>

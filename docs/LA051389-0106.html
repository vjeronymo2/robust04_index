			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND TV;  </P> <P> IT'S TIME FOR FINAL BOWS ON 'FAMILY TIES,' 'MOONLIGHTING,' 'WAR AND  REMEMBRANCE'  </P> <P> Curtain calls galore highlight Sunday night's TV schedule as two trend-setting  series and the longest and most expensive miniseries of all time take their  final bows.  </P> <P> NBC's "Family Ties" unravels in a special 70-minute episode beginning at 8 p.m.  Sunday (4)(36)(39) as Alex (Michael J. Fox) finally leaves home for a  high-powered job on Wall Street after seven seasons of wisecracks and tears in  the Keatons' Columbus, Ohio, kitchen. The final show includes a curtain call  featuring hugs and goodbys from the entire cast. As a preview to the end, KTTV  Channel 11 will air the very first episode of the series Sunday at 6 p.m.  </P> <P> In a less ballyhooed finale, the once-proud cast of "Moonlighting," plagued  this season by dismal ratings, will also bid farewell Sunday at 8 p.m.  (7)(3)(10)(42). The razor-tongued Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd, once the  daring darlings of television, star for the last time.  </P> <P> And with the death of F.D.R., Hitler's suicide and the collapse of the Third  Reich, the 29 1/2-hour saga of the Henry family, "War and Remembrance," draws  to a climactic conclusion Sunday at 9 p.m. on ABC (7)(3)(10)(42).  </P> <P> For those with an eye toward current history, Cable News Network will offer  live coverage of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit to China  beginning Sunday at 2 p.m. STEVE WEINSTEIN  </P></p>

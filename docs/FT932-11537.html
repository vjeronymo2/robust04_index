			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Bottomley announces cut in grant for Aids charities CUTS IN government funding to two leading Aids charities and a more targeted policy towards the disease were announced by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, yesterday. The decisions reflect a government view that a once-predicted heterosexual epidemic of HIV, the virus causing Aids, had not materialised and Aids should take its place alongside other competing health priorities. Future health education programmes will target high-risk groups such as homosexual men and drug abusers. Mrs Bottomley said on BBC Radio that the government's Aids strategy had been 'extremely successful and effective'. Britain had a lower prevalence than other countries because it had taken Aids seriously from an early stage. Aids now had to be seen alongside other conditions such as mental illness, cancer and heart disease, she said. 'Now that the infrastructure is in place we do not need to give it the kind of pump-priming priority as when it was a new and strange disease.' She said that the Terence Higgins Trust, which provides advice and support about Aids, and the London Lighthouse residential centre did not require so much central funding. Both organisations' grants would be reduced in stages from Pounds 450,000 to Pounds 150,000. Some Aids organisations see the government's actions as motivated by pressure for public expenditure savings. More than Pounds 886m has been spent on Aids funding since 1986. Dr Les Rudd, director of the National Aids Trust, said: 'In the current Treasury spending cuts, ministers seem to think Aids is a soft target.' He said time should be allowed for consideration of Public Health Laboratory Service figures, due to be published later this month, with which ministers are expected to justify the policy of targeting high-risk groups. 'If these figures justify a dramatic change in policy, they should be published before that change in strategy is announced,' he said.</p>

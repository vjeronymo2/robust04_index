			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (3): Is your journey necessary? - Gillian Upton explains how companies are trying to reduce costs EVEN BEFORE the Gulf War and the onset of the recession, companies had started to turn the spotlight on travel costs. Airlines had already been witnessing a downtrading from first-class to business class, for example. 'People are using the recession as an excuse,' claims Mr Steven Lek, general manager, UK and Ireland, for Singapore Airlines, one of the airlines retaining first-class cabins in the hope of a cyclical upturn. 'And anyway, business class is so good now it's difficult to justify first-class,' he says. Long a poorly tracked item in a company's report and accounts, necessity - in the form of recession - has turned the spotlight even harder on travel expenditure. But three years later, companies have got used to the substantial savings and are now prepared to forgo flexibility and staff demotivation in favour of cheaper tickets. Mr Kevin O'Brien, author of The West European Business Travel Market 1993-97, published by the Financial Times earlier this autumn, believes that the new-found cost-consciousness will not diminish after the recession ends. 'The Gulf War educated the corporate sector as to the amount of non-essential travel expenditure incurred in previous years. 'The 1990s will witness the advent of the responsible, cost-conscious business traveller,' he says. 'Traveller preferences will become less important to the corporate client as the benefits of cost reductions will increasingly outweigh them.' Major corporations have become more stringent in their travel policies for staff or have written a formal travel policy for the first time. However, according to Mr Colin Rainbow, commercial director of pan-European travel agency chain Wagons-lits, there is still a resistance to implementing the policy. 'They're not prepared to grasp the nettle,' says Mr Rainbow. 'It's more for an easy life than anything else although so many companies have cut down on staff levels that they might not have enough staff to police what's going on.' There are, of course, plenty of examples in the UK corporate sector which are exceptions to this. 'One of the things we are looking at more vociferously now is the need to travel, not just costs,' explains Mr Kevin Watts, travel manager of the British Council. 'We will always travel when there's a business need but we are looking at the business need,' he says. The first thrust of the council's strategy is to cut back on domestic travel between its London and Manchester offices by installing a permanent video conference link between the two locations. It was installed only six months ago and it is too soon to track savings, but Mr Watts is convinced that it will 'knock a big dent in our domestic travel cost. Two out of three trips between the two locations could conceivably be handled by video conferencing,' he says. The initial resistance to using the facility was overcome by offering staff social use of it over lunch periods so they could talk to their friends. Attempts to make extra savings on overseas travel are just beginning. The council is now asking whether business class is appropriate on all journeys over two and a half hours, a class of air travel stipulated in the company's travel policy. 'We point out that if they go Economy class instead, they would get more trips out of their travel budget,' says Mr Watts. While he appreciates that the majority of the overseas trips are necessary (trips are generally of around 10 days' duration and involve major projects) he believes that the advent of worldwide video conferencing will change the face of long-haul travel. 'Travelling per se is unproductive,' he says. By contrast, Mr Jim Thomas, head of travel and transport services at the Shell Centre, part of Shell International, believes teleconferencing and video conferencing do not take the place of travel; instead, they augment rather than replace it. 'Electronic communication isn't a good substitute for face to face interviews,' says Mr Thomas. Shell International with an emphasis on staff motivation, has a more liberal policy toward executive travel than the British Council. There has been no downtrading since the recession; it has not been on the agenda. 'It's not an issue,' says Mr Thomas. 'The purpose of the journey is of paramount importance. People are expected to work harder now, so downgrading is not seen as the way to go.' Instead, the company looks to reap benefits from airlines in the form of route rebates. The company's outlay on air tickets is a cool Pounds 12.5m a year and on overseas hotels Pounds 5-6m a year. Such spending can speak volumes around a negotiating table. Anybody who needs to travel still has to get authority to do so and then it will be suggested which airlines to patronise. 'We don't dictate,' says Mr Thomas, 'but we would obviously like the travellers to use the preferred carriers where we can get deals.' The last round of downtrading was undertaken a decade ago when first-class disappeared for all inter-continental flights. Now it is business class, even within Europe, for the company's 2,500 travelling executives. Only some 60 senior staff are eligible to fly first-class.

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Japan and the US at odds WITH THEIR erstwhile common enemy dissolved, industrial countries must build their relationships on a foundation of enlightened self-interest. Unfortunately, they are far from enlightened, though powerfully self-interested. The relationship between the US and Japan established after the second world war looks likely to be the most important casualty. Lawrence Summers, now US undersecretary of the treasury for international affairs, argues that the US has developed a 'comprehensive and integrated approach' to the twin problems of the Japanese current account surplus and the low penetration of manufactured imports. The US will, he says, focus on results. It will also bring high-level pressure to achieve what it wants in semi-annual meetings of the two heads of government. If agreed, the US proposals would define the relationship between the world's two most important economies. If not agreed, they would cause serious conflict. Either way, they are hugely important. The question is whether they also make sense. Mr Summers is right to distinguish the overall Japanese current account surplus from its allegedly low import penetration. More questionable is the suggestion that 'excessive' current account surpluses must be reduced to 1 1/2 per cent of gross national product, in order to create up to 2m jobs in the rest of the world. An economy cannot be forecast precisely enough to make such targeting workable. The analysis is also both too mechanistic and too short run. In the longer term, export by the Japanese of a mere 10 per cent of their gross savings should be welcomed. What could be a more useful outcome of the capital market liberalisation that the US has so long promoted? What the world does need from Japan is a strong recovery and, in the longer term, sustained growth of demand in line with the economy's potential. Mr Summers is right to demand improvement in Japanese macroeconomic policies. The biggest mistakes have been in monetary policy, where the Bank of Japan first allowed a liquidity-driven financial bubble to develop (partly in response to earlier US pressure for economic expansion) and then eased both too late and too little. The second US complaint is about low import penetration. There do remain official impediments to imports. But the main obstacles are, without doubt, Japanese businesses, which believe that they benefit from their long-term relationships, and nationalistic Japanese consumers. To eliminate barriers created by governments is indeed to 'unmanage' trade, as Mr Summers claims. But to force private organisations to buy goods they do not want is to manage it once more. Mr Summers insists the targets would not be for US goods alone. But the goods on which the US focuses are those, like supercomputers, in which it thinks it is competitive. He argues that the aim is to replicate the results of a free market. But nobody knows what those results might be. He argues that the desire is to eliminate distortions in the Japanese economy. But the result is bound to be further management by the ministries. He denies that the quantitative benchmarks will be triggers for 'hair trigger retaliation'. But it is deeply naive to suppose US industry will prove so understanding, as the history of the semi-conductor agreement has demonstrated. The world desperately needs a more enlightened approach. On macroeconomic policy, the best solution would be for Japan to accept continued appreciation of the yen, mitigated, where necessary, by further easing of its monetary and fiscal policies. On imports, the Japanese should propose a binding multilateral procedure, within the Gatt, capable of requiring any member country to change policies that deprive trading partners of the benefits they had reasonably expected from liberalisation. Japan should propose just such a reform, along with agricultural liberalisation, as its contributions to completion of the hapless Uruguay Round. But first it must say no to US demands for managed trade.</p>

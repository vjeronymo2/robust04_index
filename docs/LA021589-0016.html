			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILL ON 'RACIAL SPOILS SYSTEM'  </P> <P> This letter is in response to George Will's column "The Court Reagan Built Does  Much to Roll Back the Racial Spoils System" (Op-Ed Page, Jan. 29).  </P> <P> It is surprising to note how much history a historian can forget. Will's essay  ignores the central issue which led to reverse racial discrimination: A white  male quota system, a white male spoils system, a white male discrimination  system exists and has oppressed, tormented and killed American citizens for  hundreds of years. This system is not legal, but cultural.  </P> <P> Few laws remain on the books to identify it, but it exists and is highly  visible. One simple example is the practice of many elite universities which  give admission preferences to the children of alumni as a separate  consideration in addition to academic qualifications. Such a system promotes  the racial imbalance of the past. A separate guideline to insure a similar  special consideration for ethnic and female applicants must be put in place  while the first guideline continues.  </P> <P> Too many statistics about pay, hiring and promotion practices; too many  incidents of neighborhood racism; too much emphasis on the legalities of racial  and gender quotas belie a subtle and not-so-subtle evil. Will writes that  blacks have gained much, not from changes in government but from changes in our  "free society." Free society? It is dangerously naive to presume and print that  we are all free.  </P> <P> What is Will's solution to the current racism and sexism in our society?  Criticizing one approach is a worthless and mean-spirited endeavor without a  greater effort towards designing and enacting a comprehensive solution.  </P> <P> Mr. Will, lead, follow or get out of the way.  </P> <P> SPENCER TEPPER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

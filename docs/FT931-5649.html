			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Major ends knighthoods on the nod NOMINATING a neighbour for a knighthood could become a new British pastime - and a headache for Whitehall officials - after proposals for reforming the honours system were announced yesterday by Mr John Major. The prime minister's call for candidates for OBEs, Dames or other decorations could provoke a flood of applications to Downing Street. Forms are available on request. A spokesman confirmed last night that there were no plans for the eight-strong staff who administer the honours to be increased, 'except perhaps another typist'. Mr Major told MPs that in future he wanted honours on merit for exceptional achievement or services, 'over and above what normally might be expected' and an end to automatic honours for public servants reaching certain ranks. Class divisions will be removed by phasing out the British Empire Medal, usually for less skilled workers, and awarding instead the Member of the British Empire medal, currently reserved for professionals. In the services, awarding 'crosses' for officers and 'medals' for others will end. Mr Major wants the honours process to be more open, saying: 'It is, at present, too haphazard'. Among those disappointed will be permanent secretaries and lieutenant generals who until now have been given a knighthood on the nod. Hereditary peerages will stop, while automatic awards for High Court judges on appointment will continue. However, along with less-automatic distinctions for journalists, these may end in the future, Mr Major hinted. The armies of volunteer workers, unnoticed public servants and private sector workers outside London who the prime minister wants to reward will be delighted. Relieved Tory MPs were assured that political knighthoods would continue. The four-page nomination form imposes no restrictions on who can nominate whom, warning only that, 'because of the competition for honours it is not fair to raise nominees' expectations in case they are disappointed'. Factual details and other letters of support are requested, if possible, but not if it means breaking confidentiality. About 1,000 honours are awarded in each of the New Year and Queen's Birthday lists. But Britain's predilection for gift offers and audience participation means the number of nominations is likely to be far higher. The FT receives about 1,000 entries for a Saturday prize crossword; a television programme such as the BBC's 'Watchdog' consumer affairs magazine receives 4,000 letters a week. Downing Street appears to have few plans for changing the current system of scrutinising names via selection committees. Final recommendations to the Queen are taken ultimately by the prime minister. Forms are available from The Nominations Unit, Honours Secretariat, 10 Downing Street, London SW1A 2AA. Fax no: 071 210 5046. Closing date for the 1994 New Year's honours list is June 1.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Gavrilenko and Oleg Odnokolenko: </F> "Russian Defense Minister's Trip to Transcaucasus Another Step  Toward Establishing Peace in This `Warring Region'"]    [Text] Commenting on the first results of the trip to the  Transcaucasus by Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian Federation  Defense Minister, which began 8 June, observers are stating that  Russia's military department, particularly of late, is  increasingly having to tackle not just purely military problems  but also political ones. Sometimes this is dictated by the  nature of the situation which has developed on the territory of  the former USSR and Russia's commitments as its successor, and  also, as far as can be surmised, by a definite division of  functions directly within the military structures. Moreover,  the experience of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry's  previous contacts both with the leaders of Transcaucasian states  and the heads of military delegations demonstrates that in a  number of cases dialogue around the negotiating table is  undoubtedly successful for the "diplomats in uniform."    Despite naming the objectives of his visit upon landing at  Yerevan Airport, when Pavel Grachev noted that he had come "in  connection with the start of the summer military training period  which is designed to test the combat effectiveness and condition  of the Russian troops stationed in Armenia," it is clear that  the tasks he will address during his visit are far broader.  This is evidenced by his plans to meet with the region's heads  of state. The dialogue that has already taken place between the  Russian Federation defense minister and Armenian President Levon  Ter-Petroysan has been acknowledged to be fruitful by both  sides. During the talks they discussed issues connected with the  siting of Russian military units on the republic's territory,  and also the possibility of young Armenian performing service in  these units. It is well-known that under the treaty signed by  the heads of both states, a Russian motorized infantry division  is stationed at Gyumri in Armenia and another regiment is  stationed near Yerevan. Army Gen. Grachev spoke highly of  cooperation with Armenia's military department.    During their talks they also discussed the terms for sending  peacemaking forces into the region. This problem will also be  discussed by Army Gen. Grachev at his upcoming meeting in Baku  11 June with Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev. On 10 June  the Russian defense minister flies to Tbilisi, where he intends  to meet with Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze. According to  information from the Abkhazian Ministry of Information and the  Press, Pavel Grachev also plans to meet with Vladislav Ardzinba,  commander in chief of the republic's armed forces, and the  Abkhazian Government; during this meeting he will discuss  deploying peacemaking forces along the Inguri River.</p>

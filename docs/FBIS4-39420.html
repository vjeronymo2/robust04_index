			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS string correspondent Semen Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 7 TASS -- A Cosmos-2,281 satellite was  launched from Plesetsk cosmodrome by a Soyuz-U booster rocket by  Russia's space defence forces at 11.20 moscow time (07.20 GMT)  on Tuesday.    The launch was successful. This was the 415th launch since  December 27, 1971 when the first booster rocket of this type was  lofted into space, Major-General Anatoliy Ovchinnikov, director  of the Plesetsk cosmodrome, told ITAR-TASS. Preparations are  being finalised at the cosmodrome for the launch of a photon  technological spacecraft which is to blast off in one week's  time.    The photon is an automatic laboratory fitted out with a set  of technical facilities to obtain organic and inorganic  materials and substances with improved characteristics in zero  gravity. Specialists from the French national space research  centre take part in the preparations.    In view of the fact that the satellite, which was launched  from Plesetsk on May 25, 1994, failed to reach orbit, its number  was given to the satellite launched today.</p>

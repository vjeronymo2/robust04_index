			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nevertheless, the mechanics of implementing this process with respect to AVS would be complex and would create such uncertainty as to outweigh the benefits. Assuming that NOV's whose abatement period had not yet expired and which had not yet generated FTACO's were loaded onto AVS, OSM would have to check the status of such NOV's and continually update such information on AVS. It is unclear whether OSM would be able to keep up with the changing status of NOV's and incorporate such information in a timely manner into AVS. This would add an additional element of uncertainty with respect to the currency of violation information in AVS. OSM believes it is more desirable to have information in AVS which is both current and reliable, so that State regulatory authorities may depend on the system during the permit application review process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, OSM believes that the decision to retain at least a limited presumption of NOV abatement is consistent with positions taken by the Department of the Interior in previous litigation. In litigation relating to &sect;773.15(b)(1) and related matters before the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia, the Secretary advised the court that he had decided to reconsider the issue of whether, in the absence of an FTACO, the regulatory authority may presume that an NOV has been or is being corrected. The Secretary further advised the court that he would, if appropriate, engage in further rulemaking on the subject as expeditiously as possible. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Wildlife Fed'n <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lujan, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  No. 88&hyph;3117&hyph;AER (D.D.C.), Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of the Federal Defendants' Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment and in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motions for Summary Judgment, at pages 89&hyph;90. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated in the preamble to the proposed rule, the proposed amendment to delete the presumption of NOV abatement represented the ``further rulemaking'' of which the court was advised. However, the Secretary committed only to reconsider the presumption of NOV abatement. The Secretary never committed to finalize any proposed rule. After receiving the States' and industry's comments cited above, OSM has determined that the complete deletion of the presumption would impose a significant burden upon the States and provide little enforcement benefit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated in the preamble to the September, 1991 proposed rule, it was, in fact, never OSM's intention to load NOV's (other than delinquent NOV civil penalties) into the AVS database, given the large volume of data entry that would be required to keep such violation information up to date.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Thus, even if OSM had completely deleted the presumption of NOV abatement by adopting the proposed modification to 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1), there would have been no immediate, direct impact upon the AVS database. If OSM had eliminated the presumption, there would have been, however, a significant indirect impact upon AVS. The States would have been required to spend scarce resources tracking other States' NOV's, including those whose abatement periods had not yet expired, for permit application purposes. The States would have had fewer resources available to focus upon the other information that AVS believes is more critical to the effective implementation of section 510(c) of the Act, including the development of complete information with respect to entities' ownership and control. Further, OSM is committed to making its best effort to provide, through the AVS, a complete list of violations which are required to be used as the basis for a permit block. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, OSM has determined to retain a presumption of NOV abatement in 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). The focus of State regulatory authorities' concern appears to be the uncertainty incident to NOV's with abatement periods which have not yet expired. In substance, where an NOV has been issued and the abatement period has not yet expired, it is uncertain whether the violation will be ultimately abated or will ripen into the basis for the issuance of a failure to abate cessation order. The State regulatory authorities and the coal industry argue that such uncertainty justifies unconditional permit issuance. The environmentalists argue that such uncertainty demands permit denial. While OSM recognizes the needs of the State regulatory authorities, OSM believes that environmental advocates have also asserted legitimate concerns about the consequences of a blanket presumption of abatement for all NOV's. OSM has therefore chosen a middle ground which will serve to reduce the uncertainty while balancing the concerns of the various interests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the comments made to its proposal, OSM has amended 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) to provide that, in the absence of a failure-to-abate cessation order, a regulatory authority may presume that a notice of violation is being corrected to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdiction over the violation where the abatement period for such notice of violation has not yet expired and where the permit applicant has provided certification in his or her permit application that such violation is in the process of being corrected to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdiction over the violation. Where OSM is regulatory authority, OSM will incorporate such certification into the statement of verification currently required in OSM's permit applications. Any permits issued incident to such certification will be conditionally issued based upon successful completion of the necessary abatement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

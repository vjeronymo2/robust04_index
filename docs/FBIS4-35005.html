			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Cleber Praxedes] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- The National Accounting Office (TCU) has  found out that the sale of the state-owned package of majority  shares of public enterprises has caused a price slump,  preventing the government from making a profit through the  possible increase in the value of the shares after the  transaction. The TCU, which made a general evaluation of the  National Privatization Program (PND), advocated a reformulation  of the program.    The devaluation of shares could be avoided through a  parcelled sale of shares over a specific period, PCU member  Bento Bugarin said.    According to the auditors who reviewed the program, only 5.4  percent of all collected funds were in currency, which helped  alleviate the Union's serious fiscal situation. The rest of the  price paid for privatized enterprises was paid with government  debt certificates, which were bought with substantial discounts  on the financial market.    The TCU found out that capital investments made by the  government in the enterprises within the PND were several times  higher than the amounts that were finally obtained from the  transaction. According to Bugarin, the funds that were obtained  are not aimed at any specific objective. This means that they  did not contribute to developing any activities in which the  participation of the state is essential, like the construction  of schools or hospitals or other objectives that might improve  the people's living standards.    According to the TCU report, the lack of clear rules for the  privatization process and for management of the privatized  enterprises led to the formation of monopolies in areas like the  iron and steel sector.    For Bugarin, who read the report at the TCU plenary session,  the sale of share packages, the sale of a low number of shares  to employees, and the lack of incentives for the participation  of small investors prevented the democratization of capital,  permitting the sale of enterprises to single economic groups,  which is something that goes against PND objectives.    One of the factors that was noticeable to TCU technicians  was  the participation of the Companhia Vale do Rio Doce in the  auctions. The Constitution sets forth that Congress must  authorize state enterprises' participation in private  enterprises.</p>

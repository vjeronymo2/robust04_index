			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EMPIRE LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> KATELLA WINS SEVENTH IN A ROW, TAKES SOLE POSSESSION OF SECOND  </P> <P> Two baseball teams headed in opposite directions met Friday for an Empire  League game at Boysen Park. As expected, the team playing well of late --  Katella High School -- defeated struggling Los Alamitos, 9-0.  </P> <P> Katella (15-4, 6-3 in league) has seven consecutive victories and is in sole  possession of second place, three games behind Empire League-leading Esperanza.  </P> <P> Los Alamitos, after winning its first four league games, has lost four of its  past five and dropped out of a second-place tie. Los Alamitos is 8-11-1, 5-4.  </P> <P> Katella's Chris Drummond (5-0), a senior right-hander, gave up three hits,  walked two and hit a batter.  </P> <P> Through six innings, the only Los Alamitos hitters who were able to figure out  Drummond's changeup were second baseman Tyler Cashman and designated hitter  Todd Gragnano, who both singled.  </P> <P> The only Los Alamitos player to reach second base was right fielder Doug Kieck,  who singled to lead off the seventh inning and advanced on a walk to Carlos  Jorge. But Drummond struck out catcher Craig Voorting to end the game.  </P> <P> "Chris throws strikes," Katella Coach Tim McMenamin said. "He's got confidence  in the way our defense is playing right now behind him. He knows they're going  to make the plays."  </P> <P> The Knights, who had 11 hits, didn't waste any time against Los Alamitos  starter William Wagner, either.  </P> <P> Katella third baseman Dennis Briggs led off the bottom of the first with a  double to left, stole third and scored on Danny Allen's single. Allen and Eric  Boyd scored on a double by shortstop Jamie Vitzelio.  </P> <P> Vitzelio went three for three, including a pair of doubles, and drove in three  runs to lead Katella.  </P> <P> In other league games:  </P> <P> Loara 12, El Dorado 2 -- Czach Hallock hit a two-run home run in the third  inning and tripled in Loara's six-run fourth. Aaron France pitched a complete  game, giving up seven hits and striking out four for Loara (5-14, 3-6). El  Dorado is 10-10, 3-6.  </P> <P> Esperanza 8, Cypress 7 -- Rich Hills went four for four, including two triples,  and had four RBIs as visiting Esperanza defeated Cypress for the second time  this week. Brandon Calderella hit a two-run home run in the fourth to tie the  score, 6-6, but Esperanza (14-6, 9-0) scored an unearned run in the fifth and  Hills scored on a sacrifice fly by Jason Perez in the sixth.  </P></p>

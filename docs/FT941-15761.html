			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Irish Contl rises to IPounds 4.74m Irish Continental Group, the largest shipping and ferry group operating from Ireland, has reported a 14.6 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 4.74m (Pounds 4.55m) on turnover up 5.8 per cent to IPounds 108.8m, for the year ended October 31 1993. The company said the turnover increase was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year's contribution from B&amp;I ferries (10 months in 1991-92) which ICG bought from the Irish government for IPounds 8.5m two years ago. The B&amp;I routes saw modest increases in both passenger and cargo traffic during the year, while its Irish Ferries operations had lower passenger carryings 'but in line with expectations' due to a chartering of one of its ferries for operations out of Helsinki during the Easter period. Roll on-roll off operations out of the Dublin ferryport terminal saw an increase of 8.8 per cent to 123,000 units, although conventional container cargoes declined from 54,000 to 34,000 units as a result of the reopening of competing terminals in Dublin port after the ending of a prolonged stevedores strike. Last September ICG took a 25 per cent holding in Bell Lines, a short-sea European container shipping service, and last November paid IPounds 55.5m for the ferry Pride of Bilbao, which is operating out of Portsmouth to the Continent on charter to P&amp;O Lines. Mr Eamonn Rothwell, group managing director, said that the P&amp;O charter was providing a net yield of some 11 per cent before depreciation. The company expects strong growth in all its markets in 1994, due to a predicted upturn in the UK economy as well as improved economic outlooks in Ireland and the Continent. Earnings per share were 27p (21.8p) and a final dividend of 2p is recommended for a total of 3p, up 24 per cent on the previous 2.42p.</p>

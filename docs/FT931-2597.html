			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Sharp upturn for Swire Pacific - Hong Kong Results A SPARKLING year for property development helped Swire Pacific, the Hong Kong-based aviation, property and trading group, boost 1992 net earnings 43.5 per cent to HKDollars 4.4bn (USDollars 570m) from HKDollars 3bn in 1991. The result, which was at the top end of analysts' expectations, was achieved on a 16 per cent rise in turnover to HKDollars 38.9bn from HKDollars 33.6bn. Cathay Pacific, the airline, contributed about HKDollars 1.5bn to profits both last year and in 1991. Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, said Swire Properties' profits had been substantially higher than in 1991. This reflected significant increases in income from the office, retail and residential parts of its showcase Pacific Place development on Hong Kong island. He said Swire Properties had earned exceptional profits of HKDollars 998.2m from the sale of some office and residential properties, and the sale of an option to buy a property to Sun Hung Kai Properties. Analysts said the property group's contribution to operating profits rose by 114 per cent. The industries division performed well last year, and strong growth was expected in 1993, Mr Sutch said. Swire Bottlers in Hong Kong had a successful year and was benefiting from the centralisation of its bottling in a single plant. The US and China both performed well, he added. The trading division's profits edged ahead, with improved performance from all its main businesses, particularly those in Taiwan, he said. Swire Properties' property investment portfolio had grown and continued growth in rental income was expected. Mr Sutch repeated his warning that 1993 was likely to be a more difficult year for Cathay Pacific than 1992, but overall the outlook for Swire Pacific was encouraging. The directors declared a final B share dividend of 14.8 cents a share, making 20.6 cents for the year - a rise of 15.7 per cent over 1991. The final A share dividend was 74 cents a share making HKDollars 1.03 a share - up 15.7 per cent.</p>

As the Ministry for Information reports, they talked about  providing humanitarian aid to Yugoslavia and preparations for  resuming economic cooperation between the two countries  following the lifting of sanctions.    Vice President Zebic thanked Ambassador Shikin for Russia's  humanitarian efforts and its initiatives for reaching a lasting  agreement on a peaceful solution to the crisis in the former  Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina that would be acceptable  to all three warring sides.    Ambassador Shikin stated that, unfortunately, Russia's  efforts in providing humanitarian aid to Yugoslavia have so far  failed to yield any major result due to the unconstructive and  unreasonable conduct of some countries in the UN Security  Council's sanctions committee. Ambassador Shikin noted,  however, that Russia will continue its efforts to endorse  humanitarian aid for Yugoslavia, the Ministry for Information  says in its statement.</p>

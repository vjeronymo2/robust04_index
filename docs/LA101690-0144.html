			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BIOTECH / BIOMEDICAL;  </P> <P> I-FLOW CORP. GETS U.S. APPROVAL TO SELL SELF-INFUSION DEVICE  </P> <P> I-Flow Corp. said Monday that it has received federal permission to market its  first line of high-tech home infusion medical equipment.  </P> <P> Donald M. Earhart, the company's chief executive officer, said the device is  lightweight and computerized, enabling a patient to receive up to four  infusions of drugs or nutrients either one at a time or simultaneously.  </P> <P> "This is the product we will finally go to market with," said Earhart, adding  that the potential market for the device is greater than $500 million a year in  the United States.  </P> <P> Currently, he said, patients who need chemotherapy or other treatments with  more than one drug or a combination of drugs and nutrients are using several  single-channel pumps or cumbersome hospital systems. By contrast, Earhart said,  patients can use the I-Flow equipment in their homes or take it with them to  work or on a trip, carrying it in small bags.  </P> <P> Earhart said I-Flow is trying to raise additional funds from private investors  to cover anticipated production costs.  </P></p>

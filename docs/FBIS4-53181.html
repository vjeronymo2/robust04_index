			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Katsuto Uchihashi, critic: "Balance Sheet on </F> Recession and `Hollowing Out'"]    [Text] Finished Product Imports Surpassing Exports    With the decline of the mining and manufacturing production  index and the factory shipments index persisting, the recession  has begun to look even more serious.    The recording of this greatest decline (relative to the  previous month) since the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry [MITI] began keeping statistics on trends in mining and  manufacturing production occurred in October 1993. Since then  neither production nor factory shipments have shown any signs of  recovering.    The perception has collapsed of viewing this recession as a  process of course correction back to that before the bubble  inflated, and most industries are being hit directly by declines  both in their production and in their shipment indices to levels  far below any theoretical figures.    One might be able to see the Japanese economy reverting, in  scale and strength, back nearly to the levels of 1984, ten years  ago, and now being headed on its way to even further  retrogression toward the levels prior to that--those of the  early 1980's.    This year again, most Japanese companies, including the auto  industry, issued bullish new-year forecasts of performance  recovery, but one must seriously doubt about the extent to which  the managers believed in achieving the scenarios they themselves  had written.    Still, in contrast to such pitiful conditions domestically,  there exists an area where plans are under way to augment  production facilities across the board and should effectuate  broad-scale projects for increasing production.    It is the Asia-Pacific region, and what is doing it is  Japanese capital centered on electronics, communications, and  home appliances.    In Malaysia by the end of 1994, electronic parts such as  variable resistors, tuners, as well as floppy-disc drives will  go up by 1.3 to five times. And in Thailand, parts for microwave  ovens and for nonportable VTR's [video tape recorders] will go  up by 1.5 to two times. Furthermore, in Singapore, projects are  under way to double computer peripheral equipment, microshafts,  and so on. Facilities investment to expand the scale of  production is starting up across the board at local plants  backed by Japanese capital.    From the fact that the number of imported color TV sets has  for the first time surpassed the number exported (1993), one may  see at what a rapid pace the transfer of the production base of  our nation's manufacturing industries is proceeding.    It is not only in color TV sets that imports have  quantitatively surpassed exports.    Many of the manufacturers of electronic parts established as  local corporations are actively pushing the reimportation of  locally made parts. Not to mention the parts for nonportable  VTR's, but the scale of increase in finished goods imports also  reached 50 percent (relative to 1992) in 1993. Compared to the  30-percent reduction recorded for the exports of these, it is a  great contrast.  <H5>  "Technology Transfer" Becoming High Tech </H5>   The many Japanese-owned local plants are already entering  their third stage of development.    The initial expansion era of the first stage had a goal of  using the cheap labor power available locally. It was a response  to the continuing keynote of the high yen, and local plants were  accorded the role of mere bases for supplying parts for Japan.    For electronic parts, however, such a primitive stage is  long  past.    From Japan's viewpoint, the parts-supply bases have evolved  into bases for exporting parts to other regions, including  Japan. The respective production bases were reorganized from an  initial "development of points" to a "development of areas," and  they entered into the second stage, that of producing the best  suited parts in the best suited regions on the most suitable  scale.    Now, in the third stage we are coming into an era in which  they make the parts locally, Japanese assemblers everywhere  assemble the products locally, and sell the products locally;  and at the same time, they export the products to Japan and  elsewhere.    Looking at durable consumer goods, local buying power is  rising sharply, as seen in China. An age is approaching in which  the advent of the so-called mass-consumption society can be  foreseen. The strategy and evolution of assembling locally,  selling locally or exporting finished products to other regions  is being advanced by the local corporations themselves.    Along with such changes, "technology transfers" to these  localities are beginning to take complex aspects.    Technology transfers from Japanese business can be  classified  broadly into five types. One can see the inevitability of having  to proceed toward progressively higher levels of technology  transfer.    Type 1. Transfer of skills: At local factories  created by extending capital directly, the processes for making  things are taught to employees and leaders. Guidance for each  line is administered by on-the-job training, and when production  of new parts is begun, knowledge of the broader scope needed for  plant production is transferred to the local people.    Type 2. Sophistication of transferred technology:  Cases in which transferred technology reaches the stage of  giving birth to new lines are not rare. Even the same resistors  as are used for radio-cassette players have become producible  locally for high-quality hi-fi equipment. Other examples are  such things as going higher level such as by taking one cylinder  for a VTR cassette player and going from those for two-head  machines to four-heads and then on to six-heads. As this  proceeds, the technology level is approaching high tech. By  seeking ever higher added value locally, it is starting to give  rise to successive new lines.    Type 3. Local transfer of design and quality assurance  sectors: Taking up the third stage already discussed, such  things as the introduction of CAD (computer aided design)  systems have come to be worked on locally.    Aiming for the optimal supply bases for the entire East  Asian  region, they need to go not only into product aftercare and so  gain the ability to provide repair and replacement parts, but  also to meet ISO (International Standardization Organization)  levels.    By going through such processes, local plants will proceed  toward higher orders of specific technology. The needed  technology is brought in from Japan.    Type 4. Transfer of "manufacturing processes:"  This is the formula by which Japanese firms handle the  manufacturing process up to a certain stage and shift completely  to local areas certain processes up through finishing the  product. Japan becomes the supply base for semi-processed parts,  and the local plants take these and do the finishing of the  products. Needless to say, know-how for product inspection and  local transfer of reliability-testing sensors goes with that.    Except for special high-level parts technology, the all-out  transfer of production technologies must proceed in this way.    Type 5. Transfer of R&amp;D: At present, transfers of  research and development sectors occur only in the early stages.  However, what will come after a unified development of skills  and technology will inevitably be the completion of a  "once-through system of making things" which will mean  localizing the capacity to improve and develop products and  parts.    Japanese firms that assert they are aiming for the shortest  possible way to reach that goal are growing in number.    In the past, if one asked who it was that bore the burden  for  types from one to five, it naturally was the midsized small and  tiniest subcontracting plants for parts within Japan. It is  already clear what the above described transfer of production  bases and technology will bring next for them in Japan.    By avoiding the subject of industrial hollowing that has  raised concerns lately, we become unable to discuss Japan's  economy and business climate henceforth, and the future of  subcontracted parts industries and, of course, employment.    The situation has not changed a bit, either, for any  discussion of breaking out of "the 1990's slump."  <H5>  Dilemmas of Technology Transfer and Employment </H5>   Just as it was for restoring Japan's postwar economy, it is  valid also for Asia's NIE's [newly industrializing economies]  and ASEAN nations to accept technology transfer from the  technologically advanced nations and follow the road to growth  by using that as a nucleus and improving on it as a way to  advance.    Based on the assumption that NIE's and ASEAN nations will in  due course be able to overtake and pass the north's advanced  nations, the thought that conditions for competition in trade  globally will be equalized will lead to a way for preserving  fairness and equity in international trade. Conversely, a  hegemonic strategy such as rejects the principle of equalizing  the terms of exchange--between the north's industrial goods and  the south's resources--would eventually come to be boycotted  strongly by the world.    In that sense, for the technologically advanced nations  themselves, including Japan, working actively for technology  transfer may be called their international duty.    The problem is how should that be advanced in equilibrium  with the hollowing out of domestic industry? Realistically, it  comes to the point that one cannot avoid tackling it with a  broader point of view.    In dealing with the knotty issue of technology transfer and  industrial hollowing, the strategic argument is often made for  "transferring low tech while keeping the high tech." With that  in mind, the ultra-optimistic argument is quite glibly put forth  that "Japanese business can survive by commercializing the  next-generation technology."    As for the first, just as a clash of views has arisen over  the transfer of VTR technology to China, a strategy of  distinguishing between low tech and high tech will be rejected  by the industrial policies of the side accepting the transfers.    That the latter idea is too sanguine goes without saying.  For  instance, not even the buds of any commercialization of such  next-generation technology as room-temperature nuclear fusion or  biotechnology are to be seen.    Even if these did come into being as new industries, they  would not likely be the labor-intensive type of industry; and  expecting too much of them as a solution for employment problems  that are anticipated is out of the question.    According to predictions by the Sanwa Research Institute, if  direct overseas investment by Japanese business rises henceforth  at a 10-percent pace year after year, employment opportunities  within the nation amounting to 950,000 persons will be lost by  the year 2000. And, if it rises at a 20 percent rate, employment  opportunities for 1.26 million persons will disappear, it says.    These figures are huge ones surpassing the current number of  unemployed within businesses in the manufacturing industry.  Added to employment adjustments responding to the "1990's  slump," having this much reduction in employment predicted for  five or six years from now speaks to the peril of the  unemployment rate in Japan shooting up to an acute level  exceeding the levels of the United States and Europe.  <H5>  Production Base for Key Devices </H5>   What sorts of directions might the strategic decisions at  the  level of individual corporations be taking now?    It is a question of guarding against hollowing out at home  as  well as how to proceed with technology transfer with nations of  the Asian region. How those choices are made may constitute a  crossroads that will determine the future of Japanese business.    Certain businesses seek to gamble on making their parts even  more advanced.    For the production technology of VTR decks, they have a  strategy for advanced development of parts whereby a number of  parts are linked together by integrated circuits, with  production of the key devices being concentrated in Japan.    The advanced technology that puts the cylinder and pre-amp  into one chip necessitates a general mobilization of high  technology, such as semiconductor technology and miniaturizing  and precision processing technology.    It is believed that in the regions and nations receiving the  technology transfers they still have to go some distance to  reach this advanced technology level.    In addition, the added value of this kind of key device  makes  up 60 to 70 percent of the VTR deck as a whole. It is said that  it can be one of the few profitmaking domains within Japan's  "building of things."    This is not to say that the technological fields to remain  in  Japan are to be the existing high-tech areas, but that we should  trim back to such fields as are being newly developed and thus  to make higher technology possible for more products.    It would mean positioning plants within Japan as production  bases for such new key devices and endeavoring to maintain them  as places of employment.    It can be called an option showing possibilities. In other  words, Japan--the producer and exporter of finished goods--would  change into a parts supply base. In this way we would be aiming  to circumvent reductions in employment opportunities.    Still, the businesses involved think that, despite such  efforts by companies, a shrinkage on the order of one third  might be unavoidable for employment in the production stage.    A part of the stern reality is coming to the fore.  <H5>  Can We Counter the Big Three? </H5>   A hardship even worse than in electronics is facing the auto  industry.    The cost advantage of Japanese cars is rapidly being lost in  the "1990's recession."    In this industry the strategy pursued in the 1980's for  boosting competitiveness faces the contradiction that in the  1990's it is changing totally into a heavy burden.    The competitiveness created in the 1980's by the strategy of  production of many models but small quantities, short cycles,  and high value-added was transformed in the 1990's when it ran  into the sharp drop in demand. That is because the strategy that  gave birth to competitiveness had become the cause of totally  adverse effects.    The Big Three of the United States, our international  rivals,  have begun moving to transfer their production strongholds to  Mexico, and the European companies have gone into eastern Europe  and Spain. Needless to say, it is a strategy of again recovering  a powerful cost advantage by a shift of production bases.    To counter such global mobility of production strongpoints,  Japanese makers also may have to move to shift into the  Asia-Pacific region. But it is clear that this option is not  something of a kind that is easily managed.    As distinct from electronics, the cultivation of parts  industries for autos in the Asia-Pacific region will face many  obstacles.    One is that the policies of the local governments toward the  auto industry have still not settled on whether or not they  should give priority to domestic production. Hence, the basic  conditions differ from the expansion of the Big Three into  Mexico.    On the other hand, bringing the technological level of local  parts makers up to that of domestic keiretsu subcontractors  would take far too much time. And yet, to advance capital aborad  with domestic subcontractor firms, the production scales in the  local areas are far too small.    The 1980's strategy of moving into an area by somehow  building a beachhead centering on the knockdown (local assembly)  formula is about to go against them here, too.    Yet, as mentioned before, domestic subcontractors' ability  to  cut costs further has already attained its limit. One symbolic  example of this is the failure (last October) of Taiyo Kogyosho,  which had been a primary subcontractor for Toyota Autos and  supply source for Toyoda Steel Works (pressed parts). The  company's order volume had fallen to one third of its peak time.    The number of failures in steel and metals located in the  central region has become 2.4 times that of the same period last  year. But, this, too, is but a phenomenon showing an example of  the distress the auto industry is experiencing.    At the subcontracting stage--the base of the pyramid--the  reality of hollowing out is now close at hand.    With all this going on, it is not conceivable that Japanese  auto makers will easily have available the approach of  recovering cost competitiveness vis a vis European and the U.S.  cars by seeking to transfer such production bases in the way  that the electronic parts industry and other assemblers have  done. Here, too, a new peril has arisen for Japanese industry.  The "1990's slump" has begun to show another of its new sobering  aspects.</p>

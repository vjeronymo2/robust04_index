			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRM CO-OWNED BY FIRED SUBCONTRACTOR HIRED FOR METRO RAIL  </P> <P> An unlicensed subcontractor who had been kicked off a Metro Rail job and  accused of payroll cheating is part owner of a firm that was subsequently hired  in his place to work on downtown subway stations, transit district authorities  acknowledged Monday.  </P> <P> Gregory C. Park is a partner in Citicon Inc., the firm that took over when the  Park-owned PIE Construction Co. of Van Nuys was removed from the Metro Rail job  because its contracting license had expired, Southern California Rapid Transit  District officials said. Park had been accused of falsifying payroll records  and pocketing up to half his workers' wages.  </P> <P> "Clearly (Park) was the same guy we had to remove last spring," said Greg Davy,  transit district spokesman. Officials of the bonding company that had ensured  that PIE would complete the $1.6-million project made the decision to hire  Citicon to finish up when PIE was removed, Davy said. "We have no control over  rehiring," Davy explained.  </P> <P> District officials contend that they knew nothing of the criminal investigation  of Park's operations by either the state labor commissioner or the district  attorney's office until news accounts of his arrest surfaced early last week.  Park's interest in Citicon did not disqualify the firm from assuming the  contract in May, just after PIE was removed from the project, they said.  </P> <P> According to the Los Angeles district attorney's office, Park was arrested on  two felony complaints charging that he falsely reported paying up to $27.79 an  hour to PIE employees. The workers endorsed PIE payroll checks and gave them  back to their employers, accepting $12 to $15 an hour in cash, said Sandi  Gibbons, a district attorney's office spokeswoman. Park is to be arraigned  Sept. 11.  </P> <P> Park, 48, of San Dimas is a member of the Los Angeles County Citizens Planning  Council, a body that makes recommendations to the county Regional Planning  Commission. He was appointed to the post by Supervisor Pete Schabarum.  </P> <P> Park has denied that he or PIE cheated the workers. The firm was hired to  install electrical conduit in two subway station projects. He acknowledged that  the firm's license had lapsed and acknowledged that he is half-owner of  Citicon. He said, "We (Citicon) are paying the prevailing wages."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Complex Web  </P> <P> The complex web of events began when PIE -- designated a "disadvantaged  enterprise" by the transit district and awarded contracts given to minority-run  firms -- let its contracting license lapse but continued to work for two prime  contractors, Guy F. Atkinson Co. of South San Francisco and Tudor-Saliba-Perini  Inc. of Sylmar.  </P> <P> When the transit district ordered PIE off the two jobs in May, there were  allegations that the company was not paying prevailing wages and fringe  benefits, as required on federally funded projects. Both the district  attorney's office and the state labor commissioner said the investigation of  Park's companies is ongoing.  </P> <P> RTD officials said they are watching Citicon payrolls closely and all  indications are that the firm is paying the required prevailing wages.  </P></p>

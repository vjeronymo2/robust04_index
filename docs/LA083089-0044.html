			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> A second federal witness implicated Pete Rose in an alleged tax-fraud scheme  involving a winning race track ticket in the trial of former Rose housemate  Thomas Gioiosa.  </P> <P> The testimony in the third day of Gioiosa's trial on cocaine and tax-evasion  charges contradicted Rose's contention that he had nothing to do with the  winning race ticket.  </P> <P> Rose has denied any involvement in the winning ticket, and Gioiosa has pleaded  not guilty. However, accountant Joseph Mansour testified that Gioiosa told him  he was claiming the ticket for Rose.  </P> <P> In another development, Gold Star Chili Inc. and Pete Rose have agreed to  suspend the former Cincinnati Red manager's contract as a spokesman for the  restaurant chain.  </P> <P> William K. Stock, chief executive of Gold Star, said in a prepared statement,  "The attention given recent events has so overshadowed our working relationship  with Pete that even routine promotional activities have been compromised and a  temporary hold seems prudent."  </P></p>

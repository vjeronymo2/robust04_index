			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Room for manoeuvre What Mr Kenneth Clarke delivered on Tuesday has been widely described as the budget in between: between two that will raise more than Pounds 16bn in extra taxes and two that will give most of that money back; between a huge rise in indirect taxes and a subsequent lowering of direct taxes; between a post-election period of sensible policy from a chastened government and a pre-election period of idiotic policy from a desperate one. Naturally, bluff Mr Clarke denies that he has any such devious intentions. His first priority, he asserted, was 'to keep the economy on track to achieve the great prize of sustainable growth. This recovery offers the best prospect that the British people have faced for many years to enjoy the benefits of growth that does not pass through illusory boom to painful bust.' But he would say this, whatever his intentions. Delivering sustainable growth will demand both determination and skill. Will the fevered state of British politics allow him to demonstrate either? What Mr Clarke - and Mr Lamont, before him - sought to achieve in the two budgets of 1993 was room for manoeuvre. They found themselves in a fiscal hole and proceeded to dig themselves out of it. With the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) heading towards Pounds 50bn, the case for fiscal stringency seemed overwhelming. At the beginning of a parliament, it also looked well-timed. Now the choices have become far more difficult. Making them wisely is also being made less easy by the terms of the current debate. Most commentators assume that the questions are only when, and by how much, to tighten monetary policy and when, and by how much, to loosen fiscal policy. Fiscal policy This is absurd. First, the best policy option is not to loosen fiscal policy, but rather to allow interest rates (and so the exchange rate) to be lower than they would otherwise be. Second, following tax increases of as much as 2 per cent of gross domestic product with lower taxes a year or two later is senseless. But it would be worse than senseless if increases were imposed when the economy is recovering and the reductions when it is close to full capacity. Yet fiscal relaxation seems highly likely. The PSBR is now forecast to decline from 5 per cent of GDP this year to  3/4 of a per cent, by 1997-98. Moreover, revenue may rise even more quickly than the Treasury forecasts. Should inflation be higher than the low levels now forecast and the cash-limited figures for public spending be retained, the fiscal position would improve more quickly still. In any case, the chancellor should enjoy room for fiscal manoeuvre. Part of it might be exploited by raising public spending. Because inflation was much lower this year than had been forecast a year ago, the expected squeeze never happened: real general government spending is forecast to rise by 2.3 per cent in 1994-95, against the decline of 0.1 per cent forecast a year ago. It is not surprising that managing the public sector has been easy. Now, however, the plans are for a rise of only 2 per cent in the real level of general government spending between 1994-95 and 1997-98. Relaxation It is not difficult to imagine a relaxation of this squeeze. Even so the prospective PSBR should also allow large tax reductions. If the chancellor were to eliminate the 25p basic rate in favour of the 20p rate, it would cost the exchequer around Pounds 8.5bn. If this were done in 1996-97, the PSBR would rise to just over Pounds 20bn, which would be less than 3 per cent of GDP. The political calculation would be whether the popularity of a lower basic rate of tax would offset the unpopularity of higher interest rates. It may well do so, because many voters - particularly elderly ones - would enjoy the prospect of higher interest rates on their deposits. Meanwhile, in the absence of much new borrowing, the cost of higher interest rates would fall predominantly on the group of people who bought houses in the second half of the 1980s. For a desperate government this would appear to be a promising calculus. From the economic point of view, however, such a switch would be far less attractive. The Treasury's Red Book notes that net trade accounts for about half the growth in 1994 this far. For once, the UK economy is enjoying export-led growth. Any significant fiscal loosening, particularly if it were offset by monetary tightening, could throw this gain away. Worse still would be a failure to tighten monetary policy enough. In that case, everything could be thrown away in yet another consumer-led boom. The government has achieved the luxury - and the danger - of choice. The economically wise thing to do would be to leave fiscal policy as it is. The politically attractive choice would be to bribe the voters and let the economy rip. To govern is to choose. The government will show what it is made of by how it does so.</p>

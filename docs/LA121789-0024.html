			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROMANCE IN THE '80S  </P> <P> While Rainer can rest assured that there is no conspiracy to portray the world  in Hollywood's image, romance is, by definition, a bit removed from reality,  and fills an important need.  </P> <P> Love, a deeper concept Ranier avoided entirely, was depicted in most of the  films he criticized. Love works, and it's a lot more mature than romance.  </P> <P> Ranier believes optimism recalls a bygone era, but perhaps the author is stuck  back in the bra-burning, sexual-war era and its immediate aftermath, which are  both passe.  </P> <P> JAMES TUGEND  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Nadezhda Garifullina report: "There Are Two Speakers"] </F>   [Excerpts] A report on the registration of deputies'  factions and groups was delivered at the [State Duma's] Thursday  morning session by Sergey Stankevich, leader of the interim Duma  Secretariat. But, of course, the main matter of the day was the  election for the lower house speaker. After the adoption at the  evening session of three articles of the State Duma Interim  Standing Orders pertaining to the chairman of the chamber and  his powers, candidates were nominated for the post. There were  10 of them. [passage omitted]    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy appeared first. It has to be said that  his presence in the Russian parliament continues to attract  frenzied interest from the press. If during a recess a  hurricane of journalists tears down a corridor sweeping all  before it and chasing after someone, you will soon find it was  Vladimir Volfovich. The only person so sought-after by the  press at the first Congress of RSFSR People's Deputies was Boris  Nikolayevich [Yeltsin], who was then running for chairman of the  Russian Supreme Soviet. Times change, and journalists now have  a new and odious "idol."    Speaking as a candidate for speaker, Vladimir Volfovich put  the chairman in his place: "Under the new Constitution and the  statute on our Duma your task is to let people speak -- that is  all. We have had enough lectures! The left wing, the right  wing, who said what.... You yourself carry the burden of the  old parliament. And you have the tanks and the Special Purpose  Militia Detachment behind you. You are leading things in that  direction, whereas the speaker's role is like a dispatcher -- he  presses a button for the next item on the agenda, we discuss it,  and that's it." He was supported by Deputy Mironov, who  proposed psychiatric checks for deputies. "I agree. On the one  hand, there are very many contenders for this role" and he  promised to do this within two years "through our special  services." But at the same time he voiced a grievance of his  own: "Under all the laws of international practice nobody ever  discusses the question of whom to appoint as head of government  or parliament. The position throughout the world is the same --  the [leader of the] party that wins the most votes in the  election is automatically invited by the head of state to form a  government or automatically becomes the head of the parliament."    Basically, recounting a speech by Vladimir Volfovich is a  thankless task. It has to be seen -- it is a theatrical  performance by a single actor. Admittedly, sometimes he pushes  so hard that he generates furious hostility and indignation.  And you again wonder -- just who are you, Mr. Zhirinovskiy?  You get shameless bragging ("in just two days my visit to  Europe stunned [postavilo na ushi] the planet, all diplomats,  and all ministers"), self-confidence ("I have a different role,  a different calling"), downright rudeness that does not become a  member of parliament ("Don't interrupt! Shut up! Get out of  the hall! All the candidates should be sent to mental  hospitals!"), and peremptoriness ("Our time has come. Your time  has passed. On 12 December Russia's voters said you, 'Russia's  Choice,' are my main rival. You are 30 percent down on me. By  this spring you will be 60 percent down, and by the fall 90  percent down, and your voice will finally be silenced in the  entire Russian political firmament.") In short, Vladimir  Volfovich has "temporarily withdrawn his candidacy" and is  waiting for the Russian presidential elections. [passage  omitted]</p>

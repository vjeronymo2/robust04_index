			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY WITHHOLDS FUNDS FOR AIRPORT WORK  </P> <P> In a rare move, Orange County officials have withheld $111,000 in payments due  the prime contractor on the new, $48-million John Wayne Airport passenger  terminal because of a dispute between the firm and a subcontractor.  </P> <P> County officials said, however, that withholding some payments on the already  beleaguered project is not expected to delay its April 1, 1990, opening date.  </P> <P> The money involved in the dispute involves construction problems that arose  months ago and are already being corrected, officials explained. They also said  that, under state law, they had no choice but to withhold the money.  </P> <P> "Withholding funds from a prime contractor happens once a year, if that," said  Charles Niederman, director of facilities, property and transportation for the  county General Services Administration. "Generally our contractors have very  good relations with the people who work for them."  </P> <P> County officials took the unusual step of withholding money a week ago Friday,  project supervisors said, after a subcontractor, Structural Beton Inc. of  Rancho Palos Verdes, filed a formal stop payment notice with the county to halt  disbursement of funds to the prime contractor, Taylor Woodrow California Ltd.  </P> <P> Ed Shahnazarian, president of Structural Beton, is the same subcontractor who  last week accused Taylor Woodrow of violating state law by hiring  subcontractors for major work that Taylor Woodrow was obligated to do itself.  Taylor Woodrow has declined to comment on the accusation.  </P> <P> In a letter to the county Board of Supervisors, Shahnazarian said that Taylor  Woodrow's hiring of his own firm was proof of such violations and that he knew  of other examples as well. But county officials said their decision to withhold  funds had nothing to do with that issue, which is still under investigation.  </P> <P> "Under the law involving stop notices, we have to withhold funds whether we  agree with it or not," said Richard Begley, airport expansion project manager.  </P> <P> Last fall, the county withheld more than $1 million from the airport terminal's  architects in a dispute about cost overruns and alleged design mistakes.  </P> <P> Also, subcontractors recently threatened to walk off the job because of slow  payments from the county to Taylor Woodrow and hence the subcontractors.  </P> <P> Shahnazarian's dispute is more complicated. He says that Taylor Woodrow has  reneged on a severance agreement in which he was supposed to receive $111,000  after completing a third of the work on the terminal's concrete foundation.  Taylor Woodrow officials, however, say Shahnazarian's firm failed to install  certain anchor bolts properly in the foundation, resulting in fixes that are  expected to total $200,000. Shahnazarian has strongly denied any wrongdoing on  the project.  </P> <P> Chris Elliott, Taylor Woodrow's project chief, said he expects his firm to  secure bonding for the disputed $111,000, a move that would allow the county to  release funds to his company.  </P> <P> County officials last week deducted the disputed $111,000 from a payment of  more than $1 million to Taylor Woodrow for work completed as of Dec. 31. "We  tore up one check and wrote another after deducting the $111,000," said Begley.  </P></p>

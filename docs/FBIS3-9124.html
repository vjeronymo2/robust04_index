In a statement made before leaving Geneva, Simic described  as  exceptionally important the acceptance of the Yugoslav  delegation's suggestion as to how the assets of former  Yugoslavia should be inventoried.    The working group's agreement [words indistinct] the  Yugoslav  suggestion on an equal footing, after almost two years of  denying this, practically means that the legal and economic  postulates of the former Yugoslav federation must be recognized,  which in turn means that there can be no arbitrary  interpretation of the entitlement to state property, explained  Simic.    The insistence of the other former Yugoslav republics that a  division of assets was made unde the 1974 constitution collapsed  when a debate on a partial division of assets was taken off the  agenda, he added.    He further said he had held an important discussion on the  crisis in former Yugoslavia with the deputy co-chairman of the  former Yugoslavia conference, Ambassador Geerd Ahrens.    Simic said the Yugoslav delegation was satisfied with the  session of the working group on humanitarian issues, which for  the first time publicly voiced the view that international  sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) had done  incalculable harm and had unjustly punished the most vulnerable  section of the population -- the elderly, the children, the ill  and the refugees -- thus [word indistinct] the efforts of  humanitarian organisations.    U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata has also  voiced this view, so that it might be expected without a doubt  to produce some political effect, said Simic.    Yugoslavia has fulfilled all the conditions as set down by  the international community, and now expects the European Union  to show in deed what it undertook late last year to do in word,  namely to take the necessary steps to ease or lift the economic  sanctions which have been proven so utterly inappropriate, said  Simic.    The views voiced at Geneva indicate that the international  community is becoming more amenable to arguments Yugoslavia has  been presenting since before the outbreak of the crisis, said  Simic.</p>

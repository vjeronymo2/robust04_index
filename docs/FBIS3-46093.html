			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chengdu, January 20 (XINHUA) -- Inland Sichuan  Province in southwest China is attracting more capital from  Taiwan, according to government sources.    By the end of last year, the province had approved the  setting up of more than 800 Taiwan-funded enterprises, doubling  the figure of the previous year. The enterprises had taken in  521 million U.S. dollars from Taiwanese businessmen.    Government officials attribute the boom to the province's  rich natural and labor resources and a fairly strong industrial  and technological power.    The investors are going to light industry, electronics, high  technology and real estate development instead of the previously  favored catering trade and processing of agricultural and  sideline products, the officials said.    Big companies and financial groups from Taiwan have also  begun to set up businesses in the province to pursue large  development projects.</p>

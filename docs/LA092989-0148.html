			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHAVEZ WINS UNANIMOUS DECISION AT IRVINE  </P> <P> Ernie Chavez built a big early lead while winning a unanimous decision over  Bobby Chinungu Thursday in front of 1,008 at the Irvine Marriott's monthly  boxing program.  </P> <P> Chavez a left-handed welterweight from Santa Ana, used a quick right jab to  keep Chinungu of Zambia away for much of the bout.  </P> <P> Chavez (7-0) finally tired in the eighth round and Chinungu (12-1) landed a  series of punches that staggered Chavez.  </P> <P> Chavez stayed on his toes and danced away for much of the ninth and the early  part of the 10th round.  </P> <P> He again became the aggressor in the final minute of the fight, pinning  Chinungu on the ropes with a powerful combination as the bell sounded.  </P> <P> Chavez won 96-95, 97-93, 97-93, on the judges' cards.  </P> <P> "I don't think I'll see many fights like that," Chavez said. "He was really  tough. My jab just worked fantastic, but he kept throwing punches with  abundance and that kept me off guard." STEVE KRESAL  </P></p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Institute of British Geographers' Conference in Sheffield: Japanese claims questioned JAPANESE INVESTORS in north-east England are not as innovative as has been assumed, two academics from Newcastle Polytechnic told the conference yesterday. Dr Frank Peck and Dr Ian Stone said that, while Japanese companies claimed to have a very high incidence of modern management techniques, detailed analysis showed that their actual practices were often markedly less sophisticated. Linguistic confusion and a desire to appear at the forefront of modern production techniques meant that questions to Japanese companies were often misunderstood or the answers exaggerated, they said. For example, 69 per cent of all inward investors said that they had 'single-status' plants with no distinction between managers and shopfloor workers, 49 per cent said they had workers' consultative committees, 39 per cent 'just-in-time' production and 71 per cent team-working. For Japanese investors, those figures were 100 per cent, 77 per cent, 62 per cent and 100 per cent respectively. In each case, detailed interviews revealed that the techniques as generally understood were often not applied, or they were not implemented in vital production areas. The survey covered 84 of the 106 inward investors of the past decade in north-eastern manufacturing plants with more than 20 employees.</p>

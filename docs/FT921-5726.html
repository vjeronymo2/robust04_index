			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Technology: Iron challenges the lightweights Lennart Backerud, a Swedish professor, has developed a technology which he says introduces foundries to the computer era and opens up a wide range of new applications for an age-old material that is cheap, abundant and readily available from foundries worldwide: cast iron. He suggests his process is likely to redraw the map of metal usage. In the near term it seems likely to slow down the switch to aluminium by car manufacturers. SinterCast, the Swedish-American company which owns the patent, says the process can reduce the weight of products such as car components by up to 30 per cent and cut the cost by as much as 10 per cent, yet make them as strong as ever. The process has just been introduced at its foundries by Fritz Winter Eisengeiberie. This German company is one of the world's leading independent suppliers of castings for the motor industry with annual production of more than 200,000 tonnes. Backerud's process permits the commercial production of a form of cast iron called compacted graphite iron (CGI). In this form of cast iron, graphite modules form a worm-like pattern whereas in traditional cast iron, or grey iron, the graphite modules form flakes along which the metal can fracture. CGI's microstructure makes it one-and-a-half to two times as strong as grey iron, the traditional material used for casting engine blocks and cylinder heads. That strength would allow car makers to design engines with thinner cylinder walls and other structures, thus cutting weight. CGI has been known about for more than 20 years but in the past it has been produced only in laboratories. Foundries have been unable to produce it consistently, mainly because the raw material, scrap metal, contains impurities such as magnesium and titanium. The core of the Backerud process is an ultra-sensitive probe which is lowered into the molten metal before it is cast. The probe is fitted with thermocouples which detect minuscule changes as molten metal cools and solidifies. A computer analyses how the metal will cool and prescribes how to fine-tune the recipe so it will unfailingly form CGI. Ted Louckes, SinterCast's president, says that switching an engine block to aluminium would save 50 per cent of the weight at three times the cost. However, once it has been redesigned so that CGI can be used, 30 per cent of the weight could be saved at the same cost or even less. 'And the foundry capacity is already in place, no new plant and equipment is needed,' he points out. He reckons that in the automotive industry alone, at least 10m tonnes of castings could usefully be switched to CGI. Louckes says CGI costs about the same as ductile iron or 25 per cent more than grey iron. To reap the benefits of CGI, products should be re-designed. While stronger than grey iron, CGI's damping, thermal conductivity and machinability are similar to or approaching those of grey iron, while its wear resistance is superior to that of nodular iron. Backerud says that aluminium is not particularly suitable for car engine blocks and cylinder heads because these require high-quality aluminium - so it is not possible to use scrap or recycled material. SinterCast, which is based at Auburn Hills, Michigan, is taking an original approach to selling its technology. It is offering a turn-key technical service and provides all the probes, computers and other equipment, and all the necessary additives, complete with a trained technician. 'We guarantee the process. The foundry does not have to invest or worry about making the technology work,' says Louckes. In return, the foundry pays a previously-negotiated fee for each successful tonne of metal. The aim is to leave a foundry with extra profit even after paying the SinterCast fees.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Black-owned group to run 47 Denny's restaurants Denny's, the US restaurant chain recently exposed as having discriminated against black customers in many of its 1,500 restaurants, yesterday announced that it had appointed a black-owned business to run 47 Denny's restaurants in the states of New York and New Jersey. The company is NDI Foods, a newly-formed subsidiary of the Atlanta-based NDI Inc. A second subsidiary of the same company, NDI Video, owns and operates 23 Blockbuster Video stores in the US. Under the agreement with Denny's, NDI Foods will buy 17 company-owned Denny's restaurants in New York and New Jersey this year and acquire the right to buy five more next year. It will also build and operate 25 new Denny's restaurants in the same territory over the next five years. The deal will be financed by the New England based BancBoston Capital, a subsidiary of the Bank of Boston. The price of the transaction was not disclosed. In May this year Denny's, part of Flagstar, the Nasdaq-quoted restaurant group, agreed to pay Dollars 46m in damages to thousands of black customers to settle charges that it had discriminated against them. Some Denny's managers, it emerged, had tried to drive black customers away by refusing them service or making them pay in advance. The discrimination came to light in April 1993 when six black agents on the US president's secret service detail were kept waiting nearly an hour in a Denny's restaurant while white colleagues were served. In an attempt to rebuild its reputation, Flagstar reached an agreement with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in July this year, pledging to put at least eight of its restaurants into the hands of black franchises by the end of this year and at least 53 by the end of 1997.</p>

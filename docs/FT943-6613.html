			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Property: Wary buyers give rented homes a new lease of life  -With negative equity afflicting many and job security on the wane, the letting sector is buoyant again Over the seven quarters since autumn 1992, it has - according to the Nationwide building society - taken less than three times national average earnings to buy a house. Apart from one quarter in 1970, buying a home has not made such a small dent in people's wealth since 1957-61 when this affordability ratio was steadily below three. (By contrast, it was 4.56 in winter 1989.) Yet, the buying market stays soggy. The rental market is buoyant, however. 'People who might have bought are continuing to rent,' says Penny Parr-Head, of Cluttons London Residential Lettings. Indeed, she estimates that 16-17 per cent of the firm's new tenants in the first six months of 1994 do not want to buy at all. These tenants represent a big change in the property market as they are long-term renters, unlike traditional tenants - people on short assignments or corporate re-location, foreigners, those between selling and buying, the recently divorced and widowed, and young people who will buy one day - who need the short-term flexibility of renting. Together, the two groups are likely to turn the UK slowly towards the pattern in continental Europe where about 50 per cent of accommodation is rented, ranging from a low of just under 30 per cent in France to 75 per cent in Switzerland. The UK average is a puny 7 per cent, with local peaks of 14-15 per cent in London and Aberdeen, How different from 1900 when 90 per cent of UK property was rented. The Britons who choose not to buy are an extra demand on a stretched letting market, which is now at its annual, frantic peak of activity as tenants scramble to settle themselves and their families before school starts. Agents report that stock is as short as it is in the buying market, and that rents have risen (see Cadogan's Place, above). Indeed, Parr-Head says tenants are so eager that there have even been informal auctions. She expects a further leap in rents when this quarter's figures are collated. Thus, prospects are good for landlords, many of whom are Far Easterners who have bought rental property in London with zest since the devaluation of the pound in September 1992. A typical recent purchase is 4, 5 and 8 Observatory Gardens W8, with 15 apartments. Part of a re-development by Northacre, they were sold off-plan by de Groot Collis for a total of about Pounds 10m, which works out at more than Pounds 470 a square foot compared with Pounds 375 for the first block last year. Such investments should yield 8 to 10 per cent gross; perhaps a little less in the affluent Belgravia district of inner London. Robert Orr-Ewing, of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's nearby Chelsea office, says property prices in Belgravia 'are so high that it is hard to achieve the same return'. The recession and its aftermath changed attitudes among UK tenants, especially the young. Many could not find employment after leaving school or university and became sceptical about their prospects. They saw, too, how their parents suffered when they lost their jobs. What is the point of the costs and emotional commitment of buying, they asked. In a few years, we may be somewhere else, unable to pay a mortgage or with a new partner. But the main reason for the turn to renting is purely financial. In the 1980s, government ideology promoted property ownership as the best way to wealth. The recession, and the widespread plague of negative equity, have made things very different - and a long way from the home-buying mania in summer 1988 after the government announced in its Budget that spring that multiple mortgage tax relief - which allowed people living together each to claim relief on the loan for the same property - would end. With low interest rates set to continue, the present 20 per cent income tax relief on the first Pounds 30,000 of a loan can hardly be seen as the special treatment for buyers it once was. And since that comes down to 15 per cent in April, the future looks even less welcoming. There is, too, the fact that potential buyers who hold back and become tenants keep their capital - and they can get a good return on this, since real long-term interest rates are positive while inflation is low. If they put that money into a home, continuing low inflation means they have little reason to expect the compensation of capital gain from a rising house price. For UK owners letting their own properties, the Housing Act of 1988, which introduced assured shorthold tenancies, made life much easier - and saw the gradual start of an improvement for people seeking places to rent. Until then, there was the risk under existing law that owners could not regain possession from private individuals. The safest tenants were companies, which could not legally refuse to quit when they had to; and foreigners, who were unlikely to start a legal battle with the owner. Assured shorthold tenancies do not confer any security of tenure, and renters must leave at the end of their term (earlier if due notice is given). With this guarantee of repossession for landlords, more properties are now on offer and the pattern that was common before the second world war  -when houses were rented by private individuals for longish periods, without any social stigma - is re-appearing. In June, for instance, Clegg Kennedy Drew was offering Dunkeld House, in the Yorkshire village of South Dalton, for up to 10 years, at an initial annual rent of more than Pounds 10,000. Another arresting offering is Birdcatcher's Cottage, a folly designed by Humphry Repton on the edge of the park of Woburn Abbey; this is available for up to five years at Pounds 600 a month from the Bedford Estate. The tilt to renting must be a worry to developers who build new homes for owner-occupation. But Paul Mugnaioni, chairman of rented homes specialist Quality Street, is one who knows exactly how the wind is blowing. His firm, 75 per cent owned by Nationwide, offers lettings from Aberdeen to Brighton in all sectors of the market on assured tenancies. (This alternative to assured shortholds guarantees indefinite occupation as long as the tenant continues to pay.) The firm is now adding to its stock of 4,500 units - 2,500 of its own and 2,000 managed for others - and has started its own developing. As Mugnaioni puts it (and new-home builders take note): 'The crash altered attitudes fundamentally. Until then, all of us believed that God made house prices go only in one way.' Bedford Estate, Woburn Park (tel: 0525-290 202); Quality Street, Glasgow.(041-248 4553) and London (071-431 6464).

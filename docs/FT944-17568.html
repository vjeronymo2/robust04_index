			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Free the Post Office It speaks volumes for the vanishing ideological divide in British politics that the foremost policy difference between the main parties appears to be the issue of privatising the Post Office. Yet if the postal service is to be a final triumph for state industrial ownership in the UK, it cannot continue in its current form. For all Mr Tony Blair's resolution to ditch the Labour party's notorious constitutional commitment to public ownership, Labour is set to fight the privatisation of the Post Office tooth and nail. Its stance is nonsensical since all the supposed benefits of state ownership - such as universal service and a single stamp price across the country - could be secured through regulation, while consumers stand to gain from the greater efficiency and entrepreneurial zeal likely to flow from selling a majority stake in the Post Office to the private sector. Yet Labour's success in whipping up popular sentiment against postal privatisation appears to be alarming enough Tory MPs to cause the government to pause. If the cabinet feels forced by political pressure to retreat, it should not be content with preserving the status quo. Instead it should take Labour at its word and propose legislation restructuring the Post Office to give it maximum commercial freedom within the public sector. Unless it does so, Britain's highly successful postal service will be handicapped as it seeks to expand into new technologies and confront international competition. Listed company Such a policy would turn the Post Office into a stock market listed company in which the state owned, say, 80 per cent of the shares and exercised only the customary rights of a shareholder to agree broad strategy, approve directors and receive dividends. It would involve taking on the Treasury theologians who claim that no state-owned industry should be excluded from the public sector borrowing requirement and be treated as a normal company free from detailed Treasury control over budgets and borrowing. The Treasury justifies its stance by citing rules on the compilation of the public accounts, and by arguing that a public sector company could not, in practice, be allowed to float free while the government acted as ultimate guarantor for its debts. Both the rules and the argument about debt are well-founded as a general approach to state ownership. However, there are good reasons for relaxing them in the case of the Post Office, which has long operated as a profitable business. If the Post Office were a listed company forbidden by its founding statute from receiving state aid, it would in practice be subject to normal market disciplines and its borrowings could be excluded from the public accounts. Market discipline The sale of a minority stake would be sufficient to ensure market discipline, while the creation of an equity base would leave the company free to contract business alliances and provide market incentives for its managers and employees. In extremis, of course, the government might seek to amend the law to provide aid; but there is nothing to stop it doing so in the case of any private sector company. Two key issues would still remain: regulation and competition. Essential to a new regime would be the establishment of a regulator operating at arm's length from the Department of Trade and Industry, akin to the existing privatised utility regulators. The regulator, not the government, would determine stamp prices and rates of return for the Post Office, subject to statutory requirements to protect universal service and other socially desirable objectives. On competition, there is a strong case for a gradual lowering of the existing ban on rival deliverers of mail stamped at below Pounds 1 an item. This would encourage more specialised delivery services catering for the business and high-value residential market without endangering the Royal Mail. Sweden - where the post office remains in the public sector - has gone further, exposing basic letter delivery to full competition. That is an example which the UK would do well to study, and if it works, follow.</p>

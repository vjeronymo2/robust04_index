			<p>CSO     [Text] "In fiscal 1993, 150,000 multimedia personal  computers incorporating sound and animation were sold in Japan.  However, it will increase many times with games in the future."  Mutsuo Miyake, director of the Computer Division, Matsushita  Electric Industrial, who attended a product announcement  gathering in Tokyo on 11 May, expressed strong expectations with  confidence in the work before him. Matsushita estimates that  they have only a 15-percent share in the world, even including  word processors, with 2.44 million units in 1993 on the Japanese  personal computer market. For that alone, they are expecting  that "latent demand is in the home" (Miyake).    Toshiba director Shoichi Koga, who attended the announcement  of "EZ Vision," also emphasized that "Personal computers and  television are products that will be the multimedia nucleus for  family use. The big task is how to fuse them." EZ Vision is a  simple mechanism that connects a personal computer to a  television, but the function is said to be the same as  multimedia.    Multimedia personal computers carrying CD-ROM are becoming  the mainstream stand-alone type personal computer for home use  in the United States also. They are used for various purposes,  such as games and music entertainment and personal information  management, and it is said that "by 2000, the world personal  computer market will grow to $130 billion, and half of that will  be for home use" (Eckhard Pfeiffer, president, Compaq Computer  Corp.).    The fusion of television and personal computers, however,  means fighting between the personal computer division and the AV  [audiovisual] division.    In October 1993, Toshiba reorganized its personal  information  equipment division and video media division under the same  group. The objective was "to aim at a multiplier effect for  development of multimedia" (Koga). However, Matsushita, whose  computer division has embarked on television personal computers,  emphasizes that "the AV division will also probably put out  television personal computers in the future" (Miyake) and "the  early bird gets the worm." Such fighting applies also to home  electronics manufacturers and computer manufacturers. An officer  of IBM Japan forecasts a battle without honor, saying, "The  fence between home electronics and computers will collapse with  the appearance of television personal computers, and personal  computer manufacturers will come to fight in the home  electronics arena. To home electronics manufacturers, it  probably gives the impression that their own market is being  devastated by a stampede."    It cannot be overlooked that behind the possibility of  television and personal computer fusion are the popularity of  the basic "Windows" software, which is premised on CPU (central  processing unit) high performance and graphics processing, and  the provision of a hardware environment such as low price and  large-capacity memory storage. Sharp also trial-manufactured a  personal computer incorporating a television in 1982, but it  seems that the point now will be whether they can effectively  propose what can be done with the fusion of television and  personal computers.</p>

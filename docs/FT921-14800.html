			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Pakistan 'has N-bomb' The US believes Pakistan possesses the 'Islamic bomb' and fears it could become part of a nuclear-armed, fundamentalist Moslem bloc in Central Asia, a US senator said yesterday, Reuter writes from Islamabad. Pakistan has denied developing nuclear weapons, but Republican Senator Larry Pressler told a news conference in Islamabad that Washington was convinced it had a usable nuclear device. 'These are unenlightened, uninformed views of a man who has not studied this region seriously,' said Mr Sardar Asif Ali, economics minister of state, who recently led a Pakistani delegation to the newly independent states of Central Asia. Mr Pressler is vilified in Pakistan as the author of legislation under which all US military supplies and new economic aid were cut in 1990 over fears that Pakistan was making nuclear weapons.</p>

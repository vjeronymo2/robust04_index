			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: France to sell insurer stake The French government is planning to float a substantial part of its stake in Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance, the state-owned life insurance group, within the next few months, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said yesterday. He indicated, however, that the sale of shares in the insurance group would represent only a partial privatisation and that state institutions, including the Caisse des Depots et Consignations, would retain majority control. The French government holds about 43 per cent of the shares in CNP, the country's largest life insurance group with annual turnover of about FFr64bn (Dollars 11.35bn). According to the economy minister, the French government will relax its influence over Credit National, the private sector bank which was established in 1919 to help finance reconstruction after the first world war. Mr Alphandery said the government would surrender its right to appoint the chairman of the bank and its power of veto over board decisions. The announcement comes as public sector companies are bracing for a round of musical chairs. Between now and the end of September, 27 public sector chairmen will see their mandates expire. Many of the most important posts are unlikely to be affected because of recent appointments. These include Mr Jean Peyrelevade, at Credit Lyonnais, and Mr Loik le Floch-Prigent, who was moved last year from Elf Aquitaine to the head of Gaz de France. Question marks remain, however, over Mr Alain Gomez, chairman of Thomson, the electronics group, and Mr Jean Gandois, head of Pechiney, the aluminium group. Both are keen to retain their posts but Mr Gomez has already had his mandate renewed three times, the legal limit, and Mr Gandois is approaching retirement age.</p>

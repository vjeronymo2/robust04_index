			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CROWD JAMS KNOTT'S FOR A PARK FREEBIE;  </P> <P> VETERANS DAY: OFFER OF FREE ADMISSION TO MILITARY AND THEIR FAMILIES DREW  THOUSANDS TO THE AMUSEMENT CENTER. TRAFFIC BACKED UP AND PARK SECRETARIES  PULLED KP DUTY.  </P> <P> Knott's Berry Farm officials got more than they bargained for Monday when they  offered free Veterans Day admission to active and retired military service  people and their families.  </P> <P> So many people showed up for the freebie that the amusement park had to turn  away visitors at 1 p.m. The California Highway Patrol issued an alert advising  motorists to avoid Beach Boulevard because of the thousands of cars jamming  city streets en route to the park. And, amusement park secretaries found  themselves flipping burgers to help out besieged cooks at food stands.  </P> <P> The free admission was apparently broadcast at all Southern California military  commands and advertised in local newspapers. As a result, all seven parking  lots were full by early afternoon, forcing park officials to declare the event  a sellout.  </P> <P> "It was certainly greater than we expected. This would be comparable to a  Saturday during the summer," said park spokesman Stuart Zanville. "It was a  gratifying response to our invitation."  </P> <P> Park officials have extended the offer through Saturday, allowing families who  were turned away to return any time between now and then. However, for some  such as Edward and Bridgett Goins, who made the trip from San Diego with their  two young children, a rain check wasn't quite good enough.  </P> <P> "We have to plan trips like this, we can't just come," said Edward Goins, 26, a  staff sergeant at Edwards Air Force Base. "It took us a long time to get here."  </P> <P> Inside the gates, there were long lines to get on most rides. But for those who  had gotten in free, there was nothing but praise for the amusement park's  patriotic gesture.  </P> <P> "I think it was really nice that they did that," said Michelle Nelson, 24, who  came with her husband and two children from March Air Force Base in Riverside.  "It really inspires the guys and the girls in the military to see that people  care."  </P> <P> Admission usually costs $21 for adults, $17 for children 3 to 11 and $15 for  expectant mothers, seniors and disabled people.  </P> <P> For families of four like the Luteses of Bellflower, it was quite a bargain.  "We would normally have paid $56 plus," said Cathy Lutes. "I thank them very  much for doing this."  </P> <P> Because of the crowds, Knott's officials extended park hours until 8 p.m., two  hours past the normal closing time. Although the park refused to disclose  attendance figures for the day, fire officials estimated maximum park capacity  at about 20,000 people.  </P> <P> The free admission was originally intended only for the relatives of service  people serving in the Persian Gulf. But in honor of Veterans Day, Knott's  officials decided to admit free anyone who is currently serving in the  military, or retired, and their children ages 3 to 11.  </P> <P> After this year's experience, will they repeat the offer?  </P> <P> "We'll review it when the time comes," said park spokesman Bob Deuel. "But this  was kind of an unusual set of circumstances."  </P></p>

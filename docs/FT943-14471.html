			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Owners Abroad The market seemed comforted by Owners Abroad's reduced interim loss. But that is not necessarily good news. Bigger losses for tour operators at the half-way stage often point to an increase in capacity and higher annual profits. Owners' figures, though, are muddied by its increased Canadian exposure which counters the seasonality of UK package tours. The link-up with Thomas Cook also makes it hard to gauge what is happening to the underlying business. Nevertheless, Owners appears to be making good progress cutting costs and reinvigorating its operations. Its forthcoming re-branding exercise will be critical for the second phase of recovery. Owners' revival is made easier by the strong holiday market, with bookings up 13 per cent so far this year compared with 1993. BAA's passenger figures yesterday also confirmed how many Britons are joining the holiday brigade. But the real test for Owners will come when the market tightens again. The benign theory of the industry's future suggests that may not happen for a time. The big three operators, which control well over half the market, have grown sensible and sophisticated and averse to price wars. Besides, the industry is maturing and the barriers to entry are rising. More stable industry earnings should therefore be rated more highly by the stock market than in the past. But such arguments have been advanced before and confounded by experience. It still takes a leap of faith to regard tour operators as dependable investments.</p>

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Summary of the Statutory Requirements of the 1984 Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments, and Requirements of the 1993 Settlement Agreement With the Environmental Defense Fund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), enacted on November 8, 1984, largely prohibit the land disposal of untreated hazardous wastes. Once a hazardous waste is prohibited from land disposal, the statute provides only two options for legal land disposal: meet the treatment standard for the waste prior to land disposal, or dispose of the waste in a land disposal unit that has been found to satisfy the statutory no-migration test. A no-migration unit is one from which there will be no migration of hazardous constituents for as long as the waste remains hazardous. RCRA sections 3004 (d), (e), (g)(5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The treatment standards may be expressed as either constituent concentration levels or as specific methods of treatment. These standards must substantially diminish the toxicity of the waste or substantially reduce the likelihood of migration of hazardous constituents from the waste so that short-term and long-term threats to human health and the environment are minimized. RCRA section 3004(m)(1). For purposes of the restrictions, land disposal includes any placement of hazardous waste in a landfill, surface impoundment, waste pile, injection well, land treatment facility, salt dome formation, salt bed formation, or underground mine or cave. RCRA section 3004(k).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The land disposal restrictions are effective upon promulgation. RCRA section 3004(h)(1). However, the Administrator may grant a national capacity variance from the immediate effective date and establish a later effective date (not to exceed two years) based on the earliest date on which adequate alternative treatment, recovery, or disposal capacity which protects human health and the environment will be available. RCRA section 3004(h)(2). The Administrator may also grant a case-by-case extension of the effective date for up to one year, renewable once for up to one additional year, when an applicant successfully makes certain demonstrations. RCRA section 3004(h)(3). See 55 FR 22526 (June 1, 1990) for a more detailed discussion on national capacity variances and case-by-case extensions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, Congress prohibited the storage of any waste which is prohibited from land disposal unless such storage is to allow for the accumulation of such quantities of hazardous waste as are necessary to facilitate proper recovery, treatment or disposal. RCRA section 3004(j). For storage up to one year, EPA has taken the position that the agency bears the burden of proving that such storage was not solely for the purpose of accumulation of quantities necessary to facilitate proper recovery, treatment or disposal. 40 CFR 268.50(b). For storage beyond one year, however, the burden of proof shifts to the generator or owner/operator of a treatment, storage or disposal facility to demonstrate that such storage was solely for the purpose of accumulation of quantities necessary to facilitate proper recovery, treatment or disposal. 40 CFR 268.50(c). The provision applies, of course, only to storage which is not also defined in section 3004(k) as land disposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA was required to promulgate land disposal prohibitions and treatment standards by May 8, 1990 for all wastes that were either listed or identified as hazardous at the time of the 1984 amendments, RCRA sections 3004 (d), (e), and (g), a task EPA completed within the statutory timeframes. EPA was also required to promulgate prohibitions and treatment standards for wastes identified or listed as hazardous after the date of the 1984 amendments within six months after the listing or identification takes effect. RCRA section 3004(g)(4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency did not meet this latter statutory deadline for all of the wastes identified or listed after the 1984 amendments. As a result, a suit was filed by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). EPA and EDF signed a consent decree (lodged with but not entered by the District Court) that establishes a schedule for adopting prohibitions and treatment standards for newly identified and listed wastes. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EDF  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reilly,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Civ. No. 89&hyph;0598, D.D.C.) This proposed consent decree was recently modified as a result of the court decision on the Third Third final rule ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chemical Waste Management  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 976 F.2d 2 (D.C. Cir. 1992), cert. denied 113 S. Ct. 1961 (1993) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> CWM  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )). Today's rule fulfills several provisions of the proposed consent decree. The rule establishes treatment standards for newly listed coke by-product and chlorotoluene production wastes, and for the D018&hyph;D043 TC wastes (TC wastes identified as hazardous because of the presence of organic hazardous constituents) when these wastes are managed in systems other than those wastewater treatment systems whose discharge is regulated under the Clean Water Act (CWA), by zero-dischargers that do not engage in CWA-equivalent treatment prior to land disposal, and by injection into other than underground injection control (UIC) Class I deep injection wells regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Soils contaminated with these newly identified and listed wastes are also covered by this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, this rule prohibits injection into deep wells of high Total Organic Carbon ignitable wastes (D001) and Toxic Characteristic organic pesticides (D012&hyph;D017) unless they are treated to meet applicable treatment standards, or the deep well has received a no-migration variance. This last prohibition is in partial fulfillment of the settlement agreement following the D.C. Circuit's decision in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> CWM  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also modifying a number of the existing land disposal restrictions rules. Although not required by the settlements discussed above, these changes reflect EPA's updated technical knowledge, simplify implementation of the program, and provide greater programmatic consistency. In today's notice, EPA is establishing a set of treatment standards (called universal treatment standards) that apply to most hazardous wastes, changing requirements for land disposal of lab packs containing prohibited hazardous wastes, and simplifying paperwork requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

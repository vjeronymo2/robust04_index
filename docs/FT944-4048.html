			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Top jobs to be split in planned Warburg merger SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley, the investment banks that intend to merge to form a global bank next year, are to split the chief executive's role in the new organisation. They will also have an almost evenly balanced board of directors. The banks are likely to announce shortly that the board of the new holding company will have four executive directors from Morgan Stanley, and three from Warburg, with the banks' chief executives being named as co-presidents. The structure - under which each bank will nominate three non-executives to make up a 13-strong board - is likely to be cited by Warburg as evidence that the merger does not constitute a takeover by Morgan Stanley, the larger firm. Morgan Stanley's shareholders are to be offered two-thirds of the equity in the new firm, with Warburg's shareholders taking the remaining equity. The banks intend the merger to create the strongest global investment bank. The chairman of the new holding company is to be Mr Dick Fisher, Morgan Stanley's chairman, with Sir David Scholey, Warburg's chairman, becoming vice-chairman. Sir David was to step down from the helm of Warburg next year. The co-presidents in charge of the day-to-day running of the firm are to be Lord Cairns, Warburg's chief executive, and Mr John Mack, Morgan Stanley's president. Mr Mack was expected by observers to gain a stronger position in the new firm. The other executive director to be drawn from Warburg will be Mr Hugh Stevenson, chairman of Mercury Asset Management, which is 75 per cent owned by Warburg. Acquisition of MAM is thought to be a prime attraction for Morgan Stanley because it provides a stable stream of earnings. Warburg's shareholders yesterday reacted cautiously to the proposed merger, with many predicting that it would flush out rival offers. The formation of a joint company means that the premium price from an outside bid will not be paid. 'On the surface it looks as if Morgan Stanley is getting control of a damn good business very cheaply,' said one shareholder. Most institutions believe the move makes strategic sense, but is risky. 'These mergers are an incredibly difficult and dangerous business. With so much money and so many egos at stake they can go horribly wrong,' said one shareholder. The two firms are still working on the management structure of the new bank, after being forced to disclose the merger talks two weeks early when rumours in London led to a sharp rise in Warburg shares. Some Warburg executives believe that they retain a strong measure of geographical control over European operations in the new bank. although global responsibility is also likely to be allocated for functions such as equity broking.

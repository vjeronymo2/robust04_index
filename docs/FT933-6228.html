			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Sport: Courier faces the heat again - Tennis THE LAST great traditional event of the year, the US Open, starts next week in New York with record prizemoney of just over Dollars 9m, more than double what it was five years ago. There is equal prizemoney for men and women (an absurdity, this) and the two champions will each win Dollars 535,000. Not that the players will be thinking about the money when they play. They never do; pride and ambition predominate. But there is an unusual sense of expectancy this year, at least among the men, where the battle for the No 1 spot is still raging fiercely. There is no clear leader. The three Grand Slam championships have produced three different winners, though the doughty American, Jim Courier, has been in in all three finals. Last January he beat Sweden's Stefan Edberg in the sweltering heat of Melbourne. Then, on another hot day in Paris, he surprisingly lost the French title he had held for two years to Sergi Bruguera. At Wimbledon, on yet another scorching afternoon, fellow American Pete Sampras beat Courier - narrowly - on fast grass. Will Courier triumph at Flushing Meadow to stamp himself unquestionably as the man of the year? That is a teasing question. The seedings say he will: having regained the world No 1 ranking with his victory last week at Indianapolis, the 23-year-old Floridian is the official favourite. Yet this normally rock-hard competitor has displayed a soft centre at key moments this year, as he has done for the last two years in New York. In 1991, after storming through to the final, he was thrashed by Edberg with the finest tennis I have ever seen from the Swede. Last year Sampras thwarted him in the semi-final. Perhaps Courier's fine win over Becker last Sunday in Indianapolis will give him the confidence. Sampras knows all about confidence - or rather, lack of it. In Indianapolis he was shattered by a 7-6 6-7 7-6 quarter-final loss to the 20-year-old Australian Patrick Rafter, ranked at 139. That defeat lost Sampras the top ranking and demoted him to the No 2 seeding next week. Having now glanced at the draw, Sampras must feel that the fates are against him. Whereas Courier has the quietest section, with No 15 seed Cedric Pioline of France as his fourth round opponent, at the bottom Sampras must face Andre Agassi. Even though the erratic but colourful 1992 Wimbledon champion, described by Alistair Cooke as 'the Las Vegas lollipop', has slipped to No 16, he will have a tremendous following among New York's crazy fans. Of course, both must win their first three rounds, but on the evidence of Thursday's draw that seems likely. If he survives, Sampras will probably have a quarter-final against in-form Michael Chang who won in Cincinnati two weeks ago. In seven meetings since 1989 Pete has won only once. That was on a fast indoor carpet in Paris two years ago. In their five matches on hard courts Pete has won only one set. This is a psychological block that goes back to their junior days. Pete's best hope is that the powerful Czech left-hander Petr Korda (9) or last year's quarter-finalist, Wayne Ferreira of South Africa, who meet in a testing first round match, will beat Chang first. The holder, Edberg, is also in the tougher bottom half. Seeded No 3 and as delighted with life as any new father, Stefan faces a fourth round meeting with an old enemy, Alexander Volkov. The 14th seeded Russian upset Edberg dramatically in the first round in 1990. The winner is due to face Michael Stich, seeded No 6, another who always gives Edberg trouble. The German has won three of their last four meetings. The top half, though weaker overall, has its strong sections. Below Courier are the tall Ukrainian Andrei Medvedev (8), a winner of three titles already in 1993, and the tall Dutchman, Richard Krajicek (10). They have met twice. Last February Krajicek won indoors and in April Medvedev prevailed on clay. However, Krajicek could easily lose to his probable third round opponent, Todd Martin. The fast-improving Martin has risen to a career-high ranking of 17. The continuing absence of defending champion Monica Seles has robbed the women's game of any real interest. Since Seles was stabbed at court-side in April, Steffi Graf has dominated. She has won seven tournaments this year and should add an eighth in New York. But perhaps Martina Navratilova will give us a last hurrah. At the age of 36, Navratilova should not really be capable of taking this title for the fifth time. But how do you write off someone who won her eighth Los Angeles title recently to bring her career record of tournament victories to 165? I am particularly looking forward to the first live use of TEL on four of the show courts. This automatic line call system is the first to cover all the lines of the court. After pressure from the players there will be linesmen, too - a sensible decision which should rule out any uncertainty on those calls beyond the system's 1ft range. HOW THE SEEDS WOULD MEET MEN 1 Courier v 15 Pioline; 10 Krajicek v 8 Medvedev; 4 Becker v 13 Lendl; 11 Ivanisevic v 5 Bruguera; 6 Stich v 12 Muster; 14 Volkov v 3 Edberg; 7 Chang v 9 Korda; 16 Agassi v 2 Sampras. WOMEN 1 Graf v 13 Pierce; 15 Coetzer v 5 Sabatini; 4 Martinez v 11 Maleeva-Fragniere; 9 Huber v 8 Novotna; 7 Capriati v 10 M Maleeva; 12 Sukova v 3 Navratilova; 6 M J Fernandez v 16 Garrison Jackson; 14 Tauziat v 2 Sanchez-Vicario.</p>

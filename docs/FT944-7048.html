			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Bids sought for adviser to Railtrack sell-off Leading investment banks were yesterday invited to bid to advise on the privatisation of Railtrack, the company running British Rail's track, signalling and stations. The government has given investment banks between two and three weeks to submit proposals. It then expects to decide by Christmas. The Railtrack privatisation is the last significant sell-off for the foreseeable future. The mandate represents a last chance for banks to build a record for advising on privatisation. There is nevertheless some concern that rail privatisation will get caught up in the political battle in the run-up to the next election. Mr Christopher Clarke, a director at Samuel Montagu, the merchant bank, said: 'I think that anybody who works for government has to recognise that there are political considerations as well as the vagaries of the market.' Leading contenders are thought by the investment banking sector to include the UK houses with long track records in privatisation. These include Kleinwort Benson, which advised on the privatisation of the electricity industry. It believes that the experience of restructuring a sector before sale will prove particularly relevant to the Railtrack bid. Kleinwort laid claim to expertise in the sector with an analyst's report putting a real market value on Railtrack of between Pounds 3.3bn and Pounds 4.3bn. Samuel Montagu said it would bid in conjunction with James Capel, its sister broker, and perhaps a third party, notwithstanding its role in advising the government on rail privatisation in general. SG Warburg, the Barings group, and Schroders are also believed to be potential bidders. But Barclays de Zoete Wedd, which some tipped as a competitor, said it did not think it would go for the mandate. An executive said: 'It is going to be quite difficult and terribly resource-intensive.' BZW is already involved in the flotation of coal company RJB Mining and several other privatisation-related transactions. NM Rothschild is unlikely to make a bid as it already advises Railtrack on privatisation.</p>

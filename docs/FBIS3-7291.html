Japan did away with its special treatment of  Indochinese refugees on March 4 in line with an international  agreement on the screening system.    Vietnamese boat people arriving in Japan in the future will  receive the same treatment as any other arrival.    Of the 13,768 boat people who landed since May 1975, when  Vietnamese refugees first arrived, 3,416 are Vietnamese who  opted for permanent settlement, officials said. The ministry  said that in the same period 3,498 Chinese nationals posing as  Vietnamese refugees also arrived in Japan, although their  numbers have fallen off in recent years.    Other Vietnamese have gone to third countries to settle and  those posing as refugees have been forcibly repatriated.    A June 1989 international conference on Indochinese refugees  adopted the set of special screening measures to determine  whether they qualified for refugee status. But with subsequent  changes in Vietnam, a conference in February elected to revise  the measures, and Japan's cabinet gave its approval to abandon  them as of March 4.</p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Tesco acts against Telegraph TESCO supermarket group intends to join some independent newsagents in refusing to stock The Daily Telegraph tomorrow in the latest development of a dispute over the retailers' margins. The newsagents are complaining that the price of the Telegraph's Saturday editions has risen to 60p at the same time as their margins have been cut from 26.5 per cent to 25 per cent. Tesco said it would remove the newspaper from sale 'due to a reduction in trading terms'. In a separate move, the High Court yesterday made an order preventing the National Federation of Retail Newsagents and the magazine Retail Newsagent from making any comment on the dispute. The court also made permanent an emergency injunction that was granted to the Telegraph last week against the August 15 issue of Retail Newsagent, which advised its readers to act in their own interests and take the Telegraph off the shelves. The Telegraph agreed not to distribute any further letters to newsagents warning them that keeping copies of the paper off display and returning them to wholesalers for refunds could be interpreted as fraud. W H Smith, which acts as a wholesaler as well as a retailer, has continued to sell The Daily Telegraph. Two smaller chains - Forbuoys and Martin's - have kept the newspaper off display for the last two weekends, only selling it when requested.</p>

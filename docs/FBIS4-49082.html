			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Jianwei (3769 1696 0251), deputy director of the </F> Editing and Research Office of the Political Department of the  Guangzhou Military Region: "It Is Necessary To Consolidate the  Authority of the Central Leadership"]    [Text] In Volume 3 of Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly stressed the need to  maintain and consolidate the authority of the central  leadership. This is an important idea that Comrade Xiaoping has  stressed many times in the process of leading reform and  construction in our country, and is an important component of  his theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics.  It is certainly of great immediate significance to study this  concept of Comrade Xiaoping's in connection with the realities  in our present reform, opening, and economic construction.  <H8>  I. </H8>   Why is it necessary to stress the need of consolidating the  authority of the central leadership while it is necessary to  decontrol and enliven things in the course of developing the  socialist market economy?    Consolidating the authority of the central leadership  is a need in the development of the socialist market  economy. Although the market can play an effective role in  the distribution of resources, it is not a panacea and has its  own weaknesses and deficiencies. For example, it is hardly  possible for the market to completely guarantee the balance  between gross demand and gross supply in society, and this may  cause periodic fluctuations in economic development; it is hard  to maintain a reasonable order of competition within a short  period of time; it can hardly solve the issues of  infrastructural construction and environmental protection  required by economic development; and it can hardly ensure  fairness in the distribution of resources and wealth. The  settlement of all these issues requires the government's  necessary macrocontrol and management over market activities.  Macrocontrol is, in essence, central control. Therefore, the  authority of the central leadership must be consolidated.    Consolidating the authority of the central leadership  is a need in reform, opening, and economic invigoration.  In view of the fact that some people were keen to adopt their  own countermeasures against the policies laid down by the upper  authorities in the course of reform and opening up, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping seriously pointed out: "In order to make reform a  success, we must carry it out in an orderly way under unified  leadership. Otherwise, there will be disorder everywhere, and  people will just go their own way. How could reform be  successful under such circumstances?" He also said: "We must  fix a principle. That is, reform should be carried out in depth  under the unified leadership of the central authorities." China  is a large country. Reform in such a large country will  inevitably lead to the adjustment of interest relations in  various aspects. At the same time, China is a developing  country, and is facing such problems as an ill-coordinated  production structure and an undergrown market, so we will  inevitably encounter various difficulties when carrying out  reform and establishing the socialist market economic structure  if "the party Central Committee and the State Council lose their  authority and cannot control the situation." In practice, our  reform's successes were attributed to the fact that reform was  carried out in an orderly way under unified leadership.  According to different conditions, major reform measures were  adopted after corresponding backup measures were ready in some  cases, or after pilot schemes were carried out and successful  experience was gained in other cases. This prevented a shock to  society. For example, without the leadership of the party  central body and the State Council and without the authority of  the party central body and the State Council, the macrocontrol  in 1993 would not have achieved the expected results.    Consolidating the authority of the central leadership  is a need in the correct handling of relations between  localities and a need in accelerating our economic  development. Ours is a large socialist country with vast  territory, and local economic development is uneven. Reform and  opening up enables the southeast coastal areas to give full play  to their economic and geological advantages and to develop ahead  of other areas, thus bringing along economic development in  other localities. However, such uneven development is also  directly related to the issue of local interests. In order to  correctly handle such interest relations and settle such  contradictions, there must be the authority of the central  leading body. Comrade Xiaoping predicted this issue long ago,  and pointed out that the early development of the coastal areas  "will bring along better development in interior areas, and this  is a matter concerning the overall situation. The interior  localities should take the overall situation and overall  interests into account. As development continues, the coastal  areas will be required to make greater contributions to help the  interior localities develop, and this is also an issue  concerning the overall situation. At that moment, the coastal  areas should also subject themselves to this overall interest.  All this will not be possible if there is no central authority."    Consolidating the authority of the central  leadership is a need in giving play to the superiority of the  socialist system and tiding over difficulties. When  mentioning the superiority of the socialist system, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping always linked it with the authority of the central  leadership. He pointed out: "As compared with capitalism,  socialism's superiority is reflected in the fact that the whole  country can be coordinated as a chess game and strength can be  concentrated to guarantee key projects." Ours is a socialism  with the means of production mainly in public ownership, and the  people share the same fundamental interests. The party and the  government can concentrate the strength of the whole nation to  arrange key projects in the national economy according to the  long-term fundamental interests of the entire people. In times  of difficulty, the party and the government can mobilize the  strength of all quarters to overcome and tide over difficulties.  For an economically backward large country, all this is  indispensable. In view of the fact that too many "local lords"  went their own ways and this made it impossible to make or carry  out decisions on important matters, Comrade Deng Xiaoping  sharply pointed out: "Nobody is allowed to disobey the  instructions of the central leadership and the State Council.  In particular, in times of difficulty, without the authority of  the central leadership and the State Council, it is impossible  to solve problems. With such authority, great accomplishments  can still be made in times of difficulty. The authority cannot  be denied, and centralization should be effected if necessary;  otherwise, at the very least, time may be wasted." This year,  the CPC Central Committee and the State Council made sufficient  preparations for the adoption of the new reform schemes.  However, no reform scheme could be perfectly designed before it  was put into practice, and the reform tasks remain arduous and  complicated. In order to overcome the difficulties of  structural reforms, the authority of the central leadership must  be consolidated. This is an important guarantee for our efforts  to further deepen reform and promote the establishment of the  socialist market economic structure.  <H8>  II. </H8>   By stressing the need to consolidate the authority of the  central leadership, we do not mean that we should use the  previous methods. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out long ago:  "In the past, we just exercised management on the basis of  poverty; now, things are different, and we are exercising  macromanagement for the purpose of building a comparatively  well-off society. We cannot continue to use the methods we used  in the past when we were facing difficulties. Now the central  authorities should issue instructions and wield power only on  major issues and on issues concerning the general orientation."  Here he explicitly pointed out the two different methods of  consolidating central authority in the different periods.    The content of consolidating the central authority has  changed. In the past, the government was both manager and  direct investor. It had to control the overall scale and  structure of the economy, and also had to take care of  microeconomic input and output. This caused a situation in  which the government's functions were lumped together with those  of enterprises, and enterprises did not have any decisionmaking  powers. At present, the economic activities of enterprises are  oriented to the market, and enterprises will become units  operating independently on their own and bearing sole  responsibility for their profits and losses. In such  circumstances, the government's control over the market will  only be found on "major issues and issues concerning the general  orientation." That is, the government will just take care of  the overall balance and the optimization of the overall  structure. The microeconomic decisionmaking powers will be  delegated to the enterprises, which will make decisions on their  own according to market signals. At present, the central  authorities have stressed the need to resolutely control the  size of investment in fixed assets and to continue to stabilize  and develop the rural economy. This is exactly the concrete  expression of macrocontrol.    The method of exercising central authority has  changed. In the past, the government laid down various  targets to determine the scope of the enterprises' economic  activities, and directly managed the enterprises' production,  product marketing, and materials procurement, as well as the  enterprises' personnel, material, and financial affairs. At  present, the government mainly applies economic means, guiding  enterprises with the market mechanism to bring their activities  into line with the overall macroeconomic development targets.  In the past, the government managed the economy according to  the administrative powers of the departments and the local  authorities, and arranged projects and distributed money and  materials according to the plans. At present, the government  mainly applied the economic and legal means to ensure the  implementation of the development programs, to coordinate the  interest relations of the market entities, to supervise market  operation, and to provide necessary services for the market. Of  course, the government can still use administrative power if  necessary to interfere in economic activities. The reform  measures of the fiscal, tax, and banking systems adopted this  year showed that the CPC Central Committee and the State Council  mainly applied economic means to exercise macrocontrol.   <H8>    III. </H8>   What should be done in order to consolidate the authority of  the central leadership? Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out:  "This should find expression in the effectiveness of the  central instructions." To achieve this purpose, two points must  be stressed:    First, take overall interests into account. To do  this, we should first understand the overall interests. This  year, the general guideline for the work of the whole party and  the whole nation is: Grasp the opportunity, deepen reform,  expand opening, promote development, and maintain stability.  The whole party must clearly understand this general guideline  which represents the overall interests, consider and handle  things according to this guideline, and bring things into line  with the guideline. Second, we should understand the importance  of safeguarding overall interests. Take this year's fiscal and  tax reform as an example. If such reform is not carried out, the  state's financial revenue will account for too small a  percentage of the gross national product, and the government  will have no sufficient financial capacity for performing its  administrative functions and for making reasonable and effective  redistribution of the limited resources among various  localities. It is obvious that such a situation must not  continue. Moreover, it is necessary to correctly handle the  relationship between the partial interests and the overall  interests and between the immediate interests and long-term  interests. Some things may be feasible in certain localities,  but they may not be acceptable to the overall interests; some  things may not be desirable according to local interests, but  they must be done according to the overall interests. So we  must take the overall interests into account. At present, some  local governments and some departments only care about their  partial and immediate interests. They do not act in unison with  the central authorities' macrocontrol. For example, as the  scale of investment in fixed assets is too large, some comrades  are still keen to start new projects and expand investment, and  are still keen to vie with each other in rapid growth and in  ostentation and extravagance, and some comrades recklessly  issued shares and bonds without regard to the financial needs of  the state's key construction projects. All this went against  our current overall interests. All localities and departments  must always take the overall interests into account, and must  always make their partial and immediate interests subordinate to  the overall and long-term interests of the whole nation.    Second, stress discipline. While resolutely  carrying out the new reform measures adopted by the party  central leadership and the State Council, it is also necessary  to continue the resolute enforcement of the discipline laid down  by the party central leadership and the State Council for  macrocontrol. For example, the fiscal and taxation department  should continue to resolutely carry out the regulations laid  down by the State Council: Strictly control tax reductions,  strictly control financial expenditures; stop bank overdrafts;  and do not get involved in commercial credit business without  the approval of the People's Bank of China. This year, the  tasks of reform and development are arduous. As long as we can  willingly safeguard and consolidate the authority of the central  leadership, unify understanding and action under the leadership  of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, take the  overall interests into account, and observe discipline, then we  will certainly be able to maintain stability, promote  development, and win the tough reform battle.</p>

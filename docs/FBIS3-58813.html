The chief of the Social Democratic Party of Austria  [SPOe] said that all objective facts speak against such a form  of national defense; moreover, Busek's move had come "absolutely  at the wrong time." The restructuring of the Army, which was  agreed upon in 1992, would only be implemented in two years and,  therefore, one could not think about introducing something new  now. In addition, a regular army would be much too expensive  and had not proven successful in other countries. Defense  Minister Werner Fasslabend (OeVP) said it should not be  forbidden to discuss the idea of a regular army. However, in  view of the current threat, the strength of the militia army  could not be reduced in the next few years. [passage omitted]</p>

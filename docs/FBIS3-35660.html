"Georgia takes advantage of such signing today to prepare  military actions against Abkhazia and South Ossetia,"  Dzhindzholia said answering a question from Interfax at a news  conference in Sukhumi on Friday.    In his words, Georgia is actively preparing for war, which  is  evident from recent events on its border with Abkhazia (he may  have meant Georgia's attempt to land a force in Abkhazia's Gal  region on January 25 - IF).    For this reason, to his judgement, there is nothing more  important now than to deploy peace-keepers on the border between  Abkhazia and Georgia. In his words, the UN Security Council may  pass the final decision on the issue within a day or two.    On the possibility of refugees returning to the republic,  Dzhindzholia stressed the need for caring first of all about  those who live in Abkhazia now and only then speak about the  refugees' return.    He reported that the economic sanctions imposed on Abkhazia  by Russia at the end of last September had only been eased  rather than drooped altogether. "Paradoxically," Dzhindzholia  remarked, "even though Russia signed in Geneva a document with  an appeal to the world community to help Abkhazia, it has never  lifted its economic sanctions against the republic."</p>

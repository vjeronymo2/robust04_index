			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Production hopes rise at Daf plant MANAGERS and trade unions at the Leyland Daf van plant in Birmingham indicated last night that at least one main component supplier had declared its willingness to resume deliveries, opening the way to resumed limited production later this week. It was also confirmed that accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand would advise a group of the Birmingham plant's managers seeking to launch a buy-out bid. Coopers &amp; Lybrand said the management team, led by managing director Mr Allen Amery, had started to develop a business strategy. Coopers' initial task will be to help produce a 'robust' plan and secure the necessary investment for the buy-out to proceed. Mr Ken Ogilvie, the Coopers partner responsible for the project, said 'we believe the Allen Amey management team is in a strong position to secure the future of the plant', which employs nearly 1,400 people at the Washwood Heath, Birmingham, factory. Some of the company's biggest customers, including the Royal Mail and Parcelforce, confirmed their intention not to cancel orders for vans while a reasonable prospect of rescue remained. National and local union officials also decided at a meeting in Birmingham yesterday to back any management buy-out and to continue campaigning to keep the plants open. There was a narrow vote against industrial action. This followed a vote last week at Leyland, Lancashire, that was heavily against a strike. Production workers at the Albion factory in Glasgow have balloted in favour of industrial action but will not go ahead with action. Mr John Carty, Glasgow district secretary of the AEEU electrical and engineering union, said: 'We are not going on strike. What was hoped was that other plants would join us in a national type of action throughout Leyland Daf.' Mr John Allen, AEEU chief negotiator, said after the Birmingham vote: 'We have now got to get on with the job of saving the plant. We'll leave no stone unturned in our endeavour to achieve this.' Ownership of the intellectual property in Daf's operations in Lancashire may be a factor in deciding whether the Netherlands company's UK truckmaking businesses can be bought as a separate concern. Leaders of Lancashire Enterprises, the privatised regeneration agency which acts for Lancashire County Council, will meet Mr Cornelius Baan, chairman of Daf's board of managers in Eindhoven today. There is strong local interest in mounting a rescue package, probably brokered by Lancashire Enterprises, which has venture capital funds of its own and experience in syndicating big deals with other financial institutions. The right to use the ideas in design and production management being worked on by the company's design department in Leyland would make the company more attractive to a buyer. Mr Jim Mason, chairman of Lancashire Enterprises, and Mrs Louise Ellman, his vice-chairman and Labour leader of the county council, played a role in the management buy-out of Leyland Bus six years ago, securing government and EC help with a Pounds 1m retraining package.</p>

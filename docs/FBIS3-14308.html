According to our correspondent in Paris, he called for  strengthening the original arrangements with the aim of  preserving peace and security and reducing tensions.    The head of the Iranian parliamentary delegation to the 91st  conference of the Inter-parliamentary Union held the big powers  responsible for regional conflicts. He said: Just world bodies  belonging to the nations are needed to prevent and stop these  crises. Mr. Yahyavi said: This is the responsibility of the UN  but, unfortunately, the decisionmaking Security Council and the  Secretary General often act under the influence of the big  powers.    He said: A clear example in this connection is the dual  policy of the Security Council vis-a-vis the Bosnian issue and  the prevention of the despatch of peacekeeping force from the  Islamic countries on the hollow pretext that it will be siding  with the Bosnian Muslims, and that too at a time when troops  from other countries that have close ties with the Serbs have  been despatched to Bosnia.    The head of the Iranian parliamentary delegation stressed  that the different ways in which the Security Council has dealt  with the Iraqi aggression against Islamic Iran and that  country's aggression against Kuwait are the other examples of  the Security Council's dual performance.    Mr. Yahyavi said: The Security Council's decisions should be  made in an open climate and by being away from behind-the-door  collusions.</p>

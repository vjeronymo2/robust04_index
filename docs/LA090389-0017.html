			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNION CONTRIBUTIONS STILL VITAL TO AMERICA'S WELL-BEING  </P> <P> I would like to express my opinion about the Aug. 13 Viewpoint, "Making a Case  for Unions."  </P> <P> One of the most durable and influential kinds of labor organizations promoting  improvements in worker legislation are AFL-CIO central labor bodies and state  federations of labor around the United States.  </P> <P> These vital units (their leaders never sleep) sponsor legislation, or  amendments to existing legislation, in state capitals around the country.  Currently, for example, the California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, is leading  the way in cooperation with management and the governor for a complete overhaul  of California's workers' compensation statute.  </P> <P> Here in Los Angeles County we have one of the heaviest concentrations of local  unions in the world. Some 400 locals are affiliated with the Los Angeles County  Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, the largest central labor body in the United  States.  </P> <P> Historically, the leaders of this powerful labor organization have pushed year  after year for improvements in legislation to increase the benefits to  unemployed workers through unemployment and disability insurance coverage.  </P> <P> Union haters should be reminded that any increases in workers' compensation,  unemployment or disability benefits from union-sponsored bills passed into law  by state legislatures, are benefits available to all injured or unemployed  workers who qualify -- union and non-union alike.  </P> <P> The role of craft unions in promoting additional skilled manpower for America's  work force through apprenticeships should not be forgotten. Carpenters,  electricians, plasterers, bricklayers, plumbers and painters must complete  four-year apprenticeship programs to reach journeyman status.  </P> <P> Local unions in these trades, and in other occupations that use apprentices,  are a vital part of our economic past, present and future. They are here to  stay. We should look upon these kinds of unions with appreciation and pride  because they are among the key elements in building a better, quality America.  </P> <P> JACK L. RUGH  </P> <P> San Gabriel  </P> <P> Former California Labor Relations Specialist  </P></p>

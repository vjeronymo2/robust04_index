			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia says the international community may have  no choice but to take stronger action against North Korea  following its decision to withdraw from the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA]. Camille Funnell reports in a statement  issued from New York Australia's foreign minister, Senator  Evans, called on North Korea to reconsider its decision:    [Begin Funnell recording] Senator Evans said uncertainty  about the nature of North Korea's nuclear activity is the cause  of instability in the Asia-Pacific region, and he said it  undermines the interest of all countries in the region in  preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. Senator Evans warned  the international community will have little choice but to take  stronger action, including through the United Nations Security  Council, if North Korea does not display a more constructive  position. He said it is in everyone's interest, not the least  to North Korea, to reconsider its decision and return to the  negotiating table. [end recording]</p>

The organisation, which held an extraordinary meeting in  Beirut this week, said the Libyan authorities were most probably  behind the abduction of Mansur al-Kikhya who vanished on  December 11 in the Egyptian capital where he was attending a  conference of Arab human rights group.    The organisation invited Libya in a statement distributed to  the press in the Lebanese capital to "counter these suspicions  based on official Libyan declarations made around this date,  calling for the elimination of the opposition and killing its  leaders."    The head of the Arab human rights organisation, Adib  al-Jadir, told AFP that al-Qadhdhafi made such statements on  December 12.    Al-Kikhya, 63, served as foreign minister under Colonel  Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi in the 1970s and represented Libya at the  United Nations between 1976 and 1980. He later became the  leader of the main opposition movement the National Rally.    The Libyan opposition has accused the Libyan government of  kidnapping al-Kikhya. Tripoli denied any involvement in the  affair, saying he was a victim of a feud between opposition  groups.    Friday's statement also urged Egypt to "pursue its efforts  to  guarantee the return of Mr. al-Kikhya."    The human rights group is a Cairo-based non-governmental  organisation, founded 10 years ago with members from all over  the Arab world and offices in 15 Arab cities and six European  capitals.</p>

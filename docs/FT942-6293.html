			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Traders braced for supply of long-dated state debt European government bonds drifted sideways in thin volume and eurobond issuance ground to a halt as UK and US markets were closed for national holidays. However, supply looms large this week, with several markets preparing to absorb long-dated government bond issuance. The Bundesbank is expected this week to announce the German government's first 10-year bund since last September, which is expected to be issued within the first 10 days of June and seen totalling around DM10bn. Meanwhile, after selling L4,000bn of three and five-year notes yesterday, Italy plans to issue another L5,500bn of seven-, 10 and 30-year paper. In addition, France is to issue FFr20bn, which most traders expect to be raised via a new 10-year benchmark, while Sweden's National Debt Office yesterday called for bids for Friday's auction of SKr3bn of 20-year index-linked bonds. Continuing uncertainty in the US market is also likely to weigh on the markets, with traders nervously eyeing Friday's release of the latest US jobs data. All this is expected to lead to further yield curve steepening in Europe, with investors still unwilling to commit funds to the longer-dated instruments. After last week's losses, German government bonds posted small gains yesterday. The June bund futures contract on DTB rose 0.13 point to 93.60. Bundesbank officials last week indicated that their securities repurchase rate could continue declining even if cuts in official rates remain on hold for now, so dealers this week will be watching the German central bank's latest repo operation for an indication of continued easing. 'If they lower the repo rate by five basis points, that would allow the Bank of France to cut (its intervention rate) by 10 basis points on Thursday,' said Mr Steve Major, head of bond research at Credit Lyonnais in Paris. The French central bank left its intervention rate unchanged at 5.40 per cent yesterday. Moody's Investors Service has lowered the Canadian Province of Ontario's long-term debt rating to Aa3 from Aa2, matching Standard &amp; Poor's downgrading to AA- from AA in November. The move followed a review of the province's financial and debt outlook and reflects the fact that Ontario's budgetary imbalance is likely to remain sizeable and wider than forecast. Moody's added that debt levels will continue rising rapidly given the anticipated requirements needed to fund the deficit and increasing non-budgetary spending. In addition, next year's provincial election and growing debt servicing costs could affect the pace of fiscal recovery in the next few years. The Hellenic Republic announced on Friday it has awarded the mandate for its Dollars 500m syndicated loan to a group of banks led by NatWest and Mitsubishi Bank. Following last week's downgrading of Greece by Moody's to Baa1 from Baa3, some bankers say the all-in price may have to be above initial indications of around 110 basis points above Libor, closer to 120 over. From June 1, Irish government bonds will be accepted for custody, clearance and settlement in the Cedel system. Cross-border settlement between a Cedel customer and a counterparty in the Irish market will be possible against payment in Irish pounds through Citibank Dublin, the Cedel depositary in Ireland. The Cedel system now includes links with 18 domestic markets and, with the inclusion of Ireland, government bonds from 13 European countries are now eligible in the system. Internationale Nederlanden Bank has established a Dollars 3bn euro medium-term note programme, arranged by Merrill Lynch, which will facilitate issuance denominated in a variety of currencies, the bank said.</p>

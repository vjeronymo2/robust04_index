			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Nikolaos Bellos] </F>   [Text] The messages that we have so far are hopeful. We  are continuously coordinating with UN mediator Cyrus Vance and  European Union [EU] Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek. We have  good faith, a desire to achieve a solution, and optimism. This  is how Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias addressed the European  Parliament [EP] plenary session in Strasbourg, presenting the  latest developments in Skopje [The former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM]. Papoulias was speaking just a few hours  before his important meeting with Vance tomorrow.    The foreign minister briefed the deputies on the issue of  Skopje and clearly presented the Greek positions and the reasons  that led the government to adopt measures against Skopje.  Referring to Skopje's continuing aggression, Papoulias  described the measures as an extreme means of self-defense  toward this Republic's intransigence and expansionist designs.    Van Den Broek, who has taken over the effort to approach  Athens and Skopje, stressed he is in continuous contact with the  two sides. He added that in coordination with the United  Nations, efforts are being made for a peaceful settlement of the  problem. Referring to the measures that the government adopted  unilaterally against Skopje, Van Den Broek stressed that they  equal trade sanctions and concern the EU. The commissioner said  he hopes the measures will be lifted soon and that both sides  will make efforts to resolve the problem. Concluding, Van Den  Broek said that Skopje depends on Greece financially but that  stability in Skopje is in Greece's best interest.    In their majority, the representatives of the political  groups said they oppose the Greek measures and asked the Greek  Government to lift them. They also asked Skopje to remove the  symbols from the flag and change its Constitution.    Replying to questions from the deputies, Papoulias stressed  that Greece does not want tension in the area, and that it has  always been and continues to be a factor of stability in the  Balkans. He said: Our side is ready to overcome the current  tension with preliminary discussions, but [FYROM President Kiro]  Gligorov must also show goodwill.</p>

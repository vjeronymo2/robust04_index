			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (2): Recession appears to be ending - The economy The longest and deepest recession Sweden has suffered since before the Second World War appears, at last, to be ending. 'The signs that we see seem to indicate that the recovery is there - and slightly better than we thought. It is time we had some good news,' said Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister who has had the unenviable task of steering the economy through the hard times. The upturn will not show up in this year's overall growth figure. The government's estimate for 1993 is that gross domestic product has contracted by 2.8 per cent, much sharper than the successive retreats of 1.7 per cent in each of 1991 and 1992. But the trends show that the economy hit bottom around mid-year and has since been edging upwards. Industrial production, fuelled by a resurgence of export growth, has risen this year by approaching 2 per cent after a fall of 3 per cent last year. In 1994, the government predicts gross domestic product growth of 2 per cent. The scars of recession, however, will take much longer to heal and, with an election looming next September, the political debate over the appropriate structure for Sweden's economy for the remainder of the century is sharpening. As the country moves tentatively out of recession it is carrying some heavy burdens. The budget deficit stands at more than 13 per cent of GDP and is set to rise higher - to an estimated 15 per cent of GDP in the 1993-94 budget year. This has pushed up central government debt from about SKr600bn in 1990 to more than SKr1,000bn, or about 70 per cent of GDP, inevitably stacking up a heavy repayment schedule for the future. Above all, the recession has seen a leap in unemployment unprecedented in Sweden, which until the late 1980s saw itself as having created the elusive formula of combining a strong welfare state with virtual full employment. In 1989, 'open' unemployment - excluding those on government training schemes - stood at less than 2 per cent of the workforce. Today, open unemployment is more than 8.5 per cent, with a further 5 per cent of the workforce on training schemes. In confronting what to do about unemployment, policymakers face a striking contrast between the external and internal sectors. What growth has been rekindled in the economy has come largely from export industries which have benefited hugely from the 25 per cent fall in the value of the Swedish krona that followed the flotation of the currency in November 1992. Exports are set to rise 6 per cent this year and a further 9 per cent next year, moving the current account balance into surplus. But the domestic economy, the engine of significant employment creation, has remained mired in recession. Government curbs on the public sector have been partly responsible. The centre-right coalition has taken SKr77bn out of the budget over the past two years and plans to extract a further SKr80bn over the next four years, mostly through lower public spending. However, a dramatic shift in savings patterns by the public has also had a profound effect. The removal of generous tax breaks on debt interest, collapsing house prices, rising unemployment and general uncertainty about future prosperity have provoked a wave of debt consolidation and saving. The household sector savings ratio has swung from minus 5 per cent to plus 11 per cent of income in just a few years. The result has been a sharp contraction of private consumption, by 2 per cent in 1992 and more than 5 per cent this year. This is significant because private consumption makes up 55 per cent of GDP. Mrs Wibble hopes there will be a small recovery in private consumption next year, fuelled by interest rates that have fallen to about 5 per cent. But the best most economists expect is about 1 per cent growth. On top of that outlook, net investment in the economy is still falling - by 10 per cent this year - and is not expected to recover until 1995. The gloomy state of the domestic economy has prompted the opposition Social Democratic party to insist that there must be a stimulus to demand to help generate growth, suggesting cuts in VAT and delays in increases in other indirect taxes. 'We fear that domestic demand will not lift the economy next year,' says Mr Goran Persson, the Social Democratic shadow finance minister. 'We think for 1994 we need to stimulate the economy. If we don't there is a danger of a downward spiral to depression.' Mrs Wibble and the centre-right government are anxious to lower taxes as part of their commitment to a market-driven economy. This year, they have made room for removing tax on dividends. But for now, Mrs Wibble says, reducing the budget deficit must have priority. 'We are not going to introduce any fiscal stimulus because it would have the opposite effect,' she says. 'The strategy is to keep on with fiscal consolidation as planned and to make it possible to keep on with the stimulus from monetary policy. That will be much more effective.' The political conflict over economic policy has been ill-received in the markets, contributing to the weakness of the krona. Until earlier this year, the Social Democrats had co-operated with the government. There was broad political acceptance of a benchmark study of the economy produced by a commission led by Professor Assar Lindbeck which made no less than 113 recommendations in general aimed at liberalisation and reducing the state's role in the economy. The Social Democrats continue to accept that the public sector, which in 1992 amounted to 70 per cent of GDP, had become too large to sustain. Mr Persson says a Social Democratic government would continue the battle against the deficit and seek to promote private industrial growth. But he opposes the government's belief that the frontiers of the state should be rolled much further back, as soon as the state of the public finances allow, through greater tax reform and more private involvement, for example in the service sector. The Social Democratic commitment is to get the deficit in check so that they can bolster, not reduce, the welfare state. 'There are areas that should not be deregulated - which the market cannot handle,' Mr Persson says. 'Our policy relies on having strong public finances because without strong public finances you cannot have a strong welfare state.'</p>

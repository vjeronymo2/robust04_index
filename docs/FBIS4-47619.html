			<p>SUMMARY                                     Faced with a wave of Solidarity trade union strikes, the formerly  communist Alliance of the Democratic Left (SLD) electoral bloc  has reaffirmed its support for its governing coalition's  austerity plan, branding the strikers as a threat to democracy  and to free market reforms.  While the SLD's allies in the  government have also criticized Solidarity's decision to strike,  many coalition leaders have also expressed sympathy for  Solidarity's demands and called for a loosening of the  government's anti-inflation efforts.                               END SUMMARY     Seeing Solidarity's tactics as politically motivated rather than  economic, SLD leaders have strongly denounced Solidarity's  ongoing nationwide strikes that began on 26 April.  Sejm Speaker  Jozef Oleksy, deputy chairman of the SLD's main party, Social  Democracy of the Republic of Poland (SdRP), said during a meeting  with workers from the FSO car plant that he did "not accept" any  union that has put "overthrowing the government as its aim" (PAP,  4 May).  He went on to accuse Solidarity leaders of playing  "political games for their own benefit" (Warsaw TV, 4 May).  After the strikes began, a Government Press Bureau Communique  blasted Solidarity, saying that "unrest and tensions are what  count" for the union and that "the content itself of the demands  and negotiations is of lesser importance."  It further warned of  the "danger to the security of the country" and threat to its  "chances for economic development" posed by the strikes (PAP, 27  April).  The SdRP's Trybuna daily echoed these sentiments in a  front page commentary on 28 April that accused Solidarity of  pushing for a "revolutionary change on the scale of what happened  in the late 1980's."  The commentary unabashedly added that the  union will likely be disappointed to find that "the majority of  Poles don't have a willingness for a withdrawal from democratic  law and a return to socialism."     Solidarity's Stance     In announcing the strikes, Solidarity leaders issued a number of  demands to ease the effects of the economic reforms on its  workers.  Solidarity's main demand is the immediate lifting of  restrictions on wage increases in state-owned industries-  -restrictions that were initiated with the inauguration of "shock  therapy" in 1990 by the Mazowiecki government.  Although in March  the new government rescinded a previous law mandating heavy taxes  on "excessive" wage increases in state firms, a new and quite  similar law was then proposed by the government, and the  parliament has voted to extend the taxes until the end of the  year.  Solidarity has also announced other demands, including  lower taxes for workers, a reduction in the work week to 40  hours, "social support" for poor families, and lower fuel prices  (Gazeta Wyborcza, 5 May).  AA     Coalition Partners' Position     While Solidarity's decision to strike has been condemned by  virtually every political group, some SdRP allies have been  critical of the government's labor policies and have even  threatened to resign from the coalition.  Ewa Spychalska, head of  the National Trade Union Alliance (OPZZ)--a union formed by the  former communists in the 198O's as an alternative to Solidarity  and a member of the SLD--admitted in a 26 April interview with  PAP that although she has "doubts about the road chosen by  Solidarity," its demands are "generally compatible with those put  to the government by OPZZ."  According to PAP, Spychalska also  warned the government not to "push the unions into a corner" and  "did not rule out the possibility of the OPZZ leaving the  coalition."  A similar sentiment was echoed by Ryszard Bugaj,  chairman of a former Solidarity party, the small Union of Labor  (UP), that has one member in the cabinet--Industry Minister Marek  Pol.  Bugaj told journalists that the strikes demonstrated that  "we are gradually beginning to pay the bills for this  government's measures."  He further suggested that if the  government's labor policies do not change, Pol might resign and  the UP might "go into a definite kind of opposition" (Zycie  Warszawy, 28 April), thus eliminating the government's only link  to former Solidarity.  Even Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, head  of the SLD's main coalition partner, the Polish Peasant Party  (PSL), expressed sympathy for the strikers, saying that while the  protests "are not justified on such a large scale," they are "a  sign" for his government and "show very clearly how great the  people's impatience is that these difficult matters be resolved"  (Warsaw radio, 3O April).     Implications     While the SLD is experiencing the same difficulty that other  governing parties faced before them -- maintaining a strict  monetary and fiscal policy while attempting to limit popular  discontent with the reforms -- it has the additional burden of  living up to its campaign promises before the election.  Pledging  during the campaign to soften the reform's effects on beleaguered  workers and pensioners, the party is now facing the hard  realities of limited funds for social spending and the need to  retard inflation by keeping the lid on wages.  Although new  parliamentary elections are not scheduled until 1997, the SLD may  be hurting the chances of its candidate in the 1995 presidential  elections by holding firm on its strong anti-inflationary stand,  and may even be undermining its coalition with other parties and  groups.  Faced with increasing social unrest and possible  pressure from their rank-and-file members, its coalition partners  may decide to leave the governing coalition and the OPZZ might  withdraw from the electoral alliance.  Furthermore, the SdRP, the  SLD's main party, will likely face internal pressures to moderate  its policy, threatening the party either with a split or a forced  withdrawal from its austerity program.

He pointed out that experts of both countries are  currently working out such a mechanism.    In Shokhin's words, the parties have actually reached an  agreement to establish a 1:3 correlation between Russian rubles  and the Belarusian currency. He explained the mechanism used  for determining this exchange rate, namely by putting together  the exchange rate and the rate based on the purchasing ability  via the consumer basket. The fist one (the exchange rate) is  1:4 and the second is 1:2.5. Shokhin noted that there exists an  intention to set different cash and non-cash rates, to make it  softer for the population and tougher for enterprises.    According to Shokhin, the issue of the time-frame for the  agreement is still being debated. The Belarusian side, which  wants to receive an access to Russian resources as soon as  possible, advocates simultaneous implementation of agreements.  Russia stands for a gradual one, in the course of half a year  during which a state-by-stage reduction in customs tariffs will  take place.    The minister pointed out that Russia and Belarus had made a  preliminary conclusion at the inter-state level stating that the  reached agreements must be ratified by both states' parliaments.  "It means that Russia should so thoroughly develop all aspects  of the accords that everybody can understand that it does not  loose but also gains from the unification of two monetary  systems," emphasized Shokhin.    In his words, advantages gained by Russia include solution  of  transit problems and direct access to Europe. This would help  to solve the problem of Russian oil export not by means of  inefficient rail way shipments but by means of an oil pipeline  laid to Polotsk and Mozyr (Belarus) and then further to Europe.    Shokhin said that 90 percent of Belarusian industry works  for  the Russian market which is why lowering prices for fuel and  energy resources would help to lower prices for goods imported  from Belarus.</p>

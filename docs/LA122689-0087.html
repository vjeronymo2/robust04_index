			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PITTSBURG;  </P> <P> THICK FOG MAY HAVE CAUSED 14-CAR CRASH  </P> <P> Dense fog may have caused a 14-car chain-reaction crash that slightly injured  two motorists on California 4 near Pittsburg, the California Highway Patrol  reported. Blinding fog clinging above the roadways prompted National Weather  Service warnings. Extremely dangerous driving conditions were posted for much  of California's Central valley, from north of Marysville to Bakersfield. The  fog was a factor in the chain-reaction crash just before 1 a.m. Monday morning  on California 4 between Pittsburg and Concord, according to a CHP spokeswoman.  San Jose International Airport was fogged in late Sunday for three hours,  delaying some Christmas travelers. Visibility was reported near zero in some  Central Valley areas, but skies were clear at the San Francisco and Oakland  airports, and travelers did not experience weather-caused delays. Weather  officials said a high-pressure system off the West Coast was preventing Pacific  storms from reaching the state.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Jericho Mayor Jamil Sabri Khalaf </F> in Jericho, by Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz in Cairo, date not given;  from the "Dialogue From Afar" program]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Mr. Khalaf, Dr.  Nabil Sha'th visited Gaza and Jericho in the first such visit by  a Palestinian official to Gaza and Jericho, the Palestinian  self-rule areas. Can you tell us what happened during the  meetings he held and the nature of his visit?    [Khalaf] Dr. Nabil Sha'th is one of the leaders who have  worked and made great efforts to establish peace in the region.  It is also very natural for him to be with us on two occasions:  The first occasion is the entry of the Palestinian police and  the second occasion is the 'Id al-Adha. Of course, his being  with us leaves a very good impression and gives a feeling of  security. He is an official of the PLO, under the leadership of  Chairman 'Arafat. This leaves a very good impression with the  forces and citizens and provides them with a great sense of  security that a top-ranking Palestinian official, Mr. Nabil  Sha'th, is visiting the area.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Israel doubts the ability of the Palestinian  police to perform their security duties in the Palestinian  territories. What can we say about the capabilities of the  Palestinian police or the policeman?    [Khalaf] There is no doubt that every good citizen who likes  peace and loves his country will consider himself a policeman  and keep the peace and security. Naturally, the citizens of the  city joined the policemen, and everyone is enjoying the fact  that they are abiding by the law and applying it in order to  provide peace of mind for every citizen.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Mr. Khalaf, Palestinian president 'Arafat  will enter the Palestinian territories at the beginning of next  month. What kind of reception he will be given by the  Palestinian people?    [Khalaf] There is no doubt that there are many preparations  under way to receive the Palestinian president on the  appropriate date, which he himself will determine. The city is  patiently awaiting his arrival. His return to the city and  entry to the region will be a historic day. The cities of Gaza  and Jericho are the first experiments for the Palestinian people  in establishing peace. Praise be to God that autonomy has  started in Gaza and Jericho. We welcome the president to his  land and city and among his people.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Mr. Khalaf, there are reports that the  Palestine National Council [PNC] will meet in Jericho. What can  you tell us about this meeting, and when will it will be held?    [Khalaf] The date will be fixed by the president and the  brothers in the PNC. We hope it will be a historic date in  Jericho. It will be a historic starting point for the  Palestinian people and we welcome the PNC members here.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Mr. Jamil Sabri Khalaf, Jericho mayor, we  thank you very much for this telephone interview and wish you a  happy 'Id al-Adha. We also wish the Palestinian people health  and prosperity.    [Khalaf] Many happy returns to you, the Islamic and Arab  nations, wherever you may be.</p>

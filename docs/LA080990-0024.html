			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PLANNERS VOICE CONCERNS OVER INDUSTRIAL PARK PLAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles County planning commissioners said Wednesday that they are  concerned about noise and traffic which could be created by a proposed  industrial park near Castaic and told the project's developer to work with  nearby residents to resolve the problems.  </P> <P> The developer, Newhall Land and Farming Co., said it was willing to redesign  portions of the project to reduce noise and traffic, but some homeowners living  near the site said they doubted that the company would address all of their  concerns.  </P> <P> "They're not trying to resolve the problems the community has brought up," said  Lester Freeman, president of the Live Oak Community Assn., after a 2 1/2-hour  hearing before the Regional Planning Commission.  </P> <P> At issue is the Valencia Commerce Center, an industrial park that would be  built on 1,436 acres west of the Golden State Freeway and north of California  126 in the Santa Clarita Valley. The park would provide 12 million square feet  of office and manufacturing space.  </P> <P> About 60 residents of Live Oak and adjoining housing tracts attended  Wednesday's hearing. Their leaders told the planning commissioners that the  park, as proposed, would destroy the quality of life in the area. The residents  made unemotional, often technical comments about the project's design and  introduced aerial photographs to make their points.  </P> <P> They charged that parts of the environmental impact report on the project were  based on faulty data. "It puts economic gain before the health and safety of  the community at this time," Marcella Tyler Ketelhut said of the report.  </P> <P> But Ketelhut said the residents were willing to work with Newhall Land to  develop a safe industrial park. "We're not seeking a complete stop to this  project," Ketelhut said.  </P> <P> Commissioner Clinton C. Ternstrom, who represents the Santa Clarita Valley,  said he shared the concerns of residents about heavy traffic entering the park  via Backer Road, which passes directly behind a residential street that is  northeast of the proposed park.  </P> <P> Ternstrom said Newhall Land will have to prove that the noise and traffic  problems can be controlled. "I'm going to press this point," he said.  </P> <P> Newhall Land officials will meet with residents to discuss the latest  modifications to the park plan. The commission scheduled another public hearing  on the industrial park Oct. 25.  </P></p>

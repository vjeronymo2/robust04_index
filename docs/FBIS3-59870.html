			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Muzhir 'Arif: "Turkey: Illusion and Reality"] </F>   [Text] A state of irresolution still reigns over Turkey's  foreign policy toward Iraq. Attention to America still is  stronger than attention to Turkey's real interests with Iraq.    Although everyone in Turkey now agrees on the need to lift  the blockade on Iraq, and Turkey's prime minister herself has  spoken more than once on the subject, particularly during her  recent visit to the United States, the Ankara government has  given no open sign of taking the initiative in this direction,  although Turkey is one of the countries most harmed by the  blockade imposed on Iraq. Official Turkish pronouncements  sometimes can be interpreted (this is my personal opinion) as a  kind of inducement to the United States and other Western  countries to give Turkey financial and economic aid. American  President Clinton's vacillating statements on aid to Turkey  perhaps give something of an impression about the truth of what  I have indicated.    It should be said here that the continued foreign military  presence on Turkish soil to confront Iraq means that Turkey's  movement with regard to lifting the blockade on the Iraqi people  is restricted. This is because any official Turkish move to this  effect will be met by an unannounced reaction by the coalition  forces to impede the Turkish move in this direction.    The Kurdish card will be one of the most powerful cards used  to pressure the Turkish government and prevent it from resuming  full relations with Iraq. Other cards that can be used against  the Turks include Cyprus, relations with Greece, relations with  the former Soviet republics in Asia, and relations with Iran  that can ebb and flow for many reasons and motives.    Ending the foreign presence in Turkey will free Turkish will  and Turkish official and popular decisionmaking from heavy  shackles. This, however, does not mean that turning the words of  Turkish officials about lifting the blockade on Iraq into deeds  is a matter difficult to achieve before achieving the withdrawal  of the coalition forces from Turkey.    Every day that passes with Iraq under blockade increases  Turkey's economic and security problems, as Turkish officials  themselves acknowledge. Though this acknowledgment is sincere,  it has not yielded the desired results. At best, it has seemed  to be a campaign to elicit the sympathy of others to aid Turkey,  or it may be an expedient for domestic consumption, to rally  public opinion that will accept nothing but the historic good  relations with Iraq and lifting the blockade from the Iraqi  people.    A well-known political principle is that the advent of a new  president and a government from another party means that one  need not retain the old policy of the previous president and  government when that policy is unacceptable to the people as  being at odds with their interests and those of the country.    However, the current administration and government in Turkey  have in no way acted on this principle, despite comments about  the harm that Turkey's previous president caused to Turkey by  facilitating military aggression against Iraq, approving the  concentration of coalition forces in Turkey, and participating  in imposing a blockade on Iraq. Add to this the fact that  continued penetration by the Turkish army and air force into  Iraqi territory on the pretext of pursuing elements of the  Turkish Kurdistan Labor Party and continued cooperation with  renegades subservient to Iraq's Kurds is against the official  policy of the new president and government in Turkey. This is  something that conflicts with the agreements on borders and  relations between Baghdad and Ankara. It conflicts with  international laws and practices, and it also conflicts with the  conviction of Turkish officials and political figures that the  border with Iraq cannot be brought under control if the Iraqi  state is absent from the area of self-rule.    Desire and embarrassment (desire to resume relations with  Iraq, embarrassment at behaving rationally, not to say fear of  America) is not a fruitful policy. I have great hope that  Turkish officials will realize that foreign financial aid,  however great, comes with heavy conditions. Whatever this aid  may be, it can never compensate Turkey for its continued losses  because of the blockade of Iraq. Turkish security will be  realized outside of bribes paid from the Turkish treasury to  renegades who have no future.</p>

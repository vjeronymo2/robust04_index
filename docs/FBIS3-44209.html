The peaceful march was organised by  the Lesotho Council of Non-governmental Organisations whose  executive director, Caleb Sello, handed the petition to the  Office of the Minister.    The petition stated: "That the prime minister should enlist  the support of the cabinet, parliament and leaders of various  political parties in the country to declare a general amnesty,  which would serve as pardon for all sections of the warrings  factions of the Royal Lesotho Defence Force."    A delegation from the Commonwealth of Nations Secretariat in  London is visiting Lesotho on the instruction of Secretary  General Chief Emeka Anyaoku to assess events in the Mountain  Kingdom. The delegation is led by Maxwell Gaylard of Australia  and Moses Anafu of Ghana, both diplomats at the Commonwealth  Secretariat.    The Commonwealth team on Tuesday met Dr Mokhehle and Foreign  Minister Molapo Qhobela and on Wednesday members of the  diplomatic corps, Basotho church leaders and political leaders.    They are due to meet the officer commanding the Lesotho army  and his military assistants on Thursday afternoon.</p>

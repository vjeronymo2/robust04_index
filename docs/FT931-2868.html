			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Debts force closure of Dominican unit ROSARIO DOMINICANA, the Dominican Republic's state-owned gold miner, has been forced to close because of increasing debts and mounting production costs. The company says its operations, centred on the Pueblo Viejo mine near the city of Cotui, have been adversely affected by falling prices for gold since 1985, and by steadily falling production. The closure has angered the company's workers and their unions, and paramilitary units have been posted at the mines as sacked employees plan protests against the closure. Rosario Dominicana says its best years were between 1980 and 1985. In 1980 it produced 370.94 troy ounces of gold and sold it at Dollars 612 an ounce. In that year it also produced 1.6m ounces of silver, which was sold at Dollars 19.59 an ounce. Its gold production rose to 412.99 ounces in 1981, but that the price had fallen to Dollars 460 an ounce. A significant decline in the company's fortunes began after 1985 and in 1987 gold production of only 246.39 ounces fetched Dollars 384 per ounce. Last year the average price it received for gold was down to Dollars 343 an ounce and on March 10 this year it averaged Dollars 326.3 an ounce. The company says the fall in prices coincided with an accumulation of debts that could not be serviced. The debt to foreign and local banks is Dollars 52.8m, while it owes the equivalent of Dollars 2.88m in production incentive payments and bonuses to its workers for 1991 and 1992, and Dollars 36m to its foreign and local contractors. Operations have also been affected by increasing production costs. In the past two years it cost the company an average of Dollars 535 to produce an ounce of gold, with the average selling price being Dollars 352. In closing its mines at Pueblo Viejo, the company is suspending 70 per cent of its workforce and reducing the wages of those being kept on for routine maintenance. Senior government officials said yesterday that they were uncertain about the duration of the closure of the company's mining operations. They said the first priority would be studying the company's financial situation to determine how its obligations to all its creditors could be met.</p>

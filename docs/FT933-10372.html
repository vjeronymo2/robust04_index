			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading FOOTSIE futures showed signs of flagging yesterday as the trading range tightened and turnover fell after hopes of an early cut in European interest rates dimmed. However, volatility against the underlying market gave dealers the chance to arbitrage between the two, writes Peter John. On the Liffe, the contract on the Footsie for September delivery opened at 2,957 and looked vulnerable for a while. At one stage it was down to 2,938, only two points above the cash market and below fair value, the premium which compensates for dividends and carrying costs, which is currently at four points. After a rally of nine consecutive days in the cash market, buyers were beginning to be wary, but dealers said they were still attracted by any dips. The prospect of interest rate cuts in Europe - which will cut debts, encourage spending and narrow the yield differential between bonds and equities - has encouraged buying of French, German and UK shares. The buyers have seen futures contracts on the markets as the quickest way in. The Footsie future was only marginally firmer on balance in late trading, and the day's turnover was less than 10,000. Traded options volume was low, with around 29,000 lots dealt. The FT-SE 100 option was the most heavily traded, while Asda topped the list of stock options, followed by RTZ and Ladbroke.</p>

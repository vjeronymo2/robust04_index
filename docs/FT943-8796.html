			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Frankfurt Market professionals have been looking forward eagerly to the second-quarter reports from the 'big three' chemical groups, with BASF kicking off on Thursday, and Bayer and Hoechst due next week. A Goldman Sachs report on the sector notes that BASF's first-quarter pre-tax profit was 47 per cent ahead of the year-earlier period, helped by 4 per cent volume growth. The evidence, it says, is that recovery momentum in the industry gathered pace in the second quarter. On the same day, the Bundesbank holds its regular fortnightly meeting. For most of last week, German and other banks were divided on the prospects for a further interest rate cut.

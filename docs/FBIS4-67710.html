			<p>BFN     [Text] Hoof-and-mouth disease has broken out among  hundreds of livestock herds in villages in Samaria and in the  Qalqilyah region. The Veterinary Service has ordered all  kibbutzim and agricultural settlements in Israel to take  precautionary measures and to prohibit outside vehicles from  entering their farms.    In the villages near Qalqilyah, entire herds have died after  contracting the disease. Over 200,000 animals in Samaria have  been inoculated so far in a lightning vaccination drive. Our  correspondent Shulamit Schmerling reports that Israeli farmers  fear their herds will contract the disease, especially through  transmission by deer in northern Israel.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Han Sung-su, ROK ambassador to the </F> United States, by Washington correspondent Nam Chan-sun at the  ROK Embassy in Washington on 27 January]    [Text] [Nam Chan-sun] Last year, the United States and  North Korea held two high-level talks and 18 working-level  contacts in New York. Many people point out that in reality the  ROK was left out of the process of such negotiations...    [Han Sung-su] It is a pity that I cannot disclose the  contents of the cooperation agreed upon between the ROK and the  United States. The ROK and the United States discussed in  advance the wording of the statement announced as a result of  the two high-level talks between the United States and North  Korea last year. We also took countermeasures and did analytic  work with the State Department before and after every New York  contact. [end Han]    However, sometimes there seem to be questionable aspects in  this cooperative system. The first Vienna contact held early  this month between North Korea and the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] is being considered as a unilateral  decision made by the United States with North Korea. After the  29 December contact, the final New York contact for 1993, the  ROK Embassy revealed that there would be a contact between North  Korea and the IAEA after one or two working-level contacts in  New York in the beginning of the new year. However, at its 5  January regular briefing, the State Department revealed that the  working-level contacts in New York had ended for the time being.  Since then, there was a telephone contact between North Korea  and the United States, and the ROK Embassy confirmed such a U.S.  contact after the 5 January State Department briefing.    Regarding this matter, Ambassador Han said that there might  be differences between the two countries in marginal matters,  but since they are in complete agreement with the fact that  North Korea must not develop nuclear weapons, differences in  marginal matters cannot be regarded as a problem.    [Nam] Last November, President Clinton revealed that he will  by no means allow North Korea to "develop" nuclear weapons.  However, since then, there were rumors that North Korea may  already possess nuclear weapons. In this connection, government  sources are saying that the remark made by President Clinton in  November is being explained as "work is being carried out so  that North Korea cannot become a nuclear power."    [Han] President Clinton's strategic plan to move away from  the Cold War is basically one to free mankind from the terror of  nuclear weapons, including the extension until next year of the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. This must be explained from a  broad point of view in that existing nuclear weapons must be  reduced and also that work must be carried out so that nuclear  weapons can no longer be produced. On whether North Korea  possesses nuclear weapons, some people say that "it might  possess nuclear weapons," and some other people say that "it  might not possess nuclear weapons." This itself is ambiguous,  but I do not think that North Korea completely possesses the  special technology needed to develop nuclear weapons.    [Nam] Nevertheless, policies must be mapped out to be  prepared in case North Korea does possess nuclear bombs. Do you  not think that all policies at this time are being made under  the premise that North Korea does not possess nuclear bombs?    [Han] The common goal of the ROK and the United States is to  achieve denuclearization, whether North Korea possesses nuclear  bombs or not. All negotiations and policies will be regulated  in accordance with that goal and according to the situation.  [end Han]    Many Americans strongly criticized the United States because  it might have made a conditional capitulation in the nuclear  negotiations with North Korea. Ambassador Han, however, was  confident that this will not greatly change the U.S.  Administration's existing policy toward North Korea.    [Han] Hard-liners and moderates can exist anywhere. It seems  that hard-liners and conservatives, in particular, are saying  that the United States made conditional capitulation. However,  if the IAEA proclaims that the continuity of the nuclear  safeguards has been broken, there will be no objection to the  fact that this issue will unconditionally be handed over to the  United Nations, regardless of the hard-liners and soft-liners.  Currently, the IAEA is only saying that the safeguards have  been damaged. It has not said whether they have been broken yet.  Therefore, all diplomatic means are currently mobilized to  find out the truth.    [Nam] Let us go into details. Some media organizations  recently reported that North Korea decided to receive only one  round of inspection, and hawks-conservatives interpreted North  Korea's alleged acceptance of one round of inspection to be its  surrender.    [Han] This problem arose when THE NEW YORK TIMES once  carried  a report on an "agreement on one round of inspection." This is  an incorrect report. The newspaper carried an incorrect report  because another reporter wrote it while the reporter in charge  of the nuclear issue was traveling in the Far East. When this  report was carried, Secretary of State Warren Christopher  personally instructed Undersecretary Lynn Davis to do something  about the incorrect report. Undersecretary Davis gave a news  conference three hours after it was published. At that time, he  made it clear that nuclear safeguards must be maintained not on  a one-time basis, that the continuity of safeguards must be  ensured, that the United States would present this matter to the  United Nations anytime the continuity is not ensured. [end Han]    However, most of the reports on nuclear negotiations between  North Korea and the United States by THE NEW YORK TIMES or THE  WASHINGTON POST have proven to be correct. Meanwhile, ROK  newspapers generally quote those newspapers.    [Nam] The ROK Embassy in the United States should inform  domestic newspapers of the details of the negotiations to a  certain extent, should it not? The U.S. Department of State  leaks information to THE NEW YORK TIMES and other media  organizations. Our government agencies merely keep silent.    [Han] The Department of State and we agreed at first to  withhold the details of the negotiations from public  circulation. However, THE WASHINGTON POST and THE NEW YORK TIMES  carried a correct report or two. So, I called high-ranking  State Department officials. I protested to them, saying, "We  are very much embarrassed by the fact that U.S. newspapers  reported details of the negotiations." After that, the United  States and we agreed to merely confirm whether contacts take  place in New York and keep silent about the details of the  negotiations. Because the U.S. Administration has kept silent  about the New York contacts, U.S. reporters have even called me.  [end Han]    Ambassador Han said: There are many think tanks and research  institutes in Washington, and many of the people working in  those institutes are former government officials. Therefore,  those people have leaked information to media organizations on  many occasions. For example, a State Department official may  leak information when he receives a call from his former boss.    [Nam] How will the North Korea-U.S. contacts in New York  proceed?    [Han] I think New York contacts are a useful venue for  discussing a third round of high-level talks between the United  States and North Korea. North Korea seems to think New York is  a good place for such contacts because it is easy to communicate  with Pyongyang from its UN Mission in New York, and the State  Department, too, thinks New York is convenient because it is not  far away from Washington. All channels of contacts other than  New York contacts have now been closed. I think the United  States and North Korea will use the New York channel for the  time being.    [Nam] What is going on with the North Korean nuclear issue  now?    [Han] Agreement has been reached on general principles.  However, no agreement has been reached on the details. An  agreement on nuclear inspection between North Korea and the IAEA  is merely one of the prerequisites for resolving the nuclear  issue. North-South dialogue, another prerequisite, must take  place soon. Holding North-South working-level contact for the  exchange of special envoys is not sufficient. That is a mere  preliminary step. The most important thing is finding a better  way to resolve the nuclear issue. North-South exchange of  special envoys must take place. [end Han]    Ambassador Han, an economic expert, said: "Compared to  conflicts in the economic negotiations, the two countries [the  United States and the ROK] have virtually no conflict in the  negotiations on security affairs between the State and Defense  Departments and the ROK counterparts." However, it seemed to be  clear that given last year's experiences, a consensus of views  or close cooperation is far from true as far as the resolution  of the North Korean nuclear issue itself is concerned.</p>

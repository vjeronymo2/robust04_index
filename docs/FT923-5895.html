			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei finishes higher after volatile session SHARE prices firmed as index-linked buying and bargain hunting absorbed profit-taking and arbitrage-linked selling, and the Nikkei average ended a volatile day with a moderate gain, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average put on 160.88 to 16,541.65. It reached the day's high of 16,663.19 in the morning session before slipping into negative territory several times in the afternoon, registering a low of 16,332.40. Volume fell to 320m shares from 397m, due to a lack of dealer participation. However, foreigners and individual investors were active buyers, while some domestic institutions took profits on holdings recently bought at lower levels. Advances led declines by 507 to 474, with 143 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks was just 0.54 ahead on the day at 1,277.38, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index slipped 1.60 to 1,045.56. Investors tried to adjust positions ahead of the government's announcement of its economic support package tomorrow. 'Since there probably will not be anything surprising in the package, institutions are trying to take profits now,' said Mr Shin Tokoi at Kidder Peabody International. Meanwhile, short-term traders focused on drug and Aids-related issues. Green Cross, the most active issue of the day, rose Y60 to Y1,340, while Ishihara Sangyo, an agro-chemical maker, advanced Y80 to Y438 on speculative buying. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone dipped Y5,000 to Y610,000. On Tuesday Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, announced the postponement of the sale of the additional tranche of shares for fiscal 1992 and 1993. Traders said the news had already been discounted and attributed the decline to light profit-taking after the stock's recent 35 per cent rebound. Banks lost ground, with Sumitomo Bank retreating Y40 to Y1,700 on sell orders by foreign institutions. Industrial Bank of Japan was down Y10 to Y2,150. High-technology blue chips declined on worries over profits, Hitachi slipping Y11 to Y792 and Fujitsu Y13 to Y570. Matsushita Electric Industrial, which reported a 62 per cent fall in consolidated pre-tax profits for the first quarter to June, shed Y30 to Y1,210. Victor Company of Japan, its affiliate, weakened Y33 to Y718. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 56.43 at 18,099.95 in a volume of 14.2m shares. Roundup THE region's markets were generally stronger, helped by some positive company results. HONG KONG was lifted by better than expected interim results from HSBC Holdings. The Hang Seng index closed 187.32, or 3.5 per cent, up at 5,478.81 in turnover of HKDollars 3bn. HSBC, which reported a 51 per cent jump in first-half profits, rose HKDollars 3.75 to HKDollars 51.50. Cathay Pacific, with a 13 per cent increase in half-year earnings, gained 40 cents to HKDollars 10.80. SINGAPORE advanced on news that a one-for-one scrip issue by Singapore Airlines had been approved in principle by the authorities. The Straits Times Industrial index added 31.62, or 2.36 per cent, at 1,370.53 in turnover of SDollars 167m (SDollars 86m on Tuesday). SIA foreign shares climbed SDollars 1.20 to SDollars 15.90 in 86m volume. SEOUL rose for the fourth consecutive session, the composite index ending 19.37 up at 513.87 in turnover of Won304bn. TAIWAN reversed early gains to finish lower after thin trading. The weighted index lost 23.35 to 3,793.03 in turnover of TDollars 18.7bn. MANILA recovered from a four-day slide, led by Philippine National Bank (PNB). The composite index improved 14.04 to 1,454.49 in combined turnover of 235m pesos. PNB rose 15.50 pesos to 277.50 pesos on news that there might be a reshuffle of senior bank officials following the recent controversial appointment of new board members. AUSTRALIA recouped Tuesday's losses, the All Ordinaries index gaining 17.0 at 1534.4 in turnover of ADollars 255.5m. News Corp put on ADollars 1.00 to ADollars 23.50.

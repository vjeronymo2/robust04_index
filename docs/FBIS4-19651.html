			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Alberto Michelini, Italian Segni Pact </F> Deputy, by Marco Politi; place and date not given: "Michelini:  `Think About the Family'"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Politi] So, Mr.  Michelini, if [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi were to call you  tomorrow to offer you the post of minister for the family, would  you refuse it?    [Michelini] Such a decision would have to be agreed upon  within the context of the Pact, of which I am a member. It  cannot be a personal matter or something done in a hurry. On  what conditions might I join the government? This is a question  that concerns the entire Pact and the Center.    [Politi] And what are those conditions?    [Michelini] Antimonopoly legislation, the antifascist issue,  a genuine federalism, and a policy on the family. Be that as it  may, at present I see no possibility of any comprehensive  connection with the government.    [Politi] Nevertheless, Berlusconi strongly believes in such  a  ministry. With what do you think it should deal?    [Michelini] It should be a center for coordinating and  initiating family policies. In France it was a Socialist,  Mitterrand, who decided to establish such a ministry, and in  Germany it was the Social Democrats. There is nothing new to  invent. Let us look at the other examples in Europe; we need to  gather together forms of expertise that are at present  dispersed. The Health Ministry deals with elderly people, the  Interior Ministry deals with young people, the Foreign Ministry  deals with some forms of adoption, and the Labor and Finance  Ministries are also involved. Instead, everything should be  coordinated.    [Politi] What are the priorities?    [Michelini] Jobs for young people, with tax relief on first  jobs, the definition of part-time work status for men and women,  housing for young couples, health and pension benefits for  housewives, and tax policy, which must take account of all  members of the family. These issues must be tackled at last,  because the family is a common asset, irrespective of  ideologies. Let us not forget that many people voted for  Berlusconi because he, at last, talked about the family.    [Politi] And so we come back to Berlusconi. The future prime  minister has announced that he wants an alliance with the  Center. With which of you has he initiated contacts?    [Michelini] Neither with me nor with Segni's Pact. Of  course, both within the Pact and within the Italian Popular  Party [PPI] there are members well disposed toward such an  approach.    [Politi] Who are they?    [Michelini] Within the PPI, the Formigoni-Buttiglione group;  within the Pact, apart from myself, there are Tremonti, the  economist; professor Siciliani; Judge Stajano; and Milio, the  attorney. We are five out of 13. Another two or three might  join us. This position must be taken into account. Tomorrow we  Pact members of parliament will have a meeting with rank and  file members at the Metropol Hotel, and we will discuss this.  Furthermore, I have already told Segni directly: "Mario," I  said, "now that La Malfa and Amato are shifting to the Left,  what will we do?"    [Politi] What was Segni's reply?    [Michelini] We are of the Center-Right, we are liberal  democrats, but we are closed to Berlusconi and Berlusconism.    [Politi] But you consider that a mistake.    [Michelini] I told Segni that we cannot remain closed. If  Berlusconi puts forward acceptable arguments, he must be brought  toward the Center. No comprehensive accord is necessary, but  certainly the Right must be encouraged to become the Center that  [LA VOCE editor] Montanelli would like. In other words, if he  puts forward a program that is not unacceptable, I will not vote  against it but will abstain. That is, I do not accept a  fundamental rejection of Berlusconi, and neither do the Italian  people accept such an attitude.    [Politi] What does the Church hierarchy think? Have you met  with Cardinal Ruini?    [Michelini] I will be meeting with him this week. I want to  hear his opinion concerning issues that are of close concern to  the Church. This, because it is the first time that an  opportunity has arisen to implement the Catholic social  doctrine. It has never happened before: The DC [Christian  Democratic Party] never did anything about it, using the excuse  of its nonconfessional allies; and I am talking about issues  such as education, the family, solidarity, and the protection of  life from birth to death.    [Politi] Does the Vatican share that opinion?    [Michelini] The Vatican is waiting to see how the situation  turns out. The crucial date will be in July, at the PPI  congress. If Buttiglione is not elected secretary, a split is  inevitable. Buttiglione is the most faithful interpreter into  political terms of the Church's social doctrine.</p>

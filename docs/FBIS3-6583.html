"The administration should try to establish a total security  posture by working out new steps to enhance the people's  security senses which have somewhat been loosened due to the  dialogue in the past," Yi said.    Yi's press secretary Kang Hyong-sok said the prime minister  made the remarks while presiding over a cabinet session.    Kang quoted the premier as saying that the recent North  Korean utterances that "we will not hesitate to come to war...,"  serve as an occasion for the South to re-establish the direction  of its stand toward the South-North dialogue and the nuclear  issue.    Premier Yi also called for detailed plans to ensure  uninterrupted function of public facilities in emergency.    "The prime minister asked the defense and public peace  authorities to be fully vigilant so that there will be no  contingency especially during President Kim Yong-sam's upcoming  visits to Japan and China," Kang said.</p>

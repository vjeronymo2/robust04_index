			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Daiwa lifts loss forecast over disputes DAIWA SECURITIES, the Japanese securities company involved in a growing scandal over the manipulation by brokers of clients' investment accounts, has increased its estimate of its likely losses from the practice. Daiwa said it would lose around Y73.5bn, instead of Y72bn as originally thought, from the settlement of five disputes with clients. The group expects to lose about Y13bn from two further disputes which are still unsettled. Daiwa has left unchanged its forecast net loss for the year to the end of March which will total Y43bn. The disputes involve the practice of tobashi in which loss-making securities are transferred from one client account to another to help clients avoid reporting losses at book-closing dates. While other brokers have also disclosed losses, Daiwa's are the largest so far revealed. Mr Masahiro Dozen, the president of Daiwa, has resigned and two other senior officials intend to quit at the end of this month. They are Mr Yuzuru Ishida, the vice-president, and Mr Motohiro Iyo, a director. Mr Dozen has been succeeded by Mr Motoo Esaka, a former vice-president. Daiwa's biggest dispute was with Tokyu Department Store, a leading retail chain, which will receive Y49.5bn in compensation. Two senior Tokyu officials are also resigning. Tobashi is not illegal but it is discouraged by the authorities. Japan Bond Research Institute (JBRI) is reviewing its ratings for possible downgradings of the long-term debt of 12 Japanese securities firms and its commercial paper ratings of 13 Japanese securities firms, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo. JBRI is reviewing its long-term ratings of: Daiwa Securities, Yamaichi Securities, Nikko Securities, Nomura Securities, Sanyo Securities, New Japan Securities, Kankaku Securities, Wako Securities, Okasan Securities, Cosmo Securities, Dai-Ichi Securities, and Kokusai Securities. Except for Kankaku, JBRI is reviewing its commercial paper ratings of all the above plus Universal Securities and Mito Securities. 'Because the environment of the securities markets hasn't improved since last fall it is expected that these firms will be unable to avoid a worsening of their earnings. Moreover, it is our judgment that problems that have resulted from questionable trading practices in the management of funds from corporate customers could possibly have a big influence on the management of securities firms in the mid-term.'</p>

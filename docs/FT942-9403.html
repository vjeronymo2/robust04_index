			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Bumper period for flotations Companies have tapped the stock market for a record Pounds 5.2bn in the first four months of 1994, more than was raised in the whole of last year. Major issues so far this year include the Pounds 464m flotation of Beazer Homes and House of Fraser's Pounds 413m market debut. A report by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick shows companies seeking full listings raised Pounds 5.17bn in 1993 and just Pounds 2.3bn in 1992. Mr Neil Austin, KPMG's head of new issues, said the number of flotations had begun to pick up in the last quarter of 1993. 'Economic recovery and solid levels of business confidence have allowed more companies to come through,' he said. A total of 84 companies were floated in the first four months, against 169 for the whole of last year and 79 in the last three months of 1993. Mr Austin said that, while there were a substantial number of companies waiting to float, he did not expect the value of funds raised to equal the first four months. 'I think we have seen the peak,' he said. The largest issue currently being expected by the market is the flotation of the venture capital group, 3i.</p>

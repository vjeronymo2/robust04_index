			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SEABROOK SHUTDOWN INVESTIGATED  </P> <P> Technicians at the Seabrook nuclear power plant were working today to determine  the reason for the $6.5-billion facility's first automatic shutdown, a  spokesman said.  </P> <P> Seabrook was operating at 30% power, producing about 210 megawatts of power,  when its turbine automatically shut down at 4:38 p.m. Wednesday. Plant  spokesman Rob Williams said that when the turbine disconnected itself from the  New England power grid, the reactor also shut down automatically.  </P> <P> Williams said that automatic shutdowns are a normal part of a nuclear plant's  operations but that operators did not know what caused it. When the cause is  determined, operators will review operations before restarting it, he said.  </P></p>

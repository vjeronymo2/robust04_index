			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Irish charm turns sour on Mulroney: Canada's premier pays price of recession CANADA'S Mr Brian Mulroney yesterday became the latest western leader to feel the public clamour for a fresh face at the helm of government. Like Mrs Margaret Thatcher and Mr George Bush before him, the Canadian premier is paying the price for presiding over a period of wrenching economic and social adjustment. Mr Mulroney's resignation after eight years as prime minister will be greeted with cheers by many Canadians. Their dislike for him is so intense that he had virtually no chance of restoring his reputation before the general election which must be held within the next nine months. Unpopular policies are only part of the reason why he sank to the lowest standing in opinion polls of any Canadian premier in recent memory. The same Irish charm and chattiness which make Mr Mulroney, 53, the life and soul of a small party have turned out to be a handicap for a leader trying to win sympathy from a surly electorate. His unctuous public-speaking style and tendency towards exaggeration have compounded public mistrust. History however, is likely to judge Mr Mulroney considerably more kindly than recent opinion polls. Many of the initiatives for which his government will be remembered have imposed considerable pain. In future years these policies are likely to be acknowledged as crucial to a badly needed revitalisation of Canada's economy. Mr Mulroney spearheaded negotiation of the US-Canada free trade agreement, which took effect in 1989, and the North American free trade pact, including Mexico, which is scheduled to be implemented on January 1 1994. Lower trade barriers are forcing many Canadian companies to examine the way they do business, from their production costs to their training policies, plant locations and industrial relations. After free trade, the biggest millstone around Mr Mulroney's neck has been the 7 per cent goods and services tax, introduced in the depths of recession in January 1991 as part of a broader tax reform. Despite the GST's unpopularity, many Canadians - especially in the business community - are grudgingly acknowledging that there may be no better alternative. More recently, the Mulroney government has gingerly begun to tackle flaws in Canada's generous but costly social security system. Parliament is on the point of tightening the rules for unemployment insurance. Ottawa is putting the finishing touches to proposals to revamp welfare payments. Unfortunately for Mr Mulroney, these challenges to hallowed pillars of Canadian social and economic policy have coincided with - and to a large extent been forced by - the longest and deepest recession since the war. Unemployment is over 11 per cent, and business bankruptpcies are at record levels. The fall in tax revenues and heavier demands for government spending have played havoc with the government's persistent promises to curtail the federal budget deficit. The projected shortfall of CDollars 34.5bn (Pounds 19.30bn) this year is the highest since the Tories' early days in office. However tight monetary policies - begun before most other industrial countries - have brought inflation down to under 2 per cent. The conventional wisdom is that Mr Mulroney's departure will do wonders for the Conservatives' chances in the general election, expected to be called in either September or October. The Conservatives will probably hold a convention in June to pick a successor. The leadership of both main opposition parties, the Liberals and New Democrats, is weak. Signs are already surfacing that support is eroding for two fringe groups, the Reform party in western Canada and the nationalistic Bloc Quebecois in Quebec, which grew fast during the years of discontent with the Mulroney Conservatives. The new Tory leader will take over at a time when the economy is getting back on its feet. But even with a fresh face at their helm, the Conservatives have some difficult political footwork ahead of them to ensure success. The key to Mr Mulroney's success in the 1984 and 1988 elections was that he commanded support both in English Canada and in francophone Quebec. Although he failed to unite the country behind a new constitution, relations between English and French Canada are calmer as he leaves office than for several years. Mr Mulroney comes from the north shore of the St Lawrence River, spent many years as a lawyer and businessman in Montreal and speaks perfect French. Quebec commands almost a quarter of the seats in parliament, and a solid performance there is crucial for any party hoping to form a majority government. None of the leadership candidates who have emerged so far - defence minister Kim Campbell, communications minister Perrin Beatty, trade minister Michael Wilson and environment minister Jean Charest - fits this double bill.

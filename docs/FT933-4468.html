			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (15): Good deal for the dealers - Case Study / Westpac Banking Corporation / An Australian financial institution saved Pounds 2m in capital costs and Pounds 500,000 a year by contracting out UK computing operations A MOVE to a new headquarters triggered a switch to computing facilities management by Westpac Banking Corporation's UK branch - and saved it about Pounds 2m in capital costs, writes John Kavanagh. It is now paying services company AST Trans-Act about Pounds 3m over three years to run its computing operation - and still saving Pounds 500,000 a year, or 25-30 per cent of its previous costs. Westpac is one of Australia's biggest financial institutions. In the 1850s it was the first foreign bank to open a branch in London. It now has 400 staff at its offices in the City, handling treasury and capital markets services, risk management and bullion dealing. Computing is vital to these activities. Dealers enter transactions to networked personal computers as they happen and these local networks are linked to the mainframe computer service, now run by AST at its own premises a couple of miles away in Waterloo. In 1991, Westpac was preparing to move across the City to its present offices. 'Apart from facilities management we had two main options,' says Peter Allen, chief manager, management services. 'We could move our IBM 4381 mainframe computer to the new offices. But that would mean extra building work to provide a computer room and the related environmental equipment. 'The other option was to move the computing operation outside London, to cheaper premises. In both cases there would have been capital costs which could have been around Pounds 2m, as well as running costs. In addition, facilities management reduces vulnerability from dependence on a group of specialised people. Running a mainframe demands that you employ a large number of operators and specialist systems programmers This is not viable for an operation of our size. With facilities management you have access to a wider range of skills.' Westpac had two main concerns when considering facilities management. One was security: 'We were giving up control of our security to a third party, so that company had to have the same concepts and procedures as us,' Allen says. 'Our other concern was whether the supplier would be able to match the quality of service we were already getting from our in-house team.' AST was chosen because it specialises in facilities management for the finance sector. It claims to be the only service supplier in the UK to be authorised to link directly to the Swift international banking network. Allen says AST, at the time largely owned by the Royal Bank of Canada, 'has the right background and approach to security: it is run along banking lines.' Westpac retained system development and maintenance, plus personal computer support, a total of 17 people. Six of the operations team joined Westpac and the other 12 were made redundant. 'We wanted to keep development in-house, because there are things we do which we think are unique,' Allen says. 'Operations is not strategically important, so we don't lose by contracting it out.' The six staff who moved across were chosen by AST according to their skills and experience. 'We were keen to see them retained, both from their own point of view and from ours, because they know our systems well,' Mr Allen says. 'They were naturally concerned about moving. They felt they had careers at Westpac. As a subsidiary of a bank, AST was able to offer a very similar package and could also offer better career paths.' Westpac's processing was transferred to AST's much bigger IBM 3084 mainframe. AST took some of the Westpac's existing equipment; the bank sold the rest. AST provides Westpac's link to Swift and also acts as the UK node in Westpac's worldwide network. Although capital and running cost savings were the main reason for going to facilities management, another benefit has since emerged. 'Suppliers promote the fact that facilities management frees you to concentrate on your core business,' Allen says. 'I didn't believe it at the time but it has certainly proved true. 'The whole area of running the mainframe service has gone. The only thing we have to worry about is making sure AST is meeting the agreed service levels.' The contract with AST is for three years. The Pounds 3m includes 24-hour support, management of the communications and disaster recovery if needed, plus a fixed amount of use of the mainframe by Westpac for system development. Westpac's first big experience of facilities management has given it the confidence to look at other areas. It is now looking at contracting out both the management and maintenance of its headquarters and the support of PC packages.

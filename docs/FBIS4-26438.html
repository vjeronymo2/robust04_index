Article 13 -- Administrative and institutional fees and  charges should be based on laws, rules, and regulations. The  specific charges and fees, including their range and levels,  should be reported and approved in accordance with the following  stipulations:    1) The administrative and institutional charges established  by the various departments of the provincial people's government  shall be examined and approved jointly by the provincial  financial department and the provincial pricing department.

Major charges  and the levels of these charges will, after being jointly  examined and verified by the provincial financial and pricing  departments, be reported to the provincial people's government  for approval.    2) Prefectures, cities, counties (districts) and townships  (small towns) are not permitted, on their own accord, to  establish local or regional charges. In cases where it is  necessary to establish such charges, after the proposals have  been jointly examined and verified by the provincial financial  and pricing departments, they will be reported to the provincial  people's government for approval.    In respect of those administrative and institutional charges  which have been approved in accordance with the stipulated  procedures, the charges, their range, and their levels shall be  publicly announced.    Article 14 -- A licensing system will be implemented for  administrative and institutional charges. The departments and  units levying the charges should take the approval documents to  the specified pricing department to obtain their charge-levying  licenses.    In the levying of administrative and institutional charges,  unified receipts which have been printed by or printed under the  supervision of a financial department must be used. The  charges, their range and their level must be in accordance with  what has been stipulated or approved.    Charges that are levied without charge-levying licenses or  without unified receipts printed by or printed under the  supervision of a financial department will be considered illegal  levies, and units or individuals that are subject to the charges  have the right to refuse to pay. In response to illegal levies,  any unit or person has the right to make a report to the  financial and pricing departments.    Article 15 -- Under conditions where ownership rights and  use  rights do not change, the extra-budgetary funds of  administrative and institutional units shall be managed through  deposit in special financial administration accounts.    The extra-budgetary funds of administrative and  institutional  units will be managed by each unit by opening income and  expenditure accounts in a bank and managing income and  expenditure separately.    Apart from where the state has other applicable  stipulations,  administrative and institutional units may only open accounts in  one bank.    The extra-budgetary funds deposited in special financial  administration accounts will be paid interest in accordance with  state stipulations, and the interest will be credited to the  unit's account.    All units should make quarterly reports on their plans for  using such funds and, after examination and approval by the  financial department at the same level, they can use the funds  under the supervision of the bank in which they have opened  their accounts. When there is a need to utilize funds in special  circumstances, approval can be granted immediately following the  report. Without the examination and approval of the finance  department, the banks in which the accounts have been opened are  not permitted to pay out funds which have been deposited in  special financial administration accounts.    Financial departments at all levels should simplify their  examination and approval procedures. When it is appropriate for  units which have special deposits to use their own funds, the  financial departments must guarantee that they will not shift  responsibility, delay things or adversely affect the use of  funds by those units holding special accounts. The banks in  which the accounts are held should, when expenditure permission  is granted by the finance departments, pay out the funds in a  timely way and must not use excuses to hold up payments.    Article 16 -- Financial departments at all levels, on the  precondition of guaranteeing normal funds use by units with  special accounts, may use funds between special financial  administration accounts and adjust funds so that surpluses in  one place can be used to meet deficiencies in other places, so  that production and institutional development can be supported.  However, they must not use such funds to establish banking  organs, development companies or for capital construction  investment.    Article 17 -- The extra-budgetary funds of administrative  and  institutional units must be used in accordance with stipulated  avenues. In accordance with a state-stipulated range, a portion  can be used to supplement administrative and institutional  charges, while the balance must be used in accordance with state  regulations.    Specialized foundations (funds) must be earmarked for  specified purposes and must not be diverted for other uses.    Article 18 -- Administrative and institutional units  intending to use extra-budgetary funds for their own capital  construction must have their proposed projects examined by the  financial department and must deposit the funds in a special  extra-budgetary fund account of the financial department at the  same level in the Construction Bank.

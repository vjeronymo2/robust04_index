			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Venables company liquidator removed The liquidator of Edennote, the insolvent company of former Tottenham Hotspur chief executive Mr Terry Venables, was removed from his post by a High Court judge yesterday because he sold the company's only substantial asset to Mr Venables without inviting offers from other creditors. Mr Stephen Ryman was removed as a result of action taken by Mr Alan Sugar, Tottenham Hotspur chairman, and his holding company Amshold, major creditors of Edennote. Mr Ryman had assigned to Mr Venables Edennote's interest in a pending Pounds 1m damages claim launched by Mr Venables and Edennote against Tottenham. The claim concerned Mr Venables' allegedly wrongful dismissal as Spurs chief executive and team manager in May last year. Mr Venables paid Pounds 7,000 for the assignment and pledged to pay the liquidator 10 per cent of any net proceeds he recovered in the action. The judge, Sir John Vinelott, cancelled the assignment and said Mr Ryman should have approached Tottenham to see if it would offer a better deal. The judge stressed that no attack had been made on Mr Ryman's integrity and good faith.</p>

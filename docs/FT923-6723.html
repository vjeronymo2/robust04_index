			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Tabloids claim Duchess sales lift THE DAILY Mirror and Sun newspapers yesterday claimed that their publication of intimate photographs of the Duchess of York and Mr John Bryan, an American friend, had greatly increased their sales. The publication of the poolside photographs has been criticised by Buckingham Palace and has refuelled the debate over privacy and the press. The Daily Mirror said an extra 14 per cent, or 370,000 copies, were sold on Thursday and more sales figures were coming in. Yesterday's print run, when further photographs were published, included an extra 300,000 copies, it said. The Sun claimed its biggest sale for four years yesterday when it published a front page photograph of the Duchess topless. An extra 300,000 copies had been printed. Yesterday the Duke and Duchess of York were at Balmoral with other members of the royal family. Mr John Bryan was reported to have visited a leading libel lawyer.</p>

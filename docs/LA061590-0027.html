			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSIONS: ISHI'S SAWTELLE KITCHEN WAS WELL-WORTH THE WAIT  </P> <P> There were those who went into foodie mourning when Ishi's Grill, the tiny  house of excellent Franco-Japanese cuisine, closed its doors more than four  years ago. Rumors about its chef, Masayuki Ishikawa would surface from time to  time -- he was trying to open a restaurant in the San Fernando Valley, he was  developing recipes for Noa Noa. . . .  </P> <P> Finally, he's opened the Sawtelle Kitchen, 2024 Sawtelle Blvd., (213) 445-9288,  which opened quietly and just for lunch two months ago.  </P> <P> This week it opened for dinner.  </P> <P> The new place is what the old place might have been if it had opened in 1990:  Ishi's moved with the times. Where Ishi's Grill had a spare, '50s Atomic  </P> <P> Age look, which fit the Zeitgeist of the early '80s, the Sawtelle Kitchen,  almost as small as the original Grill, is carefully designed to look earthy and  rustic -- like the kind of restaurant you'd hope to stumble on in the French or  Italian countryside.  </P> <P> The food is rustic, too. There are tortilla pizzas (like Italian quesadillas),  one with anchovies and capers, another with three cheeses and herbs de  Provence; also, several pastas and salads. The dinner plates are the same  bargain they were at the old restaurant: For $9 to $14.50 you can get, say, sea  bass sauteed with mussels or lamb ragout, served with one of Ishi's delicious,  silky soups or a beautifully composed salad.

This is the observation made by a Swiss  delegation which came back after a 12-day monitoring mission.  Given the "exceptional situation" prevailing in the country,  the human rights were almost abolished, said the members of the  team that was set up by the Switzerland-Kurdistan association.  They gave a press conference on Tuesday [29 March] at the  Zurich airport.    Twenty-three Swiss nationals were part of an international  delegation to Kurdistan. Their objective was to ensure the  safety of the civilian population during the Kurdish New Year  celebrations on 21 March. They also intended to monitor the  local Turkish elections during the week-end.    The members of the delegation were put under house arrest.  The Turkish security services virtually prevented any contact  with the population they said.  <H5>  Banning the Export of Weapons </H5>   The Swiss delegation has urged the Swiss authority to  immediately ban the export of weapons to Turkey. It has also  demanded that refugees from Kurdistan be no longer deported.  Moreover, Switzerland must do everything possible to convince  the parties involved in the conflict to negotiate. It was said  that the eastern part of Anatolia is virtually under siege and  one can easily imagine the consequences that this situation  entails--mainly for the economy.    As far as the elections are concerned, many irregularities  were noticeable, according to the Swiss delegation. They  estimate that one fourth of the population was excluded from the  poll in Kiziltepe. Many people were displaced. What is more,  the presence of armed soldiers in the polling stations is said  to have prevented the secrecy of the vote. In some places,  ballot papers were missing. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Awful lapse in taste: Clement Crisp laments the dire state of British cooking - Things which never would be missed Triangles of Camembert, coated in flaked almonds, deep-fried and served with a cranberry sauce.' Something from the canteen in hell? 'Iced aubergine and raspberry soup.' Ideal for clearing blocked drains? 'Mary's starter is a ramekin of snails in a ginger and avocado sauce; then noisettes of Welsh kid baked in filo pastry, with a port and coriander coulis, served with a gratine of turnip and sorrel, followed by melon with brandy-snaps on a lime and walnut sorbet.' BBC TV's Master Chef - or as near as gorge-risingly dammit. The first two items are from life: one was part of a 'pub lunch'; the other comes courtesy of a newspaper cookery writer. Television viewers will recognise the style and hateful probability of the third. They are all part of the latest and by no means happiest chapter in British cooking. Part of my plea about food in Britain today is that we must have an end to tormented grub, to gastronomic adventures as pretentious and improbable as those we find in cookery articles, in garrulous food programmes on television, and especially in that apotheosis of the Cuisine Fancy-Schmancy propounded by Master Chef, where the ingredients are as tortured as the presenter's vowels. Years ago, in a revue, Kenneth Williams was seen pushing food angrily round his plate in a restaurant with the cry 'Filthy Foreign Muck]' Nowadays, still haunted by very proper feelings of inferiority about our nation's cooking, we are gulled by writers, by the food industry, by makers of packaged meals (that deep-fried Camembert affront came, I'll bet, in icy blocks from Borgia Deep Freeze Ltd) into believing that complicated is good, and probably 'continental'. Complicated food is, on the whole, stupid, palate-numbing, bad. It commits the greatest sin by denying ingredients their nature, flavour, texture. So, instead of concentrating upon freshness, upon clarity of cooking and presentation, hotels, restaurants, cooks at home are bombarded with ideas about elaboration and artifice by manufacturers, by writers in newspapers and magazines, and most insidiously by the television cookery industry. A friend, who is a good and blessedly unfussy cook, dined with a food writer. Offered a dish, she was invited to 'guess what is in it?' She found it impossible to say, and was rewarded by a gratified cry: 'Isn't it wonderful: no one can tell]' The real tragedy of all this misdirected fervour for innovation is that much basic British food remains as disgusting as ever it was. We believe in Fast Food, an American gospel that has spread everywhere, so that Moscow's first taste (inapt word) of western cooking was a hamburger. Pap, tasteless but colourful, zipped up with sauces and about as nutritious as blotting paper, with a fizzy cola to wash it down, is what too many people now believe is nourishment. We accept the mediocre in food shops and in hotels and restaurants, and are gulled by the titles of dishes rather than by their taste. It is time for the Eater's Revolt, the Foodie's Crusade. Away with pre-packed meat, with bruised fruit in dear little plastic baskets, with supermarket fish that last saw the sea a year ago, with vegetables 'garden-fresh' and 'morning-gathered' and old as time, with prepared meals whose chief merit lies in the caprices of description on the packet. To hell with airport catering; with fake Indian, Thai, Chinese, Italian dishes in the supermarket that taste of salt, garlic and flour; with 'instant noodles' and 'soup' in a plastic cup that require just hot water - and dead taste-buds. To the devil with any fish served 'in delicious breadcrumbs' that are a carapace of cheap paste over the world's smallest piece of plaice. And to perdition with hotels and restaurants - and some pretty grand establishments at that - which care more for words on the menu than deeds in the kitchen. In one such expensive hell-hole I was recently served lukewarm fish with a garnish of chilly vegetables. (I was a guest and couldn't make a fuss.) In a pretentious Edinburgh hotel last month a request for 'the green salad' brought a confection of parboiled leeks, beans and exhausted vegetation, and the 'vegetable risotto' was most notable for chunks of raw-ish aubergine. A protest brought the remark: 'I'm sorry you didn't enjoy it' and the bill. Is there any real remedy for this situation - for the culinary pretentiousness, for the inadequacy of ingredients? We make the best protest with our purses, avoiding the offenders. (I have a satisfying private campaign, black-mouthing certain restaurants to anyone who will listen.) We must complain at the time, and since this will usually have no effect, we may even lose our tempers - very un-English, save in traffic jams. Not that this will do any good either, but it relieves the feelings. I record that a few months ago I went with foodie friends to a new roof-top 'bistro' in London. (The difference between the service in a French bistro - fast, efficient, knowledgeable - and the willowy and bemused youths taking our order was cause enough for alarm.) We were not allowed to arrive until 8.15 - 'we like to stagger the seating to provide better service' - and a 40-minute wait between courses was explained by the fact that 'we think our customers enjoy talking'. And the food was boring. We must never forget, though, that in Britain the customer is always wrong. Egon Ronay has done marvels with his food guides, and Gault et Millau in France are tremendously avenging angels when the occasion demands it. What we really need now is The Bad Food Guide to list shops, chefs, restaurants, fast-food outlets, supermarket chains, pubs and hotels. Alas, it would run to as many pages as the OED. But we must fight back at the purveyors of junk. Foodies, unite] We have nothing to lose but our stomachs, and they have already been undermined.</p>

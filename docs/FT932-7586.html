			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses remain wary about Wall Street BOURSES were chary about responding to consecutive record highs on Wall Street, writes Our Markets Staff, as Paris and Brussels extended their Ascension day holidays. FRANKFURT was lifted by options-related buying in the last 10 minutes of trading, but the DAX still closed 6.82 lower at 1,610.59, down 1.5 per cent on the week, in volume up from DM5.1bn to DM5.4bn. Schering rose DM14 to DM780.50. Mr Reinhard Fischer of Paribas Capital Markets, which has brought Germany up from slightly underweight to average as the dollar has strengthened, said that the pharmaceuticals group had moved on its 80 per cent export ratio, and the potential effect of dollar/mark relationship on its export margins. ZURICH finished at a fourth consecutive record high although profit-taking erased most of the early gains and Wall Street's weaker opening dampened the mood. The SMI index finished 6.5 higher at 2,233.1, after a day's peak of 2,245.3. The market rose 2.1 per cent over the week. Nestle and Brown Boveri were lifted by the strong dollar, rising SFr10 to SFr1,140 in the bearers, and SFr10 to SFr813 respectively. MILAN edged lower as the market digested yesterday's supplementary budget package. Thursday's late and cautious half percentage point discount rate cut had been widely expected and investors focused on the prospects for further cuts. The Comit index eased 0.72 to 558.45 for a 3.6 per cent rise on the week. Recent out-performers bore the brunt of profit-taking. Against the trend, Italmobiliare found favour with domestic fund managers, adding L1,500 or 3.5 per cent to fix at L44,500 before easing to L44,400 after hours. MADRID closed virtually in balance, with banks higher and utilities mostly lower after Fecsa blamed low demand, low rainfall and the peseta devaluation for its decision not to pay a final dividend. Fecsa fell Pta44 to Pta685 as the general index closed 0.92 higher at 256.33, up 1 per cent on the week. AMSTERDAM saw early gains eroded after news of Wall Street's weak opening in modest trade with many investors extending the Ascension Day holiday into the weekend. The CBS Tendency index added 0.30 to 104.50, a weekly decline of 2.8 per cent. Heineken, under pressure in recent weeks, shed another 90 cents to Fl 177.90 on news of higher first quarter losses at its Spanish El Aguila affiliate. STOCKHOLM advanced in heavy trading, mainly on foreign buying of the pharmaceutical group, Astra, and the telecommunications giant, Ericsson. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 16.2 to 1,092.7, up 1 per cent on the week. Astra A rose SKr21 to SKr751 and Ericsson B by SKr9 to SKr320 as turnover rose from SKr966m to SKr1.12bn. HELSINKI climbed further after Wednesday's news that a threatened labour market conflict had been settled, the Hex index rising 31.06, or 2.5 per cent to 1,248.24, up 7.2 per cent on the week. Dealers said that hopes of lower interest rates and the affirmative Danish vote on Maastricht had also created optimism. COPENHAGEN ended a politically crucial week with the Maastricht result that it expected and and the CSE index 0.23 lower at 303.66, stood 0.5 per cent down from its May 14 peak.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- May 21                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes*            Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1154.83     1155.16     1154.80     1154.49 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1218.72     1218.66     1217.88     1216.90  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes*           13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1155.26     1155.74     1156.02     1155.78 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1216.41     1216.18     1215.95     1215.46  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        May 20    May 19    May 18    May 17    May 14  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1156.03   1147.97   1152.98   1146.07   1148.21 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1220.19   1212.27   1217.75   1214.06   1212.97  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1156.65; 200 - 1220.32 Low/day: 100 - 1153.31  200 - 1213.69  *Partial.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

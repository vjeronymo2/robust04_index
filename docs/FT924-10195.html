			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Clinton holds his lead in polls on eve of election: Bush loses momentum as Democrat weathers fierce counterattack THE MOST relentlessly negative presidential election campaign in recent US history moved into its final hours yesterday with Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas still favoured to defeat Republican President George Bush. Yesterday's polling evidence suggested that Mr Clinton may have weathered the fierce Bush counterattack and be back on track to victory. The largest survey, the New York Times-CBS poll of more than 1,900 registered voters, taken from Tuesday to Friday of last week, gave Mr Clinton 43 per cent, Mr Bush 34 per cent and Mr Ross Perot, the Texas independent, 15 per cent. All three candidates campaigned exhaustively over the weekend in states deemed critical tomorrow. Yesterday, Mr Clinton was in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, while Mr Bush visited Michigan, New Jersey and Connecticut. Mr Perot was flying off to two rallies in California, having hit Florida and Missouri on Saturday. Mr Clinton, his voice virtually gone, worked the crowds at a football game in Cincinnati, croaking out his message of 'change' and attacking the president for distorting his record. Mr Bush denied on TV that there was anything new in the latest Iran-Contra revelations and at a rally in Michigan returned to the attack on Mr Clinton's draft record. He said friends of the governor had destroyed his military records to protect him from embarrassment over not serving in the Vietnam war. The Clinton camp dismissed the charge. The New York Times-CBS poll said Mr Clinton's edge was statistically almost identical to its final poll in 1988, which presaged Mr Bush's easy victory over Mr Michael Dukakis. Its previous survey, published a week ago, gave Mr Clinton only a five-point lead. The poll takers reported some tightening of the race among those questioned on Thursday and Friday, but on those days it still found Mr Clinton up by eight points among the probable electorate and seven among registered voters. The volatile CNN-USA Today poll of 1,600 'likely' voters, which is conducted by Gallup and which releases its findings daily, yesterday gave Mr Clinton 43 per cent, Mr Bush 36 and Mr Perot 15. From Wednesday to Saturday last week, it had Mr Clinton's lead down to between one and three points, greatly boosting Mr Bush's hopes. An ABC survey released on Saturday gave Mr Clinton a three-point margin. The election is determined not by popular vote but in the electoral college, the 538 votes of which are awarded, with two minor exceptions, on a winner-take-all basis, state-by-state. A Washington Post survey of all the states plus the District of Columbia demonstrated yesterday how much of an uphill task Mr Bush still faces. It put Mr Clinton 'clearly ahead' in 16 states, plus DC, worth 227 electoral votes and with 'a slight edge or better' in another 15 states, with 112 votes. This would give him more than the 270 needed for victory. Mr Bush had a 'marked advantage' in only nine states with 68 votes, and was 'even or slightly ahead' in 10 others with 131 votes. The Bush campaign was encouraged by the latest poll putting him only three points behind in Wisconsin, a strong Democratic state which Mr Bush toured by train on Saturday, and virtually level in Ohio. But new surveys in Michigan and New Jersey, 'must win' states for the president, still had him 8-12 points adrift of Mr Clinton and his lead was down to only three points in Florida, which had looked more secure. The main element of unpredictability centres on the Perot vote, still at a high level for an independent candidate so late in the game. Though his poll scores are going down and his unfavourable ratings rising, his local impact may yet be large. Mr Bush seems to have moved ahead in Texas, but both the New York Times and the Washington Post found it possible that Mr Perot could hand the state to Mr Clinton. In as many as 25 states, the Post found, last-minute decisions by his supporters could be critical. Race for the White House, Page 2 Last clash, Page 16 Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Lamont pressure wins broad support SMALL BUSINESSES gave widespread support yesterday to Mr Norman Lamont's call for banks to pass on recent interest-rate reductions fully and promptly to help them survive the recession. But while businesses said almost unanimously that small companies were having to wait too long for their interest rate cuts, the chancellor's plea has also revived wider concerns about the banks' attitude. For some, it is inevitable that the banks will try to delay the good news for small companies - their bigger clients have more bargaining power and can shop around for loans. For others, what one company yesterday said was the banks' 'unsupportive attitude to anything involving risk' is far more dangerous than delay in reducing interest rates. But not everyone agrees that the banks are playing unfairly. The Forum for Private Business, which represents more than 20,000 companies, says accusations that banks have failed to pass on interest-rate cuts are false and distract attention from the real issue of improving bank services. Mr Stan Mendham, the founder of the Business Forum, said: 'To cry wolf over allegations which we know cannot be substantiated would degrade our future task of ensuring that the banks play their role in ensuring a small-business-led recovery.' The Confederation of British Industry commented: 'It is still unclear the extent to which banks have or have not passed on the benefits of lower interest rates.' It is hard to find a good word from industry for the banks. The Specialist Engineering Contractors' Group, which represents more than 3,800 mechanical and electrical contractors, will be campaigning on interest rates and other bank-related issues. Mr Terry Cann, the group's head of marketing, said: 'On a number of occasions different members have spoken discouragingly about the level of support from the banks.' Yesterday Mr Cann took a call from a member incensed by having to continue to pay more interest than he had expected. The Federation of Small Businesses, representing more than 60,000 companies, has written to the chairmen of the four largest clearing banks asking them to ensure that interest-rate reductions are passed on to its members. Mr John Harris, federation president, is particularly critical of National Westminster Bank and of Barclays, which sets a minimum rate for some overdrafts to small companies. A letter from National Westminster offering an overdraft facility for Pounds 8,000 to a management training company in October stated: 'Interest will be charged at a rate equal to the base rate from time to time plus 6 1/2 per cent per annum subject to a minimum rate of 14.5 per cent per annum.' National Westminster said last night that it had reduced its minimum lending rates last week. 'This customer will have reaped the full benefit of last week's base-rate reduction,' the bank said. A more widespread criticism was that banks used the reduction in base rates to widen the margin charged on loans. 'Some of our members, when interest rates previously were reduced by one percentage point, received letters almost the same day announcing that the margin charged on their loans was going up by the same amount,' Mr Harris said. Mr Stephen Crampton, managing director of London-based 3D Scanners, expects sales to double every year for its unique 3D digitising service  - turning solid objects into a computer-aided design model. But he said the company recently risked failing when its bank refused to renew a loan at very short notice. Meanwhile, the bulk of the company's medium-term borrowings are through the government-insured small business loan guarantee scheme. 'What is clear,' the CBI said, 'is that there is great dissatisfaction at the way in which banks levy their charges. It is not always apparent how banks arrive at the additional charges over base rates they make.'</p>

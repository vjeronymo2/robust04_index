			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As described in Section I, the Licensee is authorized to receive, possess, use, and transfer a wide range of byproduct material, special nuclear material, and source material in quantities set forth in its Licenses. The regulations specified in 10 CFR 30.35, 10 CFR 40.36, and 10 CFR 70.25 require licensees to provide financial assurance such that licensed facilities will be decommissioned in a safe and timely manner, and that adequate funds will be available for decommissioning to ensure that the health and safety of the public is protected. The Licensee has continually failed to provide to the NRC the required financial assurance contrary to the requirements in 10 CFR 30.35, 10 CFR 40.36, and 10 CFR 70.25, yet continues to perform NRC-licensed activities. The Licensee is either unwilling or unable to comply with the financial assurance requirements. The public health and safety require the Licensee to have adequate funds and financial assurance for decommissioning to ensure that decommissioning of the Licensee's facilities can be completed in a safe and timely manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that sufficient funding will be available for decommissioning of the facility in compliance with Commission requirements, and that the health and safety of the public, including the Licensee's employees, will be protected in connection with the decommissioning of the Licensee's facilities. This is significant should the Licensee discontinue operations without appropriate financial assurance for the decommissioning. Therefore, the public health, safety, and interest require that License Nos. 29&hyph;01442&hyph;01, SMC&hyph;1181, and SNM&hyph;296 be suspended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to sections 51, 62, 63, 81, 161b, 161i, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR parts 30, 40, and 70, it is hereby ordered that License Nos. 29&hyph;01442&hyph;01, SMC&hyph;1181, and SWM&hyph;296, are suspended pending the submittal to NRC by the licensee of appropriate financial assurance in the amount of $125,000.00 for its licensees in accordance with 10 CFR 30.35, 10 CFR 40.36, and 10 CFR 70.25, and the NRC's written acceptance of the licensee's submittal(s) to satisfy these regulatory requirements. While the Licenses are suspended, the Licensee shall not receive, use, manufacture, distribute, or transfer radioactice material and shall place all licensed material in locked storage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Regional Administrator, Region I, may, in writing, relax or rescind this Order upon demonstrator by the Licensee of good cause.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with 10 CFR 2.202, the Licensee must, and any other person adversely affected by this Order may, submit an answer to this Order, and may request a hearing on this Order, within 20 days of the date of this Order. The answer may consent to this Order. Unless the answer consents of this Order, the answer shall, in writing and under oath or affirmiation, specifically admit or deny each allegation or charge made in this Order and set forth the matters of fact and law on which the Licensee or other person adversely affected relies and the reasons as to why the Order should not have been issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any answer or request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN: Chief, Docketing and Service Section, Washington, DC 20555. Copies of the hearing request also should be sent to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement at the same address, to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region I, 475 Allendale Road, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, 19406, and to the Licensee if the hearing request is by a person other than the Licensee. If a person other than the Licensee requests a hearing, that person shall set forth with particularity the manner in which his interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria set forth in 10 CFR 2.714(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a hearing is requested by the Licensee or a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue on Order designating the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing shall be whether this Order should be sustained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the absence of any request for hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from the date of this Order without further order or proceedings. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 4th day of May 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> James Lieberman,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Director, Office of Enforcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1153 Filed 5&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 7590&hyph;01&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

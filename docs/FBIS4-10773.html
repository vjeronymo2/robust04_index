			<p>BFN     [Text] With 297 votes in favor and 116 against, the Chamber  of Deputies on 13 April stripped Deputy Carlos Benevides  (PMDB-CE) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Ceara] of his  political rights. In the morning, with 346 votes in favor and 42  votes against, alternate Deputy Feres Nader (PTB-RJ) [Brazilian  Labor Party-Rio de Janeiro] also was stripped of his political  rights. He cannot become a deputy nor run in the next elections.  Benevides and Nader were both involved in the budget scandal.    President Itamar Franco on 13 April sanctioned a law  approved  by the Senate that increases from three to eight years the term  during which members of Congress are deprived of their political  rights when found guilty of a lack of decorum.</p>

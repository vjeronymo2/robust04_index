			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, April 21 (AFP)--British and Chinese  officials agreed Thursday [21 April] to release 117 hectares  (289 acres) more of land this financial year to help contain the  colony's property prices. This was disclosed at the end of the  Sino-British Land Commission meeting here on Hong Kong's 1994-95  land disposal program and comes as the government is attempting  to contain real estate values which, property experts say, now  rival those in Tokyo. Britain and China will release 117  hectares (289 acres) of land for private commercial development  and public housing -- 10 hectares (24.7 acres) less that the  127.8 hectares (315.8 acres) released in the last fiscal year.    Tony Eason, head of the British team, said the team had  "positive and cooperative" discussions on the need to ease the  land shortage that is in part a cause of the territory's soaring  property prices. Property prices have rise nearly 200 percent  over the past three years, with home ownership now out of the  reach of at least 50 percent of households. "We expect the  market to see it as a positive step towards injecting additional  supply into the market," Eason said.    Governor Chris Patten's recent pledge to act on property  prices has triggered a 10-to-15 percent drop in asking rents  since the Easter holiday and a 60 percent decline in recorded  property transactions, property analysts said. Several factors  have been cited for the rising prices, including negative  interest rates, growing demand from young families, an influx of  foreign companies doing business with China, and speculation by  Chinese state firms.</p>

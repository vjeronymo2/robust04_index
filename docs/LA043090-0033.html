			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 RALLIES AIM AT PROBLEMS OF HOMELESSNESS;  </P> <P> STREET PEOPLE: ONE SEEKS TO REGISTER SKID ROW HABITUES TO VOTE. IN SANTA  MONICA, RESIDENTS EXPRESS CONCERN ABOUT CRIME LINKED TO TRANSIENTS.  </P> <P> Two rallies concerning the homeless of the Los Angeles area were held Sunday --  one sponsored by people aiming to help street people re-enter the mainstream,  the other by beach community residents concerned about violence linked to the  transient population.  </P> <P> Kicking off a weeklong campaign to register homeless people and transients to  vote in California's June 5 primary, a local social service agency held an  afternoon concert and voter registration drive at a Skid Row park. A van from  the Los Angeles County registrar-recorder's office was parked nearby to  register people to vote.  </P> <P> The Single Room Occupancy Housing Corp. -- a nonprofit organization that owns  and operates 10 low-cost hotels in downtown Los Angeles -- held the afternoon  event at San Julian Park on San Julian and East 5th streets.  </P> <P> "When you're trying hard just to survive, registering to vote is not the first  thing on your mind," said Kori Kanayama, a special assistant for the housing  firm. "We want them to feel that their vote will count and that their vote is  wanted."  </P> <P> Starting today and ending Friday, all of the corporation's hotels will compete  to register the most votes, said Doneg McDonough, an assistant director of the  organization. The hotel with the most voters registered will win tickets to a  Dodgers baseball game, he said.  </P> <P> Angelia Adams, a 33-year-old resident of the Southern Hotel on Skid Row, was  among those registering to vote Sunday. She said money problems forced her to  leave her South-Central Los Angeles home for the streets three years ago, and  during that time her previous voter registration lapsed.  </P> <P> Adams, who begins a new job with the U.S. Census Bureau today, said: "I feel  myself getting back into the real world and (voting) is something a responsible  person has to do. You've got to know how the country runs and what it does. At  last, I feel like a part of it."  </P> <P> About 600 people attended the concert that served to spotlight the voter  registration effort. By the end of the day, 61 people had registered to vote,  Kanayama said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in Santa Monica, about 150 people attended an afternoon public forum  at the Santa Monica Library where they engaged in rancorous debate about how  local officials should deal with the city's burgeoning homeless population.  </P> <P> Officials from the city's human services agency and tourism promotion office,  as well as Santa Monica law enforcement officials, fielded often hostile  questions from residents about the rising incidence of violence caused by  transients in the area.  </P> <P> The officials said most of their efforts to combat the problem are futile  because of social ills afflicting all of society -- such as a lack of  affordable housing, jail overcrowding and a scarcity of programs for the  mentally ill and those with alcohol and drug problems.  </P> <P> Homeless activists had feared that the meeting, organized by Concerned  Homeowners of Santa Monica, would turn into an afternoon of homeless bashing.  Some residents on hand, however, defended the city's efforts and the rights of  the homeless, saying changes on the federal, state and county level are needed  so that homeless people have a place to stay and a place to work.  </P> <P> Santa Monica City Atty. Robert M. Myers, who was not present, bore the brunt of  criticism for his reputation of being lenient on transients accused of  misdemeanor violations such as public inebriation and sleeping in parks.  </P> <P> The homeowners' group recently took a survey of Santa Monica residents, who  overwhelmingly reported that homelessness was their biggest concern.  </P></p>

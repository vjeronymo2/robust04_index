			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / ESA set to cancel manned space plans THE European Space Agency (ESA) is set to announce virtual cancellation of its manned space programme, as part of a plan to cut spending 18 per cent over the next three years. Trade and science ministers attending ESA's ministerial council meeting in Granada, Spain, will be asked to approve a restructuring marking the end of ESA's five-year-old plan for self-sufficiency in manned space technology. Mr Jean-Marie Luton, ESA's director-general, will instead propose a 110m accounting units outlay to assess the possibilities of a joint European/Russian shuttle and space station. An accounting unit (AU) used by ESA is similar in value to an Ecu but related to a wider European currency basket. ESA's total budget for 1993-1995 will be AU7.7bn under the Luton plan. His proposals vindicate UK space policy. Five years ago, the UK refused to join the manned space programme, preferring to concentrate on Earth observation satellites. 'Now these programmes are over-subscribed,' Mr Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA's strategy director, said. Germany has been the driving force behind the cost-cutting effort. As well as the abandoning of the Hermes manned programme, the German space Agency Dara insisted on better cost controls. Internal costs account for 6 per cent of ESA's budget. Cancellation of Hermes and of much of the Columbus manned space laboratory is a blow to main contractors Aerospatiale and Dassault of France and MBB-Erno of Germany. Projects likely to be approved at the meeting: Polar Orbiting Earth Mission (Poem): two satellites for environmental monitoring and meteorology costing AU1.8bn and to be launched by the year 2000. Prime contractor: the Anglo-French joint venture Matra-Marconi. Polar platform: Part of Poem, costing AU700m; prime contractor: British Aerospace. Pressurised Module: the only remaining manned project, to be attached to the US space station Freedom. Cost: AU2.5bn; prime contractors, MBB-Erno and Aeritalia. Data Relay Satellite: costing AU950m; allowing information from Poem satellites to be sent to Europe from the other side of Earth.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Kleinwort settles suit with US broker THE LAWSUIT filed by Wall Street securities house PaineWebber against the UK investment bank Kleinwort Benson alleging that two of its former executives who defected in April to Kleinwort's US operation had improperly lured away clients, employees and confidential information has been settled. The suit was filed on April 29 after Mr Stephen Canter, president and chief executive of PaineWebber's investment management subsidiary Mitchell Hutchins Institutional Investors (MHII), and Mr Emad Zikry, the firm's managing director of fixed income and quantitative investing, left the firm for Kleinwort Benson International Investment in New York. Following their departure, several other MHII executives also joined them at Kleinwort. At the time, PaineWebber said the two had recruited other MHII employees while still at the firm and used confidential and proprietary client information to solicit MHII clients. As part of its settlement with Kleinwort, however, MHII acknowledged that 'after completing expedited pre-trial discovery proceedings, it has discovered no evidence that either Mr Canter or Mr Zikry, while in the employ of MHII, solicited any client or any employee of MHII to leave MHII or took any property belonging to MHII'. Both sides expressed satisfaction with the outcome, the full terms of which were not disclosed.</p>

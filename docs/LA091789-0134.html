			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: A BIT OF CHINESE CUISINE TO A LATIN BEAT  </P> <P> While Mario Tamayo (co-founder of Cha Cha Cha and proprietor of Cafe Mambo) is  readying the Atlas Bar &amp; Grill in the Wilshire District's Wiltern building,  his estranged partner, Toribio Prado, has a project in the works, too: a  Chinese/Latino hybrid sort of place in Hollywood, to be called Chino Latino.  </P> <P> Prado currently runs Cha Cha Cha and serves as consulting chef at the popular  new El Mocambo, an upscale Cuban-style establishment in West Hollywood. El  Mocambo boss Perry Santos is his partner in the new enterprise, which is  scheduled to open in late November on the site of the landmark Chinese Kitchen,  across the street from El Coyote on Beverly Boulevard. Santos and his wife  Marta are designing the interior of Chino Latino, which they promise "will  resemble a Chinese restaurant in the middle of the Amazon." The menu will mix  Cuban and Central and South American food ideas with dishes from several  regions of China -- for instance, "mu shu burrito" stuffed with fried plantains  and black beans, and Chinese-style barbecued pork ribs with mango and tomatillo  salsa.  </P> <P> "We're really having fun with the whole idea," says Santos. "We've been playing  with a wok stove on our off hours at El Mocambo. We've been in New York,  checking out the Chinese-Cuban scene there, meeting chefs, and so on. Now  Toribio is taking a couple of Chinese cooking classes, and he's actually going  to go cook at a Chinese restaurant downtown for a while. We've got all kinds of  ideas. The guest checks are going to be written on Chinese laundry tickets.  We're having special Spanish-language fortune cookies made up. And we're going  to have the most interesting eggrolls and sparerib sauces you've ever tasted"  </P> <P> Santos adds two other bits of news: He and Prado are also developing a take-out  barbecue concept, in association with entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. And, he says,  "We're negotiating right now to open El Mocambo in the Trump Plaza in New York  . . . right where Trader Vic's used to be."  </P> <P> RUMOR CONTROL: A reader spotted a notice of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing for  the Gustaf Anders partnership and related businesses that ran the first-rate  California/contemporary restaurant in La Jolla until earlier this year.  However, owners, William (Gustaf) Magnuson and Ulf (Anders) Standberg recently  moved the restaurant to the South Coast Plaza Village shopping center in Santa  Ana where it is very much open and going strong. When contacted, Standberg said  the bankruptcy was merely a way of clearing up a complicated situation left  behind in La Jolla.  </P> <P> BIGGER THAN THE BEATLES?: It's no secret that Michael McCarty, proprietor of  Michael's in Santa Monica (and Adirondacks in Denver and Washington), has,  shall we say, a well-developed sense of self-esteem. Just how well-developed,  wasn't apparent until invitations for this year's "Eat for Art" event came out  recently. It features a photograph of McCarty cast as, well, Jesus Christ. The  photo is a take-off on Da Vinci's "The Last Supper" in which 11 Westside chefs  -- among them Gerri Gilliland (Gilliland's), Evan Kleiman (the Angelis), Stan  Pratt (West Beach Cafe), Steve Neveaux (Opera) and Norbert Knoll (Knoll's Black  Forest Inn) -- strike adoring, apostolic poses. (Apparently, no one wanted to  play Judas.) In the center, wearing a suit and a smirk, and making a gesture  not unlike that made by the central figure in Da Vinci's original, is McCarty.  Come to think of it, though, McCarty might not see himself as Christ, but as  French super-chef Paul Bocuse, who once posed with his fellow chefs in a  similar photographic recreation. Frankly, I'm not sure which is worse.  </P> <P> (Eat for Art, incidentally, is a benefit for the Santa Monica Pier on Oct. 2. A  dozen local restaurants provide food -- tickets are $100 per person. Proceeds  go to the foundation's numerous civic arts programs. Call (213) 458-8350 for  further information.)  </P> <P> RESTAURANT MISCELLANY: Bruno's Ristorante, the big, antique- and  artifact-filled Italian restaurant in Mar Vista, perhaps best known for its  good and remarkably priced wine list, has closed -- "temporarily", say its  proprietors. . . . The Pine Avenue Grill in Long Beach, owned and operated by  the University Restaurant Group (which also runs Ocean Avenue Seafood in Santa  Monica), has transformed itself into the Pine Avenue Fish House. In honor of  the change, the restaurant is offering each guest who samples the new dinner  menu a coupon worth $6 towards breakfast at the place. . . . Loretta's Original  Chinese Food on Burton Way in Beverly Hills has opened a second B.H. location  nearby on La Cienega.  </P> <P> EVENTS: A four-course wild boar dinner will be served at the Showley-Wrightson  Restaurant in Newport Beach on Oct. 1. The wines of Guenoc will be featured,  and the price is $65 per person, including tax and tip.  </P></p>

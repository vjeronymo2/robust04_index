			<p>Support         Prime Minister Peter Boross, leader of Hungary's right of center  government, has received wide domestic support for his surprise  announcement on February Il that if NATO launches airstrikes  against Serbian forces in Bosnia, NATO's AWACS surveillance  planes will have to leave Hungarian airspace for the duration of  the attack. Interviewed by the daily Magyar Nemzet on 14  February, Laszlo Kovacs--chairman of the foreign relations  committee and member of the opposition Hungarian Socialist Party-  -declared that he is "in complete agreement" with the prime  minister's decision.  Moreover, Kovacs indicated to Duna  Television on 18 February after a joint meeting of the  parliament's defense and foreign relations committees that "on  the whole" all seven parliamentary parties agree on the issue  because Budapest must avoid "even the appearance" of "indirect  participation" in hostile action against the Serbian forces.  The  parliamentary consensus on banning NATO's AWACS flights appears  to reflect athe public mood.  Hungary's largest daily,  Nepszabadsag--a socialist paper that is usually a harsh critic of  the government--supported Boross's stance in a 14 February  editorial, declaring that it "most certainly meets with the  widest possible agreement in public opinion" because the  Hungarian people want to avoid getting "mixed up in any kind of  war."     Support for Boross was not unanimous, however.  Criticizing him  not for the substance of the decision but for the handling of the  issue, Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, foreign affairs spokesman of the  liberal Alliance of Free Democrats, charged that Boross went "too  far" in announcing the decision publicly at a press conference.  While he "approved" of the prime minister's efforts to keep  Hungary out of the Serbian conflict, Szent-Ivanyi said, it would  have been "more appropriate" to "simply remind NATO" that the  agreement allowing AWACS surveillance flights over Hungary  stipulates that the flights "cannot be used for military  activities" (Magyar Hirlap, 16 February).  The only strong public  condemnation of the decision itself appeared to come from the  liberal daily Magyar Hirlap, which said in a 16 February  editorial that by banning the AWACS flights Hungary was  indirectly supporting the Serbian position and would therefore  "share the guilt for all that is happening in Bosnia."

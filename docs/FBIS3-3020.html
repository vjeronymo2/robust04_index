Thus, they have made great contributions to safeguarding the  country's stability and public order and ensuring a smooth  progress of establishing a socialist market economy and pushing  ahead with the modernization drive.    Zhang Siqing, procurator-general of China's Supreme People's  Procuratorate, made the remarks to the current session of the  Eighth National People's Congress here today.    Last year, Zhang said, procuratorates at various levels in  the country investigated more than 56,491 cases involving  embezzlement and bribery, misappropriation of public funds, tax  evasion, refusal to pay taxes and frauds in export tax refunding.    Procuratorates at different levels investigated and punished  1,037 cadres at or above county level involved in such offenses  in 1993, with 64 being bureau-level officials and one being a  vice- ministerial level official, Zhang said.    Procuratorates at all levels last year firmly carried out  the  Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's directions on  fighting against corruption, focused their efforts on  investigating and dealing with major cases.    In the September-December period, they investigated 8,538  major cases each involving embezzlement and bribery of more than  10,000 yuan and misappropriation of public funds valued at  50,000 yuan and more and investigated and punished 715 officials  at or above country level involved in such offenses.    In cooperation with public security, state security,  judicial, administrative departments and courts, China's  procuratorates appropriately dealt with some major cases with  great impacts, safeguarding the country's political and social  stability, according to Zhang.    For instance, Zhang said, procuratorates across the country  last year staged nationwide struggles against train robbery,  larceny, kidnapping and abduction of women and children, and  prostitution. In the period, they carried out struggles against  narcotics trafficking and confiscated arms from smugglers in  Yunnan Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and waged  anti-smuggling and illicit emigration fights in southeastern  coastal and border provinces and regions.    In 1993, Zhang said, procuratorates across the country  approved the arrest of 532,394 criminal suspects and took  proceedings against 479,860 of them to people's courts, of whom  129,219 were involved in major cases.    At present, China's public order is generally stable, but  there are still some unstable factors, Zhang said. Hostile  forces and elements abroad have never stopped their activities  to split, subvert and infiltrate China and steal secrets from  the country. At home, at the same time, sabotage activities by  splittists and illicit activities under the cloak of religion  have become more serious.    Major heinous criminal cases are on the rise, the number of  violent crimes has increased by a bigger margin, public order in  some rural areas is out of control and, organized crime runs  rampant in some cities and towns, leaving people with no sense  of safety, Zhang said.    Cases of larceny, destruction of state important production  facilities, looting of state property and fighting with weapons  among groups of people take place frequently, he added.    In his speech, Zhang also touched upon supervision over law  enforcement and training of procurators.    As for tasks of procuratorates this year, Zhang said that  first, in the anti-corruption struggle, procuratorates will  concentrate their efforts on handling major cases and  investigate mainly cases involving officials and staff members  in party and government organs, judicial departments,  administrative law enforcement departments and economic  management departments.    Second, procuratorates will continue to crack down on  serious  criminal offenses;    Third, they will strengthen supervision over law enforcement  and promptly correct law violations in judicial work;    Fourth, training of procurators will be improved, the  procuratorial system will be reformed, and a socialist  procuratorial system suited to a socialist market economy and  having Chinese characteristics will be built.</p>

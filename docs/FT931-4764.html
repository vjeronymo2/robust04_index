			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Leaders press case for aid GREATER urgency in providing Russia with western aid was urged by President Francois Mitterrand of France and US president Bill Clinton after talks in Washington yesterday. Mr Clinton favoured early action even though Japan has signalled opposition to holding an emergency meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations before its normal summit which is due in Tokyo in July. The leader wanted the west to move 'aggressively' to help Russia. Report, Page 5</p>

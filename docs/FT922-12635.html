			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Sappi in acquisition negotiations SAPPI, South Africa's largest pulp and paper group, looks set to expand further abroad following an announcement that it is involved in negotiations concerning a possible acquisition. Sappi Europe, the group's European arm, was established in July 1990 after the acquisition of five fine paper mills in the UK. In the 1991 annual report Mr Eugene von As, now executive chairman, commented that 'much work remains to be done on developing our European marketing, sales and distribution network'. Any deal is likely to be in pursuit of these aims. Last month Mondi, Sappi's main competitor, also took a further step into Europe with the announcement that a consortium of Anglo American group companies, including Mondi, was paying R550m (Dollars 191m) to acquire a 44 per cent stake in Frantschach, the Austrian pulp and paper producer. Sappi also released its results yesterday for the 12 months to the end of February. A recovery in the second half restricted the drop in net earnings to a 17 per cent decline, to R313m. Net income had been 39 per cent down at the halfway stage as Sappi faced depressed markets both at home and abroad. Turnover rose by 6.5 per cent to R2.8bn, while operating income declined 17 per cent to R400.3m. Earnings per share were down 24.1 per cent to 402 cents on account of enlarged share capital following a rights issue. The overall dividend was unchanged at 200 cents per share. Mr von As said the highlights of the year were the acquisition of Lotzaba forests from Rand Mines and the R1bn rights issue. The former was an important addition to the group's forest and mining timber business, while the latter had helped lower group debt, and hence interest payments.</p>

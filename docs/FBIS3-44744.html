The PWC's  Government and Administration Group will begin discussions on  the formation of new district boards and municipal councils  after 1997.    The PWC's Government and Administration Group leader Leung  Chun- ying said last night, that Hong Kong's post-1997  administration would only be discussed in principle and it was  unlikely any concrete proposals would be formed. China would not  be making a final decision on the structure of Hong Kong's  future government until the preparatory committee meets in 1996.    Earlier, China had reiterated its warning that talks on Hong  Kong's political future could resume only if Governor Chris  Patten withdrew his constitutional reform bill from the  Legislative Council. "The door of the talks is open," Chinese  Foreign Ministry official Wu Jianmin said. "If the British side  wants the talks to be restored, it must withdraw that portion of  the package submitted to the Legislative Council." He said  China's position on resuming the talks remained unchanged.    But Patten has refused to withdraw his partial bill,  although  he has not abandoned the possibility of further talks.    Patten will meet British Foreign Minister Alistair Goodlad  today, to discuss his political reform agenda. He will also  hold crucial talks with Prime Minister John Major and other  Cabinet ministers in London, later this month, to examine the  options. It is believed he will table the second phase of his  package, covering more controversial arrangements for the 1995  elections, in March if talks do not resume.    China has sent official word to London through diplomatic  channels, that talks will not continue on 29 December [date as  published].    The political party, Meeting Point have said that Patten  planned to disclose full details of the 17 rounds of  unsuccessful Sino- British talks when he tabled the rest of his  reforms.    China has threatened to disband the three-tiers of  government  after 1997 unless Patten withdraws his proposals.    A group of City Polytechnic students demonstrated on campus  last night, to protest against the PWC, when officials from  China's de- facto embassy in Hong Kong arrived for a function.  The students called for a dissolution of the PWC, saying it was  not representative of the Hong Kong public.</p>

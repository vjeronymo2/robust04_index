			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (The Economy): Suitably modest chancellor fails to take the plunge - Alternative view Mr Clarke was suitably modest in presentation of his Budget. He aimed, he said, to avoid the usual transition 'from illusory boom to painful bust'. Rather he wanted the UK 'to become a powerful manufacturing and industrial economy'. That is normal language from a new government but is positively confessional coming from a politician whose party has been in office for 15 years. No one expected fireworks in the Budget, certainly not in its big macro-economic numbers. The PSBR for this year was slightly higher than expected but the chancellor made up for that by promising deficits in the next and subsequent years at the low end of City expectations. Mr Clarke's micro-measures were also something of a damp squib. That is a pity because many of them went in the right direction. Instead of plunging, Mr Clarke confined himself to dipping a number of toes in the water. He introduced a full National Insurance rebate for one year for employees taking on one of the long-term unemployed, although only from April 1996. That has been proposed quite widely recently, notably by Labour's Commission on Social Justice. The commission also proposed another couple of measures that Mr Clarke adopted or extended. First was the worktrial scheme whereby unemployed people are paid benefit for the first three weeks of employment instead of normal wages  - and therefore cost the employer nothing. The commission had proposed that the next month should be free to the employer as well, although the chancellor did not take that suggestion up. The second proposal picked up by Mr Clarke is a tax-free back-to-work bonus. There was no sign, however, of other commission proposals, namely substantial direct subsidies to employment - which could be justified by the cost of having people out of work - nor benefit transfer schemes, which would allow the long-term unemployed to transfer part or all of their income support or unemployment payment to an employer in exchange for a job. There is, of course, a reason for the chancellor's reticence about bolder schemes of that sort, which goes beyond mere conservatism. There is a risk of employers 'churning' their less-skilled workers in order to take advantage of such benefits. But if inadequate incentives to workers are as big a problem as the costs to employers, it is clear that such schemes would work best with a minimum wage. That would prevent employers simply transferring employment costs to the state with little or no benefit to workers. Since the minimum wage is part of Conservative demonology it is harder for the chancellor to contemplate such measures. While Mr Clarke's speech was notably lacking in financial detail, his employment-boosting measures therefore appear to be small-scale palliatives rather than a radical attack on tax/benefit disincentives to employment. Similarly, measures to improve Family Credit look small against the needs. Hopes that there would be a substantial extension of credits for childcare were not fulfilled and there was even less sign of an attack on benefit traps. It is hard to believe that unemployment has really registered as a problem with the government at a visceral level in view of its response. That scepticism is reinforced by Mr Clarke's remarks on investment incentives. In extolling the cuts to corporation tax and investment allowances by Lord Lawson when chancellor, Mr Clarke declared that the changes had been a great success and increasing allowances would 'distort investment decisions'. Evidently that line of his speech was drafted by a Treasury economist working from the textbook model of an economy at full employment, and probably a closed economy at that. In a world of unemployment, the government should want as much employment and value-added as it can get in the UK. Unemployment creates a divergence between social and private-company benefit. A few 'distortions' to the investment decision are then needed to encourage domestic investment - as most other countries are clearly aware. Levelling our playing field while others tilt theirs is asinine. The situation is even more extraordinary in that British companies can borrow to invest wherever they like and the interest payments are tax deductible. The government seems positively to encourage foreign investment at the expense of domestic. Among the measures that the chancellor did announce to encourage 'investment' was an extraordinary 20 per cent up-front income tax relief on investment in venture capital trusts. Dividends and capital gains of such trusts are also to be tax-free. Peps and Tessas are also to continue. This is an amazing collection of tax loopholes. The experience with Peps and the notorious Business Expansion Scheme is that they provided tax shelters without having any perceptible effect either on the reported ability of small businesspeople to obtain finance or on the level of investment in industry. To give a tax break of this sort to relatively wealthy savers when tax on simple bank accounts is withheld at source and the illusory inflation element in interest payments is taxed too is extremely discriminatory. It also sits oddly with Mr Clarke's claim that he would recoup Pounds 1.5bn over the next few years by closing tax loopholes. These little gadgets, he explained, in his bluff way, did not count as tax loopholes. Nonetheless, there are better ways to spend the money. Another gesture in the direction of more radical measures was Mr Clarke's new tax on landfill in 1996. This is an eminently sensible example of a 'green' tax that if properly levied should discourage excessively wasteful packaging and the recycling of materials. To link the putative revenues to a further reduction in employers' National Insurance contributions is more than a nod in the direction of European Commission - and Opposition - proposals to replace labour taxes with taxes on environmental baddies. Time will tell if the government has any serious intentions in this direction or whether this is another example of a mere gesture towards virtue. Mr Clarke concluded by promising a PSBR down to Pounds 13bn in 1996-97 and Pounds 5bn in 1997-98. No-one believes it - almost certainly not Mr Clarke himself, who hinted at tax cuts to come. A 20p basic rate, or somesuch, would keep the PSBR around or north of Pounds 20bn. Something like that will be needed in 1996 to retrieve the government's fortunes - if anything can.

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / International Company News: SmithKline sees another wave of pharmaceuticals mergers Another wave of mergers and acquisitions will change the pharmaceuticals industry as mid-sized companies succumb to larger competitors better able to compete with developments in the healthcare industries, Mr Jan Leschly, chief executive of SmithKline Beecham, the UK pharmaceuticals group, said yesterday. He was making the long-awaited account of progress in integrating the two US companies that SmithKline bought this year for Dollars 5.2bn - DPS, the drug distributor, and Sterling Health, the over-the-counter medicine maker. Mr Leschly said some of SmithKline's 78 manufacturing sites and hundreds of distribution centres would close as part of its restructuring programme following the acquisitions. The purchases laid the ground for the company's transformation into a broadly-based supplier of human healthcare whose customers paid for healthcare, not doctors. Mr Jerry Karabalas, SmithKline's president of North American Pharmaceuticals, said there had been 'faster growth than expected' at DPS. This was the more controversial of the acquisitions, which cost Dollars 2.3bn in May. The deal was criticised as too costly for a small company with uncertain growth prospects and fickle customer base. Mr Karabalas said DPS's customer base had grown 27 per cent in eight months. New corporate customers for which it helps manage the cost of buying medicines included Disney, the entertainment company, Merrill Lynch, the US securities house, and the 'very lucrative' United Mineworkers Union, which spent Dollars 100m a year on drugs for retired miners. He said DPS was likely to benefit as companies, which paid for their employee's healthcare, sought to control costs more tightly. The acquisition of Sterling Health, which brought SmithKline its first OTC analgesic, Panadol, would help the company grow in developing markets, said Mr Harry Groome, chairman of SmithKline Beecham Consumer Healthcare.</p>

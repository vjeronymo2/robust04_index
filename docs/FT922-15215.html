			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Electricity flotation puts dampener on 1992 rally - The growing number of shares traded on the already buoyant Malaysian market Investors making room in their Malaysian equity portfolios for shares in Tenaga Nasional, the electricity utility which is due to be privatised at the end of May, have put the brakes on the stock market's new year rally. The KLSE composite index climbed to a 1992 high of 619.06 on February 20, driven by blue chips and some good corporate results, but has since drifted back to close at 588.37 yesterday. It is still above its 1992 low of 546.63 reached on January 14. But, according to the FT-Actuaries World Indices, Malaysia remains ahead of the average for the region, with a 6.2 per cent rise in local currency terms, compared with a gain of 3.4 per cent for the Pacific Basin, excluding Japan. The flotation of Tenaga has attracted a lot of interest from local and foreign investors. Not only is it the country's largest privatisation to date, but it is also the first time that foreigners have been allowed to take part: of the 23 per cent the government has offered for sale, some 10 percentage points of that has been set aside for non-locals. The privatisation is expected to raise Dollars 1.3bn and, when listed, the utility will account for 11 per cent of total market capitalisation. Of the shares on offer, the bulk - some 625.05m - are restricted to local investors and will be offered at a fixed price of MDollars 4.50 (Dollars 1.73). However, results of the tender tranche of 60m shares, which closed on March 27, show that there were 178 applications at a price of MDollars 6.55 to MDollars 7.10 and that the issue was oversubscribed 7.4 times. The source of the applicants has not been made public, but analysts believe that there was a strong Japanese presence. Tenaga's May 30 listing highlights the growing number of shares listed on the KLSE, so much so that the stock market authorities have tightened the rules to limit the rise. The number of listed companies has grown since last year - there are now 334 companies with a total market capitalisation of MDollars 161.4bn, compared with 296 last July. Companies wanting a quotation have now to show a pre-tax profit record of not less than MDollars 4m over a three to five-year period, against MDollars 2m previously. Last week saw the debut of Proton, the car manufacturing joint venture between the Malaysian government and Mitsubishi, of Japan. Its shares have settled at a premium of some MDollars 1.60 over the offer price of MDollars 5, although some analysts feel the stock may drift down on disappointing vehicle sales figures. As for the Malaysian stock market as a whole, analysts say that an easing in interest rates would act as a catalyst for a fresh market rally. This appears unlikely, however, following the central bank's annual statement on Monday, in which it reaffirmed its intention to check inflation, which last year reached a 10-year high of 4.4 per cent. Hopes in the latter part of 1991 that the bank's tight monetary policy had started to cool the economy down have now faded. According to the most recent data, GDP in the 1991 final quarter accelerated to an annualised 9.7 per cent from 7.9 per cent in the first half of 1991, and compared with 8.8 per cent for the whole year. Analysts say the bank's recent interbank rate tightening indicates a cut is still some way off. But they believe a drop in inflation to about 4 per cent could lead to cuts of between 1 and 1.5 per cent in the second half of the year.</p>

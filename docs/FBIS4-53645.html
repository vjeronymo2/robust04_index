			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- The delegation of the  American Committee on Korea led by its Executive Director John  M. Swomley left here today after concluding its 12-day visit to  Korea.    During its stay in Korea, the delegation visited  Mangyongdae,  the Tower of the Chuche Idea, the Pyongyang Maternity Hospital,  the monument to the victorious fatherland liberation war,  Panmunjom and other places.    After visiting Mangyongdae, the head of the delegation said  he thought a lot, noting that President Kim Il-song who was born  into a poor family is a people's leader.    Witnessing the concrete wall built by the U.S. imperialists  and the South Korean puppets in the area south of the Military  Demarcation Line, he stressed that the United States must pull  its forces and nuclear weapons out of South Korea.</p>

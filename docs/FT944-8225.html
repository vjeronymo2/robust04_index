			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Markets: Options open up at IPE - Commodities As traders at London's International Petroleum Exchange await news from this week's ministerial meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Bali they will have a more efficient tool available for responding to market-moving developments. Today sees the introduction of a market makers' scheme for the Brent crude option contract, which, according to IPE chief executive Peter Wildblood, 'will increase accessibility' to the contract. Initially, three market makers - Credit Lyonnais Rouse, Societe Generale Options UK and City of London Options - have undertaken to staff the options pit at all times and to provide a bid and ask price on a continuous basis 'within certain parameters laid down by the exchange' for a minimum number of lots. The IPE expects other members to join the scheme later. 'This initiative by the exchange is a necessary complement to our successful futures contract, which is now recognised as the predominant international benchmark for crude oil,' says Mr Wildblood. Other events this week include the release today of October production figures by the International Primary Aluminium Institute. This should give an indication of whether last week's heavy drawdown from LME warehouse stocks of the metal - which helped to drive London Metal Exchange prices to four-year highs - can be expected to continue. The stocks fall of nearly 50,000 tonnes announced on Friday took the total for the week to about 64,000 tonnes. At 1.91m tonnes the exchange stock pile is now down by about 28 per cent from the record level reached in June. In Washington tonight the US Department of Agriculture will issue its latest wheat situation and outlook summary. In London tomorrow Futures and Options World magazine's Investing in Commodities seminar will be held. Speakers will include representatives of the World Bank, the London Commodity Exchange and the Securities and Futures Authority.</p>

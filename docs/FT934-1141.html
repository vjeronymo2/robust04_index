			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Marsham Street monument Sir, In view of the Department of the Environment's enthusiasm for listing working buildings which symbolise their time, surely it should consider making an order on its Marsham Street complex. It does fulfil many of the criteria for inclusion. It is typical of the style of its period, built with the most advanced contemporary techniques and providing an excellent example of the working environment deemed suitable at the time. Is it not very unfair that the department should not order it to be preserved exactly as it is, rather than paying attention to the wishes of the owners and occupiers of the premises? After all, privately owned industrial and commercial buildings are listed without any consideration of the cost of their upkeep, or any consultation with the owners and occupiers whatsoever. J T Horrocks, joint managing director, Leigh Spinners, Park Lane, Leigh, Lancashire WN7 2LB</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / The Markets: Signs point to start of a benign phase - Global Investor Month by month, the satisfying hum of economic recovery is spreading through the industrialised world. The euphonious tone was first heard two years ago in the US and has moved slowly through the English speaking-world. In the first half of this year it has, quite suddenly, resounded through continental Europe, and its faint echo can even be recognised in Japan. Over the summer, economists' forecasts have been trying unsuccessfully to keep up with the published output figures. At the beginning of the year, most were forecasting G7 growth of a niggardly 1.5 per cent for 1994. At the last count the consensus was close to 3 per cent. Strikingly, in most countries the recovery has been driven not by consumption, but by industrial production. Factory output in the G7 countries grew at an annualised rate of 6.3 per cent in the first six months of the year. In western Germany it is growing at an annual rate of 10 per cent. France is not far behind. Admittedly much of that extra output has not left the warehouse yet, as stocks have risen sharply, but the turn-round is still remarkable. Even more encouraging is the fact that the dramatic upswing in activity seems to be largely trade-related. Estimates vary, but the net increase in world trade this year could be as high as 8 per cent, the best figure since the late 1980s. That bodes well for a sustainable, widespread recovery. What does all this mean for the global investor, especially one with a nervous eye on the equity markets? The central question is whether the higher corporate earnings which the quickening recovery will undoubtedly bring will be outweighed by the rising interest rates that will just as inevitably follow. The key lies in inflation. Two years of strong growth in the US are clearly bringing capacity problems. By any conventional estimate the US has either closed, or is near to closing, its output gap - the difference between trend and actual rates of growth. Capacity utilisation is high, and last week a leading Federal Reserve Board member mused publicly that the unemployment level was close to its 'natural rate,' below which there is only accelerating inflation. Last Friday's producer price figures confirmed many analysts' worst fears. Other countries are less advanced in the cycle, but even in Germany there are worrying signs of early capacity constraints. So there can be little doubt that nearly all of the leading economies have reached the bottom of their interest rate cycles. But that does not necessarily spell the end for equities. What most affects stock markets is long-term interest rates, and there is good reason to believe that they may not rise much further for some time to come. The collapse in bond prices in the first six months of the year has given the yield curve an unusual gradient. In Europe and Japan the ratio of 10-year bond yields to 3-month money market rates is now well above historical averages - in Japan's case the bond yield is unprecedentedly high at twice the short interest rate. This will not last. Bond prices fell and yields rose for two main reasons - investors were expecting higher inflation and were discounting higher short-term rates. The rise in short rates (at least in the early stage of this recovery) is thus already mostly discounted. And the inflationary fears are likely to be eased further as confidence grows that central banks will respond to signs of inflation. The US experience is instructive. This year's increases in short-term rates have not been followed by a rise in bond yields. In fact, after last month's increase, long rates actually fell slightly, tipping the yield curve back further towards a more normal gradient. Of course as short rates rise much further, long bond yields are also likely to drift upwards again, but not immediately, and not at the same pace, as the yield curve starts to flatten. So interest rates have bottomed out, but the rise in short rates should be slow; the rise in longer rates, much of which has already occurred, should be even slower. That leaves earnings growth. Is there any reason to doubt that it will not fully reflect the recovery? Some have argued that companies will have difficulty in passing on price increases since consumption remains subdued, though how this squares with fears about inflation will have to remain a mystery. Much more likely is a strong cyclical recovery in earnings - continuing in the US, accelerating in the UK and starting in the rest of Europe and Japan. And that recovery should have some way to go. Evidence suggests that a profits recovery lives on well past a turn in the interest rate cycle. New research by the UK stockbrokers, James Capel shows that in Europe stock markets have risen strongly following the trough in interest rates in all cycles since 1975. The analysis shows that average earnings were 14.6 per cent higher two years after rates had bottomed out. In short the likelihood is that we are now entering that benign phase of the markets' cycle where interest rates rise along with equities, driven by the rapid growth in profits associated with recovery. The really good news is that faster-flowing trade should help even more. And this time an unusual synchronicity of global economic performance may make the performance even stronger than usual. Of course it will also probably make the fall that much greater in the next phase of the cycle, when interest rates are still rising, but markets fall. But those demons should be put away for another day.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total return in local currency to 8/9/94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           % change over period             US      Japan     Germany    France    Italy     UK  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash Week      0.09      0.04         0.09      0.10     0.16   0.09 Month     0.38      0.18         0.42      0.45     0.69   0.43 Year      2.56      2.56         5.94      6.06     8.38   5.56  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year Week     -0.18      0.49        -0.18     -0.12    -0.44   0.08 Month     0.79      0.33        -0.58     -0.82    -2.02   0.50 Year     -1.74      1.94         2.65      0.63     0.90   1.16  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year Week     -0.57      0.90        -0.55     -0.47    -1.17  -0.28 Month     0.65      1.24        -1.79     -2.31    -3.96   0.50 Year     -6.06      1.04        -1.86    -4.889    -6.15  -2.77  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities Week       0.0      -3.7         -1.0      -2.1     -3.2   -1.1 Month      3.4      -4.6         -0.3      -4.8     -4.2    0.5 Year       6.3      -4.9         14.4      -0.5     13.0    9.1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

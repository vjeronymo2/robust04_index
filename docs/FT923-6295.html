			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Portugal tempts foreign investors PORTUGAL'S government bond market has seen a sharp rally in the last fortnight, helped by two cuts in the intervention rate and the Bank of Portugal's plan to lift all capital controls by the end of the year. The rally in fixed rate and floating rate bonds has been driven by domestic players, but dealers believe the recent moves could help to entice some foreigners back into Portugal's high-yielding debt instruments. The Bank of Portugal cut its intervention rate for lending to commercial banks by three-quarters of a point to 17 per cent on August 12, and then by a further point to 16 per cent a week later on August 19. Dealers believe that further rate cuts are on the cards: 'We've had indications from the central bank that the intervention rate could be down to around 13 per cent by the end of the year,' said Mr Alex Mitcheson-Smith, analyst at Paribas Capital Markets. The reduction in interest rates sparked a surge in Portuguese domestic fixed rate bonds. Although foreign investors are allowed to buy fixed rate Portuguese bonds, the market is rather illiquid and  - according to dealers  - not very attractive to foreign investors because they have to pay a 20 per cent withholding tax of which a maximum of 10 per cent is reimbursed. As a result, foreigners can obtain higher net yields from Italian and Spanish bonds at present. In addition to lower interest rates in Portugal, dealers are keen to see the lifting of controls on capital as promised by the Central Bank earlier this month. The first step, on August 31, is the abolition of the requirement for Portuguese companies which borrow in foreign currencies to deposit the equivalent of 25 per cent of the amount in escudos with the Bank of Portugal in an interest-free deposit. However, of more relevance to foreign investors is the plan to allow non-residents to buy floating rate government bonds (known as Fips) with effect from October 31. In addition, they will be allowed full access to Portugal's domestic money market with effect from December 31. Foreign investors were avid buyers of Fips in early 1991, but in July 1991 the Bank of Portugal banned foreigners from buying these high-yielding instruments because it was concerned about the speculative inflows of capital. News that foreigners will be allowed once again to buy Fips lifted bond prices. Yields on five-year Fips have fallen from 17 per cent before the announcement to about 15 per cent at the end of last week in anticipation of demand from foreigners. While dealers are pleased with the recent moves they warn that many foreign investors are wary about the high-yielding markets at present because of uncertainty over the future of the Maastricht Treaty on European economic and monetary union.</p>

The multipolar  tendency will become more obvious. The shock wave caused by the  end of the Cold War on the world situation will change from  across-the-board shock in 1993 to in-depth shock in 1994. The  general changes in the international situation will tend to be  less violent, but local and regional turbulences will still  continue.    The contention for domination of affairs in the  Asia-Pacific region will develop further. The multitiered  economic cooperation in this region will continue mainly in the  form of subregional cooperation [yi ci qu yu he zuo wei zhu 0110  2945 0575 1008 0678 0155 3634 0031], and the multilateral  dialogue mechanism in Northeast Asia will become the new focus  of regional security cooperation.    After the Seattle meeting, the United States tried to  further  expand the functions of APEC, and further its effort to  establish the Asia-Pacific Economic Community advocated by the  United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Although  Japan did not object to the relevant proposals raised by the  United States, it set forth certain reservations and limitations  on the U.S. proposals and also covertly encouraged and supported  ASEAN in confronting the United States on this issue. The ASEAN  countries were opposed to the U.S.- dominated plan for  Asia-Pacific regional economic cooperation. After Indonesia took  over the APEC chairmanship, it joined other ASEAN countries in  using this advantage to slow down the pace of Asia-Pacific  economic cooperation advocated by the United States.    After the Seattle meeting, although economic cooperation in  the Pan-Asia-Pacific region was strengthened somewhat, the APEC  ministerial meeting in Seattle did not reach agreement on the  final development goal and evolution pace of APEC. Moreover,  various parties concerned were involved in sharp contradictions  on this issue. Therefore, the Asia-Pacific regional economic  cooperation will not advance too fast in 1994, and the  subregional and "enlarged tripartite" [zeng zhang san jiao she  1073 7022 0005 6037 1709] economic cooperation in the  Asia-Pacific region, especially in East Asia, will come to  another upsurge.    After the security forum in the ASEAN region was set in  motion, the United States, Japan, and Russia will gradually  shift the focus of their work to the Northeast Asian security  affairs that have close relations with their own interests. It  is expected that the United States, Japan, and Russia will  strengthen their tripartite "semiofficial security forum" on  affairs in Northeast Asia, and will make an effort to create  their official dialogue mechanism. At the same time, the United  States, Japan, and the ROK will also gradually open the secret  consultation organization for the security in Northeast Asia  formed by the United States, Japan, the ROK, Canada, and  Australia, and will consider including China and Russia as  members in order to exchange opinions on security affairs in  this region. Northeast Asia will thus become another focus of  the Asia-Pacific multilateral security dialogue.    The scope of contradictions between the United States,  Japan, and Europe will become wider, but the focus of their  frictions will shift. European and Asian affairs will be more  closely linked in Western relations.    In the economic field, after the end of the Uruguay Round  trade talks, the contradictions between the United States,  Europe, and Japan will shift to the concrete implementation of  the agreement. This year, the U.S., European, and Japanese  Governments will still be plagued by their domestic problems,  and may adopt more protectionist measures under domestic  pressure.    In the political and security fields, in January, U.S.  President Clinton will promote his "New Atlantic Doctrine"  during his visit to Europe. The United States will try to  maintain its domination over European political and security  affairs and try to make NATO carry out adjustments and reforms  according to its wishes. This will inevitably arouse vigilance  and resentment among some West European countries. NATO's  reorganization will become the main subject of the U.S.-European  dispute. The U.S.-Japanese contradictions will become more  prominent in the course of establishing the Asia-Pacific  multilateral security mechanism.    A noteworthy fact is that the United States, Europe, and  Japan are all stressing the implementation of their new  Asia-Pacific policy in an attempt to expand their own influence  in the Asia-Pacific region and to raise their status in the  West. That is, they are trying to boost their influence in  Europe and America through first boosting their influence in  Asia.    Improving the Cooperative Mechanisms in Each's Own  Region Will Remain the Task of Primary Importance of the Three  Major Economic Circles of Europe, the United States, and  Japan.    Improving and developing their internal cooperation  mechanisms, and properly handling the contradictions and  problems inside their own regions will be the most pressing and  also the most important task for regional economic circles in  1994. Before this task is successfully fulfilled, it is hard to  carry out large-scale and intense inter-regional economic  frictions and struggles. Although the Maastricht Treaty has  come into force, it is hard to say whether the second-phase goal  of the European Economic and Currency Union will be smoothly  achieved. There remain serious differences between various EC  countries on the economic policies. The struggle between  unionism and the idea of safeguarding national sovereignty will  become more profound and more intense in the process of  integration. The general economic recession will make it hard  for most EC members to meet the third-phase requirements of the  economic and currency union on time. The North American Free  Trade Agreement is also facing the fact that a distinct gap  exists between the economies of the United States, Canada, and  Mexico, so it is hard to unify the specific standards. In  addition, many domestic factors in the United States and Mexico  are also constraining the union from extending into Latin  American. It is also hard to advance economic cooperation in  the Pan-Asia-Pacific region at a faster pace because of the  unevenness of economic development, the differences in social  systems, and the existence of complex contradictions inside this  region and also because the organizational structure of regional  economic cooperation is rather loose.    Russia will remain the world's largest unstable factor,  and the political struggle in Russia will continue.    Although Russia's new constitution has been passed and the  new parliament has been elected, the Russian political situation  will remain uncertain and the political struggle inside the  ruling clique of Russia may become more intense. At present,  various political factions are involved in another round of  trial of strength around the cabinet appointments and the  chairmanship of the two parliamentary chambers. In the first  half of this year, the debate on whether to hold a presidential  election will arise again. The tendency toward autonomy and  self-determination in the 88 federal entities will make it hard  to compromise with the national authorities. More importantly,  the Russian economy is far from moving onto a path of normal  development. It is even harder for the new parliament and the  new cabinet to reach a conclusion on the new reform program.  The authorities' macroeconomic policy will continue to be  uncertain and elusive and the microeconomic entities will find  it hard to take a firm course. The overall economic situation  in Russia will not make a marked turn for the better.    In addition, big-power nationalism's further rise in Russia  has aroused vigilance among some Western, East European, and  former Soviet countries. The Russia policy of the Western  countries, especially that of the United States, will be  continuously adjusted according to changes in the Russian  political situation. The changing Russian political situation  will remain the most important variable that affects the  development of the world pattern.    Many local hot spots will be settled in a political  way, but many difficulties will remain. In some regions, local  conflicts may arise again.    After the signing of the framework agreement on the  Palestinian-Israeli Peace Treaty, the Middle East peace talks  may make further breakthroughs. The dialogue between the  Cambodian Government and the Khmer Rouge is still continuing.  After the adoption of the interim constitution in South Africa,  nationwide general elections will be held. The parties involved  in the Bosnia civil war may reach a cease-fire agreement.  However, the contradictions in all such old hot spots are  complicated, and the peace processes will not be smooth. The  frictions and conflicts in some new hot spots of the former  Soviet region and Eastern Europe have not been alleviated, and  may even further escalate.</p>

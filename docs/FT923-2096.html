			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Losses at Whinney Mackay-Lewis Whinney Mackay-Lewis, the USM-quoted architectural practice, fell into the red in the second half leaving it with a full year pre-tax loss of Pounds 435,000, compared with profits of Pounds 576,000. The company blamed difficult trading and the postponement of two important projects. Included in the loss were 'significant' redundancy costs and an exceptional refurbishment charge of Pounds 163,000. On prospects the company said that the prolonged recession in the construction industry was making it difficult for any business in the sector to look forward with confidence. Turnover for the year to April 30 was lower at Pounds 5.68m (Pounds 7.66m). Losses per share were 5.1p (earnings 5.1p). After the passing of the interim dividend directors are not recommending a final. Last year there was a total of 2p.</p>

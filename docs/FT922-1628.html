			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / France (7): Revising the borders - Industrial policy in the melting pot OVER the past decade, President Francois Mitterrand has drawn back many of the frontiers of state industry to allow free market forces a controlled entry into this previously protected domain. The secret of understanding French industry policy is to know where those boundaries lie at a given moment - and it is not easy. 'There are no absolute rules to determine what is a strategic industry . . . It is true that what is strategic or not, or what requires intervention or not, does evolve,' said Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, industry minister, in a recent interview. Cars, papermaking and machine tools were, for example, among the sectors thought strategically vital in the mid 1980s. Now the Paris government feels those businesses should compete without its help and focuses its industrial interest instead on electronics, semiconductors, biotechnology and the environment. The state's business, says Mr Strauss-Kahn, is to lend a helping hand in projects in such strategic sectors, too long-term for private business to handle alone. Defence equipment and vital supplies, such as oil, are also treated as strategic and therefore subject to state control, though here the government is loosening its grip slightly. By contrast, it is increasing control over air transport, through Air France's takeover in 1990 of UTA, a private airline. To the opposition, all this looks like a complete muddle. Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the Gaullist party, recently complained of 'the confusion of government policy on privatisation, which wavers constantly between recognising the freedom of companies and maintaining the control of the state'. Yet there is clear evidence that the government is allowing the public sector more freedom. It is, for example, increasingly leaving the big decisions in state industry to professional managers and allowing them to strike alliances with private foreign partners. True, there was a quick swerve towards interventionism during the 11-month government of Mrs Edith Cresson, the former prime minister, who resigned in April. This made a lot of noise, but little practical impact. Her successor, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, has taken a more hands-off approach, balanced by Mr Strauss-Kahn's vigilant attention to the need to keep up to the mark in strategic sectors. Examples of these new freedoms are the ground-breaking alliance between Renault, once a sacred symbol of French state industry, and Volvo, the Swedish car maker; the stakes taken in Bull, the state-owned computer group, by NEC of Japan and IBM of the US; and the share swap being negotiated between Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Dresdner Bank of Germany. The government is also showing that it does not want to disrupt proven professional management in the public sector in the way in which it is now settling down to review the 45 top jobs in state industry, whose three-year mandates come to an end in the next few months. Mr Beregovoy plans to make as few changes as possible. Until last spring, the tone of French industry policy was set by Mr Mitterrand's 1988 election pledge that there should be neither privatisations nor nationalisations, known as the 'ni ni' policy. The aim was to induce stability after the merry-go-round of nationalisations of the first Socialist government and the privatisations under the 1986-1988 Gaullist regime. In the event, the state-sector's demand for fresh capital proved so strong that the 'ni ni' rule became unworkable. This was recognised officially when the Renault-Volvo alliance was given the go-ahead in early 1990, allowing Volvo to take a 20 per cent stake in Renault and to contribute to a capital increase. In May last year, the government finally buried 'ni ni' by issuing a decree allowing private companies to take minority stakes in French state-controlled businesses, so long as they contributed fresh capital and entered into a an industrial, commercial or financial co-operation accord. That freedom was later extended to the state insurers, which had been left out of the decree because they were governed by their own separate law. Last September, Mr Mitterrand gave his personal seal to the end of his old policy, by telling the nation that he now supported partial privatisations so long as the cash from share sales was used to fund industrial investments or jobs. Mr Beregovoy's arrival gave fresh impetus to all this, as well as marking a practical step back from interventionism. One of his first actions was to tone down an ambitious plan to restructure the electronics industry, hatched by Mrs Cresson's government, in which the Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE) audio and video equipment group was to merge with the industrial arm of the CEA atomic energy authority. It now looks as if CEA-Industrie will simply take a minority stake in TCE. The Gaullists, however, complain that Mr Beregovoy's move to a more liberal industry policy is very slight. The real reason for his privatisations is to raise cash for the government rather than to give state industry more freedom, they complain. The government fully accepts that most of the partial privatisations so far, except for Renault, have been to raise money to fund the campaign against unemployment, its top priority in domestic politics, rather than to raise investment funds for the companies. Ironically, the Socialists also gave job protection as one of the reasons for their nationalisation programme in the early 1980s. Officials say the state hopes to raise FFr15bn to FFr20bn this year. It looks as if they will meet that target easily. To date, the government has pulled in FFr2bn from last November's flotation of Credit Local de France, a local authority bank, and FFr2bn from the sale of a small stake in Elf Aquitaine in March. Up to FFr3bn is to come from the sale of a stake in Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance, a life insurer, and another FFr8bn to FFr10bn is expected to come from the sale of a large stake in Total, the oil group. The Total case is especially interesting, since the government is planning to reduce the public sector's stake from 34 per cent to 15 per cent, and the state's direct voting rights to a mere 5 per cent. This is a much greater relaxation of control than most people had believed possible in a sensitive sector such as oil, though the government is to keep the crucial rights to nominate the chairman and to vet Total's international agreements. It is wrong to suggest that state-owned companies have been completely deprived of fresh investment, even if they do continue to be undercapitalised by comparison with privately-owned foreign competitors. The state has bailed out the neediest cases, such as Bull, Thomson and Air France, from its own budget. Its ability to do more has been limited by the European Commission's rigorous application of EC rules against state aid, as well as by the government's own budget deficit. So ways have been found to fund state companies without having to dip directly into the public purse, by using state owned banks. Credit Lyonnais, for example, pumped FFr2.5bn of fresh share capital into Usinor Sacilor last year after having bought a stake in Rhone-Poulenc, the state-owned chemicals group, in the previous year, and is discussing a possible FFr1bn investment in Aerospatiale, the state-owned aircraft and missiles group. Credit Lyonnais' larger competitor, BNP, paid FFr2bn for Air France convertible bonds. Credit Lyonnais was happy to oblige and says it would have made these investments in any case on straight commercial grounds. BNP, by contrast, fought successfully to get better terms out of Air France. The state banks are not necessarily a pushover - a sign that independent management in the state sector will not always be easy for the government to digest.</p>

According to TSE President Luis Arturo  Zaldivar, the results widely favored the governing Nationalist  Republican Alliance Party, which obtained 35,081 valid votes.  The leftist coalition of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation  Front, Democratic Convergence, and the National Revolutionary  Movement obtained 12,409 votes, and the Christian Democratic  Party obtained 12,557.    The remaining political organizations obtained the following  votes: Authentic Christian Movement, 462 votes; Unity Movement,  1,505 votes; National Conciliation Party, 5,820 votes; and the  National Solidarity Movement, 542 votes. According to the report  provided by the departmental boards, the total number of votes  contested was 256; 4,280 were annulled for several reasons; and  1,903 voters abstained.    The TSE president said those were the first official results  he could provide because the departmental boards discuss every  case to reach an agreement. He said, however, he had personally  asked the board members to speed up the counting process so as  to give the people the final results of the presidential  election this afternoon. He added once the vote-counting process  ends and the TSE reports those results, the tribunal will  immediately proceed to make the legal call for the second round  of the presidential election, in accordance with the  Constitution and electoral law.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (10): Frankfurt flaps its wings - Andrew Fisher studies Germany's bid to be a world financial centre Slow to catch on but quick to catch up' is the verdict of a foreign banker in Frankfurt on how Germany's financial markets, and those responsible for their development, have responded to pressures for change. The Bonn government has pushed through laws to make Finanzplatz Deutschland (Germany as a financial centre) more attractive and efficient; the equities and futures markets have been streamlined; and the Bundesbank has taken a more relaxed stance over financial innovations. More changes are in the pipeline. This activity is yielding results: insider trading is being outlawed; a new body to regulate the securities markets is being formed; tougher disclosure rules for share stakes are being introduced; and money market funds - common in countries like France and the US - are becoming part of the financial landscape. Thus Frankfurt has the basis to develop into a much more dynamic financial centre. But this does not mean it is approaching the status of London, a global centre ranking with Tokyo and New York. That was underlined by the recent decision of Deutsche Bank to base its investment banking activities in London, where it bought Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank, five years ago. The fact that Germany's biggest bank took that long to choose London as the centre of its investment banking activities - its German business will stay in Frankfurt - shows the truth of the above quote. On the other hand, Deutsche Bank did not want to swamp Morgan Grenfell's identity and was keen to learn about the more entrepreneurial Anglo-Saxon banking culture. Although Deutsche Bank's plans shook many people in the German financial community, there was general understanding for its decision. London is where much of the expertise lies and where international equities trading, mergers and acquisitions advice, and derivatives business are far more highly developed. Other German banks may also move equities and derivatives trading to the UK. While this will hardly enhance Frankfurt's reputation, it should not dent it too much. Many bankers see Frankfurt's main role as a regional financial centre for continental Europe, handling important deals for both east and west. 'What we do in London should and will have a positive effect on what we do in Frankfurt,' said Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank's chairman. 'The success we may have as a London participant should mean additional business and more success for Finanzplatz Frankfurt.' But that will mean more effort by those in Frankfurt itself. As the home of the Bundesbank and now of the new European Monetary Institute - forerunner of the planned European central bank - it is one of the world's most important monetary capitals. It houses several important international banks, a thriving bond market - the third largest in the world and biggest in Europe - and a successful futures market, the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB). It is in equities that Frankfurt, which dominates trading on Germany's eight stock exchanges, has the most catching up to do. This reflects the relative lack of interest among private investors in shares, though this is changing, and companies' traditional reliance on bank loans rather than equity. Smaller German companies have also been reluctant to dilute control by raising funds in the market. 'Germany is not so far a stock-market oriented society,' says Mr Bernhard Walther, head of Dresdner International Research Institute (Diri), part of Dresdner Bank. 'But this is changing rapidly.' He believes the government's big privatisation programme will provide a huge impetus. The partial privatisation of Lufthansa, the German airline, raised some DM1bn this year. But that of Deutsche Telekom, likely to raise some DM15bn early in 1996, will have a much greater impact. Foreign banks have vied to play a key international role in the Telekom flotation, next to Deutsche and Dresdner. If the issue is handled well, it could promote share ownership among private investors and raise Frankfurt's status. 'The repercussions of Deutsche Telekom will be quite substantial,' says Mr Andreas von Buddenbrock, head of investment banking at the German operation of Merrill Lynch, the US investment house. Foreign interest in the issue will be substantial, but domestic investors will also be wooed. There is plenty of scope to lift outside interest in German stocks. Of the net capital flow of Dollars 68bn by US investors into foreign equities last year, Germany accounted for only Dollars 2.7bn. 'The German market has obviously only been of minor interest to American investors,' Mr Buddenbrock wrote in Borsen-Zeitung, the financial newspaper. With US investors becoming more globally-minded, 'German corporations should attempt to become more attractive'. That means clearer accounts, greater attention to investor relations, and more understanding of how capital markets work. For an economy the size of Germany's, the stock market certainly needs more muscle. Only 6 per cent of households own shares, far below US and British levels. Moreover, the market capitalisation of German shares is equivalent to some 30 per cent of GNP, again far lower than elsewhere. But Germany has a highly successful economy in which companies tend to put manufacturing and product quality much higher than financial skills. For private investors, the Bundesbank's solid monetary record has meant that fixed-interest investments have produced steady gains. Two world wars, the hyper-inflation of 1923 and the trauma of currency reform in 1948 have tipped the scales away from the uncertainty of shares to the safety of bonds and savings. 'In Germany, equities have not always been better than bonds,' notes Diri's Mr Walther, citing the 1970s. But now that the international trend is towards more fund-raising through securities issues and less through bank loans, he sees a new opportunity for Frankfurt. Its regulatory framework is as good as anywhere. 'Now, we've got to put life into it.'</p>

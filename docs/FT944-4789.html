			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Clarke condemns Labour over its stance on VAT Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, accused Labour leaders in the Commons last night of failing to face up to the policy implications of their attempt to prevent value added tax on domestic fuel being increased from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent in April. As the five-day Budget debate neared its conclusion he urged them to show their commitment to healthy public finances by indicating whether they wanted lower taxation or higher public borrowing. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow trade and industry secretary, refused to anticipate a Labour budget, which was unlikely to be introduced for another 2 1/2 years. He said Mr Clarke was being 'absolutely fatuous' in making such a demand. Ministers and Tory backbenchers were repeatedly accused from the opposition benches of breaching specific promises not to extend VAT to domestic fuel. Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, initiated the charges during Question Time exchanges before the start of the debate. He said that in the subsequent vote on a Labour procedural motion, designed to provide an opportunity to reconsider the decision to increase VAT on domestic fuel, there would be 'two types of Tory MP' taking part, those who would 'abide by their specific promise' not to extend VAT to domestic fuel and those who would make any promise to get elected with no intention of keeping it. He asked ministers if they were really saying that there was no other way of restoring the nation's finances 'than through this most hated and unpopular tax'. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, defended the VAT increase and insisted that it had enabled the chancellor to produce a Budget that had 'gained the confidence of the markets'. Underlining the importance of market confidence, Mr Heseltine said it was 'an essential pre-requisite' to maintaining the economic growth on which the prosperity of the nation depended. He urged Labour MPs who impugned the integrity of ministers to examine the role of Mr Blair in seeking to abandon their party's principles in regard to public ownership and opposition to grant maintained schools. Mr Heseltine said government policies were delivering a strong and prosperous economy and attacked Labour MPs for failing to acknowledge the 'transformation' that had taken place over the past 15 years. He contrasted their attitude to that of managers in industry and commerce who knew 'just how exciting are the prospects for their products and services in world markets'.</p>

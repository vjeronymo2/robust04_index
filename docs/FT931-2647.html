			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Restructure bears fruit as Coats rises to Pounds 109m COATS VIYELLA'S pre-tax profit for 1992 rose to Pounds 109.1m compared with Pounds 96.7m, as three years of restructuring began to bear fruit. The figures have been prepared for the first time in accordance with the accounting standards FRS 3 and draft standard FRED 3, the latter reclassifing convertible preference shares as debt and the associated costs as financing costs. Excluding these two standards pre-tax profits would have been Pounds 122m compared with Pounds 111.4m in 1991. Turnover rose 6.5 per cent to Pounds 2.11bn and operating profits increased 19.7 per cent to Pounds 146.2m. The dividend for the year is raised by 0.25p to 7.25p with a final of 4.25p. Earnings per share were given as 10.2p against 10p. The shares rose 11p to 245p. 'Given the economic circumstances, the results are very good,' said Mr Neville Bain, chief executive. The prospects for 1993 were even brighter largely thanks to the fall in the value of sterling. Mr Bain pointed out that this was already encouraging retailers in the UK and exports markets to consider switching supplier to the UK. 'Dollars 1.50 to the pound is just what we've been looking for for many years,' said Sir David Alliance, chairman. The company earns most of its profits outside the UK, but the domestic market was a strong performer in 1992 with operating profits at Pounds 60m (Pounds 37.5m) as a result of restructuring and the economies of scale arising from the Tootal merger nearly two years ago. Again Brazil was the main problem concerning results. Sales fell by 40 per cent amid local economic uncertainty. The Brazilian losses cannot be offset against previous years' profits and pushed the tax charge up to 40.1 per cent compared with 37.8 per cent in 1991. Cash flow remained negative, but Coats expects the figure to be positive for 1993-94 as a cash release programme continues and restructuring costs fall. The benefits of the first full year of Tootal's contribution showed up in the Pounds 83.9m (Pounds 65.9m) operating profits from the thread division, excluding the Brazilian losses. COMMENT The market registered approval of earnings and profits at the top of the range of expectations by taking the shares up to a current p/e of about 24. This can justified if the fall in sterling boosts turnover, margins and market share, if the tax charge can be cut by several percentage points, if thread margins filter through to the other divisions and if the Brazilian profits hole is sewn up. That is a lot of ifs, given that in the current year, pre-tax profits would do well to rise much beyond Pounds 145m with a prospective p/e in the high teens. The company is doing well, but further investment in the shares is for the long term only.</p>

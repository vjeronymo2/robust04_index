In his address, his majesty the king has  underscored the grave responsibilities Jordan has been  shouldering with all manliness and honor toward all pan-Arab  causes, foremost among which is the Palestine question.    In this address, His Majesty King Husayn has addressed  various historical junctures, and explained in detail the  circumstances surrounding these junctures, as well as the  historical facts regarding these junctures. He has also spoken  of the valuable lessons learned from these junctures. We would  like to dwell upon the last one addressed by the king, namely,  the ongoing peace process. His majesty the king has explained  the peace process thoroughly, provided us with an insight into  its future prospects, and underscored the urgent requirements of  this phase.    The first requirement of this phase in the peace process,  which was heralded by a joint Jordanian-Palestinian endeavor,  and indeed, by a single political umbrella, is to promote  bilateral coordination to the degree that reflects the current  state of affairs between two fraternal peoples, who share common  aspirations as well as common national woes, not to mention  blood relations, history, geography, and joint pan-Arab  interests.    Courtesy over this vital issue is no longer useful. The  brothers are required to meet as soon as possible to address  urgent priority issues, and reach a clear agreement that would  delineate duties and responsibilities in all clarity and  accuracy. This is necessary if Jordan, this steadfast Arab  bastion, is to continue to extend its utmost support and  assistance to the Palestinian brothers in observance of its  strong national and pan-Arab commitments.    We are duty bound to say here that the Jordanian-Palestinian  coordination lacks the required credibility. It is necessary to  shun traditional courtesy to proceed together toward a proper  handling of urgent issues, and explore all possible  eventualities, particularly since the implementation of the  Palestinian-Israeli declaration of principles is bound to  affect, one way or another, Jordan's present and future.    Given all this, it is an inescapable duty to put bilateral  coordination in its proper context, and promote it within a firm  institutionalized framework that is capable of protecting the  interests of Jordanians and Palestinians alike and averting any  crises that could burden the strong and firm  Jordanian-Palestinian relations at present or in the future in  any way whatsoever.    The Jordanians and Palestinians, who are brothers, have  lived  and suffered together. They do not have any doubts about the  strenuous efforts Husayn has made throughout the past years to  defend this chaste soil. Likewise, they are aware that the  Hashemite leadership has made relentless and indefatigable  efforts to ensure that the rights are returned to their rightful  owners, and avert imminent dangers threatening this nation. The  Jordanians and Palestinians will not hesitate to continue the  march they have started along the path of unity, which reflects  strongly cherished sentiments within the hearts of all of them.</p>

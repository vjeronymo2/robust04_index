			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed comment: "Issue Disrupted"] </F>   [Text] We ask you to forgive us, dear readers -- the  Saturday issue dated 18 June did not reach you. On the night  before publication V.P. Leontyev, director of the "Pressa"  publishing house, decreed that SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA should be  suspended. Why? Old debts, we were "eating" other people's  paper....    Excuse us, but this has been said dozens of times -- in  court, in arbitration, in the government, in the committee for  the press, with the publishing house leadership.... The debts  were formed mainly as a result of the newspaper's illegal (as  the court established) closure in October 1993 for two and  one-half months on orders from the Ministry for the Press and  the Mass Media headed by V.F. Shumeyko. Even then they amounted  to the astronomical sum of 1.2 billion. We could have settled  debts with the "Pressa" publishing house three times over. But  neither Shumeyko nor anyone else wants to settle debts for their  illegal actions.... The question of subsidies for the press  remained hanging and only what are called "state" publications  close to their hearts were generously subsidized.    After the spring quarantine established for it by the  publishing house SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA appealed for help to readers  and other newspapers. The received the most vigorous support  from the people -- tens of millions of rubles. With this money  we are buying paper, paying for the production and  transportation of current issues. This survival probably seemed  too impertinent to the publisher and he remembered his old debts  and suspended the newspaper.    In their speeches State Duma deputies protested this  treatment of the opposition people's newspaper. Chamber deputy  chairman A.N. Chilingarov was instructed to conduct the  necessary talks on resuming publication. The committee for  information and communications under the chairmanship of M.N.  Poltoranin suggested forming a commission including  representatives of the State Duma and government to resolve this  unusual conflict. The publishing house agreed to publish a few  issues of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA if, it said, there was money to  back them up.... We backed them with your hard-earned rubles,  dear friends.    We take this opportunity to express to you, dear friends,  our  heartfelt thanks for the newspaper's support. The preliminary  results of subscription for the second half of the year have  just become known. All similar publications have substantial  losses compared with January, with ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI restoring  only 7.6 percent of its subscription, losing 484,000  subscribers. SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA has no losses -- it has restored  128.6 percent of its January subscribers. The money submitted  by readers would be enough to settle its debts and to publish  the newspaper regularly. The state organizations only have to  put it at the editorial office's disposal. We hope for  effective aid from deputies. At any rate today it is thanks to  the deputies that we are with you again!</p>

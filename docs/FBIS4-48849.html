			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Mr Derek Hanekom MP, minister of land affairs </F> and chairman of the cabinet committee on the Ingonyama Trust  Act; issued by the Ministry of Land Affairs on 26 May on the  SAPA PR Wire Service]    [Text] The cabinet committee appointed to investigate,  report and make recommendations on the background, reasons for  the implications of the Ingonyama [King's] Trust Act, has met  for the second time today.    A committee of experts has been appointed to assist the  cabinet committee in its investigations. Prof Harriet Ngubane  MP, Attorney Geoff Budlender (director of the Legal Resources  Centre), Adv Pius Langa SC [Senior Counselor] (Durban Bar and  president of the National Association of Democratic Lawyers) and  Mr Erik Buiten (chief director of the Department of Regional and  Land Affairs) are serving on the technical committee. Further  assistance is being provided by the Department of Regional and  Land Affairs.    The cabinet committee will inform cabinet on 1 June 1994 of  steps taken and the progress being made in the investigation. It  is envisaged that the final report and recommendations will be  presented to cabinet on 14 June 1994.    In conclusion, there seems to be some confusion regarding  the  extent of land which may be subject to the Ingonyama Trust, in  terms of the KwaZulu Ingonyama Trust Act. Approximately  3,070,000 hectares of former sa development trust land was  transferred in terms of the above act, all situated within the  jurisdiction of the former KwaZulu Legislative Assembly.    This includes all of the land within KwaZulu, except the  following: tribally owned land of some 8,000 ha; privately owned  land of some 153,000 ha; the land described in Schedule 4 of  Proclamation R28/1992 of 41,500 ha, and the former SA  Development Trust Land situated outside KwaZulu (i.e. Makatini  Flats, Goodluck Farms, Ntambanana Farms, Impendhle Farms, Platt  Estates area, Highflats Farms, Gundrift Farms, Margate Corridor  Farms, Meringa Flats, Gingindluvu Farms).    It could be mentioned that the majority of land transferred  in terms of the Ingonyama Trust Act had been occupied by tribes  and communities since before 1913. This category of land  consists of some 2,300,000 ha, previously referred to as the  Zululand reserves.    In the interest of an open and accountable process,  submissions by interested parties will be welcomed. However, due  to the urgency and sensitivity of the issue, submissions can  only be accepted until midnight on Wednesday, 1 June 1994.  Submissions on the Ingonyama Trust Act and its implications can  be faxed to the Ministry of Land Affairs at (012) 211-244.</p>

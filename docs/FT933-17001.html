			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Spotlight shunned by the SFO content to let the attorney-general step into the spotlight to rebut the allegations of impropriety made by Mr Michael Mates over the office's handling of Mr Asil Nadir's case. The brief denial of the allegations issued by Mr George Staple, the SFO director, a few hours after Mr Mates's speech, remains its only official comment on the furore. The office said: 'All the criticisms have been answered - we don't want to perpetuate this.' However, the allegations have forced the office on to the defensive. A few days prior to Mr Mates's statement, senior police investigators were ordered by the office to shut out all contacts with the press - whether overt or covert. Both the police involved and the office have become nervous at the way the whole controversy has developed. 'This is a political issue that we just don't want to get drawn into,' said one investigator. Senior investigators insist there is no conspiracy other than Mr Nadir's own efforts to undermine their attempts to bring him to justice. A view widely held among those at the office and others probing the affairs of Polly Peck is that the campaigning by Mr Nadir and others such as Mr Mates is serving to diminish any prospect that the fugitive tycoon could have a fair trial in Britain, should he ever be brought back before the courts here. One senior investigator said yesterday: 'Mr Mates had been misled . . . What his allegations are succeeding in doing is putting a smokescreen around Mr Nadir.' The allegations have come at a sensitive time for the SFO, with the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice due to report next week.</p>

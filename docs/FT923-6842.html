			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Heaven can wait, but Yugoslavia cannot: Edward Mortimer observes attempts to mediate and prevent conflict in the republics of Croatia and Macedonia We all know that the European Community exists, but only privileged mortals have actually seen it. This week I became one of them. On the war-scarred mountain roads of Croatia, Europe appeared to me in tangible form. It took the shape of two white vehicles, a Fiat and an off-road Mercedes. One was driven by a Frenchman, the other by a Spaniard, and both flew the dark blue flag with 12 gold stars. I not only saw the cars, I rode in them. They transported me to the mysterious 'Serb Republic of Krajina'. I visited its capital, Knin, where I met its president, Mr Goran Hadzic. Europe is powerful, but not omnipotent. The ex-Yugoslav world is a Homeric one, in which rival deities maintain an uneasy coexistence. In principle, the dark blue flag can circulate at will throughout the land. In practice there are roadblocks and checkpoints to be negotiated. To get to Mr Hadzic's mountain kingdom, starting from the Dalmatian port of Split, you must first pass a Croatian army checkpoint, then a UN one, then one operated by the Serb militia. Among these various deities, the UN enjoys a Zeus-like primacy: the light blue flag takes precedence over the dark blue. This was manifested in the fact that the longest hold-up occurred at the UN checkpoint. Mr Thierry de Beauce, charge de mission at the Elysee and personal envoy of Lord Carrington, sweated under the harsh Balkan sun while Kenyan soldiers of Unprofor (the UN Protection Force) discussed among themselves, in Swahili, what to do about the fact that they had received no order to let him through. Mr de Beauce, a French novelist, is vice-chairman of the Carrington peace conference, with special responsibility for problems of national minorities. While the conference has been notoriously unsuccessful in stopping the war, it has busied itself trying to work out political solutions to the underlying conflicts: those that have already caused fighting, and those that might do so in the future. This week's mission, on which I was invited as an observer, dealt with one conflict in each category. The status of the Krajina Serbs was the main issue at stake in the war in Croatia last year. The results were all too visible along our route through the 'pink zone' - an area not included in the UN Protected Area but, for the moment, under de facto Serb control. There is scarcely a civilian inhabitant to be seen; only deserted villages of destroyed houses. Mr de Beauce's task was to persuade Mr Hadzic to embark on negotiations with the Croatian government. The Krajina or 'frontierland' was part of Croatia until last year. As far as the EC is concerned, it still is. This is why Mr Hadzic's people come within Mr de Beauce's terms of reference. Needless to say, that is also the view of the Croatian government. But that is not how Mr Hadzic and his associates see the matter. They maintain that their self-proclaimed republic is now independent, and much entitled to international recognition as Croatia itself. If it forms part of any larger entity in the future, it should certainly not be Croatia but a federation of Serb states, presumably including Serbia proper, Montenegro, and the equally self-proclaimed 'Serb Republic' in neighbouring Bosnia. The outcome of the war in Bosnia is indeed crucial to Krajina's future. That war has enabled the Serbs to establish a 30 km-wide corridor across northern Bosnia, linking Krajina to Belgrade and thus enabling it to receive supplies. This has given new confidence to Mr Hadzic and the people around him, encouraging them to reject out of hand any suggestion that they might revert to any kind of special status within Croatia. Mr Hadzic admits that had Croatia offered before the war the concessions it is offering now the Serbs would have been delighted. But he adds that if he agreed now to negotiate on a special status within Croatia, 'I should be signing my own death warrant'. Since it is equally clear that Croatia will not accept Krajina's independence, the only hope seems to be that talks might begin on certain concrete points so as to re-establish a minimum of trust and communication between the two sides. Mr Hadzic suggested that Croatia should start by allowing 20,000 Serb refugees to return to their homes in western Slavonia, in central Croatia. The fact that he thought they would be willing to do so, while the area remains under Croatian government control, was the only encouraging sign I could glean from the visit. Since there are many more Croat refugees who wish to return to areas now under Serb control, there might be the makings of a deal here, if the UN could guarantee the security of the returnees on both sides. But even that would be difficult to negotiate, with feeling already rising in Croatia against the UN force, whose presence is seen by many as helping to legitimise and perpetuate Serb control of the protected areas. The EC's chances of putting Croatia together again cannot be rated high. But perhaps at least it can help prevent Macedonia from falling apart. That was the other object of Mr de Beauce's trip, which took us to the lakeside resort of Ohrid, in the south-west of the Macedonian republic. There we were entertained by the president, Mr Kiro Gligorov, despite the fact that the EC has still not recognised his republic, even though advised by its own arbitration commission that Macedonia fulfils all the criteria for recognition. There is still that awkward problem of its name. The EC, in deference to Greece, has offered to recognise the republic under any name that does not include the word 'Macedonia'. But the republic's inhabitants, whatever their ethnic and linguistic connections with Bulgarians and other Slavs, are used to being Macedonians and would not recognise themselves under any other name. Or rather, that is true of the majority of the republic's inhabitants. A large minority, probably about 25 per cent, are not Slavs but Albanians and consider themselves the victims of various kinds of discrimination and repression by the Macedonian majority. The Albanians are, however, about to join a coalition government with Mr Gligorov's party, and both sides seem aware of the importance of solving their differences peacefully. The risk that they might end up in a similar position to Serbs and Croats is real, especially if fighting breaks out between Serbs and Albanians in neighbouring Kosovo. Yet both also clearly valued Mr de Beauce's presence, knowing that without third-party involvement they would find it hard to communicate. 'We shall always need your help,' he was told by Mr Halili, leader of the main Albanian party. 'Europe', it seems, is still in demand in the Balkans, whether west Europeans want it or not.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Croatia's Foreign Minister Mate Granic has called  for continuing dialogue in order to find a lasting solution to  the armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Granic told the  United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva that  negotiations were the only way to end the war and find a  political settlement to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    However Granic, who is also deputy prime minister, made no  reference to Wednesday's statement by ethnic Croatians in Bosnia  that they were willing to consider a union with Bosnia's  Muslims. Croatians and Muslims in Bosnia have agreed a  cease-fire, which comes into effect at midday on Friday.</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Clinton puts his stamp on legal system President Bill Clinton may be having mixed success in persuading Congress to pass the laws he wants, but he is making more progress at putting his stamp on the men and women who will interpret those laws. Already, Mr Clinton has won Senate confirmation for 86 of his nominees to be federal judges, and White House officials hope they may be able to squeeze another 40 or so through in the next few weeks before the Senate breaks up ahead of November's congressional elections. That would not only make a dent in the sizeable backlog of unfilled judgeships that Mr Clinton inherited from President George Bush; it would also go some way to changing the complexion of the federal judiciary away from the conservative nominees of Mr Bush and President Ronald Reagan. That includes Mr Clinton's two nominees to the nine-member Supreme Court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Stephen Breyer, the first two justices nominated by a Democratic president since President Lyndon Johnson. In ideological terms, the change is not stark. Very few of Mr Clinton's nominees have aroused much opposition. Most have been, like Mrs Ginsburg and Mr Breyer, moderates of unquestioned legal competence. This is in contrast to the Justice Department, where in fields ranging from civil rights to anti-trust the Clinton administration has diverged sharply from the policies of the Reagan and Bush years. The biggest confirmation row so far came over Judge Rosemary Barkett, a former Catholic nun from Florida whose reservations about the death penalty came under attack. But Ms Barkett eventually won confirmation to a seat on the 11th circuit federal appeals court, which covers Florida, Georgia and Alabama. Another nominee who has aroused some controversy, Judge Lee Sarokin, has yet to be confirmed. Mr Sarokin was removed in 1992 from a liability case against a cigarette company by the 3rd circuit appeals court to which he has now been nominated. In diversity of background, however, Mr Clinton's selections differ radically from the white males chosen overwhelmingly by Mr Reagan and Mr Bush. Among the judges so far nominated or confirmed, Mr Clinton has already picked more women than Mr Bush did in his whole four-year term, and over one-third more than Mr Reagan in eight years. The 28 black Americans he has nominated beat by almost 50 per cent the combined Reagan-Bush total.</p>

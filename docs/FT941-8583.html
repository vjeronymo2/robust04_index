			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Volatility is the new keynote in Zurich  -Ian Rodger on the recent attack of nerves in the formerly placid Swiss equity market Investors in the Swiss stock market have become accustomed to almost automatic share price rises in the past couple of years. The SPI all-share index climbed virtually without pause in 1993 and started this year on much the same trend, with a brisk advance of 6.4 per cent in January. But the party finally came to an abrupt end last week. While most world stock markets sagged slightly following the rise in US interest rates and then recovered, the Swiss market dropped more sharply than it had in over a year. In six sessions from February 7, the SPI shed more than 6 per cent of its value, while the SMI index of 18 leading shares tumbled 8.9 per cent. Suddenly, the adjective on every analyst's lips is 'volatile'. 'We are now in a period of nervousness,' says Mr Serge Ledermann, head of Swiss equity research at Geneva bankers Lombard, Odier. In spite of this week's recovery, with the SPI and the SMI up by 3.5 and 4.3 per cent respectively since Monday evening, few believe the market will return to its placid rising pattern in the near future. 'We do not expect any new highs in the next few months,' says Mr Bernhard Tschanz of Credit Suisse in Zurich. As might be expected following an interest rate rise, the main victims of last week's correction were bank shares. The banking sub-index of the SPI fell 6.4 per cent over the six sessions to Tuesday. The important chemical and pharmaceutical sector was on trend with a 6.2 per cent setback, as was the Nestle-dominated food sector. On the other hand, the cyclical machinery group declined only 3.7 per cent, indicating the increasing attention paid to these shares as the prospects of economic recovery in Europe improve. Analysts point out that the correction was in many respects overdue. The Swiss market, which is perhaps valued at 15 times expected 1994 earnings, has been look-ing expensive relative to other European markets for several weeks. It is widely known that many international portfolio managers have recently reduced their Swiss weightings. Thus, as Mr Ledermann suggests, the correction was logical even though the event that provoked it was neither unexpected nor directly damaging. There is also a feeling that a longer term structural shift is taking place. In the past two years, Swiss equities have been driven by the strong downward interest rate trend and the reassessment of earnings following much improved disclosure by most Swiss companies. From now on, says Mr Ledermann, the focus will be much more on individual companies' profit performance. This is already most clearly evident in the pharmaceuticals sector, where Roche shares continue significantly to outperform those of its local rivals, Ciba and Sandoz. Roche non-voting shares are up 12.4 per cent since the beginning of the year to SFr7,050, while Sandoz bearers are off 6.0 per cent and Ciba registered down 1 per cent. Similarly, among the big banks, Union Bank of Switzerland bearers are 8.4 per cent higher since the end of December, while bearers of CS Holding, the group built around Credit Suisse, are down nearly 2 per cent. It is probably no coincidence that, in both of these cases, Mr Martin Ebner's influential BZ Bank group in Zurich has made clear its preferences for UBS and Roche. BK Vision and Pharma Vision, investment companies controlled by BZ, have indicated in the past few weeks that they would probably sell off their large holdings in Ciba and CS Holding. Some analysts have also pointed to BZ as the source of an unusually high level of activity in the shares of Nestle in the past few weeks. Nearly SFr3.8bn in the food group's shares were traded in January, more than double the monthly average last year. The price, at SFr1,367 yesterday, is up by nearly 7 per cent since the beginning of the year. Food Vision, anyone?</p>

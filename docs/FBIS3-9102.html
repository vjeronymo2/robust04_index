			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jozef Moravcik, former minister of foreign </F> affairs and prime minister-designate, by Ivan Stulajter; place  and date not given: "Michal Kovac's Course of Action During the  Meeting With Bill Clinton Was in No Way Unusual"]    [Text] [Stulajter] Speaking about the meeting of  representatives of the Visegrad Four countries with U.S.  President Bill Clinton in Prague, in his address to the National  Council of the Slovak Republic on Friday [11 March], Vladimir  Meciar said that this was an opportunity to "tackle the security  and economic interests of the Slovak Republic, to tackle  cooperation and bilateral relations between the United States  and Slovakia. We had worked out a great deal in this regard,  but, out of 40 minutes [reserved for the meeting], President  Kovac had reserved 34 minutes for himself, for a one-sided  speech prepared in writing. I did not have a chance." From the  viewpoint of protocol, what role was assigned to the prime  ministers of the Visegrad Four countries at the talks with Bill  Clinton?    [Moravcik] I do not know how the other representatives of  the Visegrad Four countries conducted their talks. It is quite  common in diplomatic practice that the main and sometimes  exclusive role at talks is played by the delegation head, which  was the president of the Slovak Republic.    [Stulajter] Which subject matters did the talks with the  U.S. President touch upon?    [Moravcik] The talks focused on issues concerning security,  participation in the Partnership for Peace project, Slovakia's  foreign policy orientation, open foreign policy problems, and  the expansion of bilateral relations.    [Stulajter] Would it have been possible to sign any  documents in Prague?    [Moravcik] No signing of documents had been planned.    [Stulajter] Was Slovak President Michal Kovac's course of  action during the talks with Bill Clinton unusual in any way,  compared with the normal practice?    [Moravcik] I do not consider anything that happened unusual.    [Stulajter] How do you assess the visit from your point of  view?    [Moravcik] The talks fulfilled the basic aim. They  emphasized our interest in integration into the Euro-Atlantic  security system, our acceptance of the offer to participate in  the Partnership for Peace project, and our interest in the  development of bilateral relations, especially in the sphere of  economic cooperation.</p>

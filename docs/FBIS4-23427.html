			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Paul Stober and Farouk Chothia] </F>   [Text] The Goldstone Commission has information linking the  new minister of police in KwaZulu/Natal, Celani Mtetwa, to  illegal gun- unning for Inkatha.    Sources inside and outside the commission confirmed this  week  that they have information tying Mtetwa to the receipt of  weapons from the network alleged to have been set up by renegade  South African Police members.    The police portfolio in the Natal cabinet has been at the  centre of this week's battle between the ANC and the Inkatha  Freedom Party [IFP] in Natal over regional executive positions.    It has also emerged that the government of national unity is  keeping new details of the involvement of key former South  African Police [SAP] and IFP officials in political violence  under close wraps for fear of the political repercussions.    The MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN has been leaked the second report  of the  Transitional Executive Council [TEC] task group on hit squads in  the KwaZulu Police which names IFP PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging] leader Themba Khoza, IFP PWV parliamentarian  Humphrey Ndlovu, and 16 senior KwaZulu (KZP) policemen who are  said to have taken part in hit squad activity. No action has  been taken on this, although it is dated March 29. And a new  Goldstone report, which was expected to have been made public,  has been sent to the international team investigating the  involvement of IFP and SAP officials in "third force" activity.    This report, dealing with covert operations against anti-  apartheid activists, corruption and other criminal activities by  policemen, was expected to be released three weeks ago,  according to sources in the ANC.    Sources in the commission have confirmed that such a report  was drawn up. "There was going to be a report but it was  decided it was inappropriate for Goldstone to have his own  report now that the international team was investigating," said  a source close to the minister of safety and security.  Goldstone is understood to have discussed the report with the  minister, Sidney Mufamadi.    Judge Richard Goldstone confirmed his commission had handed  over the relevant information to the international team. "All  information has been submitted to the international team," he  said. Asked if his commission would produce further reports on  the matter, he said: "It depends very much on what comes out of  the international investigation. There may or may not be, I  really can't say."    The second report by the TEC task group investigating  hitsquads in the KwaZulu Police recommends the immediate  suspension of the deputy commissioner of the KZP, Major General  Sipho Mathe, on grounds that he aided and concealed the  activities of hit men in the KZP. Among other things, he is  accused of "disgraceful conduct" by failing to investigate hit  squad claims against three senior Inkatha members.    The report paints a frightening picture of the systematic  concealment, failure to investigate and conniving at hit squad  activity in the KZP by senior officers. It recommends the  suspension of two KZP brigadiers, C.P. Mzimela and B.L. Ndlovu,  and a district commander, Lieutenant Colonel Sipho Mdluli. It  also calls for charges of defeating the ends of justice to be  investigated against L.A. Hlengwa, a former policeman and  currently an IFP head office official in Ulundi. Also  recommended is the suspension of two majors, two captains and a  lieutenant and the investigation of a brigadier, a major and two  captains.    The TEC report says an investigation into a massacre at  Nqutu, Natal by a KwaZulu policeman, Lieutenant Mbatha,  "revealed that the rest of the suspects were members of a hit  squad that operated from hostels in East Rand and that Themba  Khoza and Humphrey Ndlovu were involved in the planning of the  massacre."    The reluctance to take firm action against "third force"  suspects reflects differences in both the ANC and the government  about how to deal with criminal rightwing elements in the  security forces.    In the ANC, there are those who are urging a "softly-softly"  approach, in an attempt to win these elements over. They appear  to have the backing of State President Nelson Mandela.    Others feel the quick removal of those who were involved in  orchestrating violence is the only way to finally stop those  involved in political destabilisation and get to the bottom of  the political violence which has rocked South Africa since 1990.    The debate around indemnity is also crucial. The authors of  the TEC report urge the TEC to grant selective indemnity to  witnesses who are prepared to give further details of "third  force" activity. They warn that without being able to offer  potential witnesses indemnity, there is "little or no prospect  of rooting out those orchestrating this significant cause of  political violence."    The government has made no substantial moves towards  addressing this particular indemnity issue. Senior former South  African Police officers are pushing for a blanket indemnity for  all political crimes after a cut off date, without disclosure of  the crime. They apparently hope this will prevent lower ranking  officers from testifying against their seniors.    The ANC and human rights activists have been pushing for the  full disclosure by those involved in political violence to help  them with their investigations. At the moment, the government  is taking the view that they cannot defy the generals without  destabilising the security forces -- something they are not  prepared to risk.    Meanwhile, all Judge Goldstone's witnesses -- the mystery  "Qs" who were sent to Denmark for safety in the wake of the  release of the "third force" report -- were brought back to  South Africa three weeks ago.</p>

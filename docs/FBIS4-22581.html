			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Plyushch, chairman of the Ukrainian </F> Supreme Council, by Aleksandr Sokol, parliamentary  correspondent: "Whoever Has the Power Has the Keys to Paradise.  And These Keys Are Granted by the People. Let Us Remember That  When Electing Parliament on 10 April and the President of  Ukraine on 26 June: Ivan Plyushch: 'We Must Bring New Blood to  Power As Quickly As Possible'"]    [Text] As we know, Supreme Soviet Council Ivan  Plyushch won the elections. And convincingly--he received more  than 71 percent of the votes. But that was not the event that  attracted general attention. What got people stirred up was  Plyushch's appeal not to postpone the presidential elections but  to conduct them, as decreed by the Supreme Council, on 26 June  of this year.    Before that, a different opinion had been expressed.  Leonid Kravchuk, television, and many political figures had  asserted and are still trying to prove that presidential  elections on the scheduled date would be if not fatal then at  least inexpedient. The unexpected statement from the head of  parliament, understandably, elicited various interpretations.  Aleksandr Sokol decided to go to him for clarification.    [Sokol] Ivan Stepanovich! Having expressed your opinion  about  the presidential elections next to the ballot box, you then  repeated it on television. Do you really think that under  current conditions presidential elections are possible and  necessary?    [Plyushch] I do not think we can continue to mark time; we  must finally carry out the reforms. Both political and economic.  People involved with politics and economics understand that  these spheres of activity are interconnected. Not so long ago we  were saying: First political reforms and then economic. Today we  are exclaiming: "The economy is the root of all evil!" But to an  unprejudiced person it is clear that we have no national economy  because we have not carried out political reforms.    I am profoundly convinced that there is a limit to  everything. There was one for the Supreme Council elected in  1990 as well. Because in addition to the fact that today's state  of affairs caused the people to be dissatisfied with it, other  problems arose as well: Who was elected how, at what time, under  what system, in what state, etc., etc. I think the deputies  adopted the only correct decision: to schedule the elections  early. But this demand was also made to the executive power, to  the president.    Leonid Makarovych and I had no differences of opinion  regarding the idea that we should adopt a decree concerning both  the Supreme Council and the president simultaneously. As we  know, it was duly adopted. And suddenly there is this turn.    There is nothing surprising about the fact that the  president's apparatus and his local structures are trying to  stay as long as possible. That is a natural process. Something  else is confusing.    After the law on the formation of new regional organs of  power was adopted, after this was ordered by the president, a  frenzied campaign developed regarding this law. The were looking  for flaws, dramatizing the fact that the time of the elections  coincides with a busy time for agricultural work, sending  telegrams, working on the structures. Things reached a point  where the president's representative stated at an official  conference: The person who put this law through is a criminal.  Since the person in charge of the conference did not say  anything, the speaker clarified: This was done by Plyushch...    The rumor was spread that some kind of revenge was planned.  But can we allow such a malicious fabrication?! This has to do  with something altogether different. If we want reform, if we  want to improve our lives, we need the appropriate people--from  the chairman of the rural soviet to the head of parliament, from  the brigade leader to the prime minister. And we must be  concerned about people like that. And in the shortest amount of  time, without getting bogged down in elections.    Elections are not an end in themselves, not a means of  settling scores. The authorities must be elected locally. They  are the expression of the will of the people. From 27 March  through 10 April they must entrust the power to the legislators,  and on 26 June--to the executive structures. If this is done  Ukraine will for the first time have a power actually created by  the people. Those at the helm will be obligated to act and  justify this confidence. Now let us imagine that nothing were to  happen. The authorities would be sitting there in suspense...    [Sokol] But what about the provision of the law that says  that the presidential election campaign should begin four months  before the elections? After all, it is too late for that.    [Plyushch] This legal norm was written for normal life. We  are living under the conditions of an ever deepening crisis. If  we stick to formalities, then 26 June is indeed an unrealistic  date for presidential elections. But if we are guided by higher  interests and take reality into account, we can find a solution.  All we have to do is want it. Moreover, the presidential  election campaign began a long time ago, back when both inside  and outside parliament there was the threatening demand: "Down  with the Supreme Council!" "Down with the president!" There is  quite enough time to nominate candidates and discuss them.    But I do not want to link the need for forthcoming changes  to  the presidential elections alone. The authorities must be  elected locally. That is the main thing. A situation like the  one we have now should not be. And just look--they are blaming  Kravchuk and Plyushch for everything. Because of them the buses  are not running, there is no control over trade in medicine,  they registered many unneeded small enterprises, they created a  sea of booths, they reduced the people to poverty. And so forth  and so on. They themselves did this, they used up their time,  and now they are looking for someone to blame. They used to damn  the party, the administrative system, and now they have decided  to heap everything on the party in power even though they  themselves belong to it...    The longer the situation continues, the greater will be the  uncertainty in the society, and irresponsibility and other  negative phenomena will increase.    [Sokol] If you do not object, let us return to the  presidential elections. How can we elect one if we do not know  his ultimate status and authority?    [Plyushch] It is true, legislation does not clearly indicate  what kind of future president and new government we should have.  But the Supreme Council has already considered the  constitutional foundations of the organization of power in  Ukraine. They decided that the new members would dot all the  i's. The newly elected deputies would determine, in particular,  whether the prime minister would be the head of the executive  power or if everything would remain as it is: The president both  the head of the state and the head of the executive power. It  would not take as much time to resolve this problem as some  people think.    The result will depend on the political forces that come to  parliament. I am convinced that the executive power should be  concentrated in one set of hands. The president could be in  charge of it. But then he must head up the government. In this  case there is no need for a prime minister. This is the  presidential form of government chosen recently in Belarus.    It exists in America as well, and it has for a long time.  But  we also have experience: Over two years we have seen that with  the kind of system we have now nobody is responsible for the  state of affairs in the country. Therefore I will repeat once  again: There is no need to make a lot of noise and postpone the  new elections; instead we should prepare for them. There is time  enough for that.    [Sokol] Ivan Stepanovich! But it is also possible to have a  situation where Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk could say that the  decision of the early elections was unconstitutional. There are  grounds for such a statement.    [Plyushch] But he signed the law on this...    [Sokol] And the last thing. There is reason to think that  the  elections will not be held on 26 June anyway. By insisting on  your position, are you not risking a certain amount of your  authority?    [Plyushch] I am. But that is not the essential thing. The  main thing is to change the situation for the better. And as  quickly as possible. The situation will depend on many factors.  If I end up alone, it will be a voice howling in the desert.    You are well aware of my position regarding the election of  the new members of the Supreme Council. There was so much  shouting: "The elections will not take place!" I will not even  consider the idea that the people will not come to them. Even  what we have today is an important political victory. All we  have to do is bring things to completion.    Today people have started saying that the people can make  the  best choice. Yes, they can. But they will never make the  mistakes of which a single person is capable. If we allow an  individual to have the power--there will be immeasurably more  mistakes.</p>

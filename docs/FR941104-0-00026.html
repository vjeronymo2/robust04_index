			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter questioned how authorization of the State program would be affected by EPA's promulgation of a final federal rule regarding corrective action. The commenter also questioned whether EPA intended to use the proposed subpart S corrective action rules to measure the State's ``consistency'' with the federal corrective action program; and what EPA intended when EPA stated in its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that EPA's proposed definition of a SWMU ``will be the controlling interpretation against which Washington's regulatory definition of a solid waste management unit will be measured until EPA codifies a statutory or regulatory definition.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response, should EPA finalize a federal rule regarding corrective action at some point after the State has received corrective action authorization, the State will be required to submit an application for a revision of the State corrective action program, in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(e)(1) and 271.25. Until EPA promulgates a final federal corrective action rule, EPA intends to use its proposed subpart S rules (55 FR 30798, July 27, 1990) as the measure of consistency in order to determine whether the State's authorized corrective action program is at least as stringent as the federal corrective action program would be under the proposed Subpart S rule. Since the proposed subpart S rule has not yet been finalized, EPA cannot authorize nor enforce the provisions of Subpart S. However, EPA is currently using the provisions contained in the proposed Subpart S rule as guidance when conducting federal corrective actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters raised concerns regarding the State of Washington's siting criteria for new hazardous waste facilities. In response, the proposed approval and authorization of Washington's hazardous waste program revision is for a corrective action program. Since the corrective action program under RCRA is intended to address clean up of releases of hazardous waste at existing hazardous waste facilities, the commenters' concerns regarding siting of new facilities are outside the scope of this current authorization action. The State's siting criteria are State regulations which have no federal counterpart, and as such are not part of the federal RCRA program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

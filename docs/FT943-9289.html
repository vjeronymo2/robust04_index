			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Senate backs community banks: Legislation will allow easier access to credit The Clinton administration has completed the first item on its banking legislation agenda with a Senate vote to pass the Community Development Act, which will set up a Dollars 382m (Pounds 246.4m) fund to spur the creation of local development banks and partnerships in economically distressed communities. But a more far-reaching bill to allow banks to open branches outside their home states, overturning decades of US banking tradition, remains blocked in the Senate. Although its supporters believe they will easily win a vote on the measure, which passed the House of Representatives last month, the debate on healthcare reform has pushed it off until September, at the earliest. The Community Development Act was a significant component of President Bill Clinton's economic programme, and administration officials say it should improve access to credit for communities which have found it difficult to obtain financing. Mr Frank Newman, undersecretary for domestic finance at the US Treasury, said he hoped within a year not only to establish the fund and set out the criteria on which it would judge applications, but also to make the first investments. The fund may offer equity, loans or grants to community development banks, as well as providing credits to traditional banks which increase their community lending. If, as Mr Newman hopes, the Senate passes the Interstate Branching Bill this year, the administration still has unfinished business on its banking agenda when a new Congress comes to Washington next year. Mr Newman lists the securities activities of US financial institutions, issues of fair lending and community responsibility for financial services companies which are not banks, and an overhaul of the Federal Home Loan Bank system as priorities. But the issue which bankers will be watching most closely is the consolidation of the various agencies which now supervise banking activity. Treasury proposals to consolidate federal bank regulators into a single agency were put off this year in the face of opposition from the Federal Reserve, which has supervisory responsibility for a large portion of the banking industry. Mr Newman said the Treasury was 'pretty far along' in its efforts to resolve the disagreement with the Fed.</p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> RANGERS WIN FIRST DIVISION TITLE SINCE '42  </P> <P> The New York Rangers were the hottest team in the NHL during the first month of  the season, then plunged to the bottom of the Patrick Division in early  January.  </P> <P> Tuesday night, the Rangers clinched their first division championship in 48  years with a 7-4 victory over the Quebec Nordiques at Quebec City.  </P> <P> The Rangers, whose last title came in 1941-42 when the NHL was a seven-team  league, rallied for five third-period goals in less than 10 minutes against the  Nordiques, the league's worst team.  </P> <P> "At the start of the season, we had just hoped to make the playoffs," said  Ranger Coach Roger Neilson, who got the job less than a month before training  camp began in September. "But when we got to Christmas and no one had run away,  we knew we'd have a chance."  </P> <P> Buffalo 6, Detroit 5 -- Dave Andreychuk scored three times during a five-goal  first period at Detroit as the Sabres eliminated the Red Wings from playoff  contention.  </P> <P> The Red Wings, two-time defending Norris Division champions, missed the  playoffs for the first time since 1985-86 and for the first time in Jacques  Demers' four years as coach.  </P> <P> New Jersey 4, Washington 1 -- Kirk Muller and Dave Maley scored during a 1:12  span midway through the first period at East Rutherford, N.J., as the Devils  prevented the Capitals from clinching a playoff spot and assured themselves of  finishing no worse than third in the Patrick Division -- their best finish  ever.  </P> <P> Calgary 4, New York Islanders 2 -- Theoren Fleury scored the tiebreaking goal  late in the second period at Uniondale, N.Y., as the Flames ended a three-game  losing streak and sent the Islanders to the brink of playoff elimination.  </P> <P> The Islanders must win their two remaining games and the Pittsburgh Penguins  must lose two for New York to make the playoffs.  </P> <P> Hartford 3, Pittsburgh 3 -- Yvon Corriveau and Adam Burt scored for the Whalers  in the third period at Pittsburgh, extending the Penguins' winless streak to  six games.  </P> <P> Boston 3, St. Louis 0 -- Reggie Lemelin made 33 saves at St. Louis as the  Bruins handed the Blues their sixth consecutive loss.  </P> <P> Edmonton 4, Vancouver 1 -- Oiler goaltender Bill Ranford tuned up for the  playoffs by turning aside 31 shots at Vancouver.  </P></p>

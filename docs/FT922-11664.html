			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / UK Company News: Tharsis loss rises and dividend halved Losses at Tharsis, the Glasgow-based group mainly involved in land development in Spain, increased from Pounds 153,000 to Pounds 290,000 in 1991 and for the second successive year the dividend is halved. There is no final payment, leaving the total at 3p. In 1990 the distribution was cut from 12.5p to 6p. On top of the loss, there were extraordinary charges of Pounds 1.46m. More than Pounds 1m covered the costs of the ruling in the Spanish courts against the company in respect of a claim of guarantees given for the performance of an associate company. The directors have received legal advice that the judgment should be appealed. Low gold price and a weak dollar on the result of bullion operations caused Filon Sur to return a substantial loss, of which Pounds 408,000 has been charged to Tharsis. After a tax credit, losses came to 5.32p (earnings 3.23p).</p>

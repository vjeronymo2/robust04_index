			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Banks face Dollars 3bn losses on their O&amp;Y loans: Markets shudder after world's biggest property developer files for insolvency protection FINANCIAL MARKETS around the world shuddered yesterday at the news that Olympia &amp; York, the world's biggest property developer, had filed for insolvency protection in Canada and the US late on Thursday night. As the markets recovered their poise, it emerged that banks face losses of at least Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) on their loans to O&amp;Y. The scale of banks' losses became clear after Citicorp, the biggest US bank, said in a submission to the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission that it had written off Dollars 101m of its loans to the property developer and classified the remaining Dollars 279m as non-performing. Bankers said they believed other banks' losses on O&amp;Y loans to be similar. Indeed, bank losses could be higher still, since Citicorp said it took the Dollars 101m write off before the group made its filing for protection from its creditors. O&amp;Y insisted that Canary Wharf, a 10-year project started in 1987 and costing up to Pounds 3bn, was unaffected by the legal moves in Canada and would continue on schedule. The reassurances helped to calm the London stock market, where bank and property shares were marked down sharply at the start of trading but clawed their way back by the end of the day. News of Citicorp's losses was the most startling development on a day filled with repercussions from O&amp;Y's move. Other developments included: The disclosure by O&amp;Y's chief bank negotiator, Mr Steve Miller, that O&amp;Y is hopeful the government will rent 500,000 square feet of unoccupied office space at Canary Wharf. Such a move could save the Docklands development from filing for insolvency protection in the UK. The government is being offered the space, enough for 2,000 civil servants, at Pounds 15 a square foot. A signal from Mr John Major that there would be no government 'bail-out' to rescue Canary Wharf and, therefore, that it would only take the space at a commercial rent. The prime minister's office also backed the Treasury's refusal to reduce O&amp;Y's Pounds 400m contribution to the costs of extending the Jubilee underground railway line to Canary Wharf. However, Mr Miller hinted that construction of the Jubilee line could be delayed by two years, to defer O&amp;Y's and its bankers' contributions to the cost, though he hopes this can be avoided. The Canary Wharf banks are also pressing for the final Pounds 300m tranche of the Jubilee payment to be deferred for many years. A preliminary decision by a caucus of bank lenders to Canary Wharf to keep the Docklands project out of administration under UK insolvency procedures until at least the end of May, though a formal decision will be made over the weekend. Pressure on the Canadian dollar, following O&amp;Y's insolvency filings, which was stemmed by co-ordinated intervention by the Bank of England and the Royal Bank of Canada. Meanwhile, O&amp;Y's insolvency filing, under Canada's Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act, initially gives O&amp;Y protection from its creditors in Canada until October 21. Thereafter, any agreement on restructuring its debt will have to be approved by three quarters of each class of lender. In granting the order, Mr Justice Robert Blair said the potential implications of O&amp;Y collapsing were 'startling, far-reaching and worldwide. 'If such a cataclysm can be avoided, every effort should be made to do so', he said. O&amp;Y said yesterday that, during the period of protection, it would halt payments on CDollars 8.4bn (Pounds 3.96bn) of its total CDollars 14bn of debt, including CDollars 600m-CDollars 700m a year in interest. But it said all other payments to employees, suppliers and tenants would be maintained. Mr Gerald Greenwald, O&amp;Y's president, described the debt standstill as a 'surgical' move, and said it would 'provide the stability for operating companies to concentrate on the long-term restructuring plan'. He said that negotiations with lenders were 'making good progress'. According to Toronto court documents, O&amp;Y will present a debt restructuring plan by July 13 for approval of its creditors. It will report on the status of debt restructuring negotiations on a monthly basis, beginning on June 15, and a meeting of O&amp;Y's creditors must be held by September 21, the court ordered.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 7 (CTK) -- Less than a half of  Slovak citizens favor the idea of Slovakia's joining NATO,  according to a poll conducted by the Slovak Statistical Office  in May.    Only 15 percent of those questioned said it was most  necessary for Slovakia to try to join NATO, while 34 percent  believed that it was probably necessary. Almost one Slovak out  of five (18 percent) is afraid and 11 percent are sure that such  efforts are senseless. 22 percent of those polled did not answer  the question.    If Slovakia became a member of NATO, almost two fifths of  citizens (37 percent) would expect an improvement in Slovakia's  defense capability, according to the poll. Four percent of  Slovaks said they would expect the defense capability to worsen.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara (AA) -- Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres arrived on a two-day official visit in Ankara today.    The Israeli foreign minister was received at Ankara's  Esenboga Airport by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin. In an  airport statement, Cetin recalled that the framework of the  relations between the two countries was outlined in a  declaration during his visit to Tel Aviv in November. Pointing  out that Peres is an important and well-known personality in the  region as well as in the world, Cetin reported that bilateral  relations, regional issues, and the Middle East peace process  will be discussed during the talks in Ankara.    Turkey and Israel are two countries based on parliamentary  democracy and free market economy, Cetin remarked. Recalling  that the Israeli president also visited Turkey some time ago,  Cetin noted that these visits greatly contribute to bilateral  relations.    Cetin declared that Peres plays an important role in the  Middle East peace process and said that the visit will add a new  dimension to Turkish-Israeli relations.    In his turn, Peres stated that the Middle East peace process  has reached the stage of implementation, pledging that from now  on his country will work for the economic development of the  region to benefit of the people living in this region.    Peres said that Turkey is a bridge between the Middle East,  Europe, and Asia, and it is the most contemporary country among  the Muslim countries where religion and state are separated.  Remarking that the two countries share a common history as well  as common interests, the Israeli foreign minister underlined the  great potential for cooperation in bilateral relations.    Meanwhile, in reply to a question, Cetin declared that  Turkey  is ready to contribute to the Middle East peace process in every  possible way if both sides demand it.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: ED&amp;F Man Man's flotation price announced yesterday was lower, and its yield higher, than expected. The group's managers and advisers may console themselves that disappointing ratings were partly the inevitable consequence of a 200-point fall in the FT-SE 100 share index since the pathfinder prospectus was published. But there is more to it than that. The City clearly has a problem with commodities traders. That is not surprising given its unhappy experiences during the 1980s with the old Berisford group and Gill &amp; Duffus. Added to that legacy is the difficulty for analysts in following such a curious beast as Man with its businesses ranging from peanut shelling to shipping, and money broking to commodity trading. The visibility and predictability of earnings is a further concern. The growth of two of Man's three divisions has been erratic, and earnings at the historically most stable wing, fund management, collapsed during the first half of this year. Tarring Man with the same brush as Berisford and Gill &amp; Duffus may not be fair. The group clearly has a more mature attitude to risk. It has also successfully diversified, in contrast to the earlier groups. And the fact that the management is retaining a strong stake in the business should provide considerable comfort. If the management can deliver earnings growth and commensurate dividend growth, the group will build up a following. But it will struggle to overcome City prejudices about commodity traders.</p>

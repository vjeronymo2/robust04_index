			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Lloyd's brokers resources are being stretched to the limit LLOYD'S brokers are 'finding their resources stretched to the limit' by the upheavals in the London insurance market, according to a study by De Lisle Jessup Scott, the insurance consultancy. Capacity shortages caused by heavy insurance losses are at the heart of the problem. The failure or withdrawal from the market of many small and medium-sized companies means that brokers are having more difficulty finding insurance for their clients. Extra expenses and declining volume are offsetting the benefit of recent increases in premiums and brokerage commissions. Brokers specialising in the retrocession market (the reinsurance of reinsurance), which has been hit hard by a string of big catastrophe losses, face the toughest problems. Falls in interests rates have depressed investment income while pressures on cashflow have resulted from the growing market tendency to settle claims automatically. Hard Times in a Hard Market for Lloyd's Brokers. De Lisle Jessup Scott, 20 Cousin Lane, London EC4R 3TE.</p>

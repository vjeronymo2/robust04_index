			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by 'Adil Sa'd: "The Saudi Regime and </F> Plotting Against Yemeni Unity"]    [Text] It is not strange for the Saudi regime to create  false justifications in order to plot against Yemeni unity and  to obtain regional and international supporters for the renegade  separatists in Aden.    This regime, which is known for its agentry, plotting, and  hiring of mercenaries and for its background as the outcome of a  well-known imperialist deal, cannot but shun any Arab unionist  trend and exploit every geographical and political factor in  order to foster factionalism and fighting so as to protect its  political entity first and also because such a course enables it  to indulge in its treasonous policy.    What the Saudi regime has done to Yemen is known and proven  by events and facts. It has continued to openly plot against  Yemen from the moment the Yemenis opted for the republican  political system. The Saudis dispatched large numbers of  mercenaries and agents with the aim of returning Yemen to the  era of misguidance, backwardness, and decadence. They used  border wars, assassinations, disturbances, and economic siege.  They expelled more than one million Yemeni workers from Saudi  Arabia and deprived them of their properties and financial  rights during the U.S.-Zionist aggression against Iraq. They  also plotted against the Document of Pledge and Accord, which  the Yemenis signed in February this year, when they received the  renegade 'Ali Salim al-Bid in order to spite Yemeni  constitutional legitimacy and to throw a wrench into the accord  and thus bring it to standstill. This development encouraged  al-Bid to disavow the document and to harp once more on the tune  of separatism.    The insistence of agent Fahd's regime on pushing matters in  Yemen toward internationalization is contrary to the Arab League  and UN charters. What has happened so far in the Security  Council concerning Yemen also constitutes blatant interference  in Yemen's internal affairs.    Real concern for Yemen calls for preserving its  constitutional legitimacy, which has come as a result of the  Yemeni people's democratic choice. The logic of protecting  Yemen and preserving its security and the safety of its people  and stemming the present copious flow of blood calls for  safeguarding the unity of this noble Arab country, not  encouraging separatism.</p>

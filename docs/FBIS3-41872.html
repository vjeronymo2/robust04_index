A Foreign Office spokesman said at a press briefing in Islamabad  yesterday that Pakistan is firmly committed to the objective of  nuclear nonproliferation and it will accept any just and  nondiscriminatory mechanism for nuclear nonproliferation in  South Asia. He was commenting on a report published in a local  English daily which misquoted the prime minister's statement.  The spokesman clarified that the statement as quoted by the  ASSOCIATED PRESS does not represent Pakistan's policy, nor was  it part of the statement made by the prime minister.</p>

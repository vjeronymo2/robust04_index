			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ATTORNEYS CLASH OVER LEGAL STATUS OF SCOUTS  </P> <P> An attorney for a homosexual seeking to become a Scout master argued Friday  that the Boy Scouts of America is barred by state law from discriminating on  the basis of sexual orientation.  </P> <P> The Boy Scouts violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act when it refused Timothy  Curran's request to lead a Scout troop, said attorney Jon Davidson of the  American Civil Liberties Union.  </P> <P> Curran, 28, was asked to leave the Scouts in 1980 because of his homosexuality.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Sally Disco heard closing arguments for the  trial's first phase to determine whether the Scouts is a business or a  nonprofit organization free to promote its own philosophy. If Disco rules the  organization is a business, a second phase will begin to determine whether  Curran was discriminated against.  </P> <P> George Davidson, attorney for the Boy Scouts, told Disco that the organization  should not be required to admit homosexuals because homosexual conduct is not  compatible with the Scout Oath and Law.  </P></p>

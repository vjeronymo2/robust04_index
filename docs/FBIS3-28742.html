			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from 10 February NHAN DAN: "The Spring of </F> Opportunities and Challenges"]    [Text] With this Vietnamese traditional new year, we have  entered the eighth year of implementing the renovation process.  During the past years, we have surmounted numerous acute  difficulties and surged forward. We have taken a very important  step in curbing the socioeconomic crisis. The capabilities of  our nation, people, party, and state have been enhanced amid  difficulties and hardships. The achievements recorded on the  internal and international fronts have created new opportunities  for national development.    However, our nation is still poor and the results of our  economic activity are insufficient and uncertain. At the same  time, hostile forces are attempting to undermine us, and social  vices -- especially corruption and lavish spending -- are still  prevalent. These are the great ordeals in our efforts to advance  along the path chosen by our esteemed Uncle Ho, the party, and  the people, which is aimed at making our people prosperous, our  nation powerful, and our society just and civilized so as to  catch up with developments in countries around the world.    Indeed, our past achievements have created favorable  conditions for our country to enter a new stage of development.  New opportunities as well as some acute ordeals are currently  placing increased demands on our nation's capabilities. People  throughout the country are concentrating their efforts to  accelerate development by attaching importance to agriculture  and changing the economic structure in the direction of  industrialization and modernization. Efforts are also being  made to improve social welfare, strengthen political stability,  and consolidate national defense and security, thereby helping  to extricate the nation from its socioeconomic crisis and lead  it to a new, firm developmental position.    Spring always comes with prospects; the greater the  prospects, the more efforts must be made to attain them. We  must seize opportunities to overcome any obstacles and only by  overcoming obstacles will we be able to advance further. We  must bear in mind that all developments depend chiefly on  internal strength. People throughout the country are united and  heading in the same direction, and as a result new opportunities  will be seized and developed in the new year.</p>

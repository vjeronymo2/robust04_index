			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL EARNINGS: VALLEY FEDERAL POSTS $5.45-MILLION PROFIT  </P> <P> Valley Federal Savings and Loan in Van Nuys said it "slightly exceeded"  earnings targets that the capital-poor thrift agreed upon with the federal  government, posting a profit of $5.45 million in the third quarter ended Sept.  30, compared to a loss of $70.7 million in the same quarter a year earlier.  </P> <P> Valley Federal is required to meet targets in a capital plan approved in May by  the federal Office of Thrift Supervision, since the S&amp;L falls far short of  requirements for capital reserves, which are meant to provide a cushion against  potential losses.  </P> <P> As of Sept. 30, Valley Federal had a deficit of $22.3 million in tangible  capital; that measure is essentially equal to the net worth of the institution  minus the value of some non-cash assets. But that marks an improvement since  Dec. 31, 1989, when Valley Federal had a tangible capital deficit of $43.5  million.  </P> <P> For the nine months that ended Sept. 30, Valley Federal earned $21.5 million,  compared to a loss of $73 million for the period in 1989.  </P> <P> Valley Federal had total assets on Sept. 30 of $2.72 billion, a 14% decline  from $3.17 billion a year ago.  </P></p>

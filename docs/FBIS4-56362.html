			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments through 27 April:    Cuban and Mexican businessmen have agreed to establish a  joint enterprise in the textile sector and to increase their  business operations in more than 10 other areas. Diego  Fernandez, spokesman for a delegation of Mexican businessmen  visiting Havana, said 75 percent of the textile enterprise will  be Mexican-owned. The 40 firms represented in the Mexican  delegation will be able to sell perfumes, cosmetics,  construction materials, canned juices, cookies, chocolates,  fertilizers, insecticides, and chemical and pharmaceutical  products in Cuba. Cuban firms will sell resins and marble for  construction in the Mexican market. Mexico's annual sales to  Cuba, especially products for the service sector, amount to  approximately $124 million. Mexico imports about $7 million  worth of nickel and tobacco from Cuba annually. (Mexico City  NOTIMEX in Spanish 0509 GMT 21 Apr 94)    Radio Rebelde at 1155 GMT on 23 April reports that 915 Basic  Cooperative Production Units (UBPC), with almost 90,000 members,  have been formed nationwide in the agriculture-livestock sector.  Salvador Valdez, secretary general of that sector's union, says  that it is anticipated that there will eventually be 2,300 of  these structures in that sector.    In the same newscast, Rebelde announces that the work group  of the Australia Sugar Mill in Jaguey Grande has been awarded  the Labor Feat banner. The Australia is the first  sugar-producing complex in Matanzas Province to fulfill its  production plans for the current harvest.    Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on 22 April reports that a factory  run by the union of nickel enterprises in Moa Municipality,  Holguin Province, makes "somewhat more than 1,000 kg of pigments  per month for the construction materials industry." These  pigments, obtained from nickel industry wastes, replace those  Cuba has been importing for the production of tiles and toilet  fixtures.    Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 25 April reports that the  low-capacity generator factory in Cacocum Municipality, Holguin  Province, has already produced 200 generators with PRC  technology. The report adds that this factory, the only one of  its kind in Cuba, is in the final stage of construction. The  plant will produce 23 kinds of generators of capacities ranging  from 0.55 to 15 kw. It aims to produce 30,000 units yearly. Once  the local demand for these ?MT on 26 April reports that a metal  recycling factory in Havana has experienced a decrease in its  supply of scrap metal. Last year it recycled only 10 percent of  the amount it recycled in 1990. In the first quarter of 1994,  the nonferrous metals recycled have been less than 1 percent of  the amount recycled in the same period in 1990. This recycling  plant supplies approximately 50 other factories that use  recycled metals.    Radio Rebelde at 1406 GMT on 26 April reports that the  Espana  Republicana Sugar Mill in Perico Municipality, Matanzas  Province, has thrown away 5,000 liters of the biological  fertilizer Azospirillum, which had not been picked up and was  quickly decomposing in the holding tanks.    Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 26 April reports that the  months  of May and June are crucial for the spring planting campaign. So  far, 4,000 caballerias have been planted -- 76 percent of the  goal for the January-April period. Over 18,000 caballerias are  to planted in the first half of 1994; it is therefore important  to stay on the planting schedule during the next two months.    Radio Reloj at 1930 GMT on 26 April reports that  combine-harvester operator Carlos Nunez of platoon number six  which provides sugar cane for the Hector Rodriguez sugar  agroindustrial complex in Sagua la Grande, Villa Clara Province,  was the first to cut 2 million arrobas of cane. Carlos Nunez is  one of the most outstanding producers in the country during the  current harvest, cutting more than 16,000 arrobas daily. He  reached 2 million arrobas in 110 working days. Nunez expects to  cut 100,000 arrobas more before the end of the harvest in  northern Villa Clara.    Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0000 GMT on 27  April  report that, despite efforts by farmers in Matanzas, the potato  harvest of that province did not reach the expected levels due  to the infestations that affected the crops and the high  humidity of the soil. The current harvest has been the worse of  the past years. With only 20 caballerias left to harvest,  approximately 500,000 quintals of potatoes have been harvested,  which means that the final results will be short of the goal of  760,000 quintals for the people's consumption. According to  estimates, the average yield will be 4,000 quintals per  caballeria, which is short of the goal and of what the province  traditionally obtains. So far, 100,000 quintals have been sent  to Santiago de Cuba and 170,000 quintals are in cold storage  centers.    Radio Reloj at 1930 GMT on 27 April reports that sugarcane  planting will be intensified in Camaguey with the mobilization  of thousands of workers toward that objective. From January to  date, the province has planted 460 caballerias; the goal is to  conclude the year with 1,189 caballerias of sugarcane. Recent  rains and the dampness of the soil will accelerate seed  germination.    In the same newscast, Radio Reloj adds that the Segundo Diaz  Prado UBPC in Caimito, Havana Province, will try to improve  sugarcane production for the next harvest. Adolfo Lozada,  president of the unit, has told this station that most cane  plantations are just sprouting and for this reason workers must  accelerate cleaning and planting activities because, for the  time being, they have no fertilizer. He added that the main  problem is the need to build more houses for workers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Serb aggression against the free parts of  Bosnia-Herzegovina is not letting up. Following the tried and  tested Sarajevo ploy, the criminal [Serb military leader Ratko]  Mladic's gunners continue to murder civilians.    After yesterday's massacre in Bihac, when 11 citizens were  killed and dozens wounded in a queue for the distribution of  humanitarian aid, the Serb aggressor is again today attacking  this region ferociously. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 5th Corps  fighters are still managing to repulse all these attacks,  unshakable in their commitment to defend their people and their  territories.</p>

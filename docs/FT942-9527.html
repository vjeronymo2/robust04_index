			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Arts: A monumental landscape - William Packer welcomes a new home for Henry Moore's work Henry Moore, born in Castleford in the old West Riding in 1898, was famously a Yorkshireman, even though he left his native hearth for ever as a young man. His career and reputation may have been made in London and the South, but there was not a day in his long life in which his every utterance did not declare his origins in the North. He always acknowledged the formative influence upon his creative imagination of the local landscape sub-consciously and intuitively, long before he ever knew he was to be an artist, let alone a sculptor. There were the medieval carvings in the church nearby at Methley, the monumental outcrops of rock on the moors at Adel and the high, gently rolling line of the surrounding hills against the sky. Moore in his maturity would always lift his work high into the air, to give it thus those limitless possibilities of space and scale. From his student days he worked outside whenever he could as he carved his way through his college holidays in the garden of the Norfolk schoolhouse, where his sister Mary was headmistress. 'Sculpture', he said, 'is an art of the open-air. Daylight, sunlight is necessary to it. I would rather have a piece of my sculpture put in a landscape, almost any landscape, than in, or on, the most beautiful building I know.' His hero, Michelangelo, might well have taken issue with him on the latter point, but for Moore it was true enough, and right. The surprising thing is only that hitherto we have had in this country no near-permanent opportunity to see his work as he would have wished. There have been shows in the open-air galore, notably the 80th birthday retrospective in Hyde Park in 1977, and more recently in the Yorkshire Sculpture Park itself. The orchard and garden at Perry Green, Moore's home in Hertfordshire, also have works dotted about, just as they were in his lifetime, but that was ever a working arrangement, with work-in-hand put out to be seen in the space available, and then away. Only the great Sheep Piece in the field next door was ever consciously and permanently set into the landscape. Nothing could be more appropriate, therefore, than that the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, of which Henry Moore was the first patron, and the Henry Moore Foundation should have negotiated the long-term use of what was the Deer Park of Bretton Hall, for the siting of a significant number of his works. The Wakefield Metropolitan District Council, which embraces Castleford, has owned this land, some 96 acres, since the late 1970s, and runs it as a country park. The fear might have been that this would be some kind of cultural take-over, with art being rammed down people's throats who only want a bit of fresh air and a nice walk. Nothing could be further from the truth. The people of West Yorkshire have long grown used to the idea of sculpture in the landscape, and the Yorkshire Sculpture Park itself is one of the most popular recreational resorts in the north of England. And the installation is beautifully judged, with its 16 pieces set discreetly to punctuate and inform the landscape. In all it is the happiest of collaborations between national, cultural and local interests. Even the sponsor, Hickson International, is local, with factory in Castleford and offices in Leeds, where Moore first went to art school. The principle is that the Henry Moore Foundation, which owns the works, will renew the display piecemeal over the years, with each fresh work being carefully considered in its particular site. As it is, we walk westwards up the valley towards the house, with the lake below and the slope of the hill above. Each piece stands alone, yet we are teased forward by the hint of another beyond the trees - here a figure reclining magnificently below us in its grassy hollow, there another high above and majestic against the sky. Far ahead the 'Large Two Forms', Stonehenge in scale as in effect, holds the great open centre of the park, pulling all together. And all around the trees themselves turn to shimmering sculpture in the sunlight, the folds and fall of the ground itself come into high relief, and the sheep munch away, rubbing themselves against the bronze, dozing in the shade.

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (15): The sky's the limit - A look at satellite navigation Transatlantic navigation has come a long way since Alcock and Brown crash-landed in an Irish bog after pioneering the route from Newfoundland to Europe in 1919. Passengers on a wide-bodied jet are confident about precisely where and when they will arrive. But the huge fuel costs involved in long-haul aviation make any saving on time worthwhile. Airlines jostle for slots across the lucrative north Atlantic routes while pilots seek tailwinds that can chop precious minutes off the journey. The objective is to boost profits by chipping away at fuel consumption figures. But the volume of traffic on this route means that aircraft must maintain a strict separation. Without radar coverage crews rely on time to keep flights well apart. Safety dictates a 10-minute margin between aircraft. This prevents collisions but frustrates economy measures and extra flight slots. Enter Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS). This project aims to provide an air traffic picture for the north Atlantic by mimicking radar data. Satellites are the key, taking signals from airliners and bouncing them back to a terrestrial control centre. British Airways (BA) has been experimenting with satellite navigation since September 1992, using a Boeing 747 kitted out for ADS. This relies on Inmarsat navigation satellites to relay information to and from ground stations. Air traffic control (ATC) gets the exact position of the 747 within 12 seconds. Radio contact with ATC entails a delay of up to 15 minutes before an aircraft is cleared to change its slot in pursuit of a favourable tailwind or to exit turbulence. ADS cuts this to 30 seconds. Dramatic cost benefits have been claimed on Pacific routes, where United and NorthWest Airlines use ADS. NorthWest reckons annual savings of Dollars 500,000 for each of its 50 Boeing 747s are attainable. United has the nickname Stealth Airline because its crews make so little use of radio signals. Inmarsat's Fintan Ryan is adamant the ADS price tag of Dollars 150,000 per aircraft is soon recouped. 'The savings are proven on the Pacific route. ADS means the aircraft takes off and flies only the course that optimises costs,' he says. Over the north Atlantic ADS promises to halve the separation between flights, doubling the slots available. These developments offer improved exploitation of airspace. In the final approach, as the aircraft lines up to land, an international battle has broken out between satellite-based and terrestrial navigation aids. Global positioning system (GPS) relies on a constellation of 24 satellites to measure the distance between the GPS receiver and the satellite. With three satellite signals it is possible to locate the position of the receiver anywhere on earth. GPS was originally developed for the US military and has spread rapidly throughout the civil sector. It offers a very cheap means of satellite navigation, with yachtsman's GPS sets now available for as little as Pounds 350. The GPS lobby claim their system is the answer to air navigation over developing countries and remote regions. However, pilots with leading carriers are happy with existing gyroscopes and laser-based navigation systems. For landing, civil aircraft switch to Instrument Landing System (ILS) to co-ordinate their final approach to an airport. ILS relies on radio signals to guide the aircraft in. But encroaching signals from FM commercial radio stations mean that ILS's days are numbered. The maker of GPS satellites and receivers, US avionics giant Rockwell, have spotted an opportunity. 'You see these massive markets in Russia and China opening up. They don't have a huge radar infrastructure. With GPS there is a tremendous advantage to be gained,' says Ken Medlin, a Rockwell vice-president. There is also a lot of money on the table. The US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) has commissioned a Dollars 500m project to convert ILS approaches to GPS. Mr Medlin and his colleagues argue that since GPS does not require a huge terrestrial infrastructure it is a cheap option. Unfortunately GPS is not yet suited to landing an aircraft in the worst weather conditions, known to pilots as Category 3. And Category 3 is a familiar state to crews landing in Europe. The UK Civil Aviation Authority has thrown its weight behind Microwave Landing Systems (MLS) to replace ILS by 1998. MLS uses proven microwave beam technology to guide an aircraft down in fog. Despite the US FAA's endorsement, the CAA rejects GPS as 'not yet fully proven' for precision guidance. Suspicions about the reliability of GPS are compounded by the fact that GPS satellites are controlled by the Pentagon. By contrast, Inmarsat answers to a 74-nation consortium. An accord between the US military and the FAA over civil use of GPS has failed to quell European suspicions. Even if the military agree not to scramble or break signals in time of conflict, how can operators be sure of future tariffs? Satellites have a finite life, and European airlines are convinced that the GPS community will seize on a chance to recoup the vast military investment.</p>

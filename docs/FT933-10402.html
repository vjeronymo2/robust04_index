			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Allied-Lyons confirms Pounds 40m buy from Bass ALLIED-LYONS, the drinks, food, and retailing group, yesterday strengthened its position in the UK's growing take-home drinks market with the acquisition of the Augustus Barnett chain of off-licences from Bass for Pounds 40m cash. The deal will add about 550 outlets to Allied's Victoria Wine business, creating a nationwide estate of 1,510 shops with an 8.6 per cent share of the Pounds 6bn market. Whitbread's Thresher chain is the present market leader with a 10 per cent share, closely followed by J Sainsbury and Tesco, each with more than 9 per cent. Mr Tony Trigg, chief executive of Allied-Lyons Retailing, said yesterday that the location of the Augustus Barnett shops complemented those of Victoria Wine. 'Our initial impression is that there will be very few, if any, shop closures. Indeed, we will continue to grow the estate.' Bass will supply a range of its beer brands to the combined operation, which will be particularly strong in London and south-east England, the north-west, and Scotland. Mr Ian Prosser, Bass's chairman, said the sale reflected the group's strategy of focusing on its main business areas of brewing, international hotels and pub retailing.</p>

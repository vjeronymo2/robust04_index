			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Portuguese Prime Minister Cavaco </F> Silva by unidentified correspondent -- live]    [Text] [Announcer] We have in the studio Prime Minister  Cavaco Silva. If the conflict between NATO and the Serbian  forces becomes generalized in Bosnia, do you foresee Portugal  getting involved in NATO actions?    [Silva] Portugal has made a limited contribution, about 50  men, to the humanitarian operations in the region. But I do not  foresee greater Portuguese involvement in that part of the  world. However, let us bear in mind that according to UN  resolutions, flights over Bosnia are banned, so we cannot allow  the aggressors to try to test the determination of the allies to  put an end to this Yugoslav tragedy. According to the  information we have, what happened was that planes, believed to  be Serbian, entered no-fly zones and NATO planes, with UN  authorization, opened fire and shot down four planes. It is  believed that there were six planes -- four were shot down.  What we have here is a tool to pressure the sides into  negotiating and into reaching an accord through negotiations.    [Announcer] Do you not fear the fact that Portugal's  noninvolvement in the NATO effort could be wrongly interpreted  by our allies?    [Silva] We cannot forget that Portugal has other  commitments,  mainly helping the United Nations with the Mozambican and  Angolan peace processes. We have concentrated our efforts in  this area, in the context of the United Nations. Portugal is  not as well placed as other countries to deploy soldiers in the  [former] Yugoslavia. I just want to add, as I have said before,  bombing is a tool to pressure the sides. It is a tactical tool,  but alone it will not achieve the final objective which is to  stop the carnage, the tragedy we have all witnessed. What was  done today, and other pending NATO threats are merely aimed at  bringing the sides to the negotiating table, to accept an accord  favorable to peace in the region.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 18 February--On 18 February, three linked  Sejm commissions--administration and internal affairs,  agriculture and the food economy, and town and country  planning--unanimously adopted the report of the internal affairs  minister on the implementation of the law of 24 March 1992 on  the acquisition of property by foreigners.    According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MSW], the  number of applications presented and permits granted--in  particular the total quantity of land--gives no cause for social  concern. In 1990, the permits for the purchase of land related  to 398 hectares, in 1991 to 534 hectares, and in 1992 to 705  hectares. In the view of representatives of the Internal  Affairs Ministry, the law allows "in principle for the securing  of the interests of the Polish Republic."    In 1992, there ensued an increase in the number of  applications for the granting of permits for the purchase of  immovable assets by foreigners. There were 1,940 applications  received (1,573 in 1991). A treasury fee is charged for the  issuance of a permit, and the state Treasury altogether received  the joint sum of 10.6 billion zlotys on this account. Two years  ago, the MSW issued a total of 112 refusals to grant a permit  for the purchase of immovable assets in Poland (31 in 1991).    As was reported, the largest number of permits was issued to  foreigners from the FRG, the former USSR, Sweden, and the United  States. Among the companies with foreign capital participation,  the greatest number of permits was issued to enterprises with  the participation of capital from Germany, the Netherlands,  Austria, the United States, and Italy. Foreigners most  willingly buy land situated in the Opole, Gdansk, Katowice, and  Warsaw Voivodships.</p>

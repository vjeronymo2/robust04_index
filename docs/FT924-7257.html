			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Business Travel (20): Small, intimate and private  -Hotels BIG IS not always best when it comes to choosing an hotel. Cavernous lobbies, throngs of people queueing to check in or check out, or to use the lifts, restaurants and conference facilities are not everyone's idea of a hotel stay. And it need not be. Smaller, independently-run hotels have come into their own over the past few years as they are the antithesis of the big, impersonal, all-steel and glass hotel of the Eighties. The smaller hotel sells itself on intimacy, privacy and a more restful atmosphere. The big chains obviously still offer advantages such as a spread of properties worldwide and consistency of product - especially preferable in Third World countries. Membership of loyalty clubs in the big hotel chains offers benefits such as early check-in, late check-out, room upgrades, room guarantee at busy periods, and so on. Standing up for the Small is Beautiful lobby is Small Luxury Hotels of the World (SLH). It was launched as a hotel consortium in January 1991. Some 90 hotels situated in 16 countries, not one of them part of a large chain, they are mainly in the four- and five-star hotel categories. Members include Raffles in Singapore, the Lancaster and Balzac in Paris and the Ritz in London. 'People don't like standardisation any more. We offer a more personal service,' said Brian Mills, managing director of SLH. Not all SLH properties have 24-hour room service or business centres but all have concierge and valet. In tandem with this move has been the emergence of smaller-sized hotel groups - in the deluxe and lower echelons - which also offer this same mix of comfortable ambience and high quality service, in hotels not usually offering more than 200 rooms. For example, the exemplary standards of the Rafael group of hotels, all in old character buildings, such as the Rafael-managed 132-room Breidenbacher Hof in Dusseldorf. Meanwhile, much larger, deluxe hotel groups synonymous with ultra modern buildings are surprising the travelling public. Four years ago, Inter Continental opened in a beautiful landmark building called The Willard in downtown Washington DC. The Hyatt hotel chain has segmented into smaller properties called Park Hyatt. The Four Seasons-owned Regent group is soon to open in a 14th Century former monastery in Milan. In the UK, some of the four-star properties in the Edwardian Hotels Group are located in old buildings. For example, a row of 10 Regency terrace houses was converted into the 224-room Vanderbilt Hotel on London's Cromwell Road. Another group, Sarova, which has half a dozen four-star hotels in London, has a few gems, such as the Rubens, a 189-room hotel in Victoria dating back to 1912. Rooms are decorated in Regency style. Common to all these hotels, large or small, is new technology, which is releasing hotel staff to spend more time on customer service. The InterContinental hotel chain which, together with Sheraton, are the foremost business-oriented hotels in the world, is using high-tech in this way. Members of InterContinental's hotel loyalty club, called the Six Continents Club, receive an innovative no-stop check-in as well as a raft of usual benefits such as priority reservations, late check-out and room upgrades. Each customer is pre-registered, collected from the airport and, five minutes before arrival, the driver calls ahead so that the car can be met by the guest relations officer and the customer whisked straight to his/her room. This has been tested for the past six months at Inter Continental's London, New York and Berlin properties. 'That's infinitely better than seeing the top of their head behind a counter,' explained Bob Collier, senior vice-president strategic marketing at InterContinental. Holiday Inn has realised that its least motivated and lowest paid workers get to meet the customer first, at the front desk. In an attempt to improve customer service it is introducing two technology-driven enhancements, better training modules, particularly for these staff, and a more sophisticated reservation system which should respond more quickly and find room for the long-stay customers which were being refused bookings through its incumbent system, Holidex. Technology-driven customer profiles are standard to most hotels. Spreading fast are toll-free booking numbers (freephones), points for a fax or laptop, video check-out, breakfast ordering by TV (available in Marriott and Sheraton hotels), Voice Mail (an answerphone facility in the room pioneered by Westin hotels), and live reservation systems which allow the customer an instant confirmed booking. In general, new hotels are in the vanguard of high-tech gadgetry. Smart, independent hoteliers can still offer some of the technology advantage, without the capital outlay, by joining a marketing or reservations consortium. SLH's much larger rival is Leading Hotels of the World (LHW) while in the three and four-star sector there is, for example, Best Western and a relative newcomer to Europe, Flag International Hotels. Flag boasts more than 500 three- and four- star hotels, most of which are privately-owned and mainly located in Australia and New Zealand. 'All our properties are on-line to our live reservation system so it's a guaranteed reservation. There's no chance of horror stories like someone turning up and having never heard of the booking ' says David Curtis-Brignell, chief executive officer of Flag International Hotels.</p>

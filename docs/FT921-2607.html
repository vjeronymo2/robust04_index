			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: BP proven reserves down by 4% British Petroleum's proven oil reserves declined by 4 per cent, from 4.65bn barrels in 1990 to 4.44bn barrels last year. The company's gas reserves slipped from 11bn cu ft to 10.92bn cu ft. The company, which published the new reserve figures in its annual report, said the downward revisions came after disposals and a change of 96m barrels in its estimate of Canadian bitumen reserves. Oil production, however, rose last year to 1.4m barrels a day from 1.3m b/d previously. BP's proven oil reserves have been declining for the past four years and the company has embarked on an ambitious exploration programme in order to widen its reserve base.</p>

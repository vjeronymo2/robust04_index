			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Interest costs behind decline at Jeyes to Pounds 5m A strong second half and acquisitions helped to cushion the decline at Jeyes, the cleaning products group which saw 28 per cent of its market value wiped out after a profits warning in June. Mr Jimmy Moir, chief executive, said the inclusion for a full year of Globol, the German company acquired in 1992, had helped Jeyes to report a 4 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 6.6m for the year to January 1. The pre-tax return, which fell 11 per cent to Pounds 4.9m, had been depressed by a 77 per cent increase in net interest charges to Pounds 1.38m. Sales were 28 per cent ahead to Pounds 114.3m. Globol represents about 38 per cent of sales and slightly more of operating profit. The restructuring programme had been accelerated after poor results in the first half when profits fell by 82 per cent to Pounds 374,000. Pre-tax profits in the second half recovered to Pounds 4.5m against Pounds 3.4m last time. By the middle of this year five of Jeyes's 10 factories will be closed and warehousing and distribution transferred to third parties. Restructuring costs of Pounds 2.9m to pay for these actions were largely offset by profits from asset sales of Pounds 2.6m. Mr Moir said the UK division had been hit by aggressive discounting, although sales increased by 6 per cent to Pounds 62.5m. Margins were expected to remain under pressure in the new trading conditions, he said. The German market had remained stable, with gross margins maintained and a 4 per cent increase in revenues. Capital expenditure increased from Pounds 6.5m to Pounds 9m to support the reorganisation programme. Gearing rose from 6.4 per cent to 58.8 per cent. This was expected to fall substantially when the restructuring programme was completed. As forecast at the time of the profits warning, the final dividend is being increased to 4.8p for an 8.1p (7.6p) total. Earnings fell 24 per cent to 16.4p.</p>

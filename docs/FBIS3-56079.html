			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys by Violeta </F> Gaizauskaite and Algimantas Zukas under the "Opinions" rubric;  place and date not given: "P. Gylys Welcomes `Shadow' Cabinet"]    [Text] "People are currently most concerned with the  indexation of savings, compensation, and benefits," said  Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys sharing his  impressions after a meeting with his constituents in the Utena  region. However, the audience also asked numerous questions  about our relations with Russia after Zhirinovskiy's success in  the elections. Even rural people were interested in whether we  would join NATO, as well as other foreign policy issues.  Journalists Violeta Gaizauskaite and Algimantas Zukas also had  some questions for the minister, who is celebrating his first  anniversary in office. P. Gylys "had a session" with  journalists at the Foreign Ministry Collegium.    [RESPUBLIKA] How could you assess the past year in  politics? Do you think, as foreign minister, that you have  fulfilled all commitments?    [Gylys] Well, I am, probably, supposed to demonstrate severe  self-criticism now .... Assuming this position, I understood  perfectly well that I would not manage to accomplish everything  I wanted. I do not want to underrate the work of Mr. A.  Saudargas [former minister]. I see, however, that the formation  of the system will continue for several years. When the  International Relations Institute releases its first  "production," we will have more young people who know several  West European languages. If we succeed in creating a state  machine that works in a new style in some five years, the state  will remain stable even when ministers change.    [RESPUBLIKA] However, many Foreign Ministry employees  have found other, often better-paying jobs. Do you not think  that such "migration" results from the fact that people do not  see a prospect for making a good diplomatic career? What  decides the appointment of one or another official to important  diplomatic positions?    [Gylys] I would not like to agree with you, because it is  over recent months that we have tried to show people that their  work is valued. They know that those people who work in the  ministry and Lithuania's diplomatic missions abroad will rotate.  A large group of our employees has gone to work in our missions  in Washington, Vienna, and Helsinki. We invite people from  other offices because it is difficult to find those of an  ambassadorial scale. Neither the president nor I put any  "political" questions to appointed ambassadors.    [RESPUBLIKA] One can notice that former high-ranking  suppliers and traders usually go to the East. With what is such  "economic" tendency associated?    [Gylys] The press mocks us by saying that nothing has come  out of "economization," while you notice that real economists  become ambassadors. However, this was not some deliberate  selection. I would not stress the diplomats' former occupation.  "Economization" is an unfinished process: We wanted to achieve  much more, but I could not assess everything as damaging. By  May of 1994, we must draft a free trade agreement with the  European Union. We have prepared a program on joining GATT.  These agreements must be drafted with the smallest painful  effect, because the opening of the Lithuanian market implies  competition, which is not always gentlemanly.    [RESPUBLIKA] What should be the role of the Foreign  Policy Coordination Council, the existence of which is not  projected in the Constitution, by the way?    [Gylys] I would like to be frank. However, I would not be  pleased if my sincerity was used against me.... The president's  office was a new institution, and I was a new minister.  Therefore, the "circulation" of information between this office  and the ministry was not too good in the beginning, but things  have improved now. Political strife is often waged in the  Seimas [parliament] Foreign Affairs Committee, thus, the latter  is more difficult to communicate with. By the way, information  about the committee's activities that reaches the Foreign  Ministry is insufficient. The new council will help to know  better who does what, and to take joint action.    [RESPUBLIKA] Both journalists and Seimas deputies  were quite surprised by the idea of establishing a position of  the minister for relations with Western countries. Would you be  "minister for the East" in that case?    [Gylys] Representation plays a great role in interstate  relations, and it would be good to have such a minister as J.  Mejerovics in Latvia. The Foreign Ministry will not split and  will deal with all geographic latitudes.    [RESPUBLIKA] Lithuania has disbanded its former  delegation for negotiations with Russia. However, Russia has  not changed the status of its delegation. Its leader V. Isakov  is urging the expansion of dialogue on the delineation of state  borders and the establishment of border crossings. However,  does Lithuania's new delegation include any specialists in these  issues?    [Gylys] The current delegation is only a core, while experts  will be invited from all offices. For example, the group headed  by Deputy Foreign Minister V. Domarkas will contribute to the  delineation of the borders. I would like to go back to the  conversation between Presidents A. Brazauskas and B. Yeltsin, in  which they exchanged opinions about the necessity of changes in  the negotiating delegations. I think that nothing exceptional  has occurred after the appointment of the group for negotiations  with the CIS. I would like to draw your attention to the fact  that this group includes state officials rather than  politicians. Russia did this in the very beginning, while we  did not preserve the principle of solidarity and state interest.    [RESPUBLIKA] RESPUBLIKA was surprised by the statement  of G. Karasin, chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry Information  Service, that Russia had been informed about the visit of the  Chechen delegation to Lithuania in advance, and, therefore, this  visit "did not exceed any permissible limits." What could this  mean?    [Gylys] I learned about this visit a few days ago. As far as  I know, none of our employees informed Moscow about it in  advance. According to my understanding of diplomacy, however,  the preparation for this visit seems strange.    [RESPUBLIKA] You assessed the opposition's  no-confidence vote against you as an integral part of the  operation "Fall." Do you think that the opposition is plotting  a "Spring" operation?    [Gylys] I imagine that the operation "Spring" will be much  weaker than the "Fall" one. The oral battle will continue until  the next elections. However, this is not enough. There is a  slight possibility of assuming power through illegal means.    [RESPUBLIKA] How would you comment on the words of  opposition leader V. Landsbergis that the Lithuanian Democratic  Labor Party's foreign policy has failed? Could the opposition  participate in conducting the policy of the ruling party? What  constructive proposals of the opposition could you remember?    [Gylys] Like Mr. V. Landsbergis, I would have to strain my  memory very much.... I could discern a conceptual, although a  critical, assessment in the address of Social Democrat V.  Pleckaitis before the Seimas. Sometimes it looks like some  people in Lithuania are displeased with our considerably quiet  relations with Russia, or with the withdrawal of Russian troops.  They need strife and enemies, and possibly large ones.  However, such an evolution of international relations has no  perspective. I believe that it is high time for the opposition  to think about a "shadow" cabinet, because it is useful for the  people to know what government will come after the next  elections.    [RESPUBLIKA] One "shadow" cabinet has already declared  itself.... [reference to young politicians' conference which  elected a 'government of the 21st century']    [Gylys] If you have in mind the Lithuanian Government of the  21st century, its representatives also work in the Foreign  Ministry. However, as soon as I learned about its existence, I  calmed down. They are allowed to act freely, and their  "orientation" toward the 21st century is welcome.</p>

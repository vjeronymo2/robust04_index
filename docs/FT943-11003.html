			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Business and the Law: Risky act without a safety net - US firms could lose out in Hong Kong At first glance, British lawyers in Hong Kong do not appear to be having it all their own way. In spite of the fact that UK and local lawyers still have a monopoly over advising on local law, the American investment banks have so far been most successful in securing mandates for the Chinese privatisations. This has translated into ready-made opportunities for those US law firms that have strong client relationships with US banks. The latest tranche of 22 privatisation mandates, recently announced, was dominated by the American houses. Partly in anticipation of this, US law firms have been pouring into Hong Kong over the last six to eight months - many at the request of key bank clients. Even Cravath Swaine &amp; Moore, which has until now been less willing to move overseas than its rivals, has been lured to Hong Kong this year. Shearman &amp; Sterling and Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell have also opened for business there. However, appearances may be deceptive. It is questionable whether it makes strategic sense for US law firms to depend too heavily on their investment bank providers. There are already suggestions that the China bonanza for investment banks may have been overestimated, and that the large investments being made by some US banks in Hong Kong are rash, considering how competitive the marketplace has become. If any of the investment banks find themselves overstretched, this would be keenly felt by some of the recent Wall Street law firm arrivals. Unlike their UK counterparts, Americans tend to staff offices leanly and fly teams around the region as required. Few have built substantial Asian networks, although most claim to be running an Asian practice from Hong Kong. Those firms without a diversified regional practice are likely to find themselves painfully exposed. This is the heart of the problem - a credible Asian practice cannot be built overnight, it demands long-term commitment and a willingness to invest in offices across the region. Another headache affects both US and UK law firms: China's relative commercial immaturity. Structured legislation is still in its infancy and consequently many deals are stuck at the documentation stage. To this should be added the fact that participation in last year's nine and this year's 22 privatisations was effectively a loss-leader for many of the law firms concerned. The competition was so intense that some put in unrealistically low tenders. This has not stopped hundreds of firms from applying for licences to practise in China - 44 licences have already been awarded and 100 more are anticipated this year. There are no signs, however, that the Chinese authorities will allocate more than one office in China to each firm. This is potentially bad news for those that were first in: ministry contacts made Beijing the obvious choice and, consequently, most foreign firms are there. Now, however, Shanghai's rapid emergence as the dominant financial centre makes it an increasingly attractive option. If a law firm is denied offices in more than one city, there are several ploys it can use to ensure that clients can be serviced from elsewhere in China. But how the Chinese authorities will react to the fact that many firms are circumventing the regulations remains unclear. These uncertainties, coupled with the near prohibitive cost of commercial property in Hong Kong, make maintaining a healthy Asian practice an urgent priority. As Jeremy Palmer, head of equity capital markets with Baring Brothers Hong Kong, comments: 'Anyone, banker or lawyer, moving to Hong Kong and concentrating solely on China business is pursuing a very risky strategy.' This puts the top UK firms in Hong Kong on safe ground - all have built up substantial Asian practices, usually around offices in Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo. They field large teams and have spent years establishing close regional ties. If China fails to deliver its promised rewards in the medium term, the expense can be offset. Many of the new US arrivals lack that cushion. Against this backdrop, it is small surprise that the local Hong Kong legal market has become increasingly aggressive. Late last year, Freshfields, the City of London law firm, acquired a team of China specialists from Coudert Brothers, a US firm boasting a long Asian pedigree. Not only did this furnish the firm with instant expertise in a market where Mandarin-speaking capital markets lawyers are at a premium, it also helped to boost its ability to advise on US law. For British firms, the ability to advise on US law (on top of local law) will become ever more important - enabling them to advise on both the New York and Hong Kong listings of the Chinese privatisations. Ever more deals carry 144A offerings (private placements in the US exempt from Securities and Exchange Commission registration). This makes drafting the crucial accompanying 10b5 opinions - the anti-fraud opinions required by US law - a vital goal. Until now, few banks would have been comfortable appointing a British firm to render such opinions, and Wall Street felt secure in this knowledge. But the picture is slowly changing. Carrying a heavyweight New York law capability should help to make UK firms more attractive in this respect. A recent appointment for Clifford Chance, the City law firm, in Hong Kong advising the Manhattan Card Co, a subsidiary of the Chase Manhattan bank, on a securitisation deal - where the bulk of the investors are in New York - underlines the value of fielding US and British lawyers. Although few of the leading Wall Street firms in Hong Kong will admit it, the forthcoming amendment allowing them to practise local law could help them to limit the threat posed by Freshfields, Clifford Chance and others. Most listings will carry a Hong Kong or Euro-tranche, and this should give them the chance to hang on to the work. They may say that they are more than happy to work alongside their British peers, but if the market begins to bite back in China and Hong Kong, they will be grateful for all the work they can get. For the future, despite the US investment banks' supremacy in China and across Asia, British law firms look better placed to reap long-term rewards. Immediate gains from Chinese listings in the New York markets cannot be expected to cover the cost of running an Asian practice. If the new US arrivals are to become permanent fixtures, they will have to invest more heavily across the whole region. The question remains whether they are prepared to commit resources to such an expensive strategy.</p>

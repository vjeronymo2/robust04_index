			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Arts: 'Cosi' and 'Zauberflote' - Salzburg Festival In Salzburg, where Mozart's name figures on almost every street corner and in almost every shop window, it is a brave festival director who attempts to reinvigorate ways and means of Mozart opera production. Gerard Mortier, Salzburg artistic director, is indeed a brave man, and in his short period of office has already launched the attempt; but so far luck has not been with him much of the way. Ideas tend to be fixed here, even more than in most front-rank operatic centres, by memories of 'classic' stagings and performers past. A new-look Idomeneo a couple of years ago was not made welcome; and on opening night the production team of this year's new Cos fan tutte - an opera about which Salzburg festival-goers feel particularly proprietorial - got a frenzied barracking, followed by mass rotten-egg lobbing in the German-speaking press. Debacle, flop and catastrophe were just some of their terms of abuse. The whole enterprise was, it seems, born under the unluckiest of stars: one producer (Luc Bondy) lost before work ever began and a second (Guy Joosten) three weeks before opening night. The final choice, Erwin Piplits of the celebrated Serapion Theatre in Vienna, had originally come on board as Joosten's designer, and had himself never directed opera before. Tales of troubled rehearsals were echoing well beyond city limits before the festival began. And then Cecilia Bartoli, scheduled to make as Despina her much-awaited Salzburg debut, caught laryngitis, to be replaced on opening night by the sparky Elzbieta Szmytka. In such circumstances the fair-minded British visitor longs to place himself on the side of the underdog. Unfortunately, the show itself puts some fairly formidable obstacles in his path. There is an intentionally dingy, downmarket quality to the design (drab modern dress; movable screens bare or else with scabbed paint-patches; a pair of MFI-style wooden tables and chairs the only furniture). The purpose, it seems, was to scrape from the opera its sunny-skied upper-class-divertissement surface and analyse the potent, timeless emotional currents beneath. This is not intrinsically an unworthy aim - and, outside Salzburg, by no means an unfamiliar one. Here, however, the design colours, motifs and stratagems are at once too unvaried, too ill-suited to the awkwardly-shaped Kleines Festspielhaus stage, and far too poorly lit to allow any chance of fulfilment. Until the later parts of Act 2, in which the strengths of an attractive young cast begin at last to register, the whole show seems of undergraduate calibre: ineptly plotted, fitfully characterised, uncertainly motivated in its search for novelty. Whether it is beyond rescue is a moot point - I myself should need persuading at gun-point to sit through Act 1, as it stands, a second time. Certainly, though, there are basic musical strengths to build on. Christoph von Dohnanyi's conducting of the Vienna Philharmonic is muscular yet flexible, highly responsive to singers' demands, if sometimes distinctly un-Mediterranean in temper. (Dohnanyi, not a favourite of the Salzburg public, received an unjust share of the final-curtain boos.) And already Jennifer Larmore (a spunky, rich-toned Dorabella), Bruce Ford (a serious, impassioned, beautifully long-phrased Ferrando), Solveig Kringelbotn (an inexperienced Fiordiligi of radiant potential), Jeffrey Black (a firm-voiced, slightly bland Guglielmo) and Ferruccio Furlanetto (Alfonso) have proved themselves worthy of the engagement. More happily for Mortier, he has already one 'classic' Mozart staging of his own to balance the books - the 1991 Zauberflote, now magically revived under Bernard Haitink's superbly strong musical direction. People who know Johannes Schaaf's views of Mozart only from those four sourly misanthropic Covent Garden productions would find this show the most gratifying of surprises. The location is reinvented - this is a South-East Asian Flute of exotic detail yet strictly responsible scenic perspective, and it fills the vast Grosses Festspielhaus stage as though creating a new world. In Act 2 the move from the local to the eternal is judged with extraordinary and moving acuity, yet the mood stays light. The cast, as youthfully fresh as the Cos but far more rewardingly employed, is without weakness, led by Deon van der Walt's manly Tamino, Rene Pape's magnificent Sarastro, Ruth Ziesak's tender Pamina, Sumi Jo's gloriously unfettered Queen and - best of all - a warm-voiced, adorably local-accented, Papageno from Anton Scharinger. The Vienna Philharmonic and choir from the Vienna State Opera help make this biggest of big-house Flutes one of the most intimate, and one of the best. Cos performances until August 7, Die Zauberflote until August 29</p>

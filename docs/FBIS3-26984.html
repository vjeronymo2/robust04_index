The newspaper, in an article published on February 9, quoted  American prison rights activists as criticizing the U.S. policy  as "hypocritical."    The U.S. newspaper quoted Brad Haga, marketing director for  Oregon Prison Industries, the state agency overseeing the  manufacture of prison goods, as revealing that Oregon will  export an estimated 3 million U.S. dollars worth of prison-made  jeans and shirts this year to Japan, Italy and other countries.    According to the article, California prisons export less  prison-made clothing than Oregon, but have so far sent test  orders to Japan and Malaysia.    Corey Weinstein, a board member of the California Prisoners  Rights Union, was also quoted as saying that the U.S. Government  typically "complains of human-rights violations in other  countries but cares not one bit about human-rights violations in  the United States".    Haga admitted that the two different policies the U.S.  Government is pursuing on prison exports "may smack of  old-fashioned imperialism."    Weinstein stressed that as long as California exports  prison-made goods, the United States "has no basis" for  criticizing other countries involved in the same practice.</p>

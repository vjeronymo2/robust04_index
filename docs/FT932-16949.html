			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Survey of Spain (6): How Gonzalez may keep his party in power - A look at the Socialists' prospects in this year's election SPAIN has a terrible memory. Or, at least, it often chooses simply not to remember what is inconvenient. One result of this is that the Spanish civil war and the ensuing dictatorship of General Francisco Franco are not taught in Spanish schools. Officials say it is still too soon to be able to teach the period objectively. There are other symptoms of this happy forgetfulness, most often reflected in the scarcity of libraries and the absurdly cliquey tone of any serious historical discussion. Thus it should have been no surprise to Mr Felipe Gonzalez when he turned up to speak at a university near Madrid last month that he was booed and sworn at. After all, his Socialist party has been involved in at about half a dozen public scandals in the past five years over influence peddling and corrupt party financing. 'Thief,' cried the students. Some of the prime minister's most vociferous opponents saw in this the end for the man who has governed Spain since 1982 and who must call a general election before the end of this year. In a deepening recession, with an increasingly fractured and inward-looking party, the Socialist vote is slipping at a giddy rate. The campus reception was a final stripping away of the Gonzalez aura, opponents said. Perhaps. The rise of Mediterranean social democracy in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which saw socialist parties rise to power and influence in France, Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal is being brought to an abrupt end. Greece and Portugal have turned right. In France, a lone president has recently seen his party swept away by an ill-tempered electorate. In Italy, Socialist leaders are among the central targets of the c o u n t r y ' s anti-corruption campaign. In Spain, the Socialists have trapped themselves in their own (though compared to Italy and France, relatively modest) corruption quagmire. Spain, though, is not Italy and its Socialists are not as unpopular as France's. Until the election, though, one of Mr Gonzalez's main problems is simply that fact that there are about 3m young voters in Spain, some of whom turned up to jeer or cheer him last month, who have no idea of what life was like under another leader. Thus, with unemployment at record levels and rising and the media successfully (but misleadingly) painting the Gonzalez administration as corrupt, it must all be his fault. Combined with this is Spain's natural isolationism. Its government may be more obvious abroad, but Spaniards remain generally uninterested in the rest of the world. It is reasonable to assume that the students screeching at Mr Gonzalez read no foreign media and speak fewer languages than most of their European Community counterparts (though probably more than British students). This, combined with a flawed ability (for lack of education for which the present government is entirely responsible) to make comparisons with Spain's recent past, is an explosive mixture for a politician who has to explain that Spain's recession is part of a global phenomenon and that the country has made great strides in the last 10 years and is much richer now than it was then. If Mr Gonzalez were able to go into the election campaigning on his 10-year record, he would probably have little trouble winning a fourth overall majority. But he is not. The economic boom of 1986 to 1989 has been quickly forgotten and he is campaigning on his third term only. That, unfortunately, is not much to go on. Perhaps only one minister will have come out of the last four years having done something he actually set out to do - Mr Jose Luis Corcuera, the interior minister, who has presided over the near dismemberment of Eta, the Basque terrorist group, and pushed controversial anti-drug legislation through parliament despite strong media opposition. For the rest, the term has been wasted and filled with upsets. A scandal surrounding the brother of the former deputy prime minister paralysed government and party for all its first year. In 1991 the Filesa scandal broke - and has come back to haunt the government until the election. Filesa was a bogus consulting company that took money from banks and manu- facturers for non-existent services and used the money to finance Socialist election campaigns. 1992 was frittered away celebrating the Expo in Seville and the Olympics in Barcelona. Meanwhile, no-one in government dared tell the country how badly things were getting and there was thus never any time to build a consensus about how to deal with the coming crisis. Employers threw money at the unions and Mr Gonzalez al- lowed party pressure to derail public spending controls in the 1990, 1991 and 1992 budgets. By the time Spain began its slide into recession at the start of last year, it had still not begun to cut its debt and was more heavily dependent on using high interest rates to attract foreign savings to finance itself than ever before. An optimistic programme of economic convergence (with the rest of the EC ahead of monetary and economic union) was rushed out in the spring but its public debt, deficit, growth and inflation targets quickly fell by the way. By the summer, the government had brought forward indirect tax increases and gone back on a promised income tax cut to save its 1992 budget. By the end of 1992 though, official statistics confirmed the worst - unemployment had risen to more than 3m and fixed investment had fallen by more than 4 per cent. How Mr Gonzalez gets out of this is a mystery, though it would be foolish to write him off. Whenever they vote, Spaniards chose leaders and not necessarily for his politics, provided the politics are broadly centrist. The prime minister is still easily the most popular politician in the country and he is still selling his mixture of tepid supply-side growth policies and high social spending. Spaniards like it, though Mr Gonzalez is highly unlikely to be able to retain a majority in the 350-seat Cortes and will probably be forced into a coalition. Recent polls, though, have shown the conservative Partido Popular practically level with the Socialists at between 33 per cent and 34 per cent of the vote each. In large part this is due to the way that the PP's young leader, Mr Jose Maria Aznar, has been able to focus on the government's record on corruption. What the polls do not show, though, is that the Socialists still lead the PP by a long way among voters who have already made up their minds how to vote. The battle will be for an increasingly large number of undecided voters and that may still be where the prime minister has an edge. Whatever the state of the economy or the force of the argument that Mr Gonzalez has been slow to deal with corruption in his party, uncertain voters may feel more comfortable with his experience. Mr Aznar grows more impressive by the day, but it is still hard to believe that Spaniards are going to give him a working majority. The PP also has a major hurdle in any national poll in that it has to fight conservative regionalist parties in important autonomies such as the Basque Country, Catalonia and Aragon. On balance, both the Basque and Catalan nationalist majorities would probably prefer to be part of a coalition with Mr Gonzalez at a national level than with Mr Aznar. For either leader, though, coalition with a regional party will be very difficult as it is bound to involve trading off greater regional autonomy in return for support in Madrid. That gives rise to a previously untested possibility - that the 1993 election will leave Spain with a leftwing government. Polls show that the PP's gains have been mainly at the expense of the Centro Democratico y Social (CDS), the rapidly imploding party of Mr Adolfo Suarez, the former prime minister. The Socialists, on the other hand, have been shedding votes to their left, to the communist-led Izquierda Unida (IU). If the post-election arithmetic allows it, the Socialist party, which is, anyway, to the left of the Gonzalez government, may force a union with the IU. Mr Gonzalez would probably leave office rather than make this deal but the party may well let him go. All the party really wants him for now is to put them in a position to form a government.</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'BABYCAKES' A QUIRKY LITTLE PAEAN TO LOVE  </P> <P> To celebrate the most romantic day of the year, CBS offers viewers a quirky  little Valentine called "Babycakes," based on the critically acclaimed German  film "Sugarbaby."  </P> <P> Airing tonight at 9 on Channels 2 and 8, it features Ricki Lake, the bubbly,  round star of John Waters' comedy "Hairspray," as Grace, an overweight mortuary  cosmetician who spots the man of her dreams at a skating rink and sets out to  seduce him.  </P> <P> Rob (Craig Sheffer), the object of her desire, is young, svelte and handsome.  As fellow cosmetician Keri (Nada Despotovich) points out, why would a guy like  him fall for a, uh, "person" like Grace? Besides, he's living with someone, and  she's gorgeous.  </P> <P> After ascertaining that Rob's relationship is an unhappy one, Grace goes about  her courtship campaign, not conceding a single calorie to do it. With ice cream  sundaes, hot meals, surprising miniskirts and an all-enveloping, bountiful  femininity, Grace makes the improbable more than possible.  </P> <P> It's not a thoughtful film; director Paul Schneider and writer Joyce Eliason  offer comic diversions and a few dark moments but don't require Lake to explore  her character too deeply.  </P> <P> Her unsympathetic stepmother (Betty Buckley), weak father (John Karlen),  eccentric boss (Paul Benedict) and oddball friend (Despotovich) are fairly  cartoonish. Lake's infectious grin and buoyant appeal and Sheffer's warmth,  however, make this unlikely romance a sweet treat. LYNNE HEFFLEY  </P></p>

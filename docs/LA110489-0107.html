			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BISHOPS WILL ADDRESS AIDS, MIDEAST ISSUES  </P> <P> Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony will be the point man for two new policy  statements on controversial subjects -- AIDS and the Middle East -- when the  nation's Roman Catholic bishops meet in Baltimore next week.  </P> <P> Mahony chairs a bishops' committee that has drafted a statement on the Middle  East that calls for creating an independent Palestinian homeland and "limits on  Palestinian rights" to ensure the security of Israel. And he heads a committee  that has issued a paper rejecting the use of condoms, instead urging chastity  as the only real solution to the AIDS epidemic.  </P> <P> Both topics have been hotly debated, but Mahony said this week that he expects  the documents to be approved without major change.  </P> <P> Although the nation's 300 bishops usually hold their November policy-making  session in Washington, the meeting will be in Baltimore this year because it is  the 200th anniversary of the Diocese of Baltimore. John Carroll was installed  there in 1789 as the first bishop in the United States.  </P> <P> In addition to presenting the two position papers, Mahony will be one of 10  candidates for the office of president of the National Conference of Catholic  Bishops. However, the present vice president, Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk of  Cincinnati, is considered likely to succeed Archbishop John L. May of St.  Louis, whose three-year term as chief spokesman for the U.S. hierarchy is  expiring. According to the conference regulations, May cannot be reelected.  </P> <P> May said in a telephone interview this week that the proposed statement on the  Middle East was "a hot topic" that has relevance outside the religious field.  </P> <P> While the American Jewish Committee has called the working draft "an honorable  and compassionate attempt to represent the various parties' concerns for  justice, recognition and security," the Anti-Defamation League has called it  "fundamentally flawed."  </P> <P> Kenneth Jacobson, ADL's director of international affairs, said a  recommendation in the proposed paper that the Palestinians be granted "  'territorial and political sovereignty' runs counter to American policy and can  only retard the chances for peace."  </P> <P> The AIDS statement is the most recent effort to resolve confusion that began in  1987, when the bishops' administrative board released a paper that, while not  promoting the use of condoms, expressed tolerance for educational programs that  included information about prophylactics.  </P> <P> The document to be voted on next week says: "It is not condoms which lead to  good health but appropriate attitudes and corresponding behavior regarding  human sexuality, integrity and dignity."  </P> <P> Some Protestant leaders who work with AIDS programs have criticized the  proposed Catholic statement, saying it is an unrealistic and ineffective way to  prevent the spread of the fatal disease.  </P> <P> Other major items at the bishops' four-day meeting, which begins Monday,  include:  </P> <P> * A resolution on abortion and public policy that calls abortion "the  fundamental human rights issue for all men and women of good will" and urges  Catholics to "redouble their efforts" to achieve constitutional protection for  unborn life and advance "morally acceptable alternatives to abortion."  </P> <P> * A recommitment by the bishops to their 1987 plan for evangelization among  black Catholics and concern about rising tensions over the roles and  expectations of the 2 million blacks within the 56-million-member U.S. church.  </P> <P> * A plan of action on food and agriculture that focuses on world hunger, the  problems of U.S. farmers who have lost their land in recent years, deplorable  living conditions among farm workers and the increasing environmental impact of  some farming practices.  </P> <P> * A speech on Monday by Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, the Vatican secretary of  state, who will attend the anniversary celebration as the personal  representative of Pope John Paul II.  </P></p>

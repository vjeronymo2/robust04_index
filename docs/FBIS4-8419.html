			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Radovan Lazarevic: "The Factories Have Remained, </F> the Experts Have Left"]    [Text] If it remains at least approximately in its present  borders, the Srpska republic could quickly heal the wounds of  war as far as its economic potential is concerned and become a  moderately developed area. This assumption is not bold, but  realistic, because this is an area which can more than feed  itself, one that possesses an impressive stock of timber,  considerably greater than the capacity of its own wood  manufacturing industry, mineral wealth, sufficient power to meet  its own needs, and a relatively advanced industry which by and  large was not destroyed in the war. If it were not for the  destructive activity of the domestic human factor and the ill  will of the world's powerful toward the Srpska republic, the  present hard times would quickly become the past.    Just as elsewhere in wartime, in the Srpska republic  agriculture is at the moment the most productive part of the  economy. And the figures themselves indicate how wrong people  are who see the Srpska republic exclusively as a land of  mountains, forests, and meadows. That is, no less than 97  percent of the plains in the former Bosnia and Herzegovina were  in the Serbian area. The Srpska republic, at least in its  present boundaries, possesses 64.3 percent of the farmland, land  which produced about 80 percent of all the wheat and corn in the  former Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has even been calculated that  the Srpska republic has more plowland per capita than the  present Yugoslavia.  <H5>  Ores in the Serbian Areas </H5>   Mineral wealth, which at one time was the principal economic  potential of the former Bosnia and Herzegovina, was also largely  in the Serbian section of that former Yugoslav republic. To be  specific, according to the figures of the Srpska republic  Chamber of Commerce, its territory accounts for 37 percent of  the brown coal reserves, 35 percent of the lead and zinc  reserves, 84 percent of the bauxite, 68 percent of the iron, 12  percent of the lignite, 88 percent of the gypsum, 89 percent of  the quartz.... Although the Serbian side perhaps did not fare  all that well in the redistribution of electric power potential  in the former Bosnia and Herzegovina, even what has remained on  the territory of the Srpska republic is enough to meet its  needs. The installed capacity of electric power generating units  on the territory of the Srpska republic amounts to 1,592  megawatts, but because most of the Drina watershed is on its  territory, and this is the largest unutilized power potential in  the former Bosnia and Herzegovina, the energy prospects of the  Srpska republic are nevertheless favorable.    The Serbian area also includes about two-thirds of the total  forest area of the former Bosnia and Herzegovina. Forests cover  half of its area. The timber resources of the Srpska republic  are estimated at about 214 million cubic meters.    Although the main industrial centers have remained on Muslim  and Croatian territory (central Bosnia, Tuzla, Mostar), the  Serbian side has not really been short-changed in this regard  either. On the contrary. The Serbian areas have about 60 percent  of the textile industry of the former Bosnia and Herzegovina,  then 50 percent of the leather and footwear industry, 55 percent  of the food manufacturing industry, most of the paper and  building materials industry, all the petroleum refining (it is  true that the refinery in Bosanski Brod has been considerably  damaged, so that repairs would cost nearly $30 million), and,  especially important, most of the electrical equipment and metal  manufacturing industries are also on Serbian territory.  <H5>  The Established Boundaries of the Serbian Space </H5>   Certain extremely profitable industries, like the alumina  mill in Zvornik, are also on Serbian territory. According to  Jefto Subotic, its manager for many years, this firm, which  employs about 2,500 workers, had exports in 1990 worth $296  million, which is more than our present foreign exchange  reserves. As for the plant itself, he says, it could go back  into operation overnight. However, this mill, along with all the  industry in the Srpska republic for that matter, is suffering  from a chronic shortage of the most highly trained personnel.  Bozidar Antic, chairman of the Srpska republic Chamber of  Commerce, has said in a statement to the press that at the  plants which are somehow operating the number of highly trained  personnel is no more than 10 percent of what it was before the  war.    Subotic, who in 1990 was proclaimed the best business  executive in the Yugoslavia of that time (he retired six months  ago), points to another phenomenon which could be a hindrance to  rapid economic recovery. The SDS [Serbian Democratic Party], he  says, must free itself of the role of supreme arbiter in all  matters, including even the economy. In some situations it  behaves for all the world like the former party committees, not  stopping short of determining even who is going to work where.  And while this might make some sense under these wartime  conditions, if it becomes established practice, it could be  disastrous for the economy when the guns go silent, Subotic  warns.    All the figures given are for the territory which belongs to  the Srpska republic at this moment. Whether its present borders  will coincide with the final borders, whether it will be  independent or in some alliances with others, these are dilemmas  which no one has answered as yet.    The three-year Yugoslav war drama has nevertheless resolved  one riddle: For the first time in history, Serbian space has  been precisely marked off with borders. The coming months will  probably answer the question of whether and when they will be  under the roof of a single state. But one of our eminent  economists, who for reasons of his own does not want his name in  the paper, examined that Serbian territory in the light of  interesting figures.    It has a population, according to his calculation, of about  12 million. And if it should turn out that all the Serbian space  should become a single state community, it would be the 14th  most populous country in Europe. In national income, the  possible community of the Serbian lands would be larger than 14  European countries, in per capita income it would be greater  than only seven countries, in per capita plowland it would be no  lower than eighth place in Europe (which at the moment has 38  states), and in its energy potential, relative to its own needs,  it also has a high 10th place. It is also in a high 11th place  on the Old Continent for its rivers and streams, but in terms of  road development it drops all the way to 27th place, and in  terms of the age-specific and education-specific structure of  the population it is in 20th place.    Regardless of what the future political map of the former  space of Yugoslavia looks like, it is good for the Serbs to  finally learn where they live and what as a people they  represent on the territory of Europe.</p>

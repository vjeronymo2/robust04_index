			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Taylor Woodrow Pounds 31m sale Taylor Woodrow, the construction, property and housebuilding group, has raised Pounds 30.8m from the sale of the west London headquarters of the Amoco oil group. The office building in Hangar Lane, constructed in 1986, had a current book value of Pounds 28.5m. It has been sold by Taylor Woodrow's property investment subsidiary to Sun Alliance and London Assurance. The property produced a net rental income of Pounds 2.35m last year. Taylor Woodrow said the sale proceeds would be used initially to reduce group borrowings and to re-invest in the group's mainstream activities. Net debt at the end of last year of Pounds 123m represented 23 per cent of shareholders' funds. The group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 30.2m (Pounds 94.5m restated loss) in 1993.</p>

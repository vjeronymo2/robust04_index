			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Miguel Mora; from the "Extravision" newscast] </F>   [Text] Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo said a national  council will be created in search of a national agreement with  the help of all sectors of the country. Lacayo said he got the  idea from Ramiro Gurdian, president of the Cosep [Higher Council  of Private Enterprise], but the important thing is to seek  economic stability for at least the next five years.    The search for a national agreement could start in  approximately two months, according to Presidency Minister  Lacayo, who said he will ask all forces in the country to fill  out a questionnaire to decide on the number and names of members  of the national council, which will be holding periodic sessions  in search of a national agreement.    [Begin Lacayo recording] We have been talking about that  with  Engineer Gurdian and with the National Planning Council. We  talked about it on the first floor of the Presidency on 24  March. The government made the proposal to form a national  economic and social planning council to draft a development plan  for at least the next five years. Once we have a plan for 1995,  1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999, the next government will be forced  to continue with that plan. We would be talking about cattle,  tourism, coffee, nontraditional products, industry, commerce,  and municipal development, as well as water, electricity, and  telephone service. We are currently sending to the groups that  participated in the 24 March meeting a questionnaire to have  them answer how they think this national council should be  formed, how many people should participate, who should  participate, how often it should meet, and so on. The purpose  of this effort is to see whether we can hold the first session  in the next two months. [end recording]    Although there is overall acceptance of this initiative,  there is marked skepticism.    [Begin recording] [Engineer Alfredo Cesar, former National  Assembly president] I believe it is a positive initiative,  however, I am not so sure whether it is feasible because we have  opposite viewpoints.    [National Coffee Commission President David Robleto] This is  difficult. You know that every government and every political  party makes different promises when election time comes. It  will be difficult for a basic agreement of principles on the  development of this country to be adopted by a party. [end  recording]    The first agreement to be reached will be economic in nature  and will not violate the Constitution, according to Cosep  President Ramiro Gurdian.    [Begin Gurdian recording] An economic agreement is possible.  We are very excited about that. We have to start working so  that we can come up with the rules of the game for the next five  years. [end recording]    With the creation of a national council, we will be opening  a  new forum of political debates with which we are going to be  able to promote economic development based on a national  agreement that will be in effect for at least five years.</p>

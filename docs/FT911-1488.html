			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Travel News: French breaks in demand PETER Mayle may have done more for holidays in France than all the carefully-laid plans of clever advertising agencies, such as those for which he used to work. Mayle's book, A Year in Provence, and his newly-published Toujours Provence have apparently stimulated UK demand for French holidays. Travel agency Thomas Cook reports that holidays to France are running at a level 60 per cent higher than this time last year. A leading independent specialist, VFB Holidays, believes that Mayle has had a marked impact: a third of a sample survey of 5,000 clients it quizzed last year mentioned A Year in Provence as required reading, not just for Provence but for how it represented life throughout rural France. VFB says that while Provence and the Provence-Rhone regions are selling exceptionally well, the Cote d'Azur is not. Other French specialists, such as Kingsland Holidays and Allez France, also report that Provence is the star performer, although another specialist, La France des Villages, believes that Provence is too expensive for many Britons: the Burgundy region is its most popular destination. The overall holiday picture this summer is looking considerably brighter than had seemed likely earlier this year. Mass-market travel agent Lunn Poly says that trade has picked up sharply for Mediterranean package holidays. But up-market American Express Travel says that the anticipated post-Gulf war boom in bookings has not been as extensive as hoped. 'Independent travel in America, however, is doing very well,' says Barry Tyrell, Amex Travel's marketing director. The Association of Independent Tour Operators reports that Italy and in-land Spain are among the most popular destinations at present, with a resurgent interest in Cyprus. But it says that bookings for Greece and Turkey are still taking time to recover from the effects of the war. Perhaps Peter Mayle might be lured there by some enterprising tourist board? THE government's decision to open up Heathrow airport to all-comers, after years of restrictions, has given new opportunities to several carriers to compete more effectively against British Airways. Cathay Pacific, voted favourite airline of Holiday Which? readers, this week started a daily non-stop service to Hong Kong from Heathrow after 10 years' lobbying. Later this month, Owners Abroad is operating the first charter flight out of Heathrow for two decades: to Faro in Portugal.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ilya Bulavinov, Semen Ulyanich report: "Parliamentarians </F> Get Down to Security"]    [Text] Aleksandr Piskunov, deputy chairman of the State  Duma's Defense Committee, yesterday met with Andrey Kokoshin,  first deputy defense minister, and Sergey Stepashin, first  deputy chief of the Federal Counterintelligence Service. They  discussed questions of interaction between the power structures  and the parliament committee.    There are practically no doubts that a single coordinated  line on military policy will be worked out, Aleksandr Piskunov  believes. One of the first priority tasks, in his opinion, is  consideration of the military budget for 1994. The committee  has already prepared a draft law on procedures for the  participation of Russian troops in peacekeeping operations  abroad.    It seems that Mr. Piskunov will after all manage to come to  agreement with the military department. In the former  parliament he also worked on the defense committee -- as deputy  chairman -- and therefore has extensive experience in dealing  with the Defense Ministry, which looked good amid the general  state of relations at the time between the executive and  legislative branches.    As a high-ranking official at the Defense Ministry told  KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent, his department is counting on  Aleksandr Piskunov, who is more sophisticated in military  matters, than on Sergey Yushenkov, former professor at the  Military and Political Academy, or Dmitriy Volkogonov, another  representative of Russia's Choice in the Defense Committee, who  is suspected of intending to pass a law on alternative service,  seen by the army generals as undesirable, and also of being  inclined toward various reorganizations in the military  department.    As for the Security Committee, the scheme of its  interrelations with the power structures will apparently be  different. Among the committee members are such prominent  opposition figures as Aleksandr Nevzorov, Stanislav Govorukhin,  and Yuriy Vlasov. With this composition, the committee chairman  -- communist Viktor Ilyukhin -- is, according to a source in the  Federal Counterintelligence Service, a man with whom one can  talk. Furthermore, owing to his commitment to the idea of  strong centralized state security bodies, Ilyukhin evokes secret  sympathies among the hitherto untouchable KGB, tired of constant  reorganizations.</p>

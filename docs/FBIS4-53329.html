			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, 17 May KYODO -- Declassified Foreign  Ministry documents soon to be compiled in book form reveal the  contents of correspondence between U.S.-led occupation forces  and the Japanese Government in the period just after the end of  World War II, publishers said Tuesday [17 May].    The publishers said the documents released from the Foreign  Ministry archives, which are already available in microfilm,  include messages between the office of the Supreme Commander for  the Allied Powers (SCAP) and the Central Liaison Office (CLO).    The documents will fill some 24 volumes, to be released  starting in October.    They concern such matters as a schedule for the repatriation  of Koreans from Japan between 1945 and 1946.    One CLO document dated October 1945 puts the number of  Koreans intending to return to Korea at war's end at 1,043,700  out of a total of 1,668,000, including 670,000 Korean residents,  336,000 laborers brought to Japan in groups, and 37,700  demobilized soldiers.    Another CLO document from October 1945 lists the locations  and employers of 31,229 Chinese workers in 25 prefectures across  the Japanese archipelago who were brought to Japan to alleviate  the wartime labor shortage.    The document goes on to detail Chinese worker "agitations"  since the war's end which "have become so violent as to  constitute a great menace to peace and order."    "Not only do they disregard the terms of contract which they  accepted before as reasonable and satisfactory, but also demand  `special' treatments as nationals of a victorious power," it  said.    Among the offending acts cited were mob violence, plundering  of weapons, plundering of money and other articles and "insults"  toward women.    "In order to enforce their excessive demands, they resort  even to armed demonstrations causing bloodshed," the document  said. "Disturbances are increasing day after day, creating  unrest and confusion among the people."    The CLO recommended immediate repatriation of the Chinese,  saying Japanese authorities faced difficulties keeping them  under control in view of the disarmament of the army and the  weakening of the police forces.</p>

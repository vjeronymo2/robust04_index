			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Senate' is not the right route to unite engineers Sir, Your bland headline, 'Elected 'senate' to unite engineering profession' (October 26), repeats parrot-fashion what the engineering establishment wants us all to believe. Sir John Fairclough's praiseworthy initiative to seek unification of a profession 'owned by its members' has been hijacked by engineering institutions determined to stop rank-and-file engineers from directly electing a majority of members on the new central body. These are the same institutions that persuaded the profession to replace the Council of Engineering Institutions by the present Engineering Council, and that now look likely to endorse the backwards step of resurrecting the old CEI structure, which did not work. No agenda has yet been set for debate, discussion and comment and even the engineers' national forum, the Engineering Assembly, has not been allowed, and will not be allowed, to express any opinion, although it is the only representative body for more than 200,000 engineers and technicians. Engineers want and deserve a central authority that is answerable to them as a profession. Unless the engineering establishment recognises this and shifts the balance of power away from the institutions and towards the membership any dream of a united engineering profession will be lost. Engineers hoping to emulate the medical profession's single effective voice should be reminded that it comes not from the Engineering Council's counterpart, the General Medical Council, but from the medics' trade union, the British Medical Association. Perhaps it is only when the engineers have their own 'BMA', free from the restraints of charitable status and Royal Charter, that the one effective voice of the profession will become a reality.

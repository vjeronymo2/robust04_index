			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report of a speech by President Ali Mahdi Mohamed at United </F> Somali Congress Central Committee meeting; place and date not  given]    [Excerpts] [Words indistinct] the president's speech  included the results of the national reconciliation conferences  held in Cairo and Nairobi. He said they were greatly respected  by the Somali people. However, the president said it was  unfortunate that while it was agreed that no further fighting  should take place in Somalia and that a conference should be  held on 15 April to pave the way for the establishment of a  national government on 15 May, the Somali National Alliance  [SNA] had launched attacks in different parts of Somalia by  massacring people and destroying much property in Marka,  Baraawe, and Jilib districts, and also in Hiiraan and Galguduud  regions. The president said this was opposed to the wishes of  our suffering people and the agreements signed in Cairo and  Nairobi. [passage omitted]    Long debates and analyses were held for five and a half  hours  and an announcement for the Somali people was issued concerning  the general situation in the country in the political, security,  and social fields, as well as the implementation of the peace  agreements reached, especially the Nairobi Manifesto of 24 March  1994. It became clear that the SNA had carried out disorder in  Mogadishu, Galguduud, and Hiiraan; destabilization and  occupation of settlements such as Marka, Jilib, Baraawe, and  others. They are planning to create endless chaos with the  intention of scuttling the 15 April conference to prepare for  the great Somali conference of 15 May. This violates the Addis  Ababa Accord and Nairobi Manifesto.    These obstacles are proof of Aidid's policy of using brute  force and bullets and his lack of confidence in democracy which  is the basis of the Somali people's aspirations in the struggle.  The 12 political organizations working for the good of the  country are aware that they represent 98 percent of the Somali  people and are constantly striving for peace and for resolving  the problem. They are also aware of the consequences which may  follow the habitual provocations and expansionism of the Somali  SNA clique. Given that it is the duty of the 12 organizations  to defend the wishes and work for peace and regaining national  dignity they are aware of the problems all over the country  perpetrated by SNA [words indistinct] to carry out its  international (?agreements) in the administrative, security and  political fields.    The 12 organizations, in respecting the Nairobi Manifesto of  24 March, are ready to participate in the 15 April conference to  be held in Mogadishu and attended by the signatories of the  Addis Ababa agreement. They are completely opposed to any  delay. The 12 political organizations urge the Somali people to  stick by their desire for peace and for settling their affairs,  and also to write and jointly confront the disruptive acts  carried out by the SNA. The 12 organizations call upon the SNA  to stop the war and withdraw from the areas they have forcefully  and aggressively occupied.</p>

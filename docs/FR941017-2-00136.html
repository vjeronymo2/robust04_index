			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OTS estimates that it costs the industry approximately $400,000 per year to complete and file the MMCOF index data electronically. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The total annual cost to the agency to prepare and distribute the MMCOF, which OTS does not use for any supervisory or regulatory purpose, is between $50,000 and $100,000. Accordingly, the OTS believes that the significant resource costs it incurs in calculating and publishing the MMCOF and the relatively high data preparation cost to the industry may outweigh the continued usefulness of the publication, at least in its current form. Therefore, OTS is reviewing: (1) whether the usefulness of the MMCOF can be increased or the burden on the industry and OTS can be decreased through modifying the scope of the MMCOF; or (2) whether OTS should stop publishing the MMCOF.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> OTS estimates that filing data for the MMCOF cost approximately $20 per report, per month, per savings association. Before January, 1993, the MMCOF was calculated based on information extracted from the monthly Thrift Financial Report (``TFR''). As of January 1, 1993, OTS abolished the monthly TFR to reduce the regulatory reporting burden on the industry. Since then, OTS-regulated SAIF-insured savings associations have been required to submit information directly to OTS for calculation and publication of the MMCOF.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Statutory Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 402(e)(3) of FIRREA requires the OTS to take such action as is necessary to assure that the indices prepared by the FHLBB, including the MMCOF, immediately prior to the enactment of FIRREA and used to calculate the interest rate on ARMs continue to be published. Under section 402(e)(4), the OTS may cease publication of an index if it substitutes an index that is substantially similar to the index that is being deleted and if the Director of OTS determines, after notice and opportunity for comment, that:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 1. the new index is based on data substantially similar to that of the original index; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. the substitution of the new index will result in an interest rate substantially similar to the rate in effect at the time the original index became unavailable.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This statutory protection is designed to mitigate the potential impact of substantially modifying or stopping publication of an index on outstanding mortgages. Currently, ARMs purchased by both the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation contain ``adjustable rate note'' language discussing the index to be used and what must occur if an index is no longer available. The standard language is: ``If the Index is no longer available, the Note Holder will choose a new index which is based upon comparable information. The Note Holder will give me notice of this choice.'' This means that the mortgage holder does not have to renegotiate with a borrower so long as the new index selected is based upon comparable information and the borrower is notified of the change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

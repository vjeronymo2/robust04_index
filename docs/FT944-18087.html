			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Observer: Piech of a problem Ah, the tricky business of coming up with a Euro-name that doesn't offend somebody, somewhere. Ferdinand Piech, chief executive of Volkswagen, proudly presented at the Paris Motor Show yesterday the group's new multi-purpose vehicle, designed to do battle with Renault's highly-successful Espace, among others. And in Europe it will be called Sharan. Sharan? That might be dandy in Germany, Italy or France, but in the UK it sounds mighty similar to Sharon, a girl's name with decidedly down-market overtones. Understandably, Richard Ide, managing director of VW's UK importer/distributor, is less than thrilled. He says no decision has yet been made on a UK name. Could always try Wayne; or perhaps Cynthia? Gary has a nice ring to it. Maybe Ermintrude? Then again, what about. . .</p>

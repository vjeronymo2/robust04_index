			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Management: Sharp knives at Tenneco - Laurie Morse describes how the company managed to cut away Dollars 1.5bn in 'failure' costs Dana Mead, chairman of Tenneco, last week stood before 450 top managers from the company's six divisions in Houston's convention centre and asked them an important question: after two years of relentless cost-cutting and restructuring how many thought the effort was running out of steam? Mead expected that as many as half would say yes, that the corporate overhaul that had shaken Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 910m) of what Tenneco calls 'failure' costs out of the system was now cutting too near the bone, and that the managers who had faced the challenge were fully extended. 'There is an exhaustion factor,' he said later. 'We've been on red alert for a long time. Someone asked me when things will get back to normal, and I said, 'this is normal'.' By way of the interactive keypads with which the conference tables were equipped, the answer flashed on an oversized screen within seconds; only 18 per cent of the managers in attendance felt the effort was flagging. That response is certainly a tribute to Tenneco's quality programme, arguably one of the most far-reaching and successful mounted in the US. Designed and implemented with the help of Armand 'Val' Feigenbaum, the veteran US quality consultant, the programme is in large part responsible for Tenneco's turnaround from a Dollars 750m net after-tax loss in 1991 to a net profit of Dollars 412m last year. Feigenbaum may not be as internationally renowned as the late W. Edwards Deming and Joseph Juran, who are usually credited with pioneering modern 'quality' ideas. But the author of Total Quality Control, written 43 years ago, can also claim to be one of the founders of the worldwide quality movement. The original link with Feigenbaum and his brother Donald, principals of Pittsfield, Massachusetts-based General Systems Co, was forged by Mead's predecessor Mike Walsh. A public-prosecutor turned corporate-turnaround expert who died of brain cancer this year at age 51, Walsh took over as Tenneco's chief executive in 1991 as losses at the company mounted. Having already employed Feigenbaum's General Systems Co consultancy at Cummins Engine, where he had been charged to head off competition from quality-oriented Japanese companies, and again at Union Pacific, Walsh was convinced that a quality effort would produce dramatic results at Tenneco. Making the group's six mature companies (all in slow-growth industries) competitive on the basis of lowest operating costs was one of the few options available when he took over. At that time Tenneco was drowning in Dollars 6bn of debt, which represented about 70 per cent of its capital; faced a Dollars 750m, or Dollars 5.57 a share, loss for the year; and all six of its divisions had declining operating earnings. The dismal results came in spite of income from Dollars 7bn in asset sales that year. Its acquisition in 1985 of JI Case, a farm and construction equipment company, had proved disastrous. High costs, out-of-control inventories, a cut-throat pricing policy and a farm recession threw Case into a tailspin almost the minute it was acquired. Subsequent efforts to save the subsidiary left the other divisions - an auto components manufacturer, a packaging company, the natural gas pipeline, Newport News Shipbuilding and Albright and Wilson chemicals - short on capital. By 1991, Case's portion of the company's loss was Dollars 620m, with an additional Dollars 461m in restructuring charges tagged on. Walsh did two things almost immediately that have had a lasting effect: he brought in his old friend Dana Mead, an International Paper executive, and put him in charge of mending the open wound at Case. He also called the Feigenbaums and asked them to join Tenneco's operating committee. This group of top officers - including divisional chiefs - is responsible for running the company on a day-to-day basis. Within three months Walsh's team had targeted nearly 15,000 jobs for redundancy, sold Dollars 1.3bn in assets, slashed Tenneco's bloated dividend by half, reduced capital spending by Dollars 350m and issued Dollars 700m in new equity. It also initiated the Total Quality Management initiative guided by the General Systems consultants. The General Systems approach to finding so-called 'quality costs' is more like an ongoing fitness programme than a crash diet, Tenneco managers say. Quality costs are defined at Tenneco as the price the company pays for things done wrong, things thrown away or returned, or for the time that product and people sit waiting without generating revenue. 'We had been doing cost-of-quality programmes for some time, and thought we were competitive within our industry,' says Dick Snell, chief of Tenneco Automotive. 'Then Val (Feigenbaum) came in and broadened all the categories. By another definition our quality costs were a respectable 5 1/2 per cent of our revenues, but using Val's system, we found our quality costs were 24 per cent.' (Tenneco's overall revenues last year were Dollars 13.2bn.) Cross-functional quality teams were formed, cost-cutting goals were set for every person in the organisation, and progress was monitored daily, weekly and monthly. The goals, and techniques used to meet them, were communicated to employees through 'cascading' training: top executives attended classes knowing they would have to teach the material to their subordinates. Line employees became an integral part of the process, including union-represented labour. Constant feedback from the General Systems staff kept everyone on track. Snell says: 'The quality initiative became visceral to us, people could understand it. In the automotive business, where margins are narrow, success depends on being low-cost producers.' Using the Feigenbaum brothers' processes, Snell's division looked in unusual places for failure costs, and found millions of dollars lying on the shop floor. Examining the scrap from pieces of car exhaust systems punched out of sheet metal, employee quality teams valued the useless leftover bits at Dollars 7m-Dollars 8m a year. 'We put a cross-functional team of engineers and designers on the problem, and within 18 months they had cut the scrap by half,' Snell says. Countless additional savings were engineered in other areas of Tenneco in a process that worked from the bottom up. When management discovered that headquarters staff felt immune to the cost-cutting goals, Mead sent an ultimatum - no exceptions, no excuses. Ilene Gordon, vice-president of operations, says General Systems not only provided a high-tech database for corporate benchmarking, but it also created a means of communicating best practices to all of the divisions' operations, something lacking at the disjointed conglomerate. General Systems has 11 staff members assisting various Tenneco divisions full time, most with on-site offices. The Feigenbaums' initial quality review suggested one out of every Dollars 4 Tenneco earned in sales in 1991 was wasted in useless costs, for a total of about Dollars 2.5bn. The company's primary goal became taking out half of those costs over a three-year period. Tenneco reached the goal a year ahead of schedule. Of the Dollars 1.6bn saved, Dollars 690m has gone to the bottomline in profits, and the remainder has been reinvested in the company. Mead points out that the costs targets were hit in relatively flat markets, with nearly flat revenues. Val Feigenbaum says Tenneco took out costs at about twice the rate of any comparable American company - the best results of any group he has advised in the US, Europe or Japan. He attributes the success to the unwavering dedication of Tenneco's executives to the process. Still, he says, Tenneco is just getting started. With quality costs whittled to 17 per cent of revenues, the goal next year is to reduce such costs to 10 per cent, or another Dollars 1bn, and ultimately to reach world-class levels of 5 per cent. Feigenbaum, whom Mead calls his 'stealth guru', warned Tenneco employees at the Houston meeting that the company needs to achieve considerable top-line revenue growth merely to move out of the category of 'average' performance. 'You will be attempting to do something only a handful of American companies have been able to pull off: to continue to build your American business while expanding throughout the world,' he says. That challenge also troubles 58-year-old Mead who, besides continuing the cost-cutting programme pioneered by his predecessor, has charted a course of global expansion. His problem is that while Wall Street gives the company credit for its excellent management systems, Tenneco's stock has dipped from Dollars 52.62 a share at year-end to about Dollars 41 recently. Operating earnings may be rising and successful public offerings of newly-profitable JI Case Corp may have boosted Tenneco's cash by nearly Dollars 700m, but analysts still assign a 'conglomerate discount' to the group and worry about the cyclical nature of its businesses. Mead is consequently under pressure to make a Dollars 1bn acquisition in one of the three areas he has identified as Tenneco's core businesses: automotive parts, packaging and natural gas. But he has decided to take a conservative approach, reinvesting in domestic packaging operations, buying a German auto components company (Gillet) to fill a gap in that part of the business, and acquiring a small US power-generating firm to enhance the group's natural gas division. Over the long haul he sees Tenneco's future in fast-growing emerging markets, and each of his company's six divisions has foreign expansion plans and joint venture prospects. Meanwhile, Mead intends to get Wall Street's attention by extending the group's quality programmes, and boosting its sub-standard return on capital by employing the now popular system of 'economic value added' to measure profitability. His aim is for 15 per cent growth in annual operating earnings, with analysts expecting Tenneco's 1995 earnings to reach Dollars 4.25 a share. The next phase of Tenneco's cost-push will attack an inbred part of the company's culture. Its six disparate divisions have long operated as independent companies, rarely sharing economies of scale. This year it has embarked on a project aimed at getting divisions to share purchasing, billing, finance, computer and personnel services, and to boost automation. Internal studies estimate that savings from consolidated administrative functions will add about 40 cents a share to Tenneco's bottomline within two years.</p>

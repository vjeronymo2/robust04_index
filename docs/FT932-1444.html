			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (6): Going for gold - Sponsorship BY INTERNATIONAL standards, the Pounds 4.8m raised to promote Manchester's Olympic bid - Pounds 2.3m from the private sector, and Pounds 2.5m from the public sector - is not a well-stocked war chest. Mr Bob Scott admits the bid is underfunded, but puts a brave face on it, claiming that it proves Manchester to be 'the most Olympic of the bidding cities'. On top of the money, the private sector has provided support worth at least Pounds 2.5m in kind, including supplying the principal bid staff on secondment. The private sector has also provided consultancy expertise and there have been other significant contributions, such as Rank Xerox's high-tech production of the bid document. Locally, the airport is the main sponsor, with more than Pounds 400,000. Other include Kelloggs, National Westminster Bank, the Duke of Westminster, Norweb, British Gas, BT and the Guardian-Manchester Evening News. For Boddington's, the Manchester subsidiary of Whitbread, the decision to contribute a Pounds 150,000 was a matter of enhancing its image and defending its patch. Mr Patrick Langan, brands manager for Boddington's beers, believes the company's support will in the short term help to encourage loyalty to its brands, and the pubs which stock them. The pubs themselves are festooned with flags advertising the company's Go for Gold promotion, with the Manchester bid logo prominent. In the longer term, he aims to win new business - for example, a contract to supply the new Victoria Arena: 'Whether the bid is successful or not a great deal of beer will be drunk.' The company is putting the bid logo on 12m cans of draught beer, to be sold nationwide, and on the last frame of its new television commercial. This will be shown on Channel 4 nationally, and on Granada and Yorkshire ITV. Pubs are being encouraged to support the Go for Gold promotion, by selling bid merchandise. The funds raised will support the Sports Aid Foundation in training athletes in the region. The names of the 150 participating publicans will go into a prize draw for a trip to Monte Carlo in September for the bid decision. Mr Trevor Adamson, NatWest's regional executive director, justifies the bank's Pounds 100,000 for Manchester's previous bid and the Pounds 150,000 it is spending on the present one in simple terms. 'We are as strong as our customers are. Anything that can improve the prosperity of the region is good for us.'</p>

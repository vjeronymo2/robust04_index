"We will have to take  great efforts" to achieve the targets envisaged by it, the  premier stressed.    During the discussion, some senior executives of ministries  and agencies stressed the need for more spending in such spheres  as housing construction, social welfare, science, environmental  protection. Thus, Culture Minister Yevgeniy Sidorov said we  should not "fight inflation by cutting down expenditures" for  culture, which are to account for 0.3 per cent of the total  budget expenditures. "With such a budget, the social sphere will  be gradually dying, which is to affect, sooner or later, the  economy and the entire situation in the country", he stressed.    Agriculture Minister Viktor Khlystun noted that the draft  budget did not provide for allocations of about 5 trillion  roubles to back the agro-industrial complex, which were  envisaged by the government decision promising support for  agriculture in 1994.    A speech by Labour Minister Gennadiy Melikyan was extremely  emotional. He predicted that the proposed 1994 budget would be  implemented for about two or three months only, and then  violations are inevitable, the same as it happened to Russia's  two previous federal budgets. He stressed that "the draft  budget has very little to do with a real economic policy, it  simply sets a tight course for stabilizing the economy by  reducing budget spending". The labour minister called upon the  government to work out effective measures to encourage  production, including through adequate taxation.    Melikyan was backed by First Deputy Defence Minister Andrey  Kokoshin, who described the draft budget as "politically  dangerous". He also reported that the defence ministry collegium  had estimated the envisaged expenditures for national security  as extremely unsufficient. "It will literally ruin the country's  defence capability", the collegium stressed. A shortage of  state funding is to bring about "an immediate dismissal of  400,000 servicemen and to fully terminate purchases of military  equipment", according to Kokoshin.    The prime minister argued that all ministries and agencies  demanding extra spending should take into consideration the  current complicated situation in the country. "Now we are on the  verge of an abyss, beyond which we will just collapse... For  this reason, the draft budget is rather tight, we should  determine how to overcome this crisis with the lowest losses",  Chernomyrdin told the gathering. "We do not need either  hyperinflation or a simmering country. And we have two levers  to control this -- power and order", he emphasised.    On the premier's proposal, the draft budget was approved in  principle. The Finance Ministry was instructed to finalize it  within ten days. In doing so, it should "by no means increase  items of expenditure, otherwise we will face a catastrophe".</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Lloyds/Midland Lloyds' new deal for small business smacks dreadfully of public relations. The innovations it proposes are conditional on it taking over Midland. If they are worth introducing on their merits, the bank would surely be going ahead anyway. The implication is that Lloyds perceives the scheme as a price necessary to silence opposition to its bid on competition policy grounds. In that case the authorities should beware. Lloyds will certainly be giving away less than meets the eye. A Pounds 100m venture capital fund and Pounds 250m in long-term loans are not exactly going to set the economy alight, despite their superficial political appeal. The provision of venture capital in dollops as small as Pounds 5,000 will certainly be expensive. Lloyds' argument is that it could only afford to offer such a service as a result of the cost savings generated by the merger. Thus it claims to have found an example of how the deal would actually increase competition in the market place even as the number of players is reduced. One has to assume that the gain for customers would be short-lived. Since the scheme is essentially a loss leader, either it would be wound down quickly or the bank would seek to subsidise it by increasing charges on other services. After all, customers of clearing banks have paid dearly for interest on current accounts. Granted, the scheme does contain the germ of something important. In a low-inflation environment, banks may find themselves increasingly driven to develop longer-term fixed-rate products for both depositors and borrowers. This is already normal in countries like Switzerland. Though small businesses will doubtless benefit, there is no reason why they should be the sole or even the main target. That leaves cost savings still the principal - and eminently sensible - rationale for a Lloyds/Midland merger. The rest is gloss.</p>

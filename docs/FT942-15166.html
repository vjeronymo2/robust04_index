			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / International Company News: Digital suffers heavy losses and warns of job cuts Digital Equipment, the US computer-maker, reported far heavier losses than expected in the third quarter, and warned it would cut 7,000 jobs, or 8 per cent of its workforce, over the next three months. The company also announced plans for a new restructuring, probably involving further cutbacks, by the end of its fiscal year in June. For the quarter, Digital reported net losses of Dollars 183.3m, or Dollars 1.34 per share. Wall Street analysts had been projecting losses of about 29 cents a share, with the worst at 50 cents. In the same period last year, Digital recorded a loss of Dollars 30.1m, or 23 cents. Digital's share price fell about 18 per cent, to trade at Dollars 23 5/8 in mid-session, down from Thursday's close of Dollars 28 7/8 . 'The financial results are unacceptable to this management and obviously disappointing,' said Mr Robert Palmer, president and chief executive. 'Growth in sales of new products is beginning to overtake the declines in our other products, but we have not yet achieved a competitive cost structure.' Sales of computers based on Digital's new Alpha microprocessor represented almost half of total systems revenues in the quarter, excluding personal computers, he said. However, total revenues for the quarter dropped 6 per cent to Dollars 3.26bn from Dollars 3.45bn. Product sales were down 1 per cent, while service revenues declined 11 per cent. The drop in service revenues surprised Mr Palmer, who said Digital had failed to anticipate a sharp decline in its maintenance business, as customers replaced older data storage devices with more reliable models. For the nine-month period, Digital reported a net loss of Dollars 338.6m, or Dollars 2.50, compared with a net loss of Dollars 364.5m, or Dollars 2.81, a year ago.</p>

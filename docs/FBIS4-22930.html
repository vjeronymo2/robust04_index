			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Roman Vershillo: ``Russian Science: To Strangle </F> or Not to Strangle? There Won't be Any More Broad Research  Front'']    [Text] Minister Boris Saltykov warned journalists gathered  at the round table in the Ministry of Science and Technology  Policy that the subject was going to be mainly about money, or  rather about the lack of it. As should have been expected, last  year the Ministry of Finance came up 300 billion rubles short,  which is 30 percent of the total budgetary expenditures for  science. In January and February of 1994, totals of 27 percent  and 40 percent respectively were allocated.    Saltykov caused a sensation by stating that the space  program  had been 148 percent financed. Aircraft builders also got a  surplus. ``And for all that, the general `science' budget was  not increased by a single copeck,'' said the Minister. ``The  chosen ones thus got some of the money of ``disowned'' fields.''  As it turns out, the mysterious reason for this situation is  that last autumn Prime Minister Chernomyrdin visited  ``Energiya'' Scientific Production Association. The Prime  Minister confronted Saltykov: ``Why didn't you tell me before  that such remarkable specialists are working there?''    ``The Russian Government cannot afford to support a broad  research front,'' maintains Boris Saltykov. As an alternative to  the Soviet course, where ambitious projects were carried out at  the expense of the entire society, the Ministry of Science has  put forth a program of priorities.    Among these are production technologies, information science  and communications, development of new materials, power  engineering, transportation, life sciences and genetic  engineering, ecology, space, research on fundamental problems of  the social and cultural development of Russia, and also research  on the fundamental properties of matter. Thirty three State  Science Centers have been set up to deal with these areas. Of  course, all science institutions of Russia are making efforts to  get into State Science Centers. The Ministry of Science has  received more than 200 applications. As implied by Saltykov's  words, the State Science Centers are not entirely maintained by  the State. Funding will be granted only to specific scientific  developments that have passed muster by experts within the walls  of the ministry.    Among the other problems that have beset Russian science,  mention was made of the exodus of skilled personnel out of the  country, and also to the private sector. Vladimir Mikhaylin,  chairman of the Union of Scientific Societies of Russia, has  pointed out that there has been a drastic decline in the number  of scientists in the 30-40 year age bracket.    Saltykov gives assurances that he is doing everything  possible to keep the powers that be from strangling our science.  But he admitted that scientists do not have the capability of  turning off a valve, like people in the oil industry, or cutting  off coal shipments, like the miners. So the minister is pretty  sure that it would do no good for scientists to go on strike.</p>

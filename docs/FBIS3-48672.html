			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan.26 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- The  Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) paid senior  opposition politicians in Malaysia and Singapore tens of  thousands of dollars without the full knowledge or consent of  the Canberra Government, according to an Australian newspaper  report quoting former agents.    The report in THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH received here Wednesday,  said the cash payments from ASIS continued over many years  beginning when the MPs were junior politicians and increasing as  the recipients grew in stature.    The clandestine payments and their management show ASIS has  taken upon itself to meddle directly in the internal political  affairs of a foreign nation without specific authorisation, the  former field agents claim, the report added. It also quoted the  former ASIS agents as saying that what started as simple bribes  snowballed over the years with little reassessment of the value  or morality of the payments.    THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH said the allegations were made during  its probe into upheavals now confronting ASIS and were supported  by several former personnel during a series of interviews. The  former secret agents were demanding a royal commission of  enquiry into ASIS claiming that it had dangerously minimal  accountability and was veering out of control.    All have various reasons to hold grudges against ASIS but  say  their careers were ruined by malicious gossip which points to  serious internal problems, the report added.    Meanwhile, the Australian federal government refused to  comment on the exposure by THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH.    THE CANBERRA TIMES reported that a spokesman for Foreign  Minister Gareth Evans, responsible for ASIS, said the government  never commented on intelligence matters.</p>

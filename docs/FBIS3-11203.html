			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The German Government announced on 15 March in  Port-au-Prince the temporary closing of its embassy in Haiti as  of 31 March and the recall of its accredited diplomats. In a  communique published in the Haitian capital, Bonn explained its  decision as a consequence of the serious economic and political  crisis resulting from the 30 September 1991 coup d'etat. The  foreign representations in Port-au-Prince have been obliged to  buy fuel at a very high cost on the black market for several  months. Some neighborhoods in the capital have electricity only  three hours a day. Bonn deems this necessary closing regrettable  because of the traditional friendship and excellent cooperation  between the two countries in the past.    While pointing out that humanitarian aid will be maintained  as long as possible through nongovernmental organizations and  churches, the German Government advises that financial and  technical cooperation remains suspended. The consular tasks  [word indistinct] of the Port-au-Prince embassy will henceforth  be performed by the General Consulate of the Federal Republic of  Germany in Florida, the communique adds.</p>

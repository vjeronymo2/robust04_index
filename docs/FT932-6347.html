			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Chevron reshapes businesses CHEVRON, the California-based oil company, yesterday announced a substantial reshaping of its US downstream oil business. It will involve the sale of two refineries and service stations in several states east of the Rocky Mountains. It will take a Dollars 550m after-tax charge against second-quarter earnings to cover losses on the sale of fixed assets and inventories, and provisions for environmental site assessment and redundancies. The company said its new refining and marketing organisation would concentrate on resources in the west, south-west and south. Mr Dave Hoyer, president of its US products business, said increasing regulation, mandated capital spending and rising taxes imposed 'enormous added risks and burdens' on a refining and marketing business as large as Chevron's. The company also saw slow growth in future demand. Capital investment demands were escalating dramatically because of requirements of the Clean Air Act. The plan involves selling Chevron's refineries at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Port Arthur, Texas. It explained it no longer mar-keted fuel products in the north-east, where Philadelphia is situated, while Port Arthur represented more refining capacity than it needed in the Gulf Coast market. The company will also concentrate on investing in its service stations east of the Rockies: in six Gulf Coast states, where it has competitive strengths; Florida; Georgia; Alabama; Mississippi; Louisiana and Texas. It will sell service stations to Chevron-branded wholesalers in other states east of the Rockies, including North and South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and Ohio.</p>

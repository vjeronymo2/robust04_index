			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> DOCTORS USE ART CREATED BY SUFFERERS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HEADACHES  </P> <P> Doctors dealing with the headache, the most common and perhaps most frustrating  form of pain, are using art created by sufferers to learn more about the often  debilitating condition.  </P> <P> A new collection of headache art -- paintings, prints, photos, sculpture and  mixed media -- solicited from all types of sufferers made its world premiere  earlier this month in conjunction with a national medical conference on  headaches.  </P> <P> "One patient who saw that exhibit told me: 'It is extremely comforting to see  this. It so vividly shows what I suffer from when I hide in my bedroom, close  the curtains and lock the door. It means I am not crazy. This is not my  imagination. It means other people are suffering the same thing,' " said Dr.  Egilius Spierings, the Dutch-born head of Faulkner Hospital's Headache Research  Foundation.  </P> <P> After a one-evening show at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the 200 works will  move to nearby Faulkner Hospital for a one-week public exhibition at the John  R. Graham Headache Center.  </P> <P> Researchers say headache is the most common pain form reported to physicians.  Five percent of the world's population has a headache every day, and an  estimated 45 million Americans suffer from chronic headaches.  </P> <P> The headache costs the nation $8 billion in lost work time and medical  expenses.  </P> <P> Spierings said letting sufferers express their pain through art can aid in a  diagnostic process that is purely subjective, enhanced by no instrumentation.  </P> <P> "It is very difficult to get people to understand what suffering from headaches  means," Spierings said. "All we can rely upon is what patients tell us.  </P> <P> "A lot of that communication is lost because of concepts. We can only hear what  we fit into our concepts. We perpetuate the existing knowledge more than expand  on it.  </P> <P> "Through art, patients can express features of their headaches unrestricted by  existing medical concepts. Ultimately the patients are going to teach us what  is right and what is wrong about our concepts of the headache."  </P> <P> Spierings put out a call earlier this year to New England headache sufferers to  express their pain through art. He did so after viewing a British exhibit, done  in the early 1980s of art involving migraines -- one of the three common  chronic headache disorders.  </P> <P> "Gripping Headache," a drawing by Raymond Dorow II, expresses the physical pain  level and emotional frustration of throbbing head pain over which he has no  control.  </P> <P> A work by Rebekah Raye, "Headache No. 1," shows that eye pain and disturbed  vision can be a part of the headache experience -- a connection disputed by  some vision experts.  </P> <P> "Twenty-five of the 200 pieces of art depict in a very pronounced way the eye  or the visual system. 'Headache No. 1' shows pain caused by intense of light. I  have never seen it expressed so well," Spierings said.  </P> <P> Some artists also submitted written descriptions of what triggered their  artistic expression.  </P> <P> "All are headache sufferers, not necessarily artists. There is a lot of hidden  talent here," Spierings said. "Many of them are extraordinary."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 29 Mar (MENA)--PLO Political Department chief  Faruq Qaddumi has stated that the Palestinians will not resume  negotiations with Israel on the implementation of self-rule in  Gaza and Jericho before the Israelis respond to the Palestinian  proposals, which provide only the minimum of protection for the  Palestinian people in Hebron.    We are awaiting these responses so that our people can feel  safe, assured, and sense some achievement, Qaddumi told MENA.    In his statement, which comes only hours before the  resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli talks on measures to  protect Palestinians in Hebron, Qaddumi said an agreement should  have been reached immediately after the massacre.    He said that when the Israelis came to Tunis they promised  to  agree immediately to several points. Regrettably, they backed  down on their promises, as they usually do, he added.    Qaddumi said this Israeli policy will not help the political  settlement. Indeed, he added, it will create further obstacles  and difficulties. He noted that the Israelis are using the same  tactics in their negotiations with the Jordanians, the Syrians,  and the Lebanese.    Qaddumi defined the Palestinian leadership's basic demands  for the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on  self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, which are scheduled to begin on  13 April. These include deploying sufficient international  forces in Hebron and all other occupied Palestinian territories  in accordance with Security Council Resolution 904, evacuating  the settlers from Hebron, implementing the withdrawal as  scheduled, and discussing the Israeli settlements in the  occupied territories. He said these settlements constitute not  only an obstacle, but a threat to the entire political process.    Qaddumi said the Israelis are evading the implementation of  Security Council Resolution 904 on international protection for  the Palestinians.    He said talk about differences over the size of the  Palestinian police force, the international protection force,  and joint Palestinian-Israeli patrols is merely an Israeli  attempt to dwarf Palestinian demands. It is as if the  differences were over numbers, not principles, he said.    He said Israel is still evading acceptance of these  conditions, basically on the pretext of numbers, while it really  does not want to implement the Security Council resolution.    Qaddumi stated: "I challenge Israel to announce that it is  ready to discuss the settlements, which represent an obstacle to  peace. I challenge Israel to withdraw immediately or to disarm  the settlers."    All this, Qaddumi maintained, indicates that our differences  with Israel are over principles, not over numbers or other  similar things, which are raised only to play down the real  differences at the negotiations.    Qaddumi said the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations are moving  with extreme difficulty. We have had this in mind from the  beginning, he said, noting Egypt's experience in its three years  of negotiations with Israel over Taba.    Qaddumi said in this regard that during those negotiations,  Israel presented maps to Egypt, which had to go to Istanbul--as  late Turkish President Turgut Ozal told him--to obtain the right  maps. This shows Israel's constant policy of forging facts and  procrastinating, Qaddumi said.    He said that while Israel has repeatedly claimed it would  withdraw from the territories it occupied in 1967, it is  actually fabricating further obstacles and excuses to maintain  its occupation.    Qaddumi stressed that the Palestinian leadership is under  pressure and strong criticism from the Palestinian people inside  the occupied territories. He also noted frustration among the  Palestinian people, which was reflected in the escalation of the  intifadah.    All this constitutes pressure on the Palestinian leadership,  he said. The Palestinian people in the occupied territories, he  added, want the negotiations to be broken up until Israel, the  Security Council, and the sponsors of the peace conference--the  United States and Russia--implement the Security Council  resolution. He said the Palestinian people do not want the  leadership to go to the negotiations before the world provides  the necessary measures for the Palestinians to feel safe and  assured.    Qaddumi said: Our people have taken the initiative and  escalated their intifadah against Israel to tell the world that  they reject settlements and want a speedy withdrawal. These are  two basic demands by the Palestinian people in the occupied  territories.    On Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar's implicit  criticism that the Palestinians failed to coordinate with the  other Arab parties involved in the peace process, Qaddumi said  the Palestinians were the ones who sought coordination. He  noted that the PLO worked to end its estrangement with Syria  after the Gulf war.    He explained: We went to Damascus and began to coordinate  with Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Egypt. We are extremely eager  for Arab coordination, which must continue.    Noting that the Syrians consider the signing of the Oslo  Agreement a departure from Arab coordination, Qaddumi said that  despite the contents of that agreement--which he himself  opposed-- one should not keep bringing up these matters because  it will only weaken the Arabs' negotiating cards.    He said that the Syrian foreign minister stressed during  their recent meeting in Damascus that Syria was ready to  coordinate with the Palestinians to mobilize international  public opinion after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. This is a  positive Syrian position, he said.    Qaddumi stressed that the Palestinian side is in direct  contact with the brothers in Syria on coordination.    All of us in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, and the PLO are  stressing the importance of Arab cooperation, without which we  will weaken our negotiating cards, he said.    He said that the Palestinian leadership has decided to  return  to this policy as soon as possible.    On the importance of coordination before a return to the  negotiations, the PLO Political Department chief said that under  clear instructions from the Palestinian leadership he held  direct talks with the foreign ministers of Syria, Jordan, and  other Arab countries. He said he also instructed the  Palestinian representative at the United Nations to coordinate  with the Arab group and its chairman, Ambassador Nabil al-'Arabi  of Egypt.    He said the PLO also called for an urgent Arab League  meeting, which resulted in resolutions condemning the Hebron  massacre and explaining Arab demands. He said Arab coordination  over the massacre was evident.    At the end of his statement, Qaddumi expressed the belief  that the Israelis will not be honest during today's talks in  Cairo.    By applying international pressure on them and exposing  their  positions, we must force the Israelis to meet the Palestinian  demands, which were recognized by the UN Security Council, he  said.    He stressed that Israel fears to live in a political  isolation that would hurt its society and heighten the internal  dispute to the level of a clash, which is already happening.</p>

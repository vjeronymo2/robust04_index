			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] One of those released from detention is Olusegun  Osoba, former governor of Ogun State. He was charged and let  out on bail. Robin White asked him what conditions were like in  jail:    [Begin recording] [Osoba] It was most horrifying, most  terrible. I think the authorities set out to deliberately  inflict mental and psychological torture on me.    [White] Why? What did they do?    [Osoba] They kept us...[pauses] particularly myself for five  days alone incommunicado in an office which is terrible, dirty,  and without adequate ventilation,and a place infested with giant  mosquitoes and very robust rats. I was made to sleep on a desk  for six days.    [White] You say robust rats. What do you mean?    [Osoba] Well, at night my companions were rats, all roaming  around the room, all over around the place.    [White] Were you interrogated?    [Oshoba] I was, and we were asked about the national  democratic alliance that we form, NADECO [National Democratic  Coalition]. [end recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattribued article: "TSE Says Only 11 Parties Qualify for </F> Presidential Race"]    [Text] Yesterday the Superior Electoral Court (TSE)  published its list of parties meeting the legal requirements for  nominating candidates for president of the republic in 1994.  Eleven parties qualified: the PDT [Democratic Labor Party], PFL  [Liberal Front Party], PL [Liberal Party], PMDB [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party], PRN [National Reconstruction Party],  PSD [Democratic Social Party], PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy  Party], PT [Workers Party], PTB [Brazilian Labor Party], PP  [Progressive Party or Popular Party], and PPR [Progressive  Renewal Party]. Under the terms of Law No. 8,713, candidates can  be nominated only by parties that received at least 5 percent of  the votes counted in the 1990 elections for the Chamber of  Deputies in at least one-third of the states, meaning, in  practice, that they must have a minimum of 15 elected deputies.  The same rule applies to parties wishing to run gubernatorial  and senatorial candidates.    The reduction in the number of candidates is the result of  the new Electoral Law (Law No. 8,713/93), which has been in  effect since 1 October 1993, the date when it was published in  the DIARIO OFICIAL. Although the PRN bloc had only 10 members on  1 October, it meets the legal requirement because it did receive  5 percent of the vote in the 1990 elections. The other seven  parties with representatives in the Chamber of Deputies on 1  October could run a single additional presidential candidate if  they formed a coalition.    Alliances--It can therefore be expected that there will be a  maximum of 11 candidates to succeed President Itamar Franco. But  while that number is mathematically possible, it is not likely,  seeing that political alliances lead to coalitions. In 1989, 20  candidates vied to succeed former President Jose Sarney. The 11  parties in question are also eligible to run candidates for  governor in 27 states and for the 54 vacancies in the Senate.    Of the 20 parties expected to participate in the 1994  elections, only two--the PMN [National Mobilization Party] and  the PRP [Progressive Republican Party or Revolutionary Party of  the Proletariat]--are not represented in the National Congress,  but they have the permanent registration required by law.  Nineteen have permanent registration, and one--the PSTU [United  Social Workers Party]--has only temporary registration, but it  does have one federal deputy, thus meeting another legal  requirement. Two parties--the PTC [expansion not given] and the  PT do B [Communist Party of Brazil]--are in the process of  receiving permanent registration. The TSE is to decide by the  day after tomorrow whether those two parties will also be  allowed to nominate candidates.    Generally speaking, the new Electoral Law will benefit the  voter, according to the TSE's presiding judge, Sepulveda  Pertence. "The law tried to make things easy for the voter by  adopting two ballots for the elections: one for candidates to be  elected by majority vote and another for proportional voting.  The only disadvantage is that it prevents us from holding two  rounds of balloting and organizing parallel vote counting, since  the two ballots will be deposited in a single ballot box."  Although deploring the slow vote count that will result,  Sepulveda admits that it is the only way to prevent fraud.    The following parties will be eligible to run candidates for  president of the republic in 1994, for state governor, and for  the Senate: the PMDB, PFL, PSDB, PDT, PT, PL, PP, PPR, PSD, PTB,  and PRN.    The following will be able to run candidates in elections  under the proportional system (that is, for the Chamber of  Deputies and state legislative assemblies) in 1994: the PSB  [Brazilian Socialist Party], PC do B [Communist Party of  Brazil], PPS [Popular Socialist Party], PSTU, PV [Green Party],  Prona [National Order Redefinition Party], PSC [Social Christian  Party], PMN, and PRP.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Martin Intl shares dive following interim loss SHARES OF Martin International Holdings tumbled 38p to 49p yesterday after the garment manufacturer and Marks and Spencer supplier reported a first half loss and a sharply reduced interim dividend, writes Graham Deller. And Mr Michael Kidd, chairman, warned that following closure costs, estimated at Pounds 500,000 in the second half, the group was likely to incur a small loss for the full year. Results for the six months to June 30, compiled under FRS 3, showed a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 270,000, against a restated profit of Pounds 142,000. Turnover was little changed at Pounds 33.9m, including Pounds 1.22m from discontinued operations. Losses per share deepened to 1.6p (0.2p) and the interim dividend is cut from 1.7p to 0.4p. Mr Kidd said the outcome 'illustrated the general pressure on margins in what remains an extremely competitive trading environment throughout the world'. The UK operations produced a 'disappointing' result, he said, although business with Marks and Spencer progressed well and underwear and leisure wear achieved a 'good' profit. Overseas operations were adversely affected by a unexpected reduction in demand from customers in the US and the Middle East, factors that will also affect the second half.</p>

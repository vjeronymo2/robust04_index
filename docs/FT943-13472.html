			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: DIY worries Stocks with home improvement interests weakened in response to reports of expansion plans by US DIY group Home Depot. Ladbroke, owner of the Texas chain, slipped 3 to 175p, B&amp;Q parent Kingfisher declined 7 to 527p and Do It All co-owner Boots fell 11 to 538p. Boots partner WH Smith was the one bright spot, managing a rise of 5 to 481p. However, stores specialists were mostly sceptical over the US group's impact on the UK market. One said that Home Depot was aware of the difficult trading environment in UK DIY and would more likely be targeting the German and French markets as the focus of its European strategy. In addition, the US company favours large store formats, which could run into planning difficulties in the UK. Boots was further undermined by weekend press reports that a consortium of institutions was considering bidding for the company's drugs division. The suggestion was met with general incredulity by analysts, who pointed out that the offshoot was most likely to be bought by a kindred business, and who also expressed surprise that the originally mooted price of Pounds 1bn had apparently dropped to between Pounds 600m to Pounds 700m, according to the reports. Media conglomerate Pearson strengthened 22 to 660p, making a gain of almost Pounds 1 a share over the past two weeks. Recent underperformance has been redressed by a spate of buy recommendations and optimism that the conglomerate will have a significant voice in the new Channel Five television station. Wm Low delivered J. Sainsbury the information requested by the country's biggest supermarket group - a move which could trigger the anticipated contest for the Scottish company following the friendly Pounds 154m bid from Tesco last week. Sainsbury's mulling gave the sector a chance to pause for breath after last week's heightened activity, with Low's shares adding just 3 at 256p, Tesco gaining 5 1/2 at 238 1/2 p and Sainsbury edging forward a half-penny to 397 1/2 p. Strong half-time results from Coca-Cola and the continuing hot weather helped Cadbury Schweppes rise 7 1/2 to 451 1/2 p. Sugar processor Tate &amp; Lyle firmed 5 to 415p. Unilever eased 5 to 1005p as the soap wars saga with arch-rival Procter &amp; Gamble rumbled on. Buying of Wellcome, ahead of Thursday's interim results, was boosted by a revival of speculation that the company was a takeover or merger target. The company is changing its year-end and reporting figures for the four months to the end of June. The shares put on 13 at 629p. Elsewhere in the sector, SmithKline Beecham, which reports full-year figures today, fell 6 to 394p on profit-taking. High street lending banks Barclays and Lloyds were pulled in different directions on switch advice from one securities house. Barclays was off 5 at one stage after Lehman Brothers downgraded the stock from buy to hold. However, the shares picked up with the market to close a penny ahead at 555p. Meanwhile, Lehman upgraded Lloyds on the expectation that it will successfully merge with the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society and boost its earnings by 12 per cent in the first year. Also, SGST reiterated its buy stance on Lloyds and the shares rose 9 to 566p. Several stocks with hotel interests benefited from recent news on the improving trading outlook. Forte gained 8 1/2 at 230p, Stakis 2 1/2 at 88p, Bass 10 at 555p, and Whitbread 12 at 553p ahead of its agm statement today. Engineering group Wagon Industrial closed a penny firmer at 500p as NatWest Securities said its rating remained undemanding, although the sticking point was the yield. A stock overhang, together with general profit-taking, left shares in GKN trailing 11 at 609p. It was also profit-taking that weakened Siebe, which closed 9 down at 598p after trade of 1.8m. A two-way pull in FKI brought volume of 3.2m as the shares closed unchanged at 180p, after the group announced disposals of Pounds 46m. One market watcher said: 'This is a good deal as it reduces debt and enables it to pursue its acquisition policy.' Negative weekend press comment left conglomerate Tomkins 3 off at 221p. Confirmation from dry cleaning company Sketchley that one of its two executive deputy chairmen is to leave the company cast a shadow over the stock. The shares eased 5 to 105p.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Christies buys City art and coin dealer CHRISTIES International, the auctioneer, yesterday bought Spink and Son, its neighbour in the heart of London's art market and one of the oldest of the City's fine art dealers. The sale is worth up to Pounds 16.3m to Andrew Weir, the private shipping and hotels company that owned Spink, and is significantly below the Pounds 50m sought in 1990 when the company first went on to the market before the Gulf war. While Christies' purchase has been taken as further confirmation of faint stirrings in the art market, it also demonstrates the extent to which the market has fallen. The deal will involve Christies in some little-known duties in addition to giving it an ability to deal in fine art coins, medals and oriental works. Spink, as official medallist to the Royal Household, has to ensure that the Queen and Prince Philip are correctly attired with medals and other decorations on public occasions. It will continue to trade under the name Spink from its premises in King Street, St James's. But the deal marks another change of fortune for a company founded in the City of London in 1666, the year of the Great Fire. Its more recent record, however, has been patchy. From a profit in 1989 of Pounds 2.1m, the company was making similar losses within two years. Last year it made losses of Pounds 700,000 on sales of Pounds 21.7m at the trading level. The sale of Spink will also raise questions in the art world as to whether there is a potential conflict of interest. Christies, as an auctioneer, would be expected to sell at the highest price possible, while Spink, might be expected to want to buy at the lowest. Lord Carrington, Christies International chairman, will chair a compliance committee to ensure what the company calls a 'proper separation and identity' of Christies and Spink. Christies is paying an initial Pounds 7.1m in cash and to settle inter-company debts. It will also pay up to Pounds 1.7m if Spink's tax losses are realised and up to Pounds 7.7m as and when the company's stock is sold. Christies will retain Pounds 3.9m from the sale proceeds of these assets. Saleroom, Page 8 Hammer falls, Page 26</p>

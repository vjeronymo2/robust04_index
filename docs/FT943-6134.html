			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Guinness Peat drops 26% after Australian setback Guinness Peat Group, the UK investment vehicle of Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur, yesterday reported a 26 per cent fall in interim profits after its Australian fund management and life assurance business ran into losses. Despite turnover ahead to Pounds 21.3m (Pounds 13m), pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 fell from Pounds 6.75m to Pounds 4.97m. However, strong growth from the rest of the group, particularly the Brown Shipley stockbroking side, and a sharp fall in the tax charge saw earnings per share increase 43 per cent to 1.09p. Tyndall Australia, in which GPG has a 52 per cent stake, swung from a Pounds 4.8m profit last time to losses of Pounds 1m. GPG blamed the decline on falls in the Australian investment market during the first half and added that the situation had now stabilised. Mr Blake Nixon, executive director, said the group's attention would focus on managing existing investments after its recent busy programme of acquisitions and disposals. 'Although we will still be looking out for investment opportunities, we will be concentrating on consolidation and adding value to our existing portfolio,' he said. Mr Nixon reiterated that the group would consider returning to the dividend list next year - the last distribution was in 1990.</p>

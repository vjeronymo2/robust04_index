			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Russian bosses get rich as workers go unpaid: Labour Ministry report likely to fuel tension Heads of Russian private and state enterprises are raking in huge salaries even where factories are technically bankrupt and workers are not being paid, government research shows. A report by the country's Labour Ministry, the Institute of Labour and a department of the presidential staff, shows that directors in a range of corporations are receiving multi-million rouble monthly salaries while their workers take home much less than the average wage or are sent on involuntary 'holidays' because of the enterprises' debts or lack of orders. The factories cited include: The Izchesmash engineering plant in Ivanovo, north-east of Moscow, which paid its workers Rbs77,000 (Pounds 22) a month - but accorded its director Rbs881,000. In summer it sent the workers home without pay for two months, but the director was given Rbs4.7m to see him through the same period. The Novosibirskenergo enterprise in Novosibirsk, central Russia, has debts of Rbs5.3bn, and stopped paying many of its workers. Its director's monthly salary, however, remained at Rbs2.65m. A pipe factory in Volgograd in the south paid its workers Rbs200,000 a month but its director Rbs2.22m. Its debts stand at about Rbs4.5bn. The research coincides with findings that the old nomenklatura - those appointed to top jobs in the communist period - have continued to occupy leading positions in society after the fall of communism, though their privileges are now measured in money rather than access to scarce goods as before. The findings are certain to fuel tension caused by cuts in support to industry and fears of bankruptcies and unemployment in the coming year. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, and Mr Alexander Shokhin, economics minister, have both warned that problems will mount as budget cuts and non-payment of wages increase while tax revenues and industrial output decline. Mr Victor Gerashchenko, chairman of the central bank, said yesterday that industrial output would fall by 15 per cent next year and gross domestic product by nearly 5 per cent. He told bankers in St Petersburg that 1995 would see a 'stabilisation, at a crisis level'. The labour report analysed pay in plants of different forms of ownership. Some were fully private, others had state holdings of between 20 and 57 per cent. 'But, characteristically, in both state and non-state enterprises there were huge disproportions between the pay received by the directors, which was 10 or more times that of the average pay of the workers,' it said. While the differential in earnings may be unremarkable in the west, it is large compared with Russia's recent past. Directors' pay was, in communist times, governed by a Lenin decree that heads of enterprises should not earn more than three times the average skilled worker's wage.</p>

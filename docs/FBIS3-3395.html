Liu, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, said  that strengthening the unity between the Army and the government  and between the Army and the people is essential to the success  in reforms and economic growth, and to China's political and  social stability as well.    Both the Army and the people should make concerted efforts  to  promote ideological and cultural progress, he said.    Committees of the Chinese Communist Party and governments at  all levels must pay close attention to agriculture and rural  work, particularly grain and cotton production, he said in a  group discussion about the government work report with deputies  from Hebei Province to the National People's Congress.    Liu, who is also a Standing Committee member of the  Political  Bureau of the party Central Committee, described agriculture as  an issue closely related to China's long-term stability.    "At present, we must arouse farmers' initiative for  production and help them achieve relatively comfortable living  standards," he said.    To this end, it is imperative to relieve farmers' financial  burdens and enable them to gain tangible benefits, he added.    The leader said that many major state-owned enterprises are  military factories, adding that the government is formulating  new measures to help these factories manufacture civilian goods  and solve their problems in operation.    Liu Huaqing also asked local governments to educate the  local  people in patriotism and collectivism in the course of speeding  up reforms and opening wider to the rest of the world.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: BET The mere 3 per cent dip in BET's share price yesterday in response to a Pounds 200m rights issue is thought-provoking. The market is evidently glad to see BET, like ECC before it, raising cash to pay off its auction market preferred stock (Amps). But if a company were to seek cash to rid itself of an excessive burden of floating rate debt - which in essence is what BET is doing - would the market be so forgiving? The timing behind BET's move is intelligible enough. The list of non-US companies with Amps outstanding is getting shorter all the time, and the market is showing worrying signs of illiquidity. If a BET auction were to fail - as has happened to Ratners - the effects on the share price do not bear thinking about. The fact remains, though, that the rights money will cost BET a net 5.7 per cent - assuming a held dividend - against 4.6 per cent for the Amps. The price of reduced risk for the company, in other words, is dilution for the shareholders. That apart, the withdrawal of BET from the Amps market, having been the first non-US company to discover it in size, may be taken as the end of and misunderstanding of these instruments in the UK may seem odd to a US observer. But the market for Amps consists wholly of US investors who are interested primarily in big, familiar, triple-A US corporations like Coca-Cola and Exxon, rather than unknown foreign minnows. Perhaps more to the point, several of the UK companies issuing them - Maxwell Communication, for one - had every reason to disguise their true balance sheet gearing and flatter their interest cover. Perhaps the epitaph for Amps in the UK should be that for too many of the issuers, the true rationale was the naivete of the UK market in scrutinising accounts.</p>

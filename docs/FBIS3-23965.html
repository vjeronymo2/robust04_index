Over the past week, the  increase in prices for nonfood goods was equal to 2.4 percent.  Foodstuffs and paid public services became more expensive over  the week by 1.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively.    The difference in the price increase rates for basic  consumer  goods and paid public services for Russia's individual economic  regions was insignificant.    In Moscow and St. Petersburg, the increase in prices for  goods and services was higher than the national average increase  and amounted respectively to 2.5 percent and 2.6 percent. In  Moscow, the prices for nonfood goods increased most of all -- by  3.1 percent, while, in St. Petersburg, paid public services  became more expensive by 4.5 percent.  <H5>  Only Vodka Is Becoming Cheaper </H5>   Basic food products over the past week became more expensive  by 1.6 percent. Prices rose most of all for vegetables -- by 4.4  percent, for groats and pasta items -- by 3.5 percent and for  dairy products -- by 3.4 percent. The prices for vegetable oil  and sugar hardly changed at all.    Over the week, vodka became cheaper on the average by 1  percent.    At the municipal and unofficial markets, the prices for meat  and fish products, butter, eggs, sugar, flour, and salt remained  unchanged.       Table 1.

Food products became more expensive  in the Northern Caucasus region than anywhere else. Here,  vegetables and fruits were 10 percent higher than a week ago,  butter was 5 percent higher and dairy products, pasta items and  some types of canned goods were 3-4 percent higher.    Prices for foodstuffs in the Eastern Siberian region  remained  practically unchanged in comparison with the preceding week.    The average cost of a basket of the 19 most important food  products on 22 February amounted to 40,500 rubles [R] calculated  on a monthly basis and rose over the week by 1.6 percent and,  since the beginning of the year, by 32.8 percent. The cost of  this basket, based on organized trade prices, was equal to  R39,200 and, based on unorganized trade prices, to R54,300.   <FIG ID=FBIS-USR-023-55A>           Average Cost of a Basket of the </FIG>          The disparity between the maximum and minimum costs for a  basket in different Russian cities amounted to a factor of 3.4  (in the previous week, it was a factor of 3.9).       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

The most "inexpensive" region in basket cost in the past  week  was the Central Chernozem region -- R21,600, while the most  "costly" was, as before, the Far East region (R70,200).    Among the surveyed Russian cities, a substantial increase in  the cost of a basket was noted in the cities of Tatarstan  (Kazan, Chistopol and Naberezhnyye Chelny), where, over the  week, milk and sour cream became more expensive by a factor of  1.4-1.6, while rye-wheat bread, wheat bread from grade I and II  flour and potatoes increased by a factor of 1.3-1.4.    The cost of a basket of the 19 most important food products  in Moscow and St. Petersburg amounted to R45,300 and R41,800 and  increased over the week by 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent,  respectively. On the list of surveyed cities, Moscow, just like  a week ago, occupied the 30th position, while St. Petersburg  moved from the 49th position to the 51st position.  <H5>  Fabrics, Powders and Wallpaper Are Becoming More Expensive </H5>   Nonfood products became more expensive by 2.4 percent. Over  the past week, just as over the 2 preceding weeks, the greatest  price increases were for fuel -- by 9 percent, and for medicine  -- by 8 percent. Fabrics, synthetic detergents and wallpaper  became 4-5 percent more expensive over the week. The prices for  footwear changed less than those for other nonfood products  (just like a week ago -- by 1 percent).    The increase in prices for non-food products amounted in  nearly all economic regions to 2-3 percent. And only for the  inhabitants of the Eastern Siberian region, where fabrics, fuel  and medicine became 12-15 percent more expensive, did they  increase overall by 4 percent.    The disparity between the minimum and maximum price levels  for individual goods is not shrinking. So, for example, in the  surveyed Russian cities, the differences in the cost of footwear  in February amounted to a factor of 6-8. Whereas one pair of  men's good-quality shoes cost R11,000-14,000 in Novocheboksarsk,  Cheboksary and Shebekino at the end of February, their price  exceeded R90,000 in Groznyy.</p>

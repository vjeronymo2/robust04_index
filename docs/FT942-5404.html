			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (2): A foot on the other side's turf - Scheherazade Daneshkhu examines the increased competition for investors' money that has followed the fall in interest rates, tempting savers out of building societies and into equities On the face of it, unit and investment trusts have more in common than divides them. It is in both their interests to attract investors into equities, and both are able to argue that, as collective funds, they offer private investors a relatively cheap route into a diversified holding. However, behind these common goals lies the competition for investors' money, which has accelerated as the fall in UK interest rates over the past 18 months has brought private investors out of the building societies and into equities. Investment trusts, with a history dating back to the 1860s, are often regarded as the more sophisticated investor's choice; but unit trusts, which have been around only since the 1930s, have been skilled at mass marketing and at appealing to bank and building society customers. They have had an advantage here over investment trusts, which have been restricted in their advertising by the Companies Act prohibiting quoted companies from advertising their shares. Packaged products, such as savings schemes and personal equity plans are exempt from this restriction, and investment trusts have concentrated their marketing on these products. Unit trusts also pay 3 per cent commission to independent financial advisers, giving them a distribution advantage over investment trusts. In recent years, some fund management groups traditionally associated with one product have ventured on to the other's turf. Before 1991, Fidelity, for example, did not manage any investment trusts. It now has two: European Values and Japanese Values. Mary Blair, Fidelity's product development director, says that the company decided three years ago that it wanted to enter the investment trust business, to attract those institutional and retail clients who will only buy investment trusts and not unit trusts. The ability of investment trusts to gear by borrowing money also has investment attractions, says Ms Blair. On the other hand, Foreign &amp; Colonial, manager of the world's oldest investment trust, has been extraordinarily successful in raising Pounds 500m within a year for the High Income unit trust, launched in February 1993 with the German Hypo bank and aimed at building society customers. F&amp;C's Craig Walton said that, although the company had had unit trusts since 1983, it had decided two years ago on a marketing drive for its unit trust business. The main reason for launching the High Income Fund as a unit, rather than investment, trust was that it could be sold through the IFA network. Structure Although some investors may have a clear-cut understanding of which type of trust to choose, each has its advantages and disadvantages. From two fundamental structural differences between the trusts stem the characteristics of each. Unit trusts are open-ended and able to create units when there is demand, whereas an investment trust has a fixed number of shares. While investment trusts are traded on the stock market in the same way as other shares, unit trusts are not quoted companies. This means that, while the value of units is fixed according to the value of the underlying assets in a unit trust, the price of shares in an investment trust fluctuates according to market demand. At periods when demand has been low, investment trusts have tended to trade at a discount to their net asset value. In the early 1980s, discounts could be as wide as 25 to 30 per cent, but the average discount fell to 12 per cent at the beginning of 1993 and then to 4 per cent in January this year, and has widened since. Private investor demand, against the background of low interest rates - as well as efforts by the industry to pull in a steady stream of new money with monthly savings schemes introduced about a decade ago - has helped to achieve this narrowing. Split-capital trusts, which separate the functions of capital growth and income, have also given investment trusts an appeal to a wider circle of investors. The narrowing of the discount has helped to give investment trusts their superior performance over unit trusts in the past 10 years. (See table - the investment trust figures do not take account of charges and are therefore comparable with those for unit trusts quoted on an offer-to-offer basis.) But with discounts historically low, investors cannot necessarily expect the same level of returns in the next 10 years. Charges Many investors are attracted to investment trusts because of their charging structure. Unit trusts have an initial charge of 5 to 6 per cent, and the bid/offer spread - the difference in price between buying and selling units  -can be greater. In addition, there is an annual management charge, often of 1.5 per cent. Since investment trusts are bought in the market, there is no comparable initial charge. Instead there is stockbroker's commission of 1.5 to 2 per cent (less in savings schemes), 0.5 per cent stamp duty on the purchase of the shares and the marketmaker's buying and selling spread. The annual fee is lower than that of unit trusts at about 0.5 to 0.75 per cent. Liquidity In falling markets, unit trust managers face the problem of redemptions, and can find themselves having to sell holdings quickly if investors want to liquidate their units. This is both good and bad from the investors' point of view. It means that they can get out quickly by making a phone call; but if they want to stay in the trust, its long-term performance can be badly hit by the fund manager having to sell stock he would otherwise have preferred to hold. Investment trust managers are spared this problem, but instead their investors are likely to find the trust moving to a deep discount if it becomes unpopular. If the investment trust is small, investors may find it difficult to sell out because of a shortage of buyers. James Higgins, of fee-based independent financial advisers Chamberlain de Broe, says: 'We do tend to favour investment trusts, because of their flexibility. They are ideal for regular savings plans, particularly because most now have plans with very low dealing charges. However, if a particularly attractive investment trust is standing at a premium, we might recommend a comparable unit trust. An example is the use of City of London Emerging Markets unit trust, instead of Templeton's investment trust.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- How they compare (Pounds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Investment                    1 year   3 years   5 years   10 years  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Average investment trust       1,359     1,664     1,750      4,304 FT-SE-A All Share              1,173     1,452     1,735      4,119 Average unit trust*            1,217     1,528     1,658      3,571 Average unit trust**           1,150     1,443     1,564      3,367 Halifax 90 day account***      1,033     1,157     1,395      2,110 Inflation (RPI)                1,023     1,084     1,269      1,629 Lloyds deposit account         1,005     1,039     1,187      1,617  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The table shows how Pounds 1,000 would have grown over given periods to May 1. *Offer to offer, income reinvested.  **Offer to bid, income reinvested.  ***Includes factor for reinvested income.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: HSW  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Job losses are highlighted ALMOST half the jobs created between 1983 and 1990 were lost in the 15 months of recession up to the third quarter of last year, according to research at Glasgow University. The research says that in spite of the faster rise in unemployment in the south, 750,000 more people in work there now than in 1979 compared with 500,000 fewer in the north. The north has lost fewer jobs in the recession because it had less new employment created in the boom.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Canadian Pizza down 14% after warning Canadian Pizza, which issued a profits warning in April just five months after flotation, yesterday reported a 14 per cent fall in interim profits and a 6 per cent drop in sales. Pre-tax profits for the six months to July 2 fell from Pounds 1.66m to Pounds 1.42m. Sales fell from Pounds 8.82m to Pounds 8.28m. The shares, floated last November at 200p, closed yesterday 5p ahead at 105p. The profits warning followed a slowdown in sales to UK retail customers and a decision by J Sainsbury, its biggest client, to stop buying pizza crusts for its delicatessen operations. Yesterday the company said the difficult climate was persisting. Sales to UK retailers, accounting for 50 per cent of turnover, were down 11 per cent. But the company had succeeded in obtaining nine new UK retail customers. Sales from the catering division were also down, by 21 per cent. However, exports were 5 per cent ahead, and sales of crusts to other pizza makers were ahead by 22 per cent. Pizza crust sales were 19 per cent up by volume, but only 4 per cent by value, reflecting the pressure on margins and the changing customer base. Earnings per share were 5.7p (6.5p). The interim dividend is 2.4p.</p>

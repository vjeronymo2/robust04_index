			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Once Again: He Who Owns Nothing Gives To The </F> Ones Who Do Not Deserve"]    [Text] Did U.S. President Bill Clinton offer Jerusalem as a  gift to Israel even before the end of the ongoing negotiations  with the PLO over self-rule and before the start of negotiations  on the final status of the occupied territories? We pose this  question in view of Clinton's recent statements to Jewish  leaders on his claimed belief in the need to keep Jerusalem as  the united capital of Israel.    President Clinton left such an issue to be decided during  negotiations between the PLO and Israel on the final status of  the occupied territories. However, the PLO, which agreed  through the Oslo accord on a solution of unlinked phases, is now  required to pause at the contents of Clinton's statements on  Jerusalem, which, aside from its sanctity, also represents a  large part of the West Bank area. If the PLO continues the  negotiations while overlooking these statements, it will mean an  implicit acceptance of a predetermined decision on the issue of  occupied Jerusalem, even before negotiations on it begin.    The PLO and all the concerned Arab and Islamic parties are  required to stress what Jordan has repeatedly stressed -- that  sovereignty over holy Jerusalem can only belong to Almighty God,  and that if peace is to be achieved in this part of the world,  Jerusalem should be a symbol of peace and a meeting point for  the sons of the three monotheistic religions. Jewish hegemony  over Jerusalem will only fuel conflict and instability.    The continued Jewish insistence on clinging to Jerusalem as  the united capital of Israel and the growing U.S. support for  this direction should prompt the PLO -- which has shouldered the  responsibility of negotiation over the issue of the West Bank  territories occupied in the 1967 war, including Jerusalem -- to  adopt a clear and sound stand on the issue of Jerusalem. Israel  has repeatedly claimed Jerusalem is an inseparable part in  tandem with increasing U.S. support for the annexation since the  recent UN Security Council resolution in which the issue of  Jerusalem was included. Washington had reservations over this  issue and hence an agreement was reached to resume the  negotiations despite these reservations and Clinton's statements  on his belief that Jerusalem should remain united under Israel's  control.    Since we are still in the first stage of the negotiations,  we, as Arabs and Palestinians, are required to return to the  strongest form of coordination so that we will not leave the  door open for the Arab parties to be isolated and so we do not  end up with results such as those which surprised us in the  secret Oslo negotiations and the well-known Washington accord.</p>

			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY WANTS TO REDUCE PENALTY IN NEWPORT CASE  </P> <P> A federal jury said Wednesday that the six defendants found guilty in the  Princeton/Newport Limited Partners securities fraud trial should forfeit $3.8  million to the government under the racketeering law, far less than the $22  million that prosecutors had demanded.  </P> <P> But U.S. District Judge Robert L. Carter said he almost certainly will overturn  the jury's findings and grant the prosecutors' request for the full $22  million.  </P> <P> The quick turn of events first raised the spirits of the defendants and their  families, who had expected the worst after Monday's guilty verdict. But the  judge's comments on taking the full $22 million erased their relief and left  them bewildered.  </P> <P> The six were found guilty by the same jury Monday on 63 counts, including  racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, securities fraud and mail fraud. The  government charged that the six arranged sham trades of securities so that  Princeton/Newport could claim phony tax losses. The case was noteworthy because  it marked the first use of the racketeering law against top executives of a  securities firm.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called 'Exorbitant'  </P> <P> Under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO,  defendants found guilty of participating in a continuing criminal enterprise  can be forced to forfeit to the government their full financial interest in the  enterprise, including amounts gained from legitimate activities.  </P> <P> But the jurors indicated by their verdict Wednesday that they felt that taking  the full amount wouldn't be appropriate in this case. After the forfeiture  verdict, juror Michelle Rodriguez said in a brief interview on the courthouse  steps that "we thought what the government asked was exorbitant." She declined  to elaborate, however, on how the jurors arrived at precise figures for each  defendant.  </P> <P> Judge Carter said that, because of his interpretation of the RICO law, he  almost certainly will grant prosecutors' request for the full $22 million,  representing salaries, management fees and partnership interests in  Princeton/Newport and related companies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pleased by Ruling  </P> <P> As part of the verdict returned Wednesday, the jurors formally found that the  defendants did have a financial interest in the criminal enterprise. The judge  said once the jurors decided that, it was unnecessary for them to determine  amounts, since the law provides for forfeiture of the full amount of their  interest. "As I understand the law, interest in the enterprise is totally  forfeitable," the judge said.  </P> <P> It wasn't clear why the judge, given his view of the law, had permitted  attorneys to make arguments to the jury about the amounts and had given jurors  a blank verdict form, with a space to write in the amounts for each defendant.  The judge said he will rule on the issue after he receives written arguments  from both sides.  </P> <P> Defense lawyers in the case said they were pleased by the jury's ruling on the  amounts of money. They said they believed that an appellate court would  reinstate the jury's findings if Judge Carter carries out his preliminary  decision to overturn them. Defense lawyers had argued that full forfeiture  would be "Draconian" and would amount to cruel and unusual punishment. Defense  lawyers said the amounts demanded by the government would wipe out the entire  net worth of several of the defendants.  </P> <P> Robert H. Schwartz, lawyer for defendant Jack Z. Rabinowitz, a  Princeton/Newport general partner, said that in the aftermath of the guilty  verdict, the jury's decision on the amounts of money "looks to me like an  apology."  </P> <P> The defendants are due to be sentenced Oct. 16 and face the possibility of  lengthy prison terms and fines in addition to the forfeiture. Defense lawyers  said they plan to appeal the conviction.  </P> <P> The jury decided that Rabinowitz and defendants Charles M. Zarzecki, Paul A.  Berkman and Bruce L. Newberg should forfeit only $200,000 each. Prosecutors  claimed that they should each give up amounts ranging from $2.57 million for  Newberg to $1.24 million for Rabinowitz.  </P> <P> The government had demanded that James Sutton Regan, the managing general  partner of Princeton/Newport, give up $15.96 million, but the jury said he  should pay only $3 million. The government had asked that Steven B. Smotrich,  the Princeton/Newport controller, pay $124,585, but jurors came up with a very  precise figure on how much they thought he should pay: $1,245.85.  </P> <P> Juror Rodriguez said jurors came up with that amount for Smotrich because it  represents 1% of what the government had asked for, and "we felt he was 1%  guilty." But she refused to explain further.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Firm Is Defunct  </P> <P> Five of the defendants had been officials of Princeton/Newport, which had  offices in Newport Beach and Princeton, N.J. The firm went out of business  after the indictment. Newberg had been a trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.  and is also a defendant in the case against former Drexel junk bond chief  Michael Milken. The indictment in that case includes charges that overlap with  the Princeton/Newport indictment.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview after the jury was dismissed, juror Joseph Pastina,  66, a retired manager of a delicatessen, said he wouldn't be disturbed if the  judge overturns the jury's findings on the forfeiture.  </P> <P> "I figured it should have been left to the judge to begin with," he said.  "That's what we all felt. I don't know why we should have been burdened with  it."  </P></p>

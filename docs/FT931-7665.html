			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Promodes to buy Discol chain PROMODES, one of France's largest hypermarket groups, is expanding its wholesale interests by buying the Discol chain of food wholesalers from the Pinault-Printemps retail group. The acquisition, which is believed to be worth between FFr150m (Dollars 26.7m) and FFr200m, will turn Promodes into the largest food wholesaler in France, ahead of Metro, the German company. Promodes, based in Normandy, is already a leading player in wholesaling with its Prodirest subsidiary, which made overall sales of FFr1.5bn last year. Discol, which also provides food to restaurants and caterers, mustered total turnover of FFr2.6bn in 1992. The hypermarket sector is one of the most dynamic areas of French retailing, which is generally under strain because of the slowdown in consumer spending. But ambitious groups, notably Promodes and Carrefour, have expanded aggressively by acquisition in recent years and intensified pressure on other retailers. For Pinault, the sale of Discol forms part of an ongoing disposal programme. The group is trying to reduce the FFr19bn of net debt it incurred after the acquisition of the Au Printemps department store group in late 1991 which turned it into one of France's most powerful retail concerns. Pinault is also reported to be in negotiations with Galeries Lafayettes, one of Au Printemps' chief competitors, over the sale of the Prisunic chain of mixed merchandise stores.</p>

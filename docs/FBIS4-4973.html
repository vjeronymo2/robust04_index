			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, Sun -- Cambodia is anxious to  foster bilateral relations with its ASEAN neighbours and is  exploring the possibility of setting up embassies in these  countries.    Its Deputy Prime Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut told  reporters on arrival for a three-day official visit that  Cambodia planned to set up embassy here before proceeding to do  so in other ASEAN countries.    Sirivut, who is also minister of foreign affairs and  international co-operation, said the embassies were necessary to  enable his country to keep abreast the developments in the  region, as Cambodia had been isolated since the last 20 years  because of civil war.    However, he could not say how soon the plans would  materialise as the country's top priority was to revive its  economy.    "Ours is a very poor country, we have to revive our economy  first before embarking on other plans," he said at the Kuala  Lumpur International Airport in Subang on arrival from Phnom  Penh.    Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi was present to  greet Sirivut who is leading a 10-man delegation.    Sirivut's visit was on the invitation of Abdullah.    He said that he would be discussing with Abdullah about the  possibility of setting up the embassy besides discussing  bilateral matters with Malaysian officials.    The visit was also to finalise details of Datuk Sri Dr.  Mahathir Mohamed's three-day visit to Cambodia from April 14.    The Malaysian prime minister is scheduled to hold  discussions  on bilateral, regional and international issues with the  co-prime ministers of Cambodia, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun  Sen.    Dr. Mahathir will then proceed to Laos, also for a three-day  visit.    Sirivut said that the people of Cambodia were looking  forward  to Dr. Mahathir's visit because of Malaysia's role in the peace  process.    He said Cambodia had expressed deep gratitude to the  government and people of Malaysia who had contributed greatly  towards the peace process in the country.    Malaysia, he said, was among the first countries to send  troops to serve in the United Nations Transitional Authority in  Cambodia (UNTAC) whose duty was to organise and monitor the  country's first free elections. [Passage omitted]    He said King Norodom Sihanouk has agreed to personally  welcome Dr. Mahathir.    Sirivut said Cambodia also welcomed Malaysia's private  sector  to invest in the country and would seek the government's  assistance in its rebuilding.    Cambodia is seeking Malaysia's expertise in various fields  including agriculture and tourism.    "We have alot to learn from Malaysia in our efforts to  rebuild our country," he said. [passage omitted]    He is also scheduled to call on Dr. Mahathir Tuesday.</p>

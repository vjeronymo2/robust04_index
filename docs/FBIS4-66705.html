			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, March 4. Indian and Polish leaders today  held wide-ranging political discussions encompassing issues of  bilateral and multilateral interests. The talks, in the presence  of the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, and the visiting  polish President, Mr. Lech Walesa, resulted in three tentative  agreements.    Finding a common view on the need to reform the U.N. system,  the two countries decided to explore the possibility of jointly  forwarding proposals for changes in the U.N. system, including a  "change in the status of some countries."    Mr. Walesa later told presspersons that Poland shared the  Indian view that there was need for a reform of the U.N.,  including making it more effective. In this context, Mr. Walesa  announced that the representatives of the two countries at the  U.N. would present a report on how the positions of the two  countries could be coordinated and a joint initiative launched  in this regard.    The second agreement on coordination at an international  forum was in the context of the GATT. Here, the two decided to  consult each other on specific issues, especially in the case of  textiles in which India has substantial interests.    The third was in respect of jointly exploring business  opportunities in third countries by pooling respective  strengths. The private sector in the two countries would prepare  the report in this context and present it to the respective  Governments.    Giving a resume of his discussions with Indian leader's, Mr.  Walesa said detailed talks had revealed that there were no areas  of differences between the two countries. On the other hand,  prospects of economic cooperation were immense and these should  be exploited for mutual benefit.    On issues of nuclear weapons, the Polish President  reiterated  the position that his country was for a stop to nuclear  proliferation after which the world should attempt to eliminate  all weapons of mass destruction. "I know it is a difficult task  and may not be achieved in my time. The next generation will  have to strive for it," Mr. Walesa added.    Similarly, on human rights, Mr. Walesa said Poland was  against violation of human rights in any part of the world. With  Indian leaders, he said the discussions on this subject were  general in nature and no specific instances or places were  mentioned.  <H5>  The best system </H5>   The Polish President was repeatedly asked for his views on  the trade union movement and the future of communism. To every  query he stated that he believed in a strong trade union  movement which could put pressure on the owners, either private  or the State. "But the pressure should not be so strong as to  kill the enterprise, like bacteria which eats away the vitals of  the body," he added.    Mr. Walesa was also categorical in stating that he believed  that the capitalist form of development was the best system, but  not brutal capitalism which had exploitation as its main plank.  "Some call it capitalism with a human face. That, I think, is  what is needed."  <H5>  Investment invited </H5>   Earlier, the Polish President had a meeting with Indian  industrialists where he invited investment. Stating that his  country could serve as a stepping stone to the European market,  he assured the industrialists that "every penny invested in  Poland will fetch high returns."    Till the mid-eighties, Poland was one of the major trading  partners in the Socialist bloc. However, with that country  pulling out of the rupee trade agreement, bilateral trade shrank  considerably.    Mr. Walesa expressed the hope that with his visit to India,  bilateral trade and investment would go up considerably. The  investment climate there was quite friendly and foreign  investment was allowed in various segments of the economy,  including portfolio investments, the industrialists were told.</p>

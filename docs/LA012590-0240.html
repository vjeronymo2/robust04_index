			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> UNION WAGES UP 3.3% IN 1989  </P> <P> Contracts settled through collective bargaining last year provided workers  average annual wage increases of 3.3% over the life of the pacts, the  government said today.  </P> <P> The Labor Department said 1989 was the first time since 1981 that negotiated  settlements provided larger wage adjustments than the contracts they replaced.  The last time parties to 1989 settlements negotiated, usually in 1986 or 1987,  average wage rate adjustments were 2.4% over the contract term.  </P> <P> Wage restorations in steel and other industries, as well as wage gains for  nurses, accounted for the difference, the agency said.  </P></p>

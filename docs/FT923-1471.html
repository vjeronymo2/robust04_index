			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Executive pay rises slide to 25-year low of 5.5% PAY rises for UK executives have fallen to their lowest level for 25 years, according to research published yesterday. The report by P-E International, the research company, found that in the six months to September 1992, median salary increases for top managers were running at an annual rate of 5.5 per cent. The figures suggest that recent high-profile pay rises for some company directors are not the norm. Executive pay rises have remained no more than about 2 percentage points above inflation since the recession began in mid-1990. Before then, average increases had run at twice the rate of inflation since 1983. This pattern resembles that during the recession of 1980 and 1981, when annual pay rises stayed at about 20 per cent during a period in which inflation was 18 per cent. However, executive pay is still rising more rapidly than inflation, currently 3.6 per cent, and more rapidly than average settlements for non-executive workforces, currently running at just over 4 per cent. A separate, smaller survey of management pay settlements conducted by researchers at Employment Conditions Abroad over the last year, showed rises of up to 7.5 per cent. The P-E International survey shows that in the year to July 1992, the number of executives facing pay cuts and freezes increased to 11 per cent from 7 per cent year-on-year, the survey of 6,703 salary packages from 508 companies shows. Companies with an annual turnover of about Pounds 500m are paying top executives an average of Pounds 160,000, and senior managers Pounds 49,000 in basic salaries, excluding bonuses. Those with a turnover of about Pounds 50m pay executives Pounds 85,000 and senior managers Pounds 33,000 in basic salaries before bonuses. An executive earning Pounds 100,000 basic salary is likely to drive a company car retailing at about Pounds 30,000 or the equivalent of a Jaguar XJ6 4.0 Auto or a BMW 730i. Those on Pounds 35,000 would drive cars worth Pounds 16,000, for example a Rover 820i or Ford Sierra 2.0i Ghia. The company cars are worth between 10 and 15 per cent of their basic salaries. About a third of company bonus schemes made no payments this year. Just 37 per cent of top managers won extra payments this year compared with 38 per cent in 1991 and 49 per cent in 1988. The average value of executive bonuses was 12 per cent of basic salary, marginally higher than last year.</p>

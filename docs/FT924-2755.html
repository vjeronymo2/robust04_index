			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Major stands firm over Maastricht MR John Major last night flatly rejected demands from his European Community partners to speed British ratification of the Maastricht treaty. The British prime minister insisted he would go no further than his previous commitment to ratify the agreement during the present session of parliament, which ends in the autumn. As Mr Major prepared for meetings last night with Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president and Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president, British ministers insisted the 'political reality' at Westminster precluded a pledge in Edinburgh to speed up ratification. But the prime minister privately will tell his European counterparts that a deal at the summit to accommodate Danish objections to Maastricht would lower the political hurdles to British ratification. This week Mr Mitterrand criticised Mr Major for linking the next crucial House of Commons vote on the treaty - the third reading - to the second Danish referendum expected in May. The prime minister has been deliberately ambivalent about whether he would delay that vote still further if Denmark put back the date of the referendum. Senior British ministers said the ambivalence was essential because of the government's precarious majority in the face of a revolt by Conservative Euro-sceptics. They warned also that if Denmark did not get a satisfactory deal from the Community there was no prospect that the Westminster parliament would ratify Maastricht. For his part, Mr Major dismissed talk of a two-speed Europe in which Denmark and the UK are left behind. His judgment is that the difficulties for the other 10 in constructing a new agreement to replace Maastricht would far outweigh the inconvenience they now face in waiting for the two countries to ratify the original agreement. Despite the inevitable eve-of-summit warnings about the complexity and difficulty of the issues facing EC leaders in Edinburgh, Mr Major is quietly confident that agreements on both the Danish question and a future financing package can be struck if all 12 leaders demonstrate the necessary 'political will'. British officials anticipate that the biggest threat is a row with Mr Felipe Gonzalez of Spain and the leaders of other southern EC states over proposals to limit increases in Community expenditure. He will warn his colleagues that a breakdown at the summit could threaten renewed turmoil in the financial markets and a further slump in economic confidence: 'They (the leaders) will be left in no doubt about how high the stakes are,' one British official said.</p>

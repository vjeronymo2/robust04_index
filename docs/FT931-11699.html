			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Money Markets: UK rates fall DEALERS in the sterling cash and futures markets assumed that UK base rates would be as low as 5 per cent by the time of the March Budget, in spite of strenuous claims by the government that it did not want to lower the cost of borrowing, writes James Blitz. Newspaper reports that the UK government was considering cutting base rates to 4 per cent to stimulate recovery had a dramatic effect on short sterling futures. The March contract rose 15 basis points in the morning to 94.50, which prices three-month money at Budget time at 5.50 per cent. That would be consistent with base rates at 5 per cent. The contract later fell back to finish at 94.42. The June and September contracts were also sharply bid up, to 94.76 and 94.77 respectively. This underlines even more firmly the view that base rates will be down at the 5 per cent level by summer. Rates in the sterling cash market declined sharply, helped by a small shortage of Pounds 800m forecast by the Bank of England. This came as a considerable relief to the market after a week of very tight money, which had seen the overnight lending rate up at 100 per cent. Three-month money came down by  1/8 percentage point to 6 3/16 per cent, while the one-year rate was bid as low as 5 5/8 per cent. More importantly, the yield curve for both 'depo bills' and certificates of deposit continued to slope right down to the one-year level, suggesting that the market has not ruled out a rate cut to below 5 per cent. The weekend devaluation of the Irish punt forced a sharp rise in money market rates in France as pressure was again put on the French franc in the European exchange rate mechanism. The cost of one-month French francs was quoted as high as 15 per cent, from about 13 1/2 per cent on Friday, although the Bank of France did not change officially posted rates at its regular market intervention on a Monday. It later came down to about 13 1/2 per cent as pressure eased. The March French franc contract tumbled a further 23 basis points to end at 88.22. The contract is now 223 basis points lower than its closing level on January 18. Nothing better illustrates the speed with which dealers have revised expectations of an easing in French - and German - rates.</p>

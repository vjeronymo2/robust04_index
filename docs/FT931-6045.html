			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Setback for Italian reform plans: Head of inquiry into constitutional changes quits after brother's arrest THE CORRUPTION scandal that is ravaging Italian politics and business claimed another victim yesterday when the head of the parliamentary commission for constitutional reform resigned. The decision by Mr Ciriaco de Mita, a former Christian Democrat prime minister, followed the arrest on Monday of his brother on charges of alleged corruption. Leaders of the main political parties asked him to reconsider the decision, which threatened to disrupt the work of the constitutional reform commission at a crucial moment. The commission has just completed draft proposals for electoral reform which need to be translated into law before a referendum on the subject can be held on April 18. Mr de Mita's resignation came as parliament began the delicate process of considering whether to waive parliamentary immunity for Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader. Milan magistrates have asked for immunity to be waived so that Mr Craxi can answer charges of alleged corruption and illicit financing of the Socialist party amounting to L36bn (Pounds 16m). A decision is expected today. In parliament yesterday, deputies were provided with a 135-page document in which Mr Craxi argued that his immunity should not be waived to face corruption charges. The former Socialist leader claimed that Milan magistrates had mounted an elaborate plot to discredit him and that he as party leader was not involved in the financial administration of the Socialists. In a letter to the commission, Mr de Mita said he was resigning to prevent speculation that his brother's arrest might upset the task of constitutional reform. His brother, Michele, was arrested with 11 others as part of a wide-ranging investigation into the use of funds for the relief of the 1980 earthquake at Irpinia in southern Italy. He is alleged to have been part of an organisation which supplied false invoices for the supply of foodstuffs. Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the Christian Democrat leader, warned that Mr de Mita's resignation would undermine the work of the commission and urged him to reconsider. The opposition former communists in the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) also backed this view. The populist Lombard League was one of the few groups to accept the resignation. The 60-member commission was formed from the two houses of parliament last autumn, and has become the central forum for preparing constitutional reform. With an April 18 date now fixed for the referendum calling for the introduction of majority voting to elect members of the senate, it is essential for the commission to have coherent leadership. The commission has to frame concrete legislation on electoral reform either before or immediately after the referendum. Mr Giovanni Conso, the justice minister, meanwhile has said he hopes to be able to have ready by the end of this week draft legislation to provide a 'political' solution to the widening corruption scandals. The proposals are expected to centre on new laws for tenders and financing of political parties, combined with amnesties for those who confess to paying and receiving bribes in return for restitution of the monies.

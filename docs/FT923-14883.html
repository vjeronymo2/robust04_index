			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Hong Kong banks cut interest rates HONG KONG'S bankers' association yesterday cut prime lending rates by 0.5 percentage points to 6.5 per cent following a signal from the colony's Exchange Fund that borrowing should be made cheaper. The Exchange Fund signalled the cut by lowering its discount rate by 0.5 percentage points earlier in the morning. The move followed an easing in US monetary policy this week. The Hong Kong dollar is fixed against the US currency and interest rate movements in the colony track those in the US. The interest rate cut is likely to fuel asset price inflation in Hong Kong. With inflation at 8.8 per cent in the 12 months to May and deposit rates now at 3.75 per cent for 12 months, the local interest rate structure disadvantages savers. The link to the US dollar has been criticised by some economists as inappropriate to Hong Kong's conditions. Monetary policy in the US is aimed at stimulating a slow growth, low inflation economy - the opposite of economic conditions in the colony. However, the government is unlikely to change the rate at which the local currency is pegged against the US dollar because it believes the peg confers financial stability and certainty. Equally important, the pricing of contracts for the colony's multi-billion dollar airport development are implicitly based on the maintenance of the peg.</p>

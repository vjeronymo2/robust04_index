			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Amanullah Khan, Pakistan Government Patch Up"] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, March 7. After prolonged confrontation,  the Pakistani Government and the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation  Front (JKLF) chief, Mr. Amanullah Khan, have patched up.    Though ideological differences over merger with Pakistan and  "azadi" (freedom) remain, a tacit agreement has been arrived at  between them on a policy of "non-interference."    Sources said Islamabad's role in getting Mr. Khan released  in  Belgium (he was arrested at the instance of India) helped in  arriving at the understanding.    The absence of confrontation between the JKLF and the  Pakistani Government in the early months of 1994, unlike in  earlier years, is an expression of this compromise.    Relations between the JKLF and Islamabad had soured after  Pakistan began providing material and moral support to groups  such as the Hizbul Mujahideen and others which favour merger (of  Kashmir) with Pakistan. After the "launch" of militancy by the  JKLF, Pakistani intelligence found that the group had a mind of  its own and would not budge from its pro-independence stance.    As a result, the JKLF was sidelined in the Kashmir valley,  its supply of arms and ammunition was also cut off to the  benefit of pro-Pakistani outfits which followed the "line" of  the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan.    The JKLF then adopted an increasingly confrontationist  attitude towards Islamabad. This was reflected in numerous  marches to the Line of Actual Control (LAC).    The killing of JKLF cadre by Pakistani security forces  resulted in a hardening of its approach towards Islamabad. In  fact, at one time Mr. Javed Ahmed Mir, acting chief of the JKLF  in the valley, had announced that a joint struggle for  independence would have to be waged against both New Delhi and  Islamabad.    The JKLF-Pakistani equation, punctuated with accusatory  statements, has been relatively quiet this year, the sources say.    With most of the "actions" against the security forces in  the  Kashmir Valley being carried out by groups such as the Hizbul  Mujahideen, the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen and the Al Barq, the  striking capabilities of the JKLF have been badly affected.    On the other hand, Pakistani intelligence agencies are aware  that the Kashmiri sentiment is still, by and large, with the  pro-independence JKLF and not with the groups propped up by it.  It is these realities, the sources said, that have made the JKLF  and the Pakistani Government aware of the mutual benefits of  having a non-confrontationist relationship.</p>

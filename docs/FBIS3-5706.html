			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "The National Security Law </F> Must Be Abolished"]    [Text] As has already been reported, on 3 March, U.S.  Secretary of State Christopher acknowledged that a U.S.  official's recent remarks which demanded that the National  Security Law [NSL] of South Korea be abolished were not an  individual's private opinion, but the official position of the  United States. The final acknowledgment made by the U.S.  secretary of state on the United States' official position  towards this law came out because the South Korean puppets were  clamoring that U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State  Hubbard's remarks calling for the abolition of the NSL in his  speech at American University on 25 February were merely an  individual's opinion. This proceeded from the present U.S.  administration's acknowledgment that one of the reasons for the  failure in progress in dialogue and negotiation between the  North and the South of Korea lies in South Korea's NSL, and this  is, albeit belated, very fortunate.    As everyone is well aware, the NSL of South Korea is a  product and legacy of the military dictatorship and a most  vicious, evil, fascist law blocking free dialogue and exchange  between the North and the South by describing us as an antistate  organization and as an enemy. Under the patronage of the United  States, the successive military dictatorial regimes of South  Korea used the NSL and various anticommunist fascist evil laws  to brutally suppress the South Korean people's struggle for  independence, democracy, reunification, incite North-South  confrontation, and block the country's reunification. Following  the fifth and sixth republics, the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime  has also been mercilessly suppressing not only the South Korean  people's struggle for independence, democracy, and  reunification, but also young students and people who called for  holding dialogue with us, thus blocking the road to dialogue.    Last year alone, the Kim Yong-sam fascist ring suppressed  and  blocked all patriotic struggles of the South Korean students and  people for national reconciliation, unity, and reunification  such as the North-South students' talks that were slated to be  held in Panmunjom on 12 June, the fourth pannational rally in  Seoul, the Pyongyang-Seoul university students' soccer games,  and the North- South student bicycle race. The rascals went so  far as to block our proposals to pay respects before the coffin  of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan in Seoul and to hold a working-level contact  in Panmunjom between North-South Chondoist representatives in  order to discuss holding joint North-South celebrations for the  centennial of the Kap-o peasants' war.    The truculent, fascist tyranny of the Kim Yong-sam ring  which  blocked fellow countrymen from expressing condolences and even  trampled upon the patriotic and nation-loving will of  North-South Chondoists using the NSL evokes strong opposition  and rejection by the world's people. The indiscreet  infringement upon human rights and the antireunification and  antidialogue maneuvers perpetrated indiscreetly by the Kim  Yong-sam ring under the mask of being a so- called civilian-led  government have been so unscrupulous that even high-ranking U.S.  officials were moved to call for the abolishment of the NSL.    One of the reasons why the Kim Yong-sam regime has been  branded as a civilian-led fascist regime is because it retains  the NSL. It is precisely because of the NSL that various  channels of dialogue and exchange between the North and the  South in the past have failed to make any progress and that  numerous South Korean people who had advocated the country's  reunification and who had visited the North were imprisoned.    This notwithstanding, the Kim Yong-sam ring has not only  been  brutally suppressing the South Korean people's just struggle for  independence, democracy, and reunification with the NSL, but is  also clamoring that it is impossible to abolish the NSL and the  like today, at a time when the issue of abolishing the law has  become an issue. The Kim Yong-sam ring's opposition to the  abolition of the NSL proceeds from its wicked intention to  suppress the South Korean people's just struggle with the law  and to block the country's peace and its peaceful reunification.  It also more clearly reveals that the rascals' clamor about a  civilian-led government and the like is an out-and-out lie and  that the rascals are fascist tyrants and national traitors who  are dashing toward fascism, division, and confrontation.    The Kim Yong-sam ring is trying to maintain the dirty  remainder of its life on a road of fascism and confrontation.  This, however, is a gross miscalculation. The road of fascist  suppression and confrontation will further incite the popular  masses' resistance and will only expedite the Kim Yong-sam  ring's ruin. The Kim Yong-sam ring should look straight at the  trend of the times and abolish, without delay, the NSL, an  antireunification and fascist evil law.</p>

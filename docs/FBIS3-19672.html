			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Maris Budovski, president of the Assembly of </F> Baltic Countries, by Christophe De Fossa in the Hague; date not  given: "Baltic Countries Appeal to Benelux Countries"--first  paragraph is LA LIBRE BELGIQUE introduction]    [Text] A delegation from the Assembly of Baltic Countries  attended the Benelux Interparliamentary Council session held on  Friday [18 March] and Saturday in The Hague. There we met with  Maris Budovski, who is the president of the Assembly of Baltic  Countries.    [De Fossa] How long has there been cooperation between the  assemblies of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania?    [Budovski] The Assembly of Baltic Countries as such only  dates back to 1990, but our cooperation is much older than that.  In 1919, the united military forces of Estonia and Latvia  fought the Red Army. Subsequently, there was cooperation  between the foreign ministers of the three states. However, I  would like to point out that, while we were able to resist  Soviet totalitarianism, it was mainly because of our traditions,  our folklore. This may be a unique phenomenon. The dance and  singing festivals have brought together, and continue to  regularly bring together, tens of thousands of participants from  our three countries. This has contributed toward binding us  together; it is something that could perhaps be called the  "singing revolution."  <H5>  A Council of Ministers for the Baltic States? </H5>   [De Fossa] Is there cooperation between your governments?    [Budovski] The ministers cooperate with their counterparts  in  the other Baltic states. This is especially true today with the  defense ministers. During the session held in Tallin late last  year, the Assembly of Baltic Countries adopted a resolution  calling on the governments of the three Baltic states to set up  a Council of Ministers for the Baltic States. We also organized  joint maneuvers. Of course, we only have very limited military  resources, but in doing so we wanted to express our wish not to  see a repeat of what happened in 1940.    [De Fossa] What are you expecting from the Benelux?    [Budovski] We are looking for cooperation because we have  common interests. I am thinking, for example, of cooperation in  terms of harbor facilities. We have excellent harbors, which  are very well equipped. So do the Benelux countries. Why do we  not organize a union at this level, given the importance of the  East European market and the fact that the gauge of our  railroads is the same as that used in the Benelux countries?    [De Fossa] You have already established close relations with  the Nordic countries.    [Budovski] Yes, these are very warm relations. We have a sea  in common, the Baltic. In 1992, together with the Council of  Nordic Countries, we concluded an agreement which is helping us  resolve very specific problems.    In the energy sector, Russia often demands prices which are  higher than the market prices. Consequently, we are turning  toward the free market and we are thinking that as far as energy  is concerned, we will undoubtedly find a solution in Norway.    [De Fossa] Why are there still Russian troops in Estonia and  Latvia?    [Budovski] The Russians do not want to answer that question.    [De Fossa] How many are there?    [Budovski] There are still 2,500 Russian troops in Estonia  and some 11,000 in Latvia. Sometimes the Russians say that this  presence guarantees Russia's security, and sometimes they put  forward the argument of the cost of social support measures in  the event that these troops are repatriated. Another argument  they use is that their presence is supposedly required to defend  the rights of the Russian minority in Latvia. In fact, many  Russians themselves are wondering why they are still in our  country. Yet Russia cannot manage to renounce its imperialism.  The Russians feel that they have been invested with a mission  vis-a-vis us: They think they have to save us!    There is a preliminary agreement concerning the withdrawal  of  Russian troops from Latvia. However, one part of Latvian public  opinion feels that the signing of an agreement is not necessary  given the fact that the presence of these troops is unlawful.  As for the Russians, they say that it is not their army, but  rather the army of the now defunct Soviet Union which is  responsible for the occupation! In fact, we were colonized.  They wanted to eliminate us, and that was the doing of officers  who are now retired and still living in the Baltic countries.    [De Fossa] So for you the war is just now ending.    [Budovski] For us, in fact, the war has not yet ended  because  there are still foreign troops on our soil.</p>

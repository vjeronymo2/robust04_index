			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Eurofighter costs attacked Germany's auditing office has criticised the mounting costs of the European fighter aircraft, a joint project by Germany, Britain, Spain and Italy, according to a leaked report obtained by the DPA newsagency. The third internal report by the office to the finance committee of the lower house of parliament compares the quality of the Eurofighter to the capability and efficiency of Russian MiG 29s. It coincides with a continuing dispute between Germany's politicians and industrialists about how to finance the project which is already behind schedule. Deutsche Aerospace, the German industrial partner in the project is seeking an extra DM1.2bn (Pounds 495m) from public funds, but the defence ministry is hesitant at providing extra financing. The project, which is expected to cost DM30bn, is running two years behind schedule. Britain and Italy expect to take delivery of the fighter aircraft in 2000, Spain in 2001 and Germany in 2002.</p>

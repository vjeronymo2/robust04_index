			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Survey of Sao Paulo (5): All the delights of the big city Sometimes dubbed 'South America's New York' because of its dynamism, skyscrapers and mix of cultures, Sao Paulo is a monster of a city. While its sheer size and confusing layout often overwhelm, an energetic and friendly population combine with a lively nightlife to compensate, writes Patrick McCurry. There are nearly 10m people in the city and about 15m in the metropolitan region, making it one of the biggest cities in the world. It is also one of the most cosmopolitan, thanks to the influx of millions of immigrants earlier this century. There are descendants of Italians, Portuguese, East Europeans, Arabs and Jews and the largest Japanese population outside Japan. Recent decades have seen a big inflow of Brazilians in search of work, either from the state's interior or often from the poor north-east. Many of these ended up swelling the favela shanty towns dotted around the city. Orientation is a problem, both for newcomers and Paulistanos, as the city's inhabitants are known. Because of its rapid and unplanned growth, the lack of natural landmarks and a confusing road system, even locals get lost. Fortunately for foreigners there are plenty of taxis at all times of day. In addition, work and social life is often concentrated in relatively few areas. These include Avenida Paulista, which is the main financial centre, Jardins and Itaim Bibi. These are the districts where imported luxury cars are almost as common as locally made Fiat Unos and VW Golfs and where the flats are protected by 24-hour security guards. Some visitors find these areas a bit characterless but they are a symbol of Paulistanos' American-style obsession with modernity. Because the city grew so quickly during the state's post-war industrialisation old buildings, including the mansions of coffee barons, were torn down to make way for office and apartment blocks. Today, blocks of flats built in the 1950s are considered historic. The city's old centre, known as 'centro', gradually lost importance in the 1960s and 1970s as businesses moved out to areas like Paulista and later to suburbs like Santo Amaro in the south. Today the centre retains its character and liveliness but is avoided by many middle-class residents because of parking problems and worries about crime. Many Paulistanos like to contrast Sao Paulo with its rival Rio de Janeiro. Unlike Rio, they say, Sao Paulo is a 'serious' city where hard work is rewarded. Cariocas, as Rio residents are known, dismiss Paulistanos as uptight workaholics too busy to enjoy the simple pleasures of life. Nevertheless, foreign visitors frequently find that Paulistanos, like most Brazilians, are genuinely friendly and helpful. In many ways Sao Paulo is trying to be an American city, or at least that seems to be the aspiration of many middle- class Paulistanos. A frequently unsatisfactory public transport system, worries about crime and the city's size have created a strong car culture. For example, instead of taking a taxi or public transport many wealthy (and not-so-wealthy) Paulistanos would rather drive to the busy Rua Franz Schubert, a chic back street housing some of the most ritzy night spots, and queue for 45 minutes to park. When they leave, they will wait another 45 minutes while the parking valet finds and recovers their car. Likewise, a popular evening out for middle-class families and adolescents is to drive to one of the city's shopping malls to eat, window shop, go to the cinema or just hang out. For many living in the enormous industrial suburbs outside the wealthy pockets of the city and for the million or so favela residents, however, entertainment is more likely to be centred on the local bar. Going out is one of the city's big attractions. Sao Paulo has a wide variety of restaurants thanks to its history of immigration, notably in the Japanese district of Liberdade and the nearby Italian neighbourhood of Bixiga. Paulistanos like to socialise late, often eating at 10pm, and then frequently carry on to a bar or jazz club until the early hours of the morning. The city is a leading South American centre for theatre, concerts and exhibitions. Many of Brazil's outstanding musicians regularly perform in Sao Paulo while international performers and orchestras put on shows at the city's opera house, the Olympia venue or open air concerts in Ibirapuera park. Top class football is another of Sao Paulo's leisure attractions. Despite losing many of their world cup stars to European teams, Sao Paulo FC, Palmeiras and Corinthians football clubs put on some of the best footballing shows in the world at city stadiums Morumbi and Pacaembu. To escape the pollution and stress of the city, residents need no encouragement to head for the coast, about two hours away. The main resorts are Guaruja, Ubatuba and Ilhabela. These are packed in the summer months, particularly at new year and Carnival. In the winter, many make tracks for the weekend retreat of Campos do Jordao in the mountains three hours away from the city. Useful telephone numbers: City code is 011. UK consulate: 287 7722.

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Prescott says Labour must focus on redistribution of work as well as wealth The Labour party will have to focus on redistribution of work as much as redistribution of wealth, Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, said yesterday, David Goodhart and Robert Taylor write. Mr Prescott said the market was distributing work unsatisfactorily between the employed and the unemployed and between full-time and part-time workers. In recent years 3m full-time jobs had been replaced by 1.5m part-time and 1.5m self-employed. Since taking over as Labour employment spokesman after the party conference last year, Mr Prescott has had a relatively low profile on labour market issues - with the exception of harrying the government on the issue of unemployment statistics. However, new thinking on the subject will come with the publication of the party's response to the European Commission's green paper on social policy published at the end of last year. The response, under the title Jobs and Social Justice, is likely to further Mr Prescott's reputation as a moderniser in traditionalist clothing. The Labour document is likely to concentrate on establishing new links between employment and social security to take account of changes in working and family lives. Mr Prescott says new thinking on the Continent is coming from 'the Keyneses and Beveridges of our time'.</p>

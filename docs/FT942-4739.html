			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Amersham shows 65% growth to Pounds 43.5m Solid underlying business growth, exchange rate movements and a US acquisition helped Amersham International, the health science group, increase pre-tax profit by 65 per cent from Pounds 26.3m to Pounds 43.5m in the year to March 31. Turnover increased by 20 per cent to Pounds 324.2m (Pounds 269.3m). This reflected a Pounds 30.7m first time contribution from US Biochemical acquired last April, offset by a Pounds 23.8m reduction in turnover from the Clinical Reagents business transferred to Eastman Kodak. Earnings per share, reflecting the 4.9m shares issued to acquire USB, grew by 55 per cent to 47p, up from 30.4p the previous year. A recommended final dividend of 11.1p (9.5p) makes a total for the year of 15.5p, up 15 per cent. The shares closed 33p higher at 971p. Trading profits increased by 54 per cent to Pounds 63.4m (Pounds 41.1m), with USB accounting for Pounds 4.9m of the increase. Underlying turnover and trading profits both increased by 10 per cent. After a 26 per cent increase in research and development spending of Pounds 20.1m (Pounds 15.9m), operating profits were 72 per cent higher at Pounds 43.3m (Pounds 25.2m), including a Pounds 3.1m contribution from USB and a net Pounds 13.2m year-on-year gain from exchange rate movements. Underlying operating profit growth at constant exchange rates was 7 per cent. Life sciences, the largest division, which sells reagents to medical and pharmaceutical research establishments and now includes USB, returned to real profit growth. It generated operating profits of Pounds 31.2m (Pounds 19.1m) on turnover 49 per cent higher at Pounds 147.6m. The healthcare division boosted turnover by 26 per cent to Pounds 119.3m and more than doubled operating profits to Pounds 9.4m (Pounds 3.9m.) The group's share of associated undertakings increased to Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 200,000). Net interest costs of Pounds 400,000 compared with net receipts of Pounds 900,000. Despite spending Pounds 10.6m in cash on the USB acquisition the group ended March with net cash of Pounds 7.7m compared with Pounds 2.6m a year earlier. COMMENT Amersham's performance, and its management which has rejuvenated the business, continues to impress. The underlying profit growth remains solid and last year's exchange rate gains helped fund the substantial increase in R&amp;D spend and new branded product launches which will fuel its future. performance. Much more modest currency gains are expected this year but pre-tax profits of Pounds 51m look possible, producing earnings of about 55p a share. The stock is trading on a forward multiple of 17.6, but could still go higher. In the meantime dividend cover has been restored to three times, and future dividend growth should be more in line with earnings.</p>

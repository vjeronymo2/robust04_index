			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar continues recovery THE DOLLAR continued to recover against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday as dealers dismissed the possibility of an imminent cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, writes James Blitz. The Fed's decision on Wednesday night not to signal a cut in the Fed Funds rate continued to strengthen dollar bulls. So, too, did the decision by the Bundesbank's council meeting yesterday not to lift German rates, thus avoiding a widening of the already large differential between the two countries' rates. Another boost to the dollar came from a report in the Asian Wall Street Journal, which suggested that the Fed had ended the bias towards easing held in its directives since last August. One London-based analyst said it was hard to believe that any member of the Federal Open Markets Committee would leak such information to the press, but admitted that the net result of the story was to strengthen the dollar. Compounding all this was the weekly US unemployment claims figure, which was down 18,000 on the week at 406,000. As a result the US currency ended more than a pfennig up in London at DM1.6140, after a previous close of DM1.6020. Against the yen, the dollar finished at Y130.20, after ending at Y129.65 the night before. In New York the US unit rose further to DM1.6167 and Y130.29. Although it had appreciated in overnight trading, sterling slipped in European dealings yesterday as traders suspected that the Bank of England had shown a more accommodative stance in its money market operations. Treasury and Bank of England officials have repeatedly stressed that a near-term rate reduction is unlikely. But the market seems to have reacted bearishly to the Bank's decision to take out a Pounds 1.3bn shortage early in its operations. The pound finished the day unchanged at DM2.9325. The Italian lira slipped towards the floor of the European exchange rate mechanism's currency grid as operators fretted about Italy's seemingly endless rounds of voting for a new president. The political instability has increased concern that action will not be taken to tackle a huge budget deficit. The lira fell one place to second from bottom of the EMS grid. The D-Mark ended at L753.30, up from L752.50. An analyst suggested yesterday that the market's uncertainty about the lira may be exacerbated by nervousness about the Danish referendum on European Monetary Union, which is due on June 2. The analyst said some dealers fear that if the Danes decide not to join the EMU, the whole project will start to fall apart, adding to uncertainty in the European Monetary System.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: BUENA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS HONOR STAFF  </P> <P> The tables were turned Wednesday morning at Buena High School in Ventura as  members of the student body served up breakfast and awards to the school staff  during the annual Staff Appreciation Breakfast.  </P> <P> Nearly 100 school employees from custodian to principal shuffled through the  line in the school cafeteria, waiting for students to dish up scrambled eggs  and ham.  </P> <P> The students handed out awards to various teachers, and named English and  journalism teacher Robert Pease teacher of the year. Pease also coaches the  school's team for the Knowledge Bowl, an annual academic competition among  county high schools.  </P> <P> The breakfast is an end-of-the-year tradition, said Diane Harriman, English  teacher and director of student activities. "We have such a great staff, and  they are generally supportive of student activities," she said. "And this bunch  of kids is so neat."  </P> <P> Student body President Jon Kirby, 17, said the breakfast is a way for students  to show appreciation to teachers and staff.  </P> <P> "It's neat because they don't often get honored," he said. "They're more than  just teachers; they're educators and friends. They don't just come to work and  then go home, and they don't get paid outstanding amounts of money to do this."  </P> <P> The students organized the event, arriving at school early to prepare the food  and decorate the cafeteria.  </P> <P> "I feel lucky this is my home school," Assistant Principal Judy Bysshe said.  "Throughout the year they are tremendous kids." KAREN McKEAN  </P></p>

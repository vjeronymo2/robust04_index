			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Exports boost car output Car production rose 7.8 per cent in September to 125,138, the highest level for the month for 21 years, as output was boosted by higher exports. Production for export rose by 17.9 per cent year-on-year to 55,136, while output for the domestic market rose only 1.1 per cent to 70,002. Car production in the first nine months of the year has risen 3 per cent to 1,075,001, but the rate of increase has accelerated during the past four months in spite of the marked slow-down in the growth of new car sales in the domestic market. Export production in the first nine months has risen 6.1 per cent to 418,134, while output for the home market rose 1.1 per cent to 656,867. Export growth has come from Rover as well as from Honda and Toyota, which are both developing new car plants in the UK with about three-quarters of production earmarked for export. Rover announced earlier this week that it was planning to create 1,450 new jobs at its UK plants during the next six months in order to raise output to meet increasing sales, in particular in export markets. Production of commercial vehicles in September rose 15 per cent year-on-year to 20,763. Commercial vehicle output has risen 16.6 per cent to 165,150 in the first nine months, halting the almost continuous decline since the end of the 1960s.</p>

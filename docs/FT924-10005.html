			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Clarke pledge on war refugees NO REFUGEES from the former states of Yugoslavia refused political asylum in Britain would be returned to war zones, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, assured the Commons last night, Ivor Owen writes. He said the government was considering what assistance it could provide to local authorities around London airport and other points of entry whose resources were under strain through having to accommodate large numbers who had fled from Bosnia and other areas. Mr Clarke faced a barrage of protests from Labour MPs when he sought to justify the new powers being sought by the government to secure the speedier removal from Britain of bogus applicants for political asylum. He also came under attack over the provisions in the Asylum and Immigration Appeals bill removing the current right of appeal available to relatives of British residents refused entry into Britain for visits of up to six months' duration. Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, said the bill was 'profoundly flawed' in spite of improvements made since an earlier version was jettisoned to make way for last April's general election. Mr Clarke accused Mr Blair of acting like a 'barrack-room lawyer' in a series of clashes over the implications of a provision designed to limit to 48 hours the time available for appeals by those whose applications for political asylum had been ruled to be unfounded by immigration officials at the ports.</p>

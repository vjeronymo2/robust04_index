			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Sun Zhonglian (1327 0022 6647): </F> "Shanghai Property Rights Exchange Operation Next Month"]    [Text] Established by the 1994 No 1 approval document of  the Shanghai People's government, the Shanghai Urban and Rural  Property Rights Exchange Office will officially go into  operation at the beginning of April. The Chairman of the  Exchange Office Gong Jiemin [7895 0094 3046] told me days  earlier that over 100 medium and small scale enterprises, having  an average capital value of 2.8 million yuan, had applied to  enter the exchange market. From these, the Exchange Office has  selected 30 enterprises having good efficiency to be the first  group of enterprises on the market.    Enterprise property exchange is the inevitable outcome of  developing a socialist market economy. Compensated property  transferral is useful to setting the parameters of enterprises'  property rights, and smoothing enterprise property rights  relationships to preserve or add value to state-owned or  collective assets; it is favorable to straightening out the  assets of current enterprises, and especially straightening out  the assets of enterprises with low profitability and suffering  losses, to realize a reasonable asset flow. The establishment  and operation of the Shanghai Urban and Rural Property Rights  Exchange Office demonstrates that Shanghai has once again take a  new step towards establishing the new socialist market economy.    Because exchange of enterprise property on the market is  still in the explorational stage in China, Shanghai has chosen  to take the easy steps first, and defer the difficult for later,  then progressively expand the process, starting with collective  enterprises. The newly established Shanghai Urban and Rural  Property Rights Exchange Office is under the charge of the  Agriculture Commission, the Municipal Office of System Reform,  the Municipal Bureau of Commerce and Industry, the Municipal,  Suburban, and County Industrial Bureau, and the Municipal Land  Bureau, all members of the Administrative Commission. The  property exchange office will adopt the membership system to  absorb a group of financial and investment organs, large scale  enterprise groups, and foreign capital organs as members of the  operation (brokers). These are specialists in acting as exchange  agents, and self-operated businesses and enterprises on the  market can entrust brokers to conduct exchanges. What is  different from other exchange offices is that in property  exchanges, the exchange involves not only material objects of  assets, but invisible assets as well. The process will consist  of registration and application, making public notice of their  going into the market, negotiation and inquiry, striking a deal  via computer, signing the contract, revising the registration  procedure, etc. It is stronger technologically, with more  widespread involvement. By gathering opinions widely, and making  multiple revisions, the property exchange office has formulated  seven regulatory documents, including the rules of the office,  temporary administrative measures for members, etc. From now on,  enterprises must go to the property rights exchange office for  public transfer of property rights, while the assets evaluation  department conducts an evaluation of the enterprise assets, and  make it known publicly. Through negotiations and inquiry, all  parties on the accepting side will offer bids by computers, and  the party offering the higher price will be favored in obtaining  the exchange. The exchange office and the brokers will supply  supporting "integrated" services for property rights exchanges  for enterprises.    At present, all preparation work prior to the Shanghai Urban  and Rural Property Rights Exchange Office going into operation  has been completed. Staff who have had primary business training  and the first group of brokers are in position, the exchange  computer system is installed with debugging fully under way, the  property exchange information network has been primarily  established, composed of Shanghai information transmission  organs, each province's asset administration organs, Shanghai's  overseas organs, etc. Review and verification has also been  completed for the first group of 30 enterprises in the market.</p>

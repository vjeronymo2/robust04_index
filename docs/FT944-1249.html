			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Lessons of high volatility in the bond markets This has been a dreadful year for bond markets around the world. But the past few months have brought modest signs of stability, if not recovery. A year ago in this space I celebrated the wonderful performance of UK gilts in 1993 as long yields sank to 6.5 per cent. It was a bonanza that was unrepeatable in the circumstances of a vigorous economic recovery, I concluded. But I should have been more cautious. The boom in bonds was abruptly reversed as long gilt yields soared up again, briefly touching the 9 per cent level in September. The overall 200 basis point rise in UK bond yields during 1994 has split two ways. Half represents a rise in real yields, as demonstrated by index-linked gilts, and this is attributable to stronger economic growth. The other half can be blamed on implied expectations of higher future inflation, although this is controversial, and it can also be argued that there have been changes in risk premiums. Certainly these adjustments appear to be primarily global rather than national. US Treasury bond yields are about 250 basis points higher than a year ago, and rises elsewhere have been 200 basis points in Germany and 150 basis points in Japan. The scale of portfolio damage has depended upon the duration of the bonds and on the currencies involved. The negative return on the old US Treasury 30-year bond has been 11 per cent so far this year, although the JP Morgan US government bond index is only showing about minus 3 per cent. Damage has been pronounced in a strong currency - the unhedged return on US Treasuries for the Swiss investor was minus 18 per cent at its worst in October. Long-dated Japanese yen bonds were dangerous to hold because the proportional rise in yields was especially high, from a starting-point of only 3.1 per cent. Yet the JP Morgan global government bond index is showing a narrowly positive 1 per cent return to the dollar-based investor this year. The severity of the early 1993 shake-out reflected the forced unwinding of huge speculative positions by hedge funds, banks and securities firms as stop-loss limits were triggered. Trillions were punted on yield curve strategies, and seemingly brilliant professional slicers and hedgers of global market risks have, after hasty visits to their lawyers, emerged reinvented as naive amateur punters exploited by hustling derivatives salesmen. The eventual consequences of this volatility have yet to be worked out. The Bank of England has swallowed the argument that encouraging an active sale and repurchase, or 'repo', market will increase liquidity and reduce the cost of borrowing. However, David Shaw of Legal &amp; General in London has calculated that on a particular definition - the percentage change during six months in the FT Government Securities Price Index - the early 1994 bear market in gilts was the most severe since the tumble, during freak economic conditions, in 1974. His conclusion is that the arrival of aggressive new bond market players, overwhelming traditional long-term institutional investors, has raised volatility. The risk premium on bonds over cash has therefore increased (and the risk premium on equities against bonds has fallen). Finance ministries might think about the implications. Another factor has triggered high volatility, however - the growing role of cross-border investors vulnerable to exchange rate risks. US Treasury bond yields have had to rise a very long way this year because Japanese institutions are refusing to plug the global financing gaps they filled in the 1980s. Mr William Sterling of Merrill Lynch in New York points out that the total US external financing requirement ran at some Dollars 150bn (Pounds 91.4bn) a year in the late 1980s, dipped briefly, but for the past two years has jumped to Dollars 280bn annually. If the US is to cover a large part of this deficit by selling financial assets to foreigners, the assets will have to look much more keenly priced. In 1994, certainly, dollar bonds have become cheaper, and have dragged down bond prices everywhere.</p>

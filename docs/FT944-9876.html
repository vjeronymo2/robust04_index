			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Call for Budget boost to skills training The government should take steps in the Budget to encourage skills training if the manufacturing revival is to be sustained. Economists from Lloyds Bank argue in their latest monthly bulletin that low skills levels are 'probably the single greatest threat to the improved condition of UK manufacturing'. Manufacturing output has been rising for more than two years, and is now growing at nearly 4 per cent per year. The bulletin says this reflects the changing nature of the economic recovery, with investments and exports providing more impetus for growth. It predicts that manufacturing output as a whole should accelerate into 1995. In the bulletin Mr Sheldon Warton-Woods and Mr Patrick Moon cite these growth rates as evidence that the long-term decline in manufacturing has bottomed out. The past 25 years have seen manufacturing's share of GDP decline from around a third to close to a fifth. They attribute this turnaround to improved price competitiveness, better-quality goods and foreign direct investment increasing the export bias of the economy. Although the UK made significant productivity improvements in manufacturing during the 1980s, the authors warn that it needs to invest in high-technology capital equipment, and in the education and training to use this investment, if it is to avoid becoming a low-wage, mass-producer economy. The bulletin notes a deficiency in both education and training levels. It cites OECD data showing that the percentage of people aged 17 to 22 in full-time education and training in the UK is 'far less' than in almost every other industrialised country.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Albert Musin report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric: </F> "Uzbekistan"]    [Excerpts] In the two days of its deliberations, the  Supreme Soviet session has considered over 40 matters, including  20 draft laws. [passage omitted]    As key news agencies have already reported, President  Karimov  vehemently opposed the introduction of dual citizenship in  Uzbekistan, citing the need to make sure that all Uzbekistan  citizens retain "the feeling of patriotism." Karimov suggested  that Russia "not interfere in Uzbekistan's internal affairs."  Undoubtedly, what he meant by this was Andrey Kozyrev's trip to  Tashkent in November, when the Russian Foreign Ministry chief  raised the question of ethnic Russians' assuming dual  citizenship as a measure designed to prevent their mass  migration from Uzbekistan.    Even before starting official talks with Kozyrev, the  Uzbekistan president took the Russian ambassador to Tashkent to  task in front of journalists, saying that he "will have to  answer" for "raising the specious problem of the  Russian-speaking population in Uzbekistan." Later, the  journalists who rushed to the Russian Embassy saw a line of 700  people craving to obtain Russian citizenship and leave  Uzbekistan...    Also on the agenda were matters of the state budget and the  socioeconomic situation in Uzbekistan, although they were barely  touched.</p>

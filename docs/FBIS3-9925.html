			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 25 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan  President Ramiro de Leon Carpio and the Armed Forces recently  managed to control an alleged plot planned by soldiers and  civilians to force the head of state's resignation, the magazine  CRONICA reported today.    According to CRONICA, which cited military sources, Fernando  Andrade, former foreign minister during the military government  headed by Oscar Mejia (1983-86) was the one who tried to force  the president's resignation so that Vice President Arturo  Herbruger, for whom he worked as adviser until a few days ago,  could assume the post. The report added that Andrade's  intention was promoting Herbruger's enthronement and then having  Congress declare him incapacitated in order to leave the  Presidency vacant.    According to the sources, members of the Armed Forces knew  about the alleged plot since October. The report added that  Andrade contacted General Jose Luis Quilo Ayuso, who was removed  from his post as national defense chief of staff on 18 February;  former President Vinicio Cerezo (1986-91); and Central American  Parliament Deputy Danilo Roca, the lawyer who represents the  soldiers who tried to overthrow Cerezo.    Military Intelligence learned about the plan, as well as  Israeli and U.S. diplomats, who alerted President De Leon of a  possible attack against him.    Nevertheless, Andrade, former foreign minister (1983-86) and  former ambassador to the OAS and the United Nations, today  denied any participation in the alleged plot, stating that he  presented his resignation to Herbruger in December, but it was  not accepted until February. "I find those rumors very funny,"  Andrade said, dismissing the possibility that his resignation  was due to his presumed implication in the plot.    Roca, a member of the Union of the National Center (UCN),  also denied the allegations, saying that "the soldiers I  represent were discharged." "Should I get involved in something  like this, you will see me at the National Palace, and not  talking about an aborted coup," Roca stressed.    Meanwhile, during a ceremony also attended by President De  Leon, Gen. Quilo Ayuso today denied any links to any  "conspiracy" as "some people are cynically saying." With regard  to rumors about coups d'etat, President De Leon has constantly  said that they are "just rumors," and that the changes he made  in the Army on 18 February had nothing to do with presumed  movements of that nature. "It is said that some people with  coupist intentions have participated in those activities and  that there have been meetings among them, but there is no  evidence," President De Leon said.</p>

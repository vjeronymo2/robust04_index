			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Argentina anticipates further strong growth EVERYTHING seems to be going right for Argentina. The economy is booming, inflation is at a record low and the political scene is stable, after the ruling Peronist party swept to its fourth consecutive electoral victory in congressional elections on October 3. The gods are even smiling on President Carlos Menem, whose very name superstitious Argentines once considered unlucky. He emerged unscathed from a helicopter crash earlier this month and is now recovering rapidly from emergency surgery last week. The stock market is storming ahead in a bull run that has driven prices up by a quarter this year. Although this compares poorly with developed country markets, much of the advance came during the last two months, with the Merval market index rising 13 per cent since mid-August. Prices dipped suddenly last Thursday on the news that Mr Menem was undergoing surgery. The news broke just before the Buenos Aires market closed, but was enough to depress prices in New York. However, the market bounced back when it became clear that he was out of danger. But New York's reaction showed that investor confidence in Argentina still depends on two men: Mr Menem and Mr Domingo Cavallo, his economy minister. Foreign investors' views are more important than ever. It is international liquidity that is driving the market forward, not local factors. If capital inflows were to dry up, the market would go into reverse. Corporate results are mediocre given that the economy is growing by 6 per cent, after expanding by 9 per cent in 1992. Ambito Financiero, a local business newspaper, commented this week that profits at the biggest listed companies rose only 7.5 per cent in the second quarter. Luckily, overseas investors - mostly US and London-based emerging market fund managers - are looking further ahead. Many expect strong growth to continue in Argentina for some time. Mr Steve Darch, managing director at Banco Mariva, a Buenos Aires merchant bank, said investors 'are buying where there is growth potential and the potential is absolutely phenomenal. Look at a difficult industry like steel, which had to go through a restructuring process: if you think the economy will continue growing, even a non-sexy industry like steel will grow too'. Sectors attracting greatest investor interest are energy, telecommunications, food, construction and banking. YPF, Argentina's biggest company, offers exposure both to the oil industry and Argentina. Those who bought when it was floated in June have been handsomely rewarded with a 47 per cent rise to Dollars 28 yesterday. Investors are also encouraged by a decision at many companies to start paying cash dividends. This marks an important cultural change. The market expects companies to provide consistent earnings as well as opportunities for specula-tive capital gains. Capital-hungry companies are finding they can no longer ignore minority shareholders. But perhaps the most important event of the past month was congressional approval of a private pension fund system. Pension funds are unlikely to have an immediate impact. But with time they should broaden Argentina's narrow and volatile market and reduce its dangerous reliance on foreign capital.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Dollar terms                      No. of       Oct 15     % Change      % Change Market               Stocks         1993     over week     on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Argentina            (11)         813.95       +5.1         +40.3 Brazil               (44)         244.46       +3.6         +95.6 Chile                (20)         463.23       +0.8         +10.7 Colombia*             (8)         522.38       +3.3         +22.9 Mexico               (58)         750.90       +5.6         +11.1 Peru**                (7)         117.28       +5.2         +17.3 Venezuela***          (8)         625.39      +14.0         +20.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- East Asia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Korea****     (130)          99.41       +2.7          +1.3 Philippines          (11)         211.97       +9.0         +58.7 Taiwan, China*****   (76)          83.54       +5.8         +13.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Asia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- India******          (61)          92.18       +1.9          -1.6 Indonesia*******     (31)          95.88       +3.6         +63.4 Malaysia             (61)         264.64       +2.4         +61.8 Pakistan********      (8)         236.29       +0.9         +18.0 Sri Lanka*********    (5)         133.29       +1.9         +33.3 Thailand             (52)         331.60       +5.0         +43.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Euro/Mid East  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Greece               (17)         237.59       +1.4         +21.7 Jordan                (5)         173.89       +1.8         +48.8 Portugal             (16)         110.96       +1.8         +43.8 Turkey**********     (31)         182.33       -0.6        +172.7  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    Local currency terms                            Oct 15     % Change        % Change Market                       1993     over week      on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Argentina              499,458.35       +5.1            +40.6 Brazil              49,718,757.93       +3.6         +2,284.1 Chile                      766.06       +0.8            +19.5 Colombia*                  750.75       +3.2            +22.8 Mexico                   1,007.77       +5.5            +11.0 Peru**                     152.43       +4.6            +52.4 Venezuela***             1,403.32      +12.8            +50.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- East Asia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Korea****            105.89       +2.6             +4.1 Philippines                297.48      +13.5            +84.0 Taiwan, China*****          83.77       +4.7            +19.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Asia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- India******                101.94       +1.9             +6.8 Indonesia*******           109.53       +3.6            +66.5 Malaysia                   248.36       +2.6            +57.4 Pakistan********           320.85       +1.3            +38.4 Sri Lanka*********         142.24       +1.7            +42.2 Thailand                   331.54       +4.7            +42.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Euro/Mid East  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Greece                     379.90       +2.6            +33.4 Jordan                     246.38       +1.5            +48.8 Portugal                   127.79       +2.9            +63.9 Turkey**********         1,059.57       -1.1           +295.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Britain's opposition Labor Party pulled well ahead of Prime Minister Margaret  Thatcher's Conservatives in opinion polls published in London. Newspaper  surveys showed Labor, often divided and demoralized during a decade in  opposition, between 5 and 12 percentage points ahead of the Conservatives.  Labor leader Neil Kinnock hopes to rally his party for a general election due  by mid-1992 with an address Tuesday at the party's annual conference in  Brighton. A poll by the Mail newspaper gave Labor 46% support to 34% for the  Conservatives. A Sunday Times poll showed Labor with 43% support, 5 percentage  points ahead of the Conservatives.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the Committee on </F> Economic Policy of the State Duma, by DELOVOY MIR correspondent  Timur Grigoryanets under the rubric "Viewpoint"; place and date  not given: "The Time Has Come To Swallow Our Pride"]    [Text] Not so long ago a group of young politicians and  scholars made a statement about the creation of the Russian  patriotic movement People's Alliance, which analysts thought had  a great future.    The authors of the document call for unification in order to  save the self-respect of Russia and Russians, in order to prove  that the ideas of patriotism and democracy are inseparable, in  order through common efforts to prevent the final collapse of  the state, the degradation of the economy, and the return to  authoritarianism.    "We consider it a primary task to form a policy and strategy  of national reconciliation...we are convinced that the key to  national reconciliation could be the idea of citizenship, the  idea of the good of our common and unified state. The time has  come to swallow our pride and our claims to the only and always  correct truth."    The majority of the initiators of the creation of the new  social movement are members of parliament of the preceding and  present convocations and are, as they say, politicians of the  "third wave." For them, who already have post-perestroyka  political experience, the primacy of the law over personal and  group ambitions is the basic moral principle for their activity.    The authors of the statement have appealed to their allies  and sympathizers in the capital and in the regions, where they  are now forming local People's Alliance structures: "We are  asking everyone who cares about the fate of Russia to support  our initiative."    The statement was signed by the following: S. Glazyev, A.  Golovin, V. Yermakov, A. Krasnov, V. Menshov, V. Mironenko, I.  Muravyev, D. Olyshanskiy, S. Polozkov, O. Rumyantsev, V.  Sokolov, A. Fedorov, A. Tsipko, A. Chilingarov, and others.    One of the document's authors is the chairman of the  Committee on Economic Policy of the State Duma, S.Yu. Glazyev.  He is 33 years old, he was born in Zaporozhye, he graduated from  Moscow State University in economics and then worked at the  Central Economics and Mathematical Institute of the Academy of  Science, he is a doctor of economic sciences, beginning in 1991  he worked in the government structures of Russia, and in  1992-1993 he was the minister of foreign economic relations.  Today S.Yu. Glazyev responds to questions from DELOVOY MIR  correspondent Timur Grigoryanets.    [Grigoryanets] Sergey Yuryevich, among the recent political  documents public attention has been drawn to the message from  the president to the Federal Assembly. I would like to know your  opinion of this document first of all.    [Glazyev] This message contains a description of the main  points of the state's economic and social policy for this year.  The Duma has attentively discussed the message and responded  positively to its main ideas.    This pertains above all to the idea of conducting a more  balanced and reasonable economic policy and the point that the  reforms must not be conducted to the detriment of the people or  be accompanied by their impoverishment. It is important that we  first formulate a provision on the social cost of the reforms  and devote a great deal of attention to questions of structural  policy and the need to retain our scientific-industrial  potential. That is, the Duma was pleasantly surprised by how  balanced, reasonable, and constructive the message was.    [Grigoryanets] Does this assessment apply also to the draft  budget submitted by the government recently for consideration in  the State Duma?    [Glazyev] Unfortunately, no. In general one gets the  impression that the people who prepared the budget did not read  the president's message. The budget is practically in no way  linked to the basic directions of the economic policy formulated  in the presidential document. After discussion in a work group  of the Committee on Economic Policy we came to the conclusion  that, in the first place, the macroeconomic prognosis on which  the construction of the budget is based is unreliable and, in  the second place, the goal of the economic policy contained in  the draft budget does not correspond to the goals formulated in  the president's message, with the exception, perhaps, of the  goal of reducing inflation to 7-8 percent by the end of the  year. But even today it is obvious that events in the economy  will not develop the way predicted in the budget, and if we  execute it we risk hyperinflation by the end of the year. This  will be a result of the sharp decline of production which,  according to our estimates, could reach 25-30 percent, and the  figures for the first quarter confirm this. This means that the  revenue part of the budget will not be fulfilled and there will  be more manipulations with sequestering of budget expenditures,  which will introduce even more chaos into the economy. As a  result, we will inevitably end up in a situation with a very  large budget deficit and, as a result, extremely high inflation  growing into hyperinflation. Nor does the budget fully  correspond to the program of the government itself. That is, the  president's message is like a thing unto itself, the government  program is a thing unto itself, and the budget message is some  kind of third reality which is poorly linked to the first two.  And that is not even to mention the fact that in reality  everything proceeds according to some fourth scenario.    If we turn to the structural part of the budget and analyze  the priorities found in it, we discover that of the several key  branches to be supported in the government program, namely food,  the fuel and energy complex, conversion, transportation, and the  social sphere, in reality it is proposed that real resources be  provided only for the agro-industrial and fuel-energy complexes.  Actually science-intensive industry, which is the basis and the  main reserve for reconstruction and economic growth throughout  the world, and in our country as well, could simply cease to  exist this year. We have already started to lose certain  promising technologies; as we were able to determine from the  results of parliamentary hearings two weeks ago, the list of  them amounts to several dozen. These are irreversible losses,  and yet many of these technologies could compose a basis for our  economic advancement. We must not console ourselves with  illusions--no boom in the raw materials sector of the economy  can bring the entire country out of the crisis. We need  modernization, renewal of fixed capital, we must realize the  great potential that is concentrated in science-intensive  industry. Unfortunately, the priorities designated by the  president in his message and the priorities actually reflected  in the structure of the budget do not correspond to one another.  To continue to follow this same track is not simply imprudent,  it would be insane.    [Grigoryanets] And what is your committee's verdict?    [Glazyev] The work group of the Committee on Economic Policy  is inclined to suggest that the government join forces in order  to develop a new budget that corresponds to the president's  message and reasonable economic policy aimed at solving the real  problems of overcoming the economic crisis.    [Grigoryanets] You and the experts have done a large amount  of work during the course of studying the government draft of  the budget. And what are your proposals in this connection?    [Glazyev] I think that today we have no other way out than  to  begin to develop a realistic economic program for this year and  future years. I would like to emphasize that it must be based on  a reliable economic prognosis. The estimate of the threat to our  economy, which has already entered into a process of  catastrophic destruction, must be realistic as well. We also  need a prognosis of structural changes and any valuation of the  reserves we have at our disposal. On this basis it would be  possible to clearly formulate realistic goals and means of  achieving them, to prepare the corresponding system of measures,  and to build the budget on this. I think that this work could be  done in a month. If we concentrate forces and work  together--both the Federal Assembly and the government. This is  our common cause, we together are responsible for the quality of  the policy that is conducted and for the results that are  achieved.    [Grigoryanets] What will it take to do this well-arranged  work quickly? After all, it is already April....    [Glazyev] Perhaps we do not have the political will to  recognize that the economic policy being conducted today is not  adequate to the real interests of the country in overcoming the  crisis and resuming the growth of national well-being. For our  part, we have already begun this work; the first meetings of the  group of experts took place last week.    [Grigoryanets] In what ways are you close and attracted to  the people with whom you presented the initiative to create a  new social movement?    [Glazyev] I have known them for a long time as responsible,  honest, and purposeful politicians for whom the good of the  country and national interests are the real meaning of political  work. I think that the initiators of this movement could create  the concentration of creative efforts, the impulse in the organs  of power and among influential sociopolitical movements,  especially in the regions, which could finally help society move  in the direction of emerging from the crisis. The group of  people who initiated the creation of People's Alliance includes  specialists in the area of social policy, in the area of  regional policy, local self-government, and many other key  areas. My role is to coordinate and organize the work on the  economic program questions, and we have already begun to do this.    [Grigoryanets] That is, you have decided to create your own  economic program?    [Glazyev] In our country we have now entered a situation  where it is time to ask ourselves the question: "If not we, then  who?" For three months we have been waiting for the program for  the government, we have been waiting for certain realistic  measures from the structures of executive power, we have given  suggestions, we have sent proposals, but no reasonable actions  are taking place, and we are rolling toward an abyss like  lunatics. In spite of the fact that we do not yet have  sufficient possibilities of forming a realistic policy, we think  that we must exert all efforts to introduce reasonable and  constructive principles into all spheres of life. And I think we  have sufficient intellectual resources and skilled personnel for  such an initiative to work.    [Grigoryanets] Do you think that we still have a chance of  bringing our economy and our country out of the process of  disintegration in a civilized way?    [Glazyev] I think we have that chance right now. For perhaps  the only positive result of recent months was that the majority  of our politicians and organizations represented in parliament  and the structures of executive power have recognized that we  are indeed entering a process of uncontrollable catastrophic  destruction of our economy and our society. And a reflection of  this understanding was the adoption of the Duma of the  "memorandum on accord" and then the president's initiative on  the preparation of the Agreement on the Achievement of Civil  Peace in Russia. Today we see a sincere desire on the part of  practically all factions in the State Duma and many workers of  systems of executive power to develop a policy that would be  acceptable to the people and would be realized to the good of  the country from the standpoint of overcoming the crisis,  restoring industrial growth, and restoring Russia's position as  a great scientific and industrial power. The process of  consultations, roundtables, exchange of opinions, and search for  agreement on the main directions of our socioeconomic policy  that has begun gives us a real chance of developing a program  that would receive broad support and around which all  constructive forces of society could rally. Today only the  government has in no way indicated its attitude toward  initiatives on agreement from the Federal Assembly and the  president, but I hope that our criticism of the budget message  and our proposals for improving it will evoke such an action.  Because we cannot but see that behind the wasteful consumption  and the flourishing of a limited number of firms and individual  branches, behind all this we cannot but see the colossal  impoverishment of the entire country.</p>

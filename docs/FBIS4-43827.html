			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "F.B.": "Military Programming Law Adopted -- </F> Mr. Leotard Declares France Cannot Be Exempted From Nuclear  Testing"]    [Excerpts] On Wednesday, 15 June, the Senate passed the  1995-2000 Military Programming Law submitted by Defense Minister  Francois Leotard. [passage omitted]    Several senators are worried about the nuclear deterrence  issue, which has been a subject of contention between the  president of the Republic and the government. Mr. de Villepin  expressed doubts as to the "realism of the determination to  implement" the nuclear program "without additional testing."  Mr. Leotard demonstrated complete agreement, indicating that  "test simulations will not be sufficient to exempt France from  actually performing additional testing." "Not a single  scientist or member of the scientific community ever told me  otherwise," he added.</p>

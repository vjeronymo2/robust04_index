			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Ciampi chooses a broad team: Italian ex-communists to work with Christian Democrats MR CARLO Azeglio Ciampi last night broke the post-war mould of Italian politics by including former communists and a member of the Green party in a government that also has Christian Democrats in its ranks. The 72-year-old premier-designate, who is also the governor of the Bank of Italy, is the first non-parliamentarian to head a government this century. He has spent two days trying to form a team to tackle electoral reform and manage the economy. His choice of a broadly-based team comes in response to the public's demand for an era of clean politics after more than a year of damaging revelations of corruption in the establishment. For the first time a premier-designate has invoked article 92 of the constitution which permits the formation of a government without direct consultation with the party leaders. Until now all post-war governments have been dictated by party leaders. This coalition has been closely co-ordinated with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and is expected to last as long as it is necessary to draw up legislation for electoral reform. The announcement was delayed for more than two hours by reservations from the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). Three members accepted positions as ministers - Mr Vincenzo Visco, a prominent economist as finance minister; Mr Augusto Barbera, a leading member of the referendum movement, who takes charge of parliamentary relations; and Mr Luigi Berlinguer as science minister. A member of the enlarged steering committee of the PDS, Mr Berlinguer is a cousin of the late Enrico Berlinguer, the Italian Communist party leader who died in 1984 after breaking his party's ideological isolation. The new minister is rector of the University of Siena, in Tuscany. But Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS leader, insisted the party would judge the government by its programme. These reservations reflected the strong internal divisions within the party over taking part in government after being in opposition as the Communist party since 1948. Among the other novelties is the presence of 38-year-old Mr Sandro Rutelli, who recently failed to become elected the Green mayor of Rome, as environment minister. Of the portfolios that remain unchanged, the Treasury minister stays in the hands of Mr Piero Barucci and the interior ministry continues to be headed by the Christian Democrat, Mr Nicola Mancino. The foreign ministry was given to the economist, Mr Nino Andreatta, who is the outgoing finance minister. Mr Ciampi had earlier failed to persuade Mr Giuliano Amato, the outgoing prime minister, to take the job. The new economic team includes Professor Luigi Spaventa, a former fellow of All Souls, Oxford, as budget minister. The cabinet, to be sworn in today, must now face the test of parliamentary approval. But the presence of three ministers of the PDS, Greens and Republicans ensures an ample parliamentary base beyond the outgoing four-party coalition. Andreotti signs up Bush adviser, Page 2</p>

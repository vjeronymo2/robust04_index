			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> "Bad Influence," a Rob Lowe movie currently being filmed in various locations  in Los Angeles, won't be allowed to shoot in the Glen-Donald co-op building on  West 9th Street near MacArthur Park if some of the residents have their way.  John Medford, one of about 70 residents of the building, said Monday he is  circulating a petition that seeks to reject the film crew's scheduled July  24-27 visit because of allegations that Lowe videotaped sexual incidents  involving a 16-year-old Atlanta girl. "Hollywood cannot use our building to  promote and sanction gross sexual immorality by filming ('Bad Influence') in  our building," says Medford's petition. Medford said Monday that he has 13  signatures on the petition so far and added that the issue will be raised  Friday at the monthly co-op meeting. Medford said that he would withdraw the  objection to the film if the producers fired Lowe and cut one scene from the  script that reportedly involves the videotaping of a sexual encounter.

			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE;  </P> <P> DORFMAN'S 'SCOOPS' OFTEN DON'T PAN OUT, BUT FEW DOUBT HIS INFLUENCE;  </P> <P> USA TODAY COLUMNIST DEFENDS HIS SOURCES AND SAYS HE CHECKS OUT TIPS THOROUGHLY.  </P> <P> Stock market investors who picked up a copy of USA Today on June 6 had a nice,  fat tip waiting for them. Paramount Communications, reported the newspaper's  financial columnist, Dan Dorfman, was "seriously weighing" a $175-a-share bid  for Time Inc.  </P> <P> Dorfman had the story down cold. Later that day Paramount announced a hostile  offer for Time, at precisely $175 a share.  </P> <P> Two weeks later Dorfman did it again, breaking the news that Paramount would  raise the ante on its stalled takeover to $200 a share.  </P> <P> "I had two great scoops," said Dorfman. "I live for that kind of thrill."  </P> <P> Dorfman, 57, may have bagged those two, but he isn't always so prescient. More  often than not, the tips and tidbits that he passes on in his USA Today column  and in his frequent appearances on CNN's "Moneyline" TV show never quite pan  out as reported.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Scuttlebutt' and 'Gossip'  </P> <P> Perhaps less remembered than his Time-Paramount scoops, for instance, was the  Dorfman-reported speculation that Marvin Davis was considering buying Warner  Communications, or columns that Donald J. Trump was thinking about taking over  Caesar's World, MCA Inc. and Gillette Co. So far, none of this has happened.  </P> <P> While those blind alleys were properly labeled "rumor," "gossip" or  "scuttlebutt" by Dorfman, his news stories don't carry such qualifiers -- and  can be just as speculative.  </P> <P> In September Dorfman's front-page article in USA Today's Money section had  raider Irwin L. Jacobs "seriously interested" in buying Greyhound Corp.; Jacobs  never bid for it and disclaims an interest in doing so. Reebok International,  Dorfman reported last March, was "in hush-hush talks to go private"; Reebok is  still public.  </P> <P> In April, Dorfman passed on the news that Mark IV Industries was "seriously  intent" on buying Johnson Controls Inc.; Mark IV instead bought a large block  of another company. Dorfman's takeover story, said a Johnson Controls employee  last week, "just faded into never-never land."  </P> <P> The erratic course of Dorfman's exclusives has done little to tarnish his  status as the most prominent and influential financial journalist in the  nation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Enormous Influence  </P> <P> The stocks of companies discussed prominently in his on-air work and bite-size  news stories often move up or down on his mention alone.  </P> <P> Earlier this month in an awesome display of Dorfman's power, Walt Disney Co.  rose $6.37 the day before a Dorfman column on the company ran -- apparently on  the basis of a small promotion box mentioning that Dorfman would discuss  takeover speculation about the company the next day. When the column threw  water on the notion of a Disney takeover, the company's shares fell $4.87.  </P> <P> Dorfman, a compact, bushy-browed man whose voice retains the accent of his  Brooklyn upbringing, professes indifference to his clout: "What a stock does  after I write about it is not my concern."  </P> <P> Yet Dorfman's dramatic influence and numerous wide-of-the-mark tips raise  questions that aren't so easily waved off. In a business where rumor can have  as much currency as fact, the role of the press is pivotal.  </P> <P> An unscrupulous investment adviser hoping for a quick profit could feed  information about a possible takeover to a member of the media, then sell out  after the published tip -- whether accurate or not -- drives the stock's price  up.  </P> <P> This line of discussion predictably agitates Dorfman. Sitting in his quiet  office above Madison Avenue last week, he placed the heel of his hand on his  forehead and fired back at a questioner.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Window on Big Money  </P> <P> His sources, he said, have been culled from his 30 years of experience  reporting for publications ranging from Women's Wear Daily to New York magazine  and the Wall Street Journal. His news tips, he said, are checked so thoroughly  that he sometimes loses an exclusive because he is unable to properly confirm  it.  </P> <P> He is careful, he added, to call a rumor exactly that, and maintained, as does  his USA Today editor, Tom Petruno, that his news stories have been accurate. "I  am not a tout," Dorfman said.  </P> <P> If he is being used by his sources, Dorfman argued, then it's a two-way street.  </P> <P> "I'm using the user," he said. "The average guy out there has got a right to  every fact I can give him. Doesn't every guy have a right to know what the  chosen few know? What is the average guy anyway, a leper?"  </P> <P> Dorfman's stock and trade is to report that a well-heeled investor has  purchased a small equity stake in a company, invariably one rumored as a  takeover target. This information is valuable, he argued, because it provides a  window "on what the big money is doing" before the investor must publicly  disclose his holdings.  </P> <P> Although Dorfman said, "It's not my job to predict mergers and acquisitions,"  he will often describe the investor as a "raider" who is "seriously  considering" launching a takeover.  </P> <P> The problem is that the alleged takeovers often do not occur, but anticipation  that they might frequently sends the stocks running up. Dorfman said this is  not his concern, nor is it when stocks tumble back down when the "serious  consideration" turns out otherwise.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jacobs Comments  </P> <P> "Is it news when a big-name investor is dallying around in a stock?" Petruno  asked. "I maintain that it is. Yeah, it doesn't always pan out, but the stories  are written to say that someone "may' or "might' do something."  </P> <P> The targets of Dorfman's stories say that it is impossible for him to make such  observations based on any real knowledge. "I can tell you there is nobody that  knows what I'm doing until I do it," said Irwin Jacobs, a frequent subject of  Dorfman columns. "I've always had a real problem with speculation. If I'm not  quoted as saying I'm going to do it, I surely wouldn't guarantee it's going to  happen."  </P> <P> In the past year, Dorfman has reported that Jacobs-led takeover offers were  imminent for Greyhound, CBI Industries, Avon Products and CML Group. Only the  Avon report was solid. Meanwhile, Dorfman did not report Jacobs' moves on  Tidewater Inc. and Shaklee Corp., or the leveraged buyout of the company Jacobs  heads, Minstar Inc.  </P> <P> Some people believe the lack of access to a putative raider can leave Dorfman  in the position of passing on information from second-hand sources who may not  have as much insight as Dorfman implies.  </P> <P> A Dorfman column last month about Campbell Soup Co. reported the possibility  that friction within the controlling Dorrance family would lead it to sell off  assets. The story had been making the rounds in the three months since the  death of family patriarch John Dorrance Jr. and Dorfman added no new details to  the old scuttlebutt.  </P> <P> "It made it sound as if he was privy to all kinds of information," said Marcia  Atcheson, Campbell's director of investor relations. "As far as I know there is  no substance to any of that." Last week's restructuring announcement did not  follow Dorfman's scenario.  </P> <P> Some of Dorfman's peers, while generally expressing admiration for him, wonder  if the pressure to come up with big scoops can take its toll. "Dan is too smart  to do anything that would violate ethical standards," said Gene Marcial, who  writes the influential "Inside Wall Street" column at Business Week. "I think  his biggest problem is to get the story from the right sources. He really tries  to be as accurate as he can. But in the process he probably gets his share of  bum stories."  </P> <P> Dorfman dismisses criticism as merely the product of jealousy. He suggested  that it has something to do with his fame and power, and his salary.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Workaholic Loner  </P> <P> Dorfman won't confirm a figure except to say he has a five-year contract with  USA Today, but it has been reported at $250,000 a year, plus additional income  from CNN, which easily places him among the highest-paid financial reporters,  if not the highest.  </P> <P> Instead of living the sybaritic life style that his income and position might  entitle him to, Dorfman characterized his daily existence as that of a  workaholic loner.  </P> <P> He lives in a rented one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan; he recently traded up  from a studio. He walks the 18 blocks to his office each morning, usually has a  low-cholesterol lunch at his desk and has dinner with sources.  </P> <P> With two jobs, he claims to put in an average work week of 75 hours. For  relaxation, he likes to "get lost in some place where no one knows me."  Divorced, the father of a grown daughter, Dorfman expressed a desire to remarry  and raise another child.  </P> <P> To those skeptical of his work, Dorfman allowed that a certain amount of  skepticism is appropriate. "You're off your rocker if you trade just on the  basis of what I or any other journalist reports," he said.  </P> <P> Then again, that's not to say Dan Dorfman doesn't believe in Dan Dorfman. "I  don't want to come off like a (expletive) braggart," he said, "but my point is,  if I'm the highest paid, maybe I'm worth it."  </P></p>

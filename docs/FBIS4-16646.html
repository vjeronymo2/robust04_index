			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray said there was  no alternative to the idea of national accord proposed by the  Russian president. He stressed in an interview with an Interfax  correspondent in Novosibirsk that this provided for real accord  aimed at restoring the political and economic stability in  Russia and not just for a one-time peace agreement between  different political parties and movements. Shakhray is currently  in Novosibirsk where he is taking part in a scientific  conference on regional economic issues on the invitation of the  local administration.    Shakhray pointed out that many political parties and  movements, their factions in the Federal Assembly and  representatives of the regional authorities were struggling for  spheres of influence in Russia's energy, military-industrial and  agrarian complexes. Shakhray believes that the president and the  government must act as mediators in order not to let any  political forces worsen the situation in the Russian economy.  Shakhray emphasized that only this agreement could bring  economic stability to Russia.</p>

A long debate among experts early last year concluded that  an  HDTV system is both affordable and profitable for China,  especially in the economically stronger east and coastal  regions--but not immediately.    Though most of China's 800 million TV viewers are still  watching black-and-white sets, China's economic miracle in  recent years promises that an increasing number of people will  embrace the new technology, said Feng Jichun, an official with  the State Science and Technology Commission (SSTC).    Chinese family incomes are expected to increase sharply in  the next few years.    Meanwhile, production costs may reduce remarkably with  technological improvement.    The retail price of an HDTV receiver was 4.5 million  Japanese  yen ($40,500) when it first hit the market in December 1990. And  in May 1993 it was 980,000 Japanese yen ($8,820) for a 32-inch  receiver with built-in decoder.    As American scientists develop a fully digital HDTV system,  which is more advanced than the Japanese analogue one, the  production cost of such HDTV receivers will drop to $1,000 by  the turn of the century, according to some predictions.    Though the predictions seem over-optimistic, it is sure that  the new technology will cost less.    But however promising the HDTV market, the investment needed  to conquer it is too high to be acceptable for China.    Japan and European Community countries have poured a total  of  $3.5 to $4 billion into HDTV research in the last 20 years. The  U.S. is also expected to pour billions of dollars into  developing its digital technology.    Though China has focused on just a small part of the  technological development, the scheduled research will still  cost hundreds of millions of yuan, excluding that for industrial  production of HDTV receivers, said Feng.    As the country has much more important fields crying for  funds, the government can hardly spare much to make the TV  screen more attractive, Feng added.    ``My lab currently cannot even afford a complete set of HDTV  hardware,'' said Ma Changhua, director of the SSTC's HDTV  research project.    ``But the research must go on,'' he continued. ``If we stop,  it will hand over a huge market to other countries and will  cause a loss the country could hardly afford,'' he said.    China's national television network has 614 stations,  covering 81.3 per cent of its nearly 1.2 billion population.    All the production, broadcasting and transmission equipment,  plus the current 230 million TV sets and the TV set production  lines, will be replaced by new ones for HDTV, he said, because  so far HDTV is not compatible with the television now in use.    Theoretically, it is possible to broadcast the digital HDTV  programmes on current TV sets, but it would produce low-quality  pictures. HDTV receivers would perform much better, Ma said.    But all depends on the cost of technological development and  the industrial production of such broadcasting facilities as  well as the time it will take, he added.    With dramatic technological development in communications,  especially in satellite broadcasting, China can hardly remain an  isolated island of bad quality colour TV in a world of HDTV, he  added.    In developed countries, industry plays the main role in HDTV  development, but in China, both the government and the industry  are short of cash.    There are also some ``chicken-and-egg'' problems for the  promotion of HDTV, Zheng Zhihang, a researcher with the HDTV  Research Institute of the Shanghai Jiaotong University, said at  an HDTV seminar held last year in Beijing.    Consumers are unlikely to buy receivers until a wide variety  of HDTV broadcasting is available; but broadcasters will  hesitate to offer HDTV programmes until there are enough viewers  to make it worthwhile.    Meanwhile, consumers are unlikely to buy receivers until the  cost comes down to acceptable levels; but manufacturers can't  bring the cost down until millions of consumers purchase HDTVs.</p>

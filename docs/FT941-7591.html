			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Political Notebook: Dedicated followers of 1960s fashions The irony seems to have escaped the Conservatives. For a year now - even before it coined that ill-fated phrase 'back to basics' - Mr John Major's government has been promising to overturn the fashionable nostrums of the 1960s. This week most of the cabinet and much of the Tory party lined up behind those same icons of social liberalism. An attempt to reimpose capital punishment was thrown out by a huge majority. MPs then voted to lower the homosexual age of consent from 21 to 18. There were four great acts of parliament during the 1960s which defined the climate of the age. One abolished hanging. Another liberalised the divorce law. Two more legalised abortion and decriminalised homosexuality. This week's votes underlined that for all the government's rhetoric there is no going back. Fashions of the 1960s have become conventional wisdom of the 1990s. The cabinet, fortunately, shares that wisdom. Take the hanging vote. Only two members of the cabinet - Mr John Redwood and Mr Ian Lang - voted with the pro-lobby. Despite his sympathy for some of the less civilised instincts of the Tory party conference, Mr Michael Howard was at the forefront of those arguing against. The line-up on the age of consent for homosexuals was not much different. Only four senior ministers - Mr Redwood again, Mr John Gummer, Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr John Patten - lined up against the move to 18. More opposed calls for homosexuals to be treated equally with heterosexuals by setting 16 as the age of consent. But many of these ministers did so in the expectation that two or three years from now parliament will vote for just that. The picture is not quite as straightforward as regards abortion. Parliament has recently reduced the limit under which foetuses can be aborted. But that decision was linked to advances in medical science rather than to any shift in the moral climate. As for the final benchmark of the swinging 60s - liberalisation of the divorce law - the government seems set to move further in the same direction. Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor, is known to favour reducing the minimum period of separation before divorce from two years to one. Others in the cabinet are less sure. But nearly all accept that the tide is flowing that way. So the pillars of 1960s liberalism remain in place - supported one and all by a prime minister and a cabinet publicly pledged to return to the mythical good old days of the 1950s. They might argue that one or two things have changed in recent weeks. The success of the tabloids in linking 'back to basics' with the private lives of MPs has led Mr Major to take a tougher line with errant ministers. But even here there is an important caveat: only those sexual indiscretions which reach the public domain are to be swiftly punished. The government is adamant that its flagship theme remains in place, but the words are already becoming hard to find in ministerial speeches. It would be bad politics to admit defeat. But like the Citizen's Charter before it, it can be allowed quietly to sink into oblivion. Anyway, the government's problems run much deeper. The present confusion is a symptom not a cause. It was elected in 1992 on a platform which promised to call a halt to the revolutionary radicalism of the Thatcherite 1980s. In its place Mr Major offered a more conventional conservatism which promised to make things work rather than to dismantle them. But the prime minister has been running in the opposite direction ever since, attempting to define his administration with radical legislation from which even Baroness Thatcher would have retreated. Rail privatisation, the shake-up of the police, yet another education bill and the push for single-tier local authorities are symptomatic of a government frightened to stop legislating lest it then finds itself with nothing to say. And when the new laws go wrong - as they frequently do - it has a perfect excuse for yet more legislation. Traditional strengths of Conservatism - competent management, measured change and careful reform - have been forgotten as ministers scramble to put more laws on to the statute book. An approach that manages to be frantic and fragmented has forced Mr Major to look to snappy but empty slogans to provide a semblance of coherence. This week's parliamentary triumphs for the social liberalism of the 1960s provided another salutary reminder that politics is just a bit more complicated than that.</p>

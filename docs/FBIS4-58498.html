			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Athens, May 4, IRNA -- The powerful Islamic group  in Egypt `the Muslim Brotherhood' (Ikhwan al-Muslimun) has  denounced the signing of an agreement on limited Palestinian  self-rule for Gaza and Jericho in Cairo Wednesday.    "We think those who are doing this are deviated and they are  isolated from their people and from the will of their people.  We are waiting to see what is going to happen in the future,"  Ikhwan-spokesman Ma'mun al-Hudaybi told IRNA by phone from Cairo.    Al-Hudaybi spoke to IRNA from his hospital bed where he is  recovering from an illness. The Muslim Brotherhood, the most  powerful Islamic movement in the arab world, is strongly opposed  to the so-called Middle East peace process. [passage omitted]</p>

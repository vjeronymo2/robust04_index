			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: BCE shows 20% downturn BCE, the biggest Canadian telecommunications group, blamed the recession and lower profits at its Northern Telecom subsidiary for a 20 per cent decline in second-quarter profits. For the first half, earnings were down 9 per cent, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. However, despite slow economic recovery, BCE expects improved performance in all sectors in the second half. The second-quarter performance was also affected by write-downs at its Montreal Trustco financial services arm. Final earnings were CDollars 246m (USDollars 205m), or 72 cents a common share, against CDollars 307m, or 92 cents, a year earlier. Operating revenues were CDollars 4.97bn against CDollars 5.05bn. First-half earnings were CDollars 544m, or CDollars 1.60 a common share, against CDollars 600m, or CDollars 1.80 a share, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 9.84bn against CDollars 9.78bn.</p>

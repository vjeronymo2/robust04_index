At present  opposition to this is not so tough, but, as an American diplomat  put it, "if the East Europeans do not believe in partnership, it  loses all point."    Official State Department representatives have said that all  diplomatic channels are being used on both sides of the ocean to  ensure that no doubts linger: If the East Europeans reject  partnership, it will not be to their benefit.    However, today these arguments no longer work as they did  prior to the recent parliamentary elections in Russia. When the  charms of gradualism are praised in Warsaw or Prague, only one  word is heard in response: Zhirinovskiy.    Even Boris Yeltsin's offer of security guarantees, which  Russia, along with NATO, is ready to give its former Warsaw Pact  allies, is viewed in Warsaw, Prague, and Budapest in the light  of 50 years of inequality. The Russian president's offer is  presented as the latest piece of evidence: Look, our suspicions  are not without foundation, Russia still considers itself the  arbiter of its former satellites' fate.    Of course no serious politician is entitled to ignore the  staying power of Russian imperialism, as demonstrated by the  vote for Zhirinovskiy. However, U.S. officials are coming  increasingly to the conclusion that "recent expressions of  regret over the results of the Russian elections are being  voiced by the East Europeans to create as persuasive a case as  possible for eventual NATO membership."    However, this stance by the U.S. Administration is coming  under criticism. Both the leaders of the Czech Republic,  Poland, and Hungary and the representatives of the political  opposition in those countries are asking for the criteria of  NATO membership to be elaborated as a matter of urgency.    The opinion is spreading among observers that U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher is coming around to the standpoint  actively prmoted by Czech President Vaclav Havel: Namely that,  while there is no need to revise Partnership for Peace at  present, the terms which will open the organization's doors to  Eastern Europe should be enshrined in a document at the upcoming  meeting of heads of state and government in Brussels.    However, the position of Strobe Talbott, recently special  envoy for former Soviet Union affairs and now second in command  at the U.S. State Department, remains immutable and firm: There  are no new demarcation lines in Europe. Staffers close to  Talbott maintain that in deliberately exaggerating the  significance of the pro-Zhirinovskiy vote the East Europeans are  pursuing perfectly natural aims: Full NATO membership means  belonging to the Western world, which brings with it not so much  security guarantees, the need for which is highly illusory, so  much as entry to Western markets and an inflow of investments.    The question to which American diplomacy has not yet  formulated a definitive answer for itself probably goes as  follows: Is democracy in Russia capable of curbing the  onslaught of imperialist, chauvinist tendencies and preventing  the state being run by radicals like Zhirinovskiy?</p>

The cocaine was seized in Aparecida do Rio Doce on highway  364 linking Goias with Sao Paulo. This road is considered by  the Federal Police to be the cocaine road, one of the main  routes for distributing drugs coming from Bolivia.    The 198 kg of pure cocaine, wrapped in plastic bags, were  hidden in two trucks used for carrying cattle. To carry the  cocaine the drug traffickers had built a false bottom into the  truck's body. The pressed cocaine was hidden inside the steel  and wooden frames and covered with a mixture of cow's manure and  rice husks to cover up the smell of cocaine.    According to the Federal Police, who have been chasing the  drug traffickers for 20 days, the cocaine load, valued at about  600 million real cruzeiros, came from Alto Araguaia in Mato  Grosso and was being taken to Uberaba and Uberlandia in the  triangle region of Minas Gerais.</p>

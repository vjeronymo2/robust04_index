Larger birds have a larger proportion of meat to bones -- 1/2 to 1/4 pound a  person should be sufficient.  </P> <P>  -- Fresh turkey, plan to roast within a day of purchase.  </P> <P>  -- Frozen turkey, purchase several days in advance to allow sufficient time  for thawing.  </P> <P>  -- Thawing, leave turkey in the original wrapper. In the refrigerator, place  the turkey on a shallow tray. Allow two to three days to thaw a 12- to 16-pound  turkey. In cold water, place turkey in a pan or in the sink and cover with cold  water. Change the water often. Allow about 1/2 hour per pound of turkey.  </P> <P> Thawing at room temperature is not recommended. Surface bacteria can multiply  to dangerous levels at room temperatures of 60 degrees and above.  </P> <P>  -- Preparation for roasting, remove giblets. Rinse the inside and outside of  the turkey and giblets in cold water. Drain well.  </P> <P>  -- Giblets, gizzard, heart, liver and neck meat are savory additions to  stuffing. Simmer giblets in water, seasoned as desired, until fork tender.  Gizzard, heart and neck, about 1 1/2 hours; liver, about 20 minutes. Dice meat  and add to stuffing. Use the cooking broth to moisten.  </P> <P>  -- Stuffing, do not stuff the bird until just before roasting. Stuffing a bird  requires extra handling. It is safer to bake stuffing separately, particularly  in warm weather.  </P> <P> If bird is to be stuffed, allow approximately 3/4 cup stuffing for 1 pound of  turkey. Spoon stuffing lightly into body and neck cavities, allowing room for  expansion. Skewer neck skin to back and tuck wings under. Fasten legs by tying  or tucking under skin band.  </P> <P>  -- How to roast, if meat thermometer is used, insert into thick part of thigh,  without touching the bone.  </P> <P> Uncovered, place turkey, breast up on rack in shallow roasting pan and roast in  a 325-degree oven. Baste occasionally, if necessary, with broth or fruit  juices. Cover loosely with foil if browning too quickly.  </P> <P> Foil wrapped, place turkey, breast up, in center of well-greased wide heavy  foil. Fold foil over securely on top and at ends. Place in shallow pan without  rack and roast in 450-degree oven. Open foil last 20 minutes to permit  browning.  </P> <P> Roasting timetable for stuffed turkey -- If turkey weighs from 8 to 12 pounds,  roast uncovered, 4 to 4 1/2 hours; foil wrapped, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  </P> <P> If turkey weighs from 12 to 16 pounds, roast uncovered, 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 hours;  foil wrapped, 3 to 3 1/4 hours.  </P> <P> If turkey weighs from 16 to 20 pounds, roasted uncovered 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 hours;  foil wrapped, 3 1/4 to 3 1/2 hours.  </P> <P> Unstuffed turkeys require about one-half hour less roasting time.  </P> <P> Test for doneness -- About 20 minutes before roasting time is up, test bird.  When done, the thickest part of the drumstick should feel tender, and drumstick  should twist easily. If a thermometer is used, it should register 185 degrees.  After removing from oven, let the turkey stand 15 to 20 minutes, for easy  carving.  </P> <P> Care of leftovers -- If possible, dismantle the bird completely after the meal.  Always immediately refrigerate leftover turkey meat, stuffing and gravy in  separate containers. The meat may be sliced or diced in accordance with plans  for future use. The broken carcass can be simmered with water and seasonings  for a soup base or stock. Use leftovers within one to three days, or freeze for  longer storage. Plan to use frozen leftovers within one month.  </P></p>

The prime minister and the UK foreign and  defense secretaries "are pleased to accept Chancellor Kohl's  invitation." They look forward to attending the program.    The note says the ceremony will pay tribute to the  contribution British, French, and U.S. troops have made toward  the freedom of Berlin since the end of World War II.  Invitations have also gone to U.S. President Bill Clinton and  French President Francois Mitterrand.</p>

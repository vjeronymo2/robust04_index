			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Incident at Blair's office to be probed The House of Commons security authorities were last night inquiring into the mysterious appearance of three people - including two Conservative researchers - in the private Commons office of Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader. The three were found emerging from the doorway of Mr Blair's inner office on Friday night by Ms Sue Jackson, the Labour leader's head of administration, after she heard them laughing and shouting. They were escorted away by security men after refusing to give their names or explain their presence, but were allowed to leave after their Commons passes were checked. They were identified as researchers working for Mr David Atkinson, Conservative MP for Bournmouth East, and a friend visiting the Commons for the day. Mr Atkinson later confirmed that his research assistant Mr Andrew Hull had been involved in the incident. Mr Blair's office declined to discuss the incident. Tory MPs said the three had found themselves in Mr Blair's office after taking a wrong turn in the Commons' labyrinthine corridors on their way back from a social engagement. Ms Jackson said she was alerted by 'loud laughter' at about 7.30pm on Friday night. 'After several minutes I realised it was coming from Tony Blair's inner office,' she said. 'I thought it was odd because everybody who works in that area had gone home for the evening. There were three people coming out of the doorway of Tony Blair's private office. 'I asked them who they were and what they were doing. They would not say. They said they were lost. One of them rudely demanded to know the way out. I blocked the door and said I would have to get security to show them the way out.'</p>

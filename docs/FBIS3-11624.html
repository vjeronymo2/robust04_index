			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eloisa Ibarra A.] </F>   [Text] According to statements by private Attorney Daniel  Olivas Zuniga [the private attorney representing the Genie  family interests], General Humberto Ortega is barred from  exercising his duties as head of the Armed forces as long as the  precautionary measures ordered yesterday by Military Prosecutor  Lester Gallo remains in effect.    Yesterday, after Ortega concluded his testimony on the Genie  case, Gallo proceeded to order a house arrest for the general as  per a request by the victims father, Mr. Raymond Genie Penalba.    Private Attorney Olivas explained that Gen. Ortega's  military  rank is not being withdrawn as a result of the precautionary  measure, but his movements and duties as EPS [Sandinist People's  Army] chief have been restricted. According to the attorney,  "at this time he is not the chief." He added that should  Ortega's endorsement as EPS chief be required, he would be  disqualified from proceeding unless the documents had been dated  prior to the date when the house arrest orders were issued.  [sentence as received]    Ortega was questioned yesterday for more than five hours by  Military Prosecutor Lester Gallo, the defense lawyer, and the  private attorney in order to learn what he really knows about  the 28 October 1990 crime against Jean Paul Genie. The general  and his bodyguards are charged with being the alleged  perpetrators, accomplices, and accessories to the death of Genie  since they shot him to death on the night of 28 October 1990  when he tried to pass them at the 8 km marker on the Masaya  highway.    Before proceeding to testify, Ortega presented a writ  whereby  he voluntarily disqualifies himself from duties directly linked  to his military obligations as long as the Genie enquiries  lasts. Mr. Olivas explained that with the general's  disqualification, he, as head of the Armed Forces, will no  longer have to decide if the case, in which he is one of the  accused, is to be annulled or not. In this case, it will be up  to the other members of the EPS General Command to decide if an  annulment request will or will not be presented to the Supreme  Court of Justice.    During lengthy questioning, the EPS chief stated that on the  day the incident occurred, after leaving the home of Colonel  Lenin Cerna he went to the general command offices and later to  his home where he remained all night. The general also stated  that on that particular day his chief of security was Roberto  Chacon and that they were not carrying any weapons.    When asked by the private attorney if he was responsible for  giving the orders during the incident, Ortega answered: no, that  was the chief of security's responsibility. Based on Ortega's  statements, if an indictment is filed against his bodyguards,  Roberto Chacon would be the person most likely to be charged  with Genie's death given that he would be held responsible for  having ordered the shooting.    Private Attorney Olivas questioned Ortega on the results of  an investigation by the Venezuelan police, in response to which  Ortega said that the report is technically inadequate and that  they were not in Nicaragua long enough to arrive at serious  conclusions. He also described the report as being  "politicized."    On several occasions, the private attorney also questioned  the general on the possible destruction of evidence and  obstruction of police investigations. The military officer  stated that the commission established to investigate the case  in no way refused to cooperate with the police in their  investigation. With respect to the destruction of the weapons  withdrawal and surrender log, Ortega answered that it was normal  procedure to destroy the documents once they were no longer  needed.    After concluding his testimony, Ortega described the  accusations as "a well orchestrated campaign by unimportant  groups who have taken advantage of the Genie family's  misfortunes to attack the EPS."    Ortega's statements were refuted by Raymond Genie who said  that the charges are against the general and not the EPS, and  that he has never lent himself to be used in any campaign by any  group whatsoever.    Yesterday, Gen. Humberto Ortega presented a motion to  Military Prosecutor Lester Gallo disqualifying himself from some  of his military obligations "directly linked to military  jurisdiction" as long as inquiries related to the Genie case  continue.</p>

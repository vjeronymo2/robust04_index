			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Industrial sales drop as recession takes its toll GERMAN industry's sales in January tumbled 13.5 per cent, compared with the equivalent month last year, as recession and winter took their toll. Total turnover in manufacturing and mining fell to DM141bn (Pounds 57.6bn) and numbers employed dropped by 8.5 per cent (or 723,000) to 7.8m, according to the federal statistics office. Export sales were 17.5 per cent lower than a year earlier, at DM35bn. The extent of the fall underlines the sharpening industrial crisis, which last week led Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest concern, to forecast a renewed profits fall this year of up to 30 per cent. The contraction in Germany's industrial output during the month was accelerated by widespread short-time working, especially in the automotive industry. Continuation of short-time in subsequent months is likely to have had a similar effect on production and turnover in February and March. The continuing collapse in east Germany was highlighted by figures showing only 775,000 people at work in production industries during January, 29 per cent fewer than a year earlier. They generated total sales of a mere DM6.5bn, down 7 per cent. Export turnover fell almost 19 per cent to just DM700m. In the west, where industrial sales dropped 13.7 per cent, export turnover was down more than 17 per cent at DM34bn. There were sharp falls in all industrial sectors, the statistics office said. Numbers employed were down 409,000 or 5.5 per cent.</p>

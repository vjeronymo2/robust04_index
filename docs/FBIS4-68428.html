			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Volkov: "They Want Credit Emission from </F> the Government--But Have Doubts About the Solvency of the  Council of Ministers"]    [Text] The most reliable source of financing for the  territories of Russia is credit emission. We can only welcome  this candid statement issued by Oksana Dmitriyeva, chairperson  of the State Duma Subcommittee on Financing for the Territories.  Finally the Russian parliament has gotten the opportunity to  translate the unintelligible groaning of the opposition into  normal language with an intelligible vocabulary.    The results of parliamentary hearings on the draft budget  for  1994 presented by the government are as follows: The most  competent Duma members have shown that state income in the  budget is overstated due to the fact that production volume  decreased more heavily than was presumed (by 25 percent instead  of the 8 percent contained in December calculations of the  Ministry of Economics), while additional state investments  should be added to the expenditures.    The State Duma will not be able to create a full-fledged  conciliation committee capable of reaching consensus together  with the government. According to Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of  the Duma Budget Committee, this would mean "violation of the  principle of separation of powers." On the other hand, Sergey  Shapovalov, chairman of the Committee for Regional Policy,  insists that a common working group is needed--true, its  decisions would be "advisory in nature."    In other words, the State Duma is attempting to find  roundabout ways, having come into conflict with the statute it  readily adopted on procedure for adoption of the budget. This  statute prohibits the adoption of additional expenditure  resolutions without either a confirmation of supplemental  sources of income or the reduction of expenditures with respect  to other budget lines. In point of fact, taking into account  growing pressure on the part of intragovernmental groups aimed  at increasing outlays, an "advisory"--i.e., unofficial--working  group might "convince" the Ministry of Finance to a possibly  greater degree than would open confrontation during the course  of the official procedure for adopting the budget. Especially  since there seem to be additional sources through which the  government can obtain income--the removal of tax benefits for  exporters, estimated by Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the  Economics Committee, to amount to R24 trillion, and by Aleksandr  Pochinok, deputy chairman of the Budget Committee, at  approximately R10 trillion. But as Mr. Pochinok noted, it would  be more proper to first repeal the legal resolutions affording  such benefits, and only then introduce the new income into the  budget...    The situation is further complicated by the fact that the  Duma has assumed the responsibility to begin examination of the  budget at the end of next week. In the meantime, according to  the Budget Committee chairman, the draft presented does not  conform to selected excerpts from the president's correspondence  with the parliament--there is no line in it about additional  funds which must be expended on the closure of a number of coal  mines, for example, or the readjustment to be made at military  plants, etc. In Mr. Zadornov's words, "the affording of  additional funds must be conditioned upon plans for a framework  restructuring of the economy." This requirement does not  presently appear to be entirely realistic, however--and not only  because an effective concept of framework restructuring is  lacking. It also proceeds from the insincerity of politicians  who strive to effect institutional changes in words, while in  fact sustaining bankruptcy and conserving the Soviet industry.    Claims of the State Duma to the effect that new methods are  being used to finance the regions out of the federal budget  appear to be quite justified. As we know, the government has  adopted a system of transfers, accumulating income in the  federal fund for support to the regions from value-added tax,  and then transferring it to the most needy regions. However,  coefficients used by the Council of Ministers either were  calculated employing incorrect methodology or proceeding from  political considerations. For example, Kemerovo Oblast finds  itself in first place in the list of needy regions, and of 66  subsidized regions it will receive almost half the funds  accumulated. Objecting to this is not only Yabloko, but the  Russia's Choice faction as well. However, competent opponents of  the government's program from the "Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin"  bloc have additional, nontechnical objections to the principles  of regional financing proposed by the Ministry of Finance. Mrs.  Dmitriyeva stated yesterday that since the decline in production  should lead to reduced volumes of value-added tax, the source of  financing for the subsidy fund for the regions must be  different--direct credit emission, to be precise. In this  regard, observers are proposing that taxes be repealed entirely  and that the economy be financed from a computation of minimum  necessary outlays, but that in such event the parliament be  dissolved as the source of idle talk about this minimum and the  government be cleansed of officials who attempt to defend sector  interests.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Patten says deal near on airport China and Hong Kong are on the verge of reaching agreement on financing the territory's new airport, Mr Chris Patten, the UK colony's governor, said in London last night. His statement at a dinner of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council was his most optimistic comment yet on resolution of a problem that has bedevilled relations between the two sides. Agreement on the airport financing would be a significant breakthrough in relations. 'We have all but completed our discussions on the agreed minutes for the financing of the new airport,' he said. Departing from his prepared text, he said he was 'very confident' an announcement would be made 'in the next few days'. 'That, I think, would be the very best signal that China and Britain can co-operate to ensure the future economic prosperity of the territory.' It would also be necessary to reach ancillary agreement with the mass transit railway company and provisional airport authority, but he hoped that would follow. Mr Patten's speech was notable for its positive line on relations with China. He stressed that Hong Kong and the UK had supported China's aspiration to be a founder member of the World Trade Organisation and argued in favour of extension of most-favoured-nation status for China by the US.</p>

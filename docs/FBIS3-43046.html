			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by L.A. Teplova, Scientific Production Association </F> of Polymer Building Materials; UDC 678.58.691.16.621.791.94]    [Abstract] The widening gap between the physical and  engineering base of the construction industry and today's  standards, the low mechanization level of roofing operations,  and the increasing popularity of soft bitumen-based materials  prompted the National Scientific Research Institute of Polymer  Building Materials together with the Tekhnopom National  Scientific and Engineering Center to examine the effectiveness  of shaped cutting of rolled bitumen-impregnated roofing  materials using a specialized laser system. To this end, CW,  pulse, and periodic pulse CO[.sup]2[/], garnet, ruby, and  Nd-glass lasers are tested. The experiment demonstrates that  CO[.sup]2[/] CW lasers with a 1-6 kgf/cm[.sup]2[/] air  injection to the cutting zone are optimum for materials moving  at a high velocity relative to the beam. A comparison of laser,  mechanical, and combined laser-mechanical cutting methods and  process parameters makes it possible to speculate that a 36.9  m/min cutting speed can be obtained using a 5 kW laser whose  radiation is split into two beams. The advantages of a  computer-aided laser cutting system include the simplicity and  speed of switching from one standard size of material to  another. The findings confirm the outlook for using laser  radiation for shaped cutting of soft bitumen-impregnated roofing  materials and the method's ability to implement complex designer  concepts and original shapes for various building roof shapes.  The anticipated economic impact from implementing the  computer-aided laser complex using the combined laser-mechanical  method with a double-split beam and three knives is up to 10  million rubles in 1993 prices.

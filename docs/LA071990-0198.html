			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MIKE PENNER: APPEARANCES CAN BE DECEIVING WHEN SIZING UP WHITE'S TALENT  </P> <P> It is mid July, Wally Joyner and Chili Davis are on the disabled list, the  Angels are knocking on fifth place's door and Devon White is in Edmonton,  re-learning how to hit.  </P> <P> The situation is sad, on all fronts, in every sense of the word.  </P> <P> To replace Joyner, the Angels' second-leading run-producer, the club recalls  Edmonton first baseman Lee Stevens, who had yet to have a major league at-bat.  To replace Davis, the Angels' third-leading run-producer, the club recalls  Edmonton catcher Ron Tingley, owner of a .149 career major league batting  average.  </P> <P> His old team is headed south, but White isn't. The Angels need him but they  don't want him. Not now, not yet. White was sent north for a reason -- remedial  tutoring in Applied Woodwork 101 -- and classes have been in session for barely  a week. Considering the stated course objective -- "To recapture the  consistency that can make him a great player," Doug Rader says -- this could  take some time.  </P> <P> So White, one year removed from the American League All-Star team, remains in  Edmonton, trapped. Trapped by circumstances, trapped by the wildest uppercut in  the free world, trapped by four months of brilliance in the summer of 1987.  </P> <P> In a way, the best thing to happen to White was also the worst. In the first  half of his first full big league season, White batted .293 with 17 home runs  and 50 RBIs. By the end of July, he had 19 home runs and was closing in on 70  RBIs.  </P> <P> The numbers waylaid the Angels, who were expecting, maybe, a few stolen bases  and a few doubles into the gap.  </P> <P> More crucially, the numbers also waylaid White.  </P> <P> Until then, White had the look of an unpolished Willie Wilson: line-drive  hitter, limited punch, good speed. His minor league stats supported the  comparison to the death. White hit seven, eight and 14 home runs during his  last three seasons in the minors. Only once, when he split 74 RBIs between  Midland and Edmonton in 1985, did he drive in as many as 70 runs.  </P> <P> Four months into the 1987 season, White began thinking he might be Eric Davis.  </P> <P> It was all fool's gold. As we've since seen, everything about that 1987 season  was a deceit. That was the Year of the Rabbit, when a little juice was  surreptitiously added to the baseball and the game all but careened off a  cliff.  </P> <P> A rookie hit 49 home runs. Even more amazingly, Wade Boggs hit 24. Joyner went  from 22 home runs as 1986 rookie-of-the-year runner-up to 34 -- and didn't make  the All-Star team. The World Series was won by, of all people, the Minnesota  Twins, a team that had two starting pitchers but also baseball's burliest  offense, let loose under the big top of a home park affectionately known as The  Homerdome.  </P> <P> It's a season that belongs in the dumpster, right next to strike-gutted 1981.  Today, the artificially bloated power totals have no credibility, no meaning.  The entire 162-game schedule, now just an aggravating blip on the grand  statistical curve, should be fitted for an asterisk.  </P> <P> Examine the fallout:  </P> <P> Mark McGwire, the boy king of the 1987 sluggers, has become a reliable force in  the middle of the lineup, but has yet to clear 33 home runs again. Boggs is  Boggs again. Joyner has hit 37 home runs in nearly 400 games since the end of  1987. And the Twins? General Manager Andy MacPhail was apparently so  embarrassed by the scam his team pulled on the sport that he has been trading  the Twins back into their rightful place -- fifth -- ever since.  </P> <P> With White, the Angels can only hope the damage is not irreversible. But for a  while, everyone involved was suckered. An Angel batting coach, Rick Down,  proclaimed White to be the next Hank Aaron. White wanted to believe him, so he  decided to look the part.  </P> <P> Forget that White has always lacked the innate strength of Aaron or Bo Jackson  or even Ruben Sierra. He had to swing from the heels.  </P> <P> Forget that White is physically equipped to give the Angels precisely what they  most need -- a dynamic leadoff hitter. White chose to chase the dollar signs  hanging beyond the outfield fences.  </P> <P> Forget that White's 24 home runs in 1987 would translate into about 16 during a  normal season. Once the switch was flicked on, White wasn't about to turn back.  He was born to go deep -- or would be damned if he didn't go down trying.  </P> <P> After 2 1/2 seasons of diminishing returns, White has returned to Edmonton. At  best, the assignment is a midseason tuneup. At worst, it's a remake of the Gary  Pettis Story, where talented, young, Gold Glove-winning center fielder hits his  way out of Anaheim, into Canada and, ultimately, onto another team's roster.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, that was a subplot from 1987 that White either didn't detect or  respect. Now, he may be doomed to repeat it.  </P> <P> With Angel General Manager Mike Port finally awakening to the possibility that  his team might need retooling -- the view from Port's Anaheim Stadium box must  not be too good -- another sad truth has surfaced. White, the man who could  have brought Joe Carter or Ellis Burks to the Angels (with a bit of creative  packaging) during the winter, now carries a surgeon general's warning. White's  greatest resource, his potential, has been tainted, along with his market  value.  </P> <P> If Port wishes to keep his pitching intact, he has little ammunition other than  White if he's truly intent on a shakeup. That leaves this choice: Deal White at  cut-rate prices . . . or bite the bullet and pray the Edmonton experiment pans  out.  </P> <P> Who's to blame when situations degenerate?  </P> <P> Port, for waiting too long to make a move?  </P> <P> White, for waiting too long to try a course correction?  </P> <P> Or those Haitian seamstresses who added something extra to their product in  1987, helping create the grand Devon White illusion in the first place?  </P></p>

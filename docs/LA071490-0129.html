			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTLY, LIFEGUARDS IN HOT SEAT  </P> <P> The hot, muggy weather that has blanketed Orange County for the past few days  has sent thousands flocking to the beaches in search of sea breezes and a  respite from the stifling, furnace-like heat.  </P> <P> But the combination of thong-wearing sunbathers and a brutal rip current  generated by a hurricane off Baja California has made the days anything but  lazy for lifeguards.  </P> <P> Keeping a constant vigil, the crew of mostly young men who man the lifeguard  towers dashed into the heavy surf in a seemingly unending tide of rescues and  warnings to bathers who found themselves swept hundreds of yards in seconds by  the rip currents.  </P> <P> "The (current) makes it tougher because you're going out more," said Brad  Valentine, 20, a Cal State Fullerton student who was manning a lifeguard tower  about 200 yards from the Huntington Beach pier. "You're running and swimming  all the time. With conditions like this, it's a lot more stressful."  </P> <P> For Valentine and his fellow lifeguards, there appears to be little hope for  relief in sight. The heat and humidity, along with the sweeping storm-fueled  currents, should last for a least a few more days, which means bigger weekend  crowds and more unwary swimmers to be wary of.  </P> <P> Meteorologists said a high-pressure system stalled over the southwestern United  States and Hurricane Genevieve, raging about 400 miles southwest of Baja, are  responsible for the double whammy.  </P> <P> The high-pressure system trapped not only the unusually moist air but also a  higher concentration of pollutants, causing smog readings to approach the  unhealthful range in inland areas, according to South Coast Air Quality  Management District figures.  </P> <P> Inland temperatures reached the low 90s Friday, while the humidity hovered  around 60% during the day and was expected to rise to a soggy 85% at night in  parts of the county. Beach cities were just about as uncomfortably humid as the  inland areas, but temperatures in the mid 70s sent about 50,000 people to the  Huntington Beach shores.  </P> <P> While cool, offshore breezes ranging up to 15 m.p.h. brought welcome relief for  beach-goers, they posed an often hair-raising problem for lifeguards. Lt. Steve  Davidson of the Huntington Beach lifeguard station said lifeguards made about  70 rescues Thursday, compared to 10 to 15 on "a quiet summer day." At  Huntington City Beach, lifeguards reported 39 rescues Friday.  </P> <P> "Our surf picks up because of tropical storms and hurricanes," Davidson said.  "When the wind is blowing at a high velocity, sometimes we get swells from four  or five miles away. Then we get a real strong current because the waves hit at  an angle, not head on, so people drift down the beach."  </P> <P> Amy Dwyer, 17, and Sagi Mesa, 15, a pair of beach-goers from Huntington Beach,  said they were swept several hundred yards in a matter of minutes by the strong  sideways current.  </P> <P> "You have no control, you keep trying to get your feet down," Mesa said. "But  it's fun."  </P> <P> Dwyer and Mesa also said that while the surf was treacherous, they did not feel  scared because they heeded announcements over a lifeguard tower loudspeaker  warning swimmers of strong currents.  </P> <P> Lifeguard Valentine, who swam out to warn nearly a dozen swimmers of the rough  tide and made three rescues in less than four hours, said that many bathers,  while aware that the current was strong, were not aware that the waves and  current could send them crashing into the the pier's heavy wooden pilings.  </P> <P> "Usually people are glad to see you when you get out there. Just about  everybody's worst fear is kissing the pier."  </P> <P> Fear of the pier prompted lifeguard station officials to post three lifeguards  at Tower 1, just a few feet from the closed pier. By early afternoon, guards  Steve Addleman, 19, Greg Reddish, 17, and Mike Yakura, 17, had plunged after  tired or errant swimmers about 50 times, at times returning to their post for  less than a minute before spotting another floundering bather.  </P> <P> "We've been wet all day," Addleman said.  </P> <P> Times researchers Danny Sullivan and Elena Brunet contributed to this report.  </P></p>

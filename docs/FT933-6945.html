			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Hungary set for key decision on mobile telephones HUNGARY will tomorrow name the winners of a tender for two concessions to operate digital mobile telecommunications systems, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. The successful international consortiums are expected to pay a combined Dollars 100m (Pounds 150m) for the right to operate networks based on the pan-European GSM standard over 15 years and to invest a further Dollars 400m in development over the next 10 years. Hungary's is the first tender in east-central Europe for GSM mobile phone services and will set a precedent for Poland and the Czech Republic. Confident of victory is a group led by US West, the US regional operator, and HTC, the Hungarian telecommunications monopoly. They are already partners in Westel, the joint venture operating Hungary's analogue mobile telephone service. DBFH, teaming Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, France Telecom and British Telecom, is also a powerful contender. With a reported Dollars 48m bid for the rights to one concession, the west European national oper-ators topped the Dollars 46m offered originally by US West and its partners. But Deutsche Telekom is a prime contender for the planned privatisation later this year of a stake of more than 30 per cent in state-owned HTC. Deutsche Telekom's involvement in the national landline operator could conflict on competition grounds with participation in digital cellular telephony. Deutsche Telekom's divided interest may work to the advantage of Pannon GSM, a coalition of the Danish, Swedish, Finnish and Dutch state telecommunications companies. The 'Nordic' group's last bid of Dollars 45m was only marginally behind the leaders' and the tender evaluation committee rated the submission's technical quality highly.</p>

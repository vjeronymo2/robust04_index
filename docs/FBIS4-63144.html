			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku, 18 May (AZERTAC)--The item of the Bishkek  Protocol was not included in the agenda of the today's session  of the Azerbaijani Parliament.    A group of MP's, who consider the document conflicting with  the interests of the republic, proposed to discuss this item.  According to them, signing the Bishkek Protocol, the  Parliament's speaker Rasul Guliyev has exceeded his commission.  The MP's also consider the fact that the Azerbaijani  Parliament's speakers signature is affixed near the signature of  the representative of the Armenian community of Nagorno-Karabakh  "a de facto recognition of the so- called Nagorno-Karabakh  Republic."    Concerning this item, the Parliament's speaker said that  there was "too much attention" devoted to the Bishkek Protocol  and that, firing the passions against the document, some forces  in Azerbaijan were trying to use it "as a means of political  struggle". According to Rasul Guliyev, this document is just "a  protocol of intentions which is without legal effect. It has  only the recommendation character" and no consent of the  Parliament was required for the signing of the document which is  not a subject to ratification.    [Baku AZERTAC in English at 1632 GMT on 18 May, in a  Baku-datelined item, adds the following:    ["Thirteen MP's attempt to place the item of the Bishkek  Protocol signed by the Parliament speaker Rasul Guliyev on the  agenda resulted in an unexpected break announced by the speaker  today. (The Bishkek Protocol has been rejected in the Parliament  earlier.) On failing to achieve their goal, they blamed Rasul  Guliyev's deed in their statement and left the Parliament hall.  They are convinced that the Parliament speaker exceeded his  commission by signing the protocol."]</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISCOVERY: GAL AFFAIRE: DRESSING CINDERELLA FOR THE BALL  </P> <P> Quick! It's the holiday season. There is a charity ball, the office party, a  New Year's Eve affair and . . . they're all formal. What do you do?  </P> <P> If there isn't a tuxedo already hanging in the closet, it's easy enough to walk  into the nearest shop specializing in formal wear rentals and be ready in no  time for  </P> <P> maximum partying for minimum cash -- if you're a man. Women, however, face a  different problem. It would be social suicide to be seen in the same dress  three times in a row, but it could be a financial fiasco to do otherwise.  </P> <P> Gal Affaire in Los Alamitos can be a reasonable alternative to the faux pas of  repetition or the certainty of bankruptcy. The shop has more than 500 designer  formals, all personally scrutinized and individually selected by owner Pat  Thomas. Gal Affaire has everything from chiffons to lace, silks to sequins and  lame to beads in every color under the sun, including fiery reds, elegant  blacks and plenty of glittery gold and silver. Too, there is an assortment of  boas, furry jackets, jewelry, shoes and hats.  </P> <P> "We get women who attend a lot of charity events, brides who don't have a  fortune to spend or mothers looking for prom dresses for their daughters," says  store manager Antwinette Guzzino. "Most of them can't see paying $1,000 for a  dress to wear once and hang in the closet, so they come to us."  </P> <P> "Our clothing has been everywhere," Guzzino explains. "We've been to the  Academy Awards, the Country Music Awards, MTV Awards and even an (presidential)  Inaugural Ball."  </P> <P> That's a modest accounting. Women from all over the county have discovered the  thriving business for their charity balls, class reunions, cruises and  weddings. Even beauty pageant queens have been outfitted with gowns from Gal  Affaire, including the reigning Miss Seal Beach, her first and second  runners-up, and Simone Stephens, Miss California 1987-88, to name a few.  </P> <P> From $49 for a simple strapless cocktail dress, to $229 for a dazzling sequin  gown, any woman can dress like a beauty queen for a special do. The shop  carries sizes 4 to 24, and alterations are usually fairly simple and quick.  </P> <P> "We can tailor a fit to just about anyone since all of our alterations are done  by hand and are temporary," Guzzino explained as she watched a customer admire  a velvet and sequin ensemble in the mirror. "In fact, I have one dress in here  I've gotten everyone into from a 4 to a 14."  </P> <P> Whatever the special occasion, Orange County ladies know they don't need a  fairy godmother to dress them.  </P> <P> Hours: 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., Monday-Friday; 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday  </P> <P> Address: 3700 Katella Ave., Suite B, Los Alamitos  </P> <P> Telephone: (213) 596-2886  </P></p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Sour taste in Bordeaux: Allied-Lyons' decision to sell Chateau Latour Like other specialist businesses, the wine trade is flattered by the intervention of multinational conglomerates, bemused by much of what they do in its particular sector, and worried by any sign that they want to get out of it. The news that Allied-Lyons might sell Chateau Latour, the Rolls-Royce of claret, comes as an affront to the wine world. A sale would be the latest in a series of changes of ownership in Bordeaux, the world's largest wine region, triggered by economic slowdown. Latour enjoys an unmatched status, being one of four of the world-famous 'first growths' from Bordeaux's Medoc region, the elite of a rigorous quality system introduced in 1855. Under its new president, David Orr, who has spent most of his working life immersed in Allied's wine interests, Latour has shown a return to form with a 1990 that experts acknowledge is even better than those of Chateaux Lafite, Margaux and Mouton-Rothschild, the other first growths that are still French-owned and family-run. The decision to sell such a corporate gem in a depressed market for both wine and wine properties therefore baffles many observers. This is particularly true since Allied acquired Latour when prices were at their peak, in 1988. Prices have since started to flatten and in some cases fall. Sale of the vineyard also seems inconsistent with the company's recent spending spree on California wineries where prospects seem much less certain than those of the great Bordeaux estate. Allied's chairman, Michael Jackaman, is known to feel a particular affection for Latour. But a change in the group's management strategy since Jackaman and Tony Hales, the chief executive, took over last year, has prompted allied to focus on international growth brands and on raising the return on assets. 'Several people have bought properties here in recent years because they fell in love with something, or mistakenly thought wine prices would go on rising at 10 to 15 per cent per year indefinitely . . . Allied-Lyons is not like that. It is a real professional,' says Mr Philippe Casteja, president of the Conseil Interprofessionel du Vin de Bordeaux and proprietor of a neighbouring but less grand property, Chateau Batailley. Allied-Lyons is probably looking for a sale as part of its general strategy of cutting debts and concentrating on its core activities, says Mr Sylvain Massot, food and drink analyst at Morgan Stanley in London: 'Unlike Champagne, Bordeaux has never really been a business suitable for big food multinationals because it is more fragmented than Champagne and the synergies with other drinks brands are less obvious.' This is not an easy time for Chateau Latour, the smallest of the Medoc first growths. The 1991 vintage was severely curtailed by an April frost and proved a financial disaster throughout Bordeaux. Latour will be hurt more than most by the current downturn in demand because it tends to hold more of its own stocks than do its competitors. Rivals sell a higher proportion of wine through independent merchants to offload the cost of holding it, which Mr Casteja says is the single biggest component of a Bordeaux estate's overall costs. In addition, recent dumping of young vintages of Chateau Latour by an Allied-owned British wholesaler, at prices low enough to undercut even Latour's own in-house Bordeaux merchant, have hurt its image. Most of Latour's competitors are producing a higher return on their owners' invested capital. They either changed hands before Bordeaux estate prices peaked in the late 1980s or they have been in the same family for generations and mcuh of their assets were written down long ago. The most recent Medoc first growth to change hands is Chateau Margaux, bought in 1977 by the Franco-Greek Mentzelopoulos family from its previous family owners, the Ginestets for just FFr76m (Pounds 9.06m). Any bidder would have to think hard before buying Chateau Latour for the more than the Pounds 100m at which it was valued when Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, sold its 53.5 per cent stake to Allied Lyons for Pounds 58m in 1988. Yet there are eager buyers for Bordeaux properties. Most interest has come from French insurance companies, which have over the past decade picked up around 20 Bordeaux wine businesses as steady long-term investments for their property portfolios. The leader in this game is Axa, which is said to be interested in adding Latour to its portfolio of Bordeaux chateaux, including the neighbouring Chateau Pichon-Longueville. Only last June, the insurance group's wine unit, Axa-Millesimes, bought a majority stake in Chateau Suduiraut, a top Sauternes property. If Latour were to revert to French ownership, after nearly three decades in British hands, it would surely be forever. The Mentzelopoulos's bid for Margaux was accepted by the French government - under its foreign investment vetting rules of the time - in spite of a much higher offer from National Distillers of the US. Yet French foreign investment controls have since been relaxed, so Allied-Lyons could make the most of offshore interest. It could well ask and get a considerable premium from any non-French bidder - perhaps an eccentric Japanese billionaire wine enthusiast, such as those who have already made inroads in France and California. So the Bordeaux wine trade is collectively holding its breath - and an awful lot of unsold stock - in a difficult marketplace. A few months ago, David Orr took a British fine-wine merchant out to lunch at one of London's smartest restaurants. Knowing that Latour was particularly well-promoted on the Gavroche wine list, with 13 different listings from Pounds 135 to Pounds 990 a bottle, he asked the sommelier, as part of his Latour sales pitch, how many bottles he sold in an average month. He was visibly shocked by the answer that nowadays it would only be three.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Goncz, Horn, and Fodor Are Leading </F> -- The Latest Survey of the Szonda Ipsos"]    [Text] The Goncz-Horn-Fodor trio continues to head the  popularity list of the Szonda Ipsos Opinion Poll Institute.  According to a survey carried out in the first two weeks of  March, only three politicians out of the constant "players" on  the list remained in the same position.    At the beginning of the election campaign, the public showed  signs of uncertainty. The number of people who are uncertain  about which party to support although they would like to vote  increased from February to March, and so did the number of  people who do not know which party might win the elections. Two  months before the 1990 elections, slighly fewer people (58  percent) declared their readiness to participate in the voting  than now (61 percent), but then the proportion of people who had  no party preferences was only 31 percent, compared with the  current 41 percent. In the first two weeks of March 1994, 22  percent of the people who are sure they will vote do not know  which party they will vote for. This figure was 9 percent in  1990.    The number of people who refrained from giving their opinion  on politicians also increased since February. With a few  exceptions, there has been a decrease in the popularity index,  but most of the differences are statistically insignificant  compared with the previous month.    In the case of two politicians of the Federation of Young  Democrats [Fidesz], namely Viktor Orban and Laszlo Kover, and  two politicians of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], namely  Ferenc Kulin and Sandor Lezsak, the drop in their popularity  index borders the statistically significant line.    Sandor Nagy, chairman of the National Federation of  Hungarian  Trade Unions, is again on our March list. He is in second place  on the national list of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP].  His popularity has not changed since September 1992. Women,  older people, and people with a lower level of education find  Sandor Nagy more sympathetic than others. Generally, people who  sympathize with the left think of Sandor Nagy more favorably  than the average, and people who do not sympathize with the left  think of him less favorably than the average. Consequently,  Sandor Nagy is considerably more popular among MSZP followers  (65 points) than among other voters (42-50 points).    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Popularity List          |Percent                  |Change                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1.

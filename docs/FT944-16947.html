			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Observer: Not tonight Sexual politics are taking on a new meaning in the run-up to Germany's elections. According to the German version of Playboy magazine, there is a strong correlation between voting and mating habits. Polling some 1,300 people, the mag discovered that more than 50 per cent of Christian Democrat voters record having sex once a month or less. Germany's most sexually active voters are to be found in the reformed communist Party of Democratic Socialism; 20 per cent reckon they have sex at least once a day. Is that why they have no chance of forming the next government?</p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRIEST LINKED TO ARCHBISHOP CASE WOMAN  </P> <P> The Catholic archdiocese announced Saturday that a priest had offered to resign  because of a relationship with the same woman whose "intimate" ties with  Archbishop Eugene Marino forced him to step down last month.  </P> <P> The woman, 27-year-old Vicki R. Long, sued the church for paternity payments  stemming from her alleged relationship with a third priest.  </P> <P> The church is paying child support, but denies that the priest is the father.  </P> <P> Father Michael Woods, pastor at St. Jude's Catholic Church in Sandy Springs, an  Atlanta suburb, offered to resign after confessing to an intimate relationship  with Long, a Riverdale lay minister, said Bishop James Lyke, acting  administrator of the Atlanta Archdiocese.  </P> <P> It was not known if the church had accepted Wood's resignation.  </P> <P> The bishop said Woods used an undisclosed amount of parish funds to help Long.  In a statement read to his congregation by an archdiocese spokesman, Woods said  his relationship with Long has ended.  </P></p>

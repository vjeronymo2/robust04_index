			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 1541 GMT on 12 April carries a  10-minute interview -- live or recorded -- with S.A. Filatov,  head of the Administration of the President of the Russian  Federation, conducted by an unidentified interviewer. Filatov  answers three questions: on the proposed political accord, the  alleged blacklist of former Supreme Soviet deputies, and the  composition of the Constitutional Court.    Filatov says that the people voted for a market economy and  everyone agrees that there can be no going back; an agreement on  political accord would ensure continuity of policies, to the  benefit of all.    Filatov says that the so-called blacklist contains the names  of those Supreme Soviet deputies who remained in the White House  and fomented disorder; they will not receive financial  compensation for their loss of income; housing rights will be  decided on an individual basis.    Moving on to the question of the Constitutional Court,  Filatov says: "I personally consider that the members of the  Constitutional Court, as it was composed at the time, were  considerably to blame for the harm which was caused to our  state, ending with the dramatic events of last October. You may  recall that the Constitutional Court was elected at the Congress  of People's Deputies and it seems to me that, right from the  start, the principle governing the nomination of the members of  the Constitutional Court was incorrectly drawn up, because the  nominations were to a considerable extent made by the political  groupings, and the regions had very little representation on  these questions.    "Unfortunately, we got a Constitutional Court which to a  considerable extent represented various political forces. Hence  the latest instruction issued by Boris Nikolayevich, and the  instruction that the Council for Personnel Policy should draw up  recommendations on the list of those candidates for the  Constitutional Court which it should put forward to the  Federation Council for appointment. We have now examined this  question at the Council for Personnel Policy. We have agreed  that the main criterion which we will look at in each candidate  is his political neutrality. So, the candidate should not be a  politician, should not be the leader of a party, political  grouping etc. He should be in the first place a professional at  his job.    "If the condition is observed that political neutrality and  professionalism should be placed first, then there is no reason  why the law on the Constitutional Court should not be adopted.  I think that it is clear to everyone that such a law is now  very much needed. It is particularly necessary now for the  Third Estate, the third structure of power, to go into operation  when work has begun on adopting the laws of the Russian  Federation," Filatov concludes.</p>

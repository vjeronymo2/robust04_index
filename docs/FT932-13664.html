			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Medical side overtakes aerospace at Smiths THE DOWNTURN in civil aviation means Smiths Industries has for the first time made more profits from medical products than aerospace, the UK group's traditional activity. Smiths reported a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 44.3m to Pounds 40.3m in the six months to January 30. Delays in defence procurement and the reduction in civil aircraft programmes caused trading profits from aerospace to slump from Pounds 18.2m to Pounds 13.9m, on sales down from Pounds 184m to Pounds 175m. The aerospace downturn was partly offset by a strong performance by the rapidly expanding medical systems division, which increased trading profits from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 16.1m on sales which rose from Pounds 63.8m to Pounds 84.8m. Overall sales increased from Pounds 307.4m to Pounds 328m. Acquisitions were responsible for Pounds 17.1m of sales and contributed Pounds 3m to total operating profit of Pounds 38.6m (up from Pounds 37.8m). Industrial, the group's third division, increased trading profits from Pounds 8m to Pounds 8.6m. Mr Roger Hurn, chairman and chief executive, said: 'The medical systems group will be a major contributor to the future success of Smiths Industries.' In spite of the heavy spending on acquisitions, Smiths still had net cash of Pounds 5m. Interest receivable fell from Pounds 6.5m to Pounds 4.3m. Cashflow from operations increased substantially to Pounds 51.9m from Pounds 37.9m. Earnings per share fell to 9.2p from 10.1p. The interim dividend is lifted by 5 per cent to 4.3p from 4.1p.

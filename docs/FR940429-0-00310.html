A borrower is not considered totally and permanently disabled on the basis of a condition that existed at the time he or she applied for the loan, unless the borrower's condition has substantially deteriorated later, so as to render the borrower totally and permanently disabled. In the case of a Consolidation loan, the borrower must certify that the condition did not exist prior to the time the borrower applied for each of the underlying loans, unless the condition has substantially deteriorated, so as to render the borrower totally and permanently disabled. If the condition existed prior to the date the Consolidation loan was made, the borrower must provide the lender with the disbursement dates of the underlying loans if the information does not already appear in the borrower's loan file possessed by the lender.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Closed school <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ._(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

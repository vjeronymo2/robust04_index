			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At today's upper house plenary session, Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa reiterated that the national defense  program, which defines the government's basic thinking on  defense, needs to be reviewed. He said that such a review does  not necessarily have to aim at cutting back on the defense  forces.    Questioning the cabinet at this afternoon's session, Yutaka  Takeyama of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] asked about the  review of the national defense program being carried out. He  noted that regional tensions remain high even after the end of  the Cold War, as on the Korean peninsula, for example. He said  that the current situation does not warrant a cutback in the  Self-Defense Forces [SDF].    In reply, Prime Minister Hosokawa said that a review needs  to  be carried out of the concept of the program, including on the  question of what Japan's basic defense capabilities should be.  He stated that the review is currently under way in the  government, and he insisted that the review is not necessarily  aimed at reducing defense.    Yutaka Shimomura, a member of the Niin Club [upper house  floor group], was the last speaker at the interpellation session  today. He noted that the Hosokawa government retains high  popularity, although it is perhaps not as popular as it once  was. He said this means that Mr. Hosokawa should keep in mind  that he must live up to the expectations of the people and that  Mr. Hosokawa himself should come up with measures to make this  possible.    In his response, Hosokawa stated that his government was  born  surrounded by the warm expectations of the people on reform, and  that it continues to receive the support of the people as it  proceeds with these reforms. He said he continues to be  committed to the structural reforms of politics and the economy  to give a new priority to working people.</p>

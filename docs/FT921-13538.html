			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / FT Law Report: Italian banks cannot be sued in UK ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND v CASSA DI RISPARMIO DELLE PROVINCIE LOMBARD AND OTHERS Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Mustill, Lord Justice Butler-Sloss and Sir John Megaw): December 19 1991 THE UNIFORM Customs and Practice, when incorporated into an agreement between the issuing bank and the accepting bank under a letter of credit, does not dominate over express terms. And accordingly, where the parties expressly agree that reimbursement by the issuing bank should take place through its agent in the US, that is the 'primary obligation in question' on a reimbursement claim by the accepting bank, for the purpose of determining jurisdiction under the 1968 Brussels Convention, irrespective of any underlying obligation the issuing bank may have under the UCP to reimburse in the UK on non-performance by the agent. The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by the plaintiff, Royal Bank of Scotland plc (RBS), from Mr Justice Phillips's decision (FT, December 11 1990) setting aside service of proceedings in six actions by RBS against the defendant Italian banks, Cassa Di Risparmio Delle Provincie Lombard, Banco Populare di Bergamo SCaRL and others, on the ground that the English court had no jurisdiction to hear the claims. Article 2 of the Jurisdiction and Judgments Convention 1968, incorporated into UK law by the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982, provides that 'persons domiciled in a contracting state shall, whatever their nationality, be sued in the courts of that state'. Article 5: 'A person sued in a contracting state may, in another contracting state, be sued: (1) in matters relating to a contract, in the courts for the place of performance of the obligation in question . . .' that Italian importers purchased a consignment of pears, payment to be in dollars in London via irrevocable letters of credit in favour of CIR Ltd. A letter of credit to that effect was opened by Bergamo, available by RBS's acceptance of drafts drawn on RBS. RBS was asked to add its confirmation. The message making that request included a provision that on receipt of regular documents RBS should accept a beneficiary draft drawn on RBS 'and at maturity you are authorised to reimburse yourselves with Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co - New York'. The contract between Bergamo and RBS was subject to the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, ICC No 400 1983 Revision. Article 11d of the UCP provided that, by requesting a bank to add its confirmation, the issuing bank authorised it to pay, accept or negotiate against documents 'and undertakes to reimburse such bank in accordance with the provisions of these articles'. Article 16a provided that, if an authorised bank effected payment, or negotiated against documents which appeared on their face to be accordance with the credit, 'the party giving such authority shall be bound to reimburse the bank which has effected payment . . . or negotiated . . .' Article 21b provided that an issuing bank would not be relieved from any of its obligations to reimburse if reimbursement was not effected by the reimbursing bank. On March 13 1990 RBS reported to Bergamo that it had forwarded the credit to CIR, adding its own confirmation. On April 2 CIR presented the shipping documents to RBS in London. On April 3 RBS, after obtaining Bergamo's permission, took them up and accepted CIR's draft, expressed to mature on May 23. Immediately on taking up the documents RBS took back the draft from CIR and discounted it, crediting the net amount to CIR's account. While the bill was still current Bergamo received information giving grounds to suspect that the underlying transaction was affected by fraud and that the documents negotiated under the credit might be false. On May 14 it telexed RBS suggesting it held back payment on the due date. That was too late to prevent the discounting of the bill. On May 22 Bergamo confirmed it was unable to pay RBS, and requested it to refrain from claiming reimbursement from Manufacturers Hanover which, it said, was no longer authorised to reimburse RBS. RBS nevertheless did claim reimbursement when the bill matured. Manufacturers Hanover declined, as it was bound to do in the light of the changed instruction. It had no connection with the transaction save as Bergamo's agent. RBS sought what it called 'reimbursement' from Bergamo in the present action, by issuing a writ. What it was claiming was not indemnity against the amount paid to the holder of its acceptance at maturity, but compensation equal to the amount for which it had bought back its own acceptance from the holder-beneficiary. Pursuant to the practice for service under the Jurisdiction and Judgments Convention, the writ was issued without leave. It stated that the court had power under the 1982 Act to hear and determine the claim. It was pleaded that, on the maturity date of May 23, RBS became entitled to be reimbursed Dollars 137,088 by Bergamo, and that Bergamo had failed to pay in breach of its contract with RBS. By article 5 of the Convention, a person sued in a contracting state might be sued in contractual matters in another contracting state, in the 'place of performance of the obligation in question'. In Shenavai v Kreischer (1987) ECR 239 the European Court said that 'where various obligations are at issue, it will be the principal obligation which will determine jurisdiction'. Italy and the UK were 'contracting states' for the purposes of the Convention. The US was not. Bergamo moved to set aside the writ, maintaining that the 'obligation in question' for the purposes of article 5(1) did not fall for performance in the UK and that, accordingly, under article 2 the proper place for service was Italy. RBS argued that the legal structure of the relationship between the parties to a documentary credit transaction was created by the UCP, and that so far as reimbursement of the accepting bank by the issuing bank was concerned, the obligation was created and defined by article 11d and 16a of UCP. It said failure to reimburse was merely failure of the contemplated mechanism and it was the obligation of the issuing bank itself to pay pursuant to article 21b which constituted the principal obligation forming the basis of the proceedings. Hence, it was said, in accordance with Shenavai it was to that obligation that the court should look when ascertaining the place of performance of the obligation in question for the purposes of article 5(1). Neither the UCP nor the other terms of the contract stipulated the place where that obligation was to be performed so, it was contended, under English law place of performance was London where the RBS branch carried on business. Mr Justice Phillips did not accept those contentions. The case was founded on the proposition that the contractual relationship was dominated by the UCP and that the issuing bank's obligation to reimburse RBS derived solely from articles 11 and 16. That was not so. The UCP had an important role in the conduct of international trade. It expounded technical terms. It promoted consistency; and it enabled the parties to express their intentions briefly, without the need to negotiate and set out all the terms of the relationship at length. Nevertheless, it did not constitute a statutory code. It contained a formulation of customs and practices which the parties to a letter of credit transaction could incorporate into their contract by reference. That being so, the obvious place to start when searching for a contractual term material to a particular obligation, was the express agreement between the parties. Thus, when inquiring into the manner in which the issuing bank was to effect reimbursement, the court must look first at what the parties had expressly agreed. It found the answer at once - reimbursement was to be made by Manufacturers Hanover in New York. The 'obligation in question' for the purposes of article 5 was the obligation to effect reimbursement, and that was an obligation which was due for performance outside the jurisdiction of the English court. The appeals were dismissed. Their Lordships agreed. For RBS: Timothy Walker QC and Alan Griffiths (Slaughter and May) For the first five defendants: Simon Tuckey QC and Jeremy Storey (Mackenzie Mills) For the sixth defendant: Richard Aikens QC and Jeremy Storey (Norton Rose)</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff  requested Congress study the possibilities of establishing  external controls on the immense power held by the institution  he heads. He also asked the legislature to explore mechanisms  to establish other types of precautionary measures, other than  imprisonment, to ensure that those under investigation appear  before prosecutors and judges.    The prosecutor general's requests were made yesterday during  a seminar for criminal prosecutors organized by the Attorney  General's Office. De Greiff, Attorney General Carlos Gustavo  Arrieta, Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez, and Deputy Prosecutor  General Francisco Sintura attended the seminar.    Regarding the first request, the prosecutor general said  legislators had not established controls on "the great amount of  power given to prosecutors and that it is necessary to establish  controls for the future."    De Greiff said there is a 2d Court of Appeals at the  Prosecutor General's Office, but this in itself is a  contradiction because those who file suit in the 1st and 2d  Courts of Appeals are delegates of the prosecutor general and  belong to a body that has a unified administration, hierarchy,  and follows general administrative procedures and criminal  guidelines established by the prosecutor general of the  Republic. "We respect this 2d Court of Appeals, because we do  not attempt to have absolute power but, rather, one sole  criminal policy, not many policies as in the past," the  prosecutor general said.    Regarding precautionary measures, he said "arrest warrants  must be issued as an exception and when we do not have a  guarantee the person under investigation will present himself to  the authorities. It is more appropriate to promote legislative  reforms that will allow us other types of precautionary  measures, such as bail," de Greiff said.    He admitted there are prosecutors who are quick to issue  precautionary measures and involve people in cases. "Certain  prosecutors are frequently quick to issue precautionary  measures, and we have noticed people are precipitately involved  many times in cases under investigation, as can be seen at  inquiries when the prosecutor does not have all the necessary  facts to ask questions," de Greiff added.    The prosecutor general also said the institutions can no  longer allow validation of the assertion: "Nobody is refused an  arrest warrant in Colombia." "This sentence is shocking and has  been in effect since the time when there were criminal  investigation judges."    The prosecutor general stated his position regarding a  possible increase of jail sentences for several crimes and said  increasing the penalties to the maximum is not the solution.  The important thing is, he said, to have a penitentiary system  that guarantees the rehabilitation of the criminal. "We gain  nothing by putting all the hoods in jail if we do not have a  penitentiary system that will give them a chance to  rehabilitate," de Greiff said.  <H5>  Arrest Warrants </H5>   "Several people say the best system is the one in the United  States, where drug traffickers are given long sentences or life.  Let me tell you this is not true. Those penalties are imposed  on Colombian drug traffickers, not U.S. drug traffickers. I do  not know of a single case where a U.S. drug trafficker has been  sentenced to life."    For his part, Arrieta said the Attorney General's Office  should be committed to completing its investigations, that its  role should expand and include the assurance that due process is  complied with to safeguard respect for human rights, and that  the law is interpreted and implemented correctly. "The main  goal is to advance from formulating measures to restricting  personal freedom to the point where such measures are only used  when necessary to guarantee the appearance of those accused at  court," the attorney general said.    According to Arrieta, personnel of the Attorney General's  Office must be vigilant in stopping certain prosecutors' abuses  of issuing preventive arrest warrants. "We must adapt Colombian  criminal law to international laws that recommend freedom as a  basic principle during the investigative phase and thus leave  jails for those who are serving imposed sentences."    For his part, the justice minister said the current Criminal  Procedures Code had improved the trial system because, according  to him, it was an important instrument in inhibiting impunity,  clearing the backlog in legal offices, and avoiding expiration  of investigations.  <H5>  No contacts with the Cali Cartel </H5>   Yesterday, De Greiff and Arrieta said they have had no  contacts with lawyers of important Cali Cartel members for  several months. According to de Greiff, the Prosecutor General's  Office is waiting for the Valle drug traffickers to understand  that the best alternative is to surrender to justice and that  his office is willing to further this process. Arrieta said  "the Cali Cartel lawyers are most surely waiting for the change  in government to reinitiate their advances."    The prosecutor general and the attorney general commented on  other current national events:    The Hidden Microphones in Samper's Campaign: The prosecutor  general said it is being investigated, "but it will be difficult  to find the culprits in this crime due to a lack of evidence.  We will investigate as much as possible."    Retirement Age: The prosecutor said he is waiting for the  Supreme Court to define if he is an official with an established  term or if he must retire when he is 65 years of age.    Church and Politics: The attorney general said the call made  by several bishops for their parishioners to vote for one of the  candidates is unjustified. "I believe Monsignor Castrillon's  call was a personal one and did not include the church as a  whole. Church interference in politics is something we have  already surpassed. It does not have any justification at this  time."    Disaster Attention Office: The attorney general said the  Attorney General's Office will investigate as soon as the  emergency subsides whether the officials in that government  office had been negligent. "What is important now is attending  to the victims. We will start to investigate once this phase is  over. It would be senseless to do so now."</p>

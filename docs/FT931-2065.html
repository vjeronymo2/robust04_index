			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Letter: Omissions regarding Telegraph purchase of Southam stake Sir, Several important facts were missing from your article on March 20 ('Purchase of Southam stake by The Telegraph delayed'), about the deferral of the Telegraph plc extraordinary general meeting to consider the purchase from its parent, Hollinger (which is not a private company as you reported), of half that company's interest in Southam, Canada's leading newspaper publisher. The deferral of the meeting (likely by less than a week), will enable The Telegraph to present a supplementary circular describing the changed circumstances created by the sale of Southam treasury shares to Power Corporation of Canada. Hollinger believes this development to be wholly positive. Indeed, it could not have occurred without Hollinger's strong support. Power Corporation will average down its cost of Southam shares drastically with this purchase. The Telegraph and Hollinger will be free to average down also, if the Southam share price does not rise too swiftly. Southam stock is now above its price on the date of Hollinger's purchase of the shares, half of which are being offered to The Telegraph, a price about 50 per cent below where the company's shares were trading in mid-1990, and Power Corporation is paying a higher price per share than a generally distributed sale from treasury would yield. Most important, your article inexplicably omitted all mention of the agreement between Hollinger and Power Corporation, whose benefits The Telegraph will share, which largely vacates the so-called 'poison pill' arrangements which could have curtailed Hollinger's and The Telegraph's ability to be a constructive influence at Southam. No such modifications would have been accepted by Southam without the Power Corporation investment. Now, Hollinger and Power, long-standing corporate friends and on occasion allies, will be able effectively to assist Southam management in accelerating the profit turnaround that seems already to have begun. The agreement assures an absolute equality between Power and Hollinger and its affiliates despite any fluctuations in shareholdings. Power's investment greatly strengthens Southam at no cost to Hollinger or The Telegraph. I know of no precedent (and I doubt whether Lex does either) for one newspaper company to be offered so strategic a shareholding in another great newspaper company with the right to sell back its shares at its cost for a year. The only downside to The Telegraph is the interest for the year on the money required to buy the shares: less than 3 per cent, net of taxes and dividends. The upside could be astronomical and the addition to The Telegraph's earnings, through equity accounting, should add appreciably to The Telegraph's share price. This is a classic corporate recovery, identified by the same source, Hollinger, which discovered and made good on the Telegraph and Fairfax opportunities and which brought The Telegraph the one-year unrealised Pounds 65m capital gain at Fairfax and the six-month Pounds 6m gain on Trinity International shares. It is presented to The Telegraph as another outstanding opportunity and I am confident it will be approved and will be a worthy sequel to those earlier successes. Given our expectations of being able to raise our participation in Fairfax and Southam, the proposed investment will also create under The Telegraph the finest confederation, commercially and editorially, of newspaper titles ever assembled in one corporate affiliation. The Telegraph's independent directors and minority shareholders will short-change themselves if they do not subscribe to this almost-risk free opportunity. In that unlikely event, Hollinger will be mystified but consolable to take the entire benefit for itself. Conrad Black, chairman, Hollinger and The Telegraph</p>

			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Kenya's opposition may boycott poll KENYA'S opposition parties, worried the government might try dirty tricks, are considering a boycott of the country's first multi-party elections in 26 years, raising doubts about the electoral process. Senior opposition officials are angry and frustrated by the lack of transparency in the National Electoral Commission, which is organising the polls, and by the government's continued harassment of the opposition and blocking of opposition campaigning in a number of provinces. Over the weekend four opposition parties accused the government of preparing to rig the elections. The Democratic party said it was clear the NEC was incapable of organising free and fair elections. Mr Martin Shikuku, secretary general of Ford-Asili, called for the postponement of elections and the immediate resignation of Mr Justice Chesoni, chairman of the NEC. Mr Robert Shaw, an economic adviser to the main opposition party, Ford-Kenya, warned that if elections went ahead under current conditions, 'the prospects for social discord and post-electoral instability are significant.' The opposition also say the government has not agreed a plan of monitoring for international observers.</p>

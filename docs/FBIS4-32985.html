			<p>BFN     [Text] Surpassing every attendance prediction, more than  200 Sandinist cadres representing all segments of society forged  ahead with what they now call the Sandinist Renewal Movement  [Movimiento Renovador Sandinista] in an meeting held Friday  night at the IPADE [Institute for the Development of Democracy].    Dr. Sergio Ramirez opened the meeting with an analysis of  the  Special Congress, stressing that programmatic views were given  little attention, even though this was the primary purpose  behind convening the congress.    Dr. Ramirez said that in order to save Sandinism and make it  viable in future elections, the inferior leadership that was  elected at the congress had to be left behind, because this kind  of FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] does not have the  remotest possibility of influencing the rest of Nicaraguan  society.    The participants marched on stage and, putting aside the  topic of the authenticity of the FSLN Congress, focused on  offering formulas for continuing the work of the renewal current.    They all agreed that the job had just begun and that a great  deal of work remained to be done. Taking advantage of the fact  that representatives from nearly every department were present,  they began to outline the work that will be conducted nationwide.    Those in attendance were informed that the "purges"  conducted  in the congress were rejected both at home and abroad. They  also learned about the widespread feelings of Sandinists who do  not belong to the squalid structures and who oppose the control  the conservative sector has gained over the party leadership.    Some speakers predicted the National Directorate will veer  to  the right in alliance with COSEP [Higher Council of Private  Enterprise]. The conservative trend was revealed during a news  conference held by the reelected secretary general after the  congress concluded.</p>

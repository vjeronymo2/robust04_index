			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 26 (CTK) -- Interior Minister Jan Ruml  says in an interview for today's left-leaning RUDE PRAVO that he  knows for certain that General Karel Pezl, former head of the  Czech Army's General Staff and now an adviser to Defense  Minister Antonin Baudys, has a clean screening (lustration)  certificate. Ruml said he believed that the result of the  screening of General Rostislav Kotil, head of the South sector  of the UNPROFOR forces in Croatia, would be the same.    He was reacting to recent media allegations that both  generals had failed the screening tests which must be taken by  all persons in or entering high office to see if they had  collaborated with or been an agent of the former communist  secret police. These allegations were confirmed by Tomas Fejfar  (ODS), deputy chairman of parliament's defense and security  committee, on May 24, but Baudys does not agree.    Ruml also confirmed that Baudys had taken an interest in the  results of Pezl's test. He said it had not yet been shown that  officers who failed their screening tests were working in the  army. "I have ordered a new inspection of all the documents  concerning the screening law to be carried out, and nothing like  this has been shown yet," Ruml told CTK on May 24.</p>

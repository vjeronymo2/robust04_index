			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol is marking the 17th year of its air-to-ground  anti-speeder program, and the CHP reports its "air force" is alive and well  around the state. "We do enough to keep the ground units busy," said CHP  Officer Earl Clemente, one of about 30 pilots who fly single-engine aircraft  over the freeways around the state. Courts have ruled that the program is not a  speed trap. Clemente explained that in designated areas, the CHP has laid out  white hash marks a mile apart on the shoulder of the highway. By timing a car  from one mark to another, officers aloft can determine a motorist's speed.  </P></p>

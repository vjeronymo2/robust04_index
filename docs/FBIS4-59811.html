			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] AL-THAWRAH writes about the visit to Syria by the  chief of U.S. diplomacy, noting the U.S. secretary's impressions  of the visit, particularly Syria's commitment to the peace  process and its honest concern to give it the required momentum  to reach the desired and definite objective.    AL-THAWRAH says the Syrian trend and endeavor toward  reaching  a solution and settlement have always been governed by firm  principles. The paper adds: The red lines, which nobody can  bypass, remained the essence over which there is no bargaining.  These red lines -- which are based on the resolutions of the  United Nations and the Security Council and which underscore the  full implementation of these resolutions on all fronts to  guarantee the restoration of all Arab rights -- have always been  the point of reference and the basis for a just and honorable  solution and have always been appreciated by the world.    AL-THAWRAH notes a matter realized by everybody, namely,  following the signing of the Oslo and Cairo self-rule agreements  with the PLO, Israel has escalated its aggressiveness and  terrorism inside and outside the occupied territory.  Furthermore, Israel did not hesitate to bring into its military  arsenals sophisticated and internationally banned offensive  weapons. This has exposed Israel's intentions toward peace and  revealed the intentions of its rulers toward making gains at the  expense of Arab rights.    AL-THAWRAH adds: Syria, which accepted peace as a strategic  option, cannot accept any Israeli presence on any inch of the  Golan. Syria also adheres to a comprehensive solution on all  tracks, insists on the principle of a comprehensive withdrawal  from the occupied Arab territory in exchange for a complete  peace, and categorically rejects partial solutions.    Concluding, AL-THAWRAH stresses the need for undoing the  difficult Israeli knot, straightening and rectifying the course  of the Tel Aviv rulers, and binding them to the Madrid point of  reference and to implementing international legitimacy's  resolutions. This is the task of the international community  inasmuch as it is the task and responsibility of the U.S.  sponsor for the sake of peace in the Middle East.    TISHRIN says the sought peace should be based on  international legitimacy's resolutions, adding that since the  beginning of the peace process Syria has reiterated its  commitment to a just and comprehensive peace. TISHRIN notes  that Syria is very much concerned about peace and that it will  spare no efforts to activate the peace process and to help it  achieve its objectives.    TISHRIN adds that the whole world is a witness to Syria's  credibility, its sound course toward the peace process, and its  full commitment to the requirements of this process. The paper  adds that since the beginning Syria has been aware of the fact  the path of peace does not pass at all through partial  solutions, phased settlements, or individual deals. Syria  believes that peace can only be achieved through ending the  entire occupation and ushering the region into an age of  stability and security.    TISHRIN stresses that the occupation, over all the years of  Arab-Israeli conflict, has been the source of chaos and tension  and the cause of wars, tragedies, and cycles of violence.  Syria, which supports a just and comprehensive peace and  adheres to ending the occupation, bases its stand on the  resolutions of international legitimacy which provide for  Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories and the  inadmissibility of Israeli forces' occupation of these  territories. Syria's objective is to reach the peace that  guarantees restoration of Arab lands and full rights.    Concluding, TISHRIN says: For this, Syria responded to all  international political efforts, particularly the American  efforts. It always welcomed the role of the U.S. sponsor as a  full partner and fair broker in the peace process who works to  implement the U.S. initiative based on the return of land in  exchange for peace. Through this agreement, Syria opened the  road of peace, worked to achieve it on just bases, and  reiterated its continuous readiness to give a momentum to the  peace process. Syria hopes U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's tour will produce positive results to salvage the  peace process.</p>

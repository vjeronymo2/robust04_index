			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 6 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  dismissed as groundless a press report that the Seoul Government  will accept North Korean loggers in Siberia seeking political  asylum in South Korea, Presidential Spokesman Chu Ton-sik said  Wednesday.    While briefing business leaders on his recent visits to  Japan  and China over lunch at Chongwadae, President Kim said, "more  than 90 North Korean laborers in Russia have applied for asylum  in South Korea through our consulate-general or embassy but the  government is not accepting them in order not to get on the  nerves of North Korea."    "The government's position on the matter remains the same as  before and the government is not considering bringing in the  North Koreans at the moment," the chief executive was quoted as  saying.</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> LEGISLATORS TOADY TO CHICKENS, MARMOTS  </P> <P> You probably didn't know that the national welfare was threatened by an  epidemic of toad-licking. You might not be aware that people are scaring the  very life out of the chickens of America.  </P> <P> Don't panic. While you've been blithely ignoring the world's problems, state  legislators around the nation have been earning their pay by discovering these  and other predicaments -- some more serious than others -- and boldly trying to  solve them.  </P> <P> Bills have been introduced this year to exempt ostrich steaks from California's  state sales tax, to improve campaign manners in New Mexico and to encourage  people to beat up flag burners in Tennessee.  </P> <P> "Potty parity" for women is the goal of bills in Pennsylvania and Maryland. The  bills would require more toilets for women to eliminate the long lines that  form outside women's restrooms in stadiums, convention halls and other public  places.  </P> <P> There have been proposals to designate the "senior hoary marmot" at the  Anchorage Zoo as the official State Marmot of Alaska, the yucca moth as the  official State Insect of Colorado, and -- we're not making this up -- the  Crider soil series as the official State Soil of Kentucky, the Houdek soil as  the official State Soil of South Dakota and the Kalkaska soil series as the  official State Soil of Michigan.  </P> <P> West Virginia legislators are considering a proposal to give lottery tickets to  motorists who use their seat belts. A generous legislator in Indiana wanted to  pay citizens $25, in the form of an income tax credit, for voting.  </P> <P> And a state senator in New Mexico proposed creating a new county -- named after  him.  </P> <P> You might be tempted to believe that all is not serious in America's  legislatures. But that would be ignoring some of the issues facing elected  officials.  </P> <P> It turns out, for instance, that there are people who get their kicks licking  toads. According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, South American cane toads  secrete a hallucinogenic toxin that can get the licker as high as a tree frog.  </P> <P> Legislators in Georgia and South Carolina have introduced bills to outlaw the  practice.  </P> <P> "They say these frogs grow to the size of a dinner plate," said horrified Rep.  Pat Harris of South Carolina. "I don't want to see somebody walk across the  Statehouse grounds with a frog on a leash and pick him up and lick him."  </P> <P> You may laugh, but only until you consider the plight of the common chicken.  </P> <P> One of Harris' colleagues, Rep. Larry Koon, has introduced a bill making it  illegal in South Carolina to fire a gun within 300 yards of a chicken coop.  </P> <P> The sound of gunshot, it seems, can cause chickens to lose their vaunted  self-composure, jump into a pile and suffocate each other.  </P> <P> "Last year, one of Mr. Koon's constituents had chickens in a house," explained  Rep. Tom Rhoad. "Someone had a dove shoot in the field right next to the  chicken house. And the guns fired and caused the chickens to huddle up in a  corner, and the farmer lost over 1,000 chickens."  </P> <P> Then there is the plight of whales and turtles. Environmentalists say  helium-filled balloons like the ones released by the thousands at football  halftime shows can drift out to sea, pop and shower their remnants into the  water for whales and turtles to eat. The balloons can kill them.  </P> <P> With that in mind, a bill was introduced in the Tennessee Senate to prohibit  the launching of clusters of more than 24 balloons at sporting events or  political conventions unless the balloons disintegrate in water -- but the  author of the bill made one little mistake.  </P> <P> The bill, as written, would allow one cluster of 24 balloons for every person  at an event -- which means that as many as 2.3 million balloons could be  released from the University of Tennessee Neyland Stadium at a single game.  </P> <P> The popping alone would be enough to give a chicken the shakes.  </P></p>

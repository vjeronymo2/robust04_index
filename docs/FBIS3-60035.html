			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at  1100 GMT on 3 January reports that the Tel Aviv police this  morning arrested 29 people believed to be some of the largest  drug dealers in the country. The commander of the Central Unit,  David Kohen, said police in the past had not gathered sufficient  evidence to prosecute them, but a couple of addicts had helped  them collect incriminating testimony.    Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST in English on 4 January in a  page 12 report by Raine Marcus reports that "police raided the  Abu-Sayf clan's Yafo orchards early yesterday morning, arresting  27 alleged dope dealers and seizing 268 grams of heroin,  electronic scales, and other drug paraphernalia.    Every few months, the Tel Aviv narcotics squad raids the  heavily guarded orchards, known as a center for much of the  city's drug trade. Several clan members are currently in jail."    Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew on 5 January, in a page 5 report by  Eli Brenner, says that a policeman yesterday seized 15 kg of  marijuana in a south Tel Aviv apartment.</p>

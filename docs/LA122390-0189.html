			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTH HOLLYWOOD TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> TITLE A CAKEWALK FOR GRANADA HILLS  </P> <P> A few moments after his team had handily won the North Hollywood tournament  Saturday night, Granada Hills High Coach Bob Johnson was handed a microphone  and asked to offer a few words about each player.  </P> <P> He hemmed.  </P> <P> He hawed.  </P> <P> He almost blushed.  </P> <P> His team had no such trouble getting started -- and was nowhere near as humble.  The Highlanders are ready for prime time.  </P> <P> Granada Hills scored 35 points in the second quarter and easily routed El  Camino Real, 106-73, in the championship game. It marked the Highlanders' third  North Hollywood tournament title in the past five years.  </P> <P> Granada Hills, the lone City Section 4-A Division team in the event and the  top-ranked team in the region by The Times, squeezed 19 first-half turnovers  out of the young Conquistadores, who started two sophomores.  </P> <P> The game might have been over in the first five minutes, by which time Granada  Hills (10-1) had rolled up a 15-3 lead.  </P> <P> How lopsided was it? El Camino Real's starting center, Chris Teich, left for  the locker room with a gash on his elbow in the first quarter, leaving behind a  trail of blood on the hardwood.  </P> <P> "We started in a man-to-man, full-court press," Johnson said. "That seemed to  rattle them a little bit."  </P> <P> It was shake, rattle and roll, right to the title.  </P> <P> "We just came out and went right for the championship," Granada Hills forward  Jerry Allen said. "We put the pressure on."  </P> <P> Granada Hills led, 56-25, at halftime, and three Highlander players had already  reached double figures. Allen blew open the game by scoring 12 of his game-high  26 points in the third quarter as Granada Hills took a 78-52 lead.  </P> <P> Allen, selected the tournament's most valuable player, emerged from a scoring  rut of sorts. The 6-foot-4 senior had scored 23 points in each of the past four  games.  </P> <P> In fact, Allen has been playing so well that Johnson seems to be getting  spoiled. Maybe he has his reasons -- Allen was averaging 22.5 points, 12.9  rebounds and six assists entering the game. Allen also had 17 rebounds and five  assists against the Conquistadores.  </P> <P> "He scored 26 points?" Johnson said. "That was a sneaky 26."  </P> <P> The rest of the attack was as direct as a head-on collision. Six Highlanders  scored in double figures as Johnson cleared the bench. Leading the the  double-digit honor roll were George Vicuna and Adrian Sellers with 12 points  each. Sagy Koren, Randy Eason and Shelton Simmons added 11.  </P> <P> Markee Brown, a sophomore, led El Camino Real with 24 points. Clyde Price added  14 and Sam Sarpong, another sophomore starter, scored 13.  </P> <P> Allen put the game away for good -- not that it was really in doubt -- by  scoring three consecutive Highlander baskets in the third quarter.  </P> <P> After El Camino Real (6-2) crawled within 63-40, Allen scored inside on a  follow shot, slammed home a breakaway dunk and then tipped in an alley-oop lob  to give Granada Hills a 69-42 lead with 3 minutes 35 seconds left in the  quarter.  </P> <P> In other games:  </P> <P> Grant 52, North Hollywood 42 -- North Hollywood (6-4) crept within 43-39 with  3:21 remaining, but Grant's Jason Astor nailed a 15-foot jump shot to give the  Lancers a six-point lead in the third-place game.  </P> <P> Eric Brown (six points, seven assists) added a three-point shot to give Grant a  48-39 lead with 2:10 left.  </P> <P> Brunell Mori scored a team-high 13 points and added 16 rebounds to lead Grant  (7-2), which has beaten North Hollywood twice this season.  </P> <P> Reseda 76, Bell-Jeff 62 -- Junior swingman Marquis Burns scored 13 of his  game-high 23 points in the second half to hold off a Bell-Jeff rally and lead  the Regents (4-4) to the consolation title.  </P> <P> A trio of Reseda players took turns carrying the team offensively. With the  Regents leading, 45-36, at halftime, Burns scored seven of his team's 11 points  in the third quarter.  </P> <P> James Pigford added 19 points for Reseda, including 10 in the second quarter.  </P> <P> Bennie Scott, who finished with 10 points, scored eight in the first quarter as  the Regents took a 26-17 lead.  </P> <P> James Chen had 12 points for Reseda. Brian Lee scored a team-high 19 for  Bell-Jeff (4-5) and teammates Ignacio Castro (18) and Bob Machuca (12) also  scored in double figures.  </P></p>

The amendments are necessary to implement Public Law 101&hyph;508, enacted November 5, 1990, which mandates that the NRC recover approximately 100 percent of its budget authority in Fiscal Year (FY) 1994 less amounts appropriated from the Nuclear Waste Fund (NWF). The amount to be recovered for FY 1994 is approximately $513 million.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  August 19, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Copies of comments received and the agency workpapers that support these final changes to 10 CFR Parts 170 and 171 may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public Law 101&hyph;508, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA&hyph;90), enacted November 5, 1990, requires that the NRC recover approximately 100 percent of its budget authority less the amount appropriated from the Department of Energy (DOE) administered NWF for FYs 1991 through 1995 by assessing fees. OBRA&hyph;90 was amended in 1993 to extend the NRC's 100 percent fee recovery requirement through 1998.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC assesses two types of fees to recover its budget authority. First, license and inspection fees, established in 10 CFR Part 170 under the authority of the Independent Offices Appropriation Act (IOAA), 31 U.S.C. 9701, recover the NRC's costs of providing individually identifiable services to specific applicants and licensees. The services provided by the NRC for which these fees are assessed include the review of applications for the issuance of new licenses or approvals, amendments to or renewal of licenses or approvals, and inspections of licensed activities. Second, annual fees, established in 10 CFR Part 171 under the authority of OBRA&hyph;90, recover generic and other regulatory costs not recovered through 10 CFR Part 170 fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsequent to enactment of OBRA&hyph;90, the NRC published six final fee rules after evaluation of public comments. On July 10, 1991 (56 FR 31472), the NRC published a final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that established the Part 170 professional hourly rate and the materials licensing and inspection fees, as well as the Part 171 annual fees, to be assessed to recover approximately 100 percent of the FY 1991 budget. In addition to establishing the FY 1991 fees, the final rule established the underlying basis and methodology for determining both the 10 CFR Part 170 hourly rate and fees and the 10 CFR Part 171 annual fees. The FY 1991 rule was challenged in Federal court by several parties. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rendered its decision on those challenges on March 16, 1993, in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Allied-Signal v. NRC, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  remanding two issues to the NRC for further consideration (988 F.2d 146 (D.C. Cir. 1993)). The court decision was also extended to cover the FY 1992 fee rule by court order dated April 30, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 17, 1992 (57 FR 13625), the NRC published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  two limited changes to 10 CFR Parts 170 and 171. The limited changes became effective May 18, 1992. The limited change to 10 CFR Part 170 allowed the NRC to bill quarterly for those license fees that were previously billed every six months. The limited change to 10 CFR Part 171 lowered in some cases the maximum annual fee of $1,800 assessed a materials licensee who qualifies as a small entity under the NRC's size standards. A lower tier small entity fee of $400 per licensed category was established for small business and non-profit organizations with gross annual receipts of less than $250,000 and small governmental jurisdictions with a population of less than 20,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 23, 1992 (57 FR 32691), and July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38666), the NRC published final rules in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that established the licensing, inspection, and annual fees necessary for the NRC to recover approximately 100 percent of its budget authority for FY 1992 and FY 1993 respectively. The basic methodology used in the FY 1992 and FY 1993 final rules was unchanged from that used to calculate the 10 CFR Part 170 professional hourly rate, the specific materials licensing and inspection fees in 10 CFR Part 170, and the 10 CFR Part 171 annual fees in the final rule published July 10, 1991 (56 FR 31472). The methodology for assessing low-level waste (LLW) costs was changed in FY 1993 in response to the judicial decision mentioned earlier. This change was explained in detail in the FY 1993 final rule published July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38669&hyph;72). In brief, the NRC created two groups_large waste generators and small waste generators. Licensees within each group are charged a uniform flat fee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 17, 1994 (59 FR 12539), the NRC reinstated the annual fee exemption for nonprofit educational institutions after notice and comment. In response to the March 16, 1993, judicial decision, the exemption had been eliminated in the final rule published by NRC on July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38666).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The American College of Nuclear Physicians and the Society of Nuclear Medicine filed a Petition for Rulemaking which included a request that the Commission exempt medical licensees from fees for services provided in nonprofit institutions. The Commission denied that request on March 17, 1994 (59 FR 12555).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 2903(c) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 required the NRC to undertake a broad review of its annual fee policies under Section 6101(c) of OBRA&hyph;90, solicit public comment on the need for policy changes, and recommend changes in existing law to the Congress that the NRC found were needed to prevent the placement of an unfair burden on certain NRC licensees. To comply with the Energy Policy Act requirements, the NRC reviewed more than 500 public comments submitted in response to the request for comment published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on April 19, 1993 (58 FR 21116), and sent its report to Congress on February 23, 1994. A copy of this report has been placed in the Public Document Room.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

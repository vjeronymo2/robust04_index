			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / White paper sets out Britain's post-Cold war defence strategy BRITAIN yesterday set out its post-Cold war defence strategy designed to allow the UK to respond to a threat anywhere in the world, rather than just in Europe. 'The strategic environment has been transformed over the last four years,' said Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, in the defence white paper published yesterday. The distinction between tasks in Europe and 'out of area' had become blurred, the white paper says. In a separate move yesterday, the government confirmed its order for a fourth and final Trident nuclear submarine. It will be built by Vickers at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. The white paper says policy aims in place since 1975 should now be replaced with three new overlapping roles: the protection and security of the UK and dependent territories, even when there is no external threat; insurance against any external threat to the UK and its allies; and promoting the UK's wider security interests through the maintenance of international peace and stability. Britain's new defence roles replace a four-pronged policy which specified commitment to Nato, the UK, mainland Europe, and sea power in the eastern Atlantic and the English Channel. Mr Rifkind said that Nato, nevertheless, remained the 'bedrock' of UK defence policy. Defence spending will rise slightly in cash terms over the next three years, the white paper says. Mr Rifkind said this still would represent savings of up to Pounds 4bn a year in real terms by the end of that period. But defence has already been identified by the Treasury as being ripe for cuts in this year's public spending round, and there are signs that a tough battle lies ahead, in spite of Mr Rifkind's assurances on cost control. Mr John Townend, the chairman of the Conservative backbench finance committee, said the UK could take on an international peacekeeping role, but the new strategy should not mean that the UK had to bear a 'disproportionate' share of the cost. Payments from other countries are a possible solution. The white paper reveals that the UK will have received Pounds 2bn in cash from Gulf war allies in payment for the UK's involvement. Opposition spokesmen condemned the white paper as a 'catalogue of lost opportunities' which showed no evidence of fresh thinking. Mr Martin O'Neill, the shadow defence secretary, highlighted what he called the paper's failure to deal adequately with the 'challenge to maritime security and air power presented by the new world order'.

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Rules of the new gas game Had it not been so long delayed, yesterday's consultation paper on the future of the UK gas market would probably have earned only routine comment. Most of it contains technical proposals for fleshing out last year's decision to abolish British Gas' monopoly; it is about detail rather than principle. Instead, the Department of Trade and Industry spent much of the day fending off accusations that its plans will trigger sharp increases in gas prices, and result in the poor and elderly being cut off from supplies. It has only itself to blame for this. But now that the consultation process is finally under way, the pace must be maintained because there is not much time if liberalisation is to be achieved by the 1998 deadline. The test of the document is whether it points the way to a competitive market without sacrificing safety or diluting the social obligations that go with a domestic gas supply. The basic organisational proposals look sound. There is to be a transitional phase during which competition will only be introduced in small measure, and some regulatory controls may continue beyond 1998 to prevent abrupt changes. British Gas may end up playing a special part for some years yet because of its market dominance and ownership of the transportation system. But it would be compensated for this. New suppliers would have to demonstrate financial strength and access to gas supplies before they could be licensed. They would also have to take on British Gas-style obligations to supply all-comers in their chosen franchise regions. A new Network Code would ensure that the players in the new game behaved. If one of them failed, the rest would pick up the pieces under a proposed bonding or insurance scheme. Where the document is less clear, and therefore less convincing, is over pricing. It acknowledges that, as the cross-subsidies in British Gas's present prices are squeezed out, there will be a process of 'rebalancing'. Furthermore, consumers who live a long way from the gas terminals could end up paying more because of the greater role that transportation costs will play in the new regime. The government's answer to these concerns is its faith in the market's ability to drive prices down. That faith will be strongly challenged in the confrontational climate which has greeted the document, and the government appears to have anticipated this by hinting that published tariffs may be required and that price controls could be extended. It is reasonable for the government to be concerned about preventing the entry of unreliable operators into the supply of a basic fuel, but the tone of the document betrays a worrying nervousness about price liberalisation. Independent gas suppliers were less than enthralled by what they saw yesterday. As it firms up the rules, the government will need to ensure that they are sufficiently attractive to draw in the new competitors without whom deregulation will fail.</p>

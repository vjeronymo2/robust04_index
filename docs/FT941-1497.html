			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Prudential refuses to join retail investment watchdog Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer, has rejected the prospect of joining the Personal Investment Authority, the new regulator to protect private investors. It is insisting instead on its right to come directly under the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog. That brings Prudential into direct conflict with the regulators, since Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, has made it clear it wanted to end SIB's role in direct regulation of retail financial services. In a strongly worded statement, Mr Mick Newmarch, Prudential chief executive, said Prudential did not believe the PIA's approach to regulation was suited to providing 'adequate and cost-effective saver protection'. It had concluded that the option of statutory regulation by the SIB was more consistent with its point of view and in the best interests of its customers, Mr Newmarch said. From July, the PIA is intended to be the single watchdog for retail financial services, replacing the existing system of separate regulators for different types of organisation, such as independent financial advisers and life companies. Mr Newmarch said the fact that the PIA had not yet developed its own rulebook, but planned to begin its work as a regulator using the rules of the existing regulators, seemed to involve 'giving a blank cheque to PIA when nothing in its history justifies that level of confidence'. At an earlier stage, such a stark challenge to the prospects for the PIA might have derailed the new regulator. But with less than a fortnight to go before the first deadline for applications, and some previous critics - such as Standard Life and Scottish Amicable - making it clear they will join, the PIA still appears poised to go ahead. Halifax, the UK's largest building society, earlier this week expressed serious reservations and said it had not decided whether to apply. The Prudential's decision was greeted with statements of regret by the SIB, the PIA and the government. The Treasury response underlined ministers' continuing determination not to be pushed into legislating for a full-blown statutory system of regulation - as Prudential would prefer. It expressed full support for the SIB's approach and added: 'Neither the PIA nor its timetable will be in any way deflected by the Pru's decision.' In practice, the SIB will be able to delegate the routine regulation to the PIA and can apply PIA standards. But it will still have to carry out its own disciplinary proceedings.

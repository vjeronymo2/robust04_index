			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Teilo Colley, PA News] </F>   [Text] A British soldier has been shot dead in Bosnia, the  Ministry of Defence [MoD] said today. Private Sean Richard  Taylor, 20, of Cleveland, was a member of the Duke of  Wellington's Regiment. He was killed last night at an  observation point at Gorazde, a Muslim enclave in the east of  the country which is surrounded by Bosnian Serb forces. He was  the sixth British soldier to die in Bosnia. The shooting came a  few days after two British soldiers were injured when an  explosion damaged their armoured vehicle six miles south-west of  Maglaj in central Bosnia. The MoD said Pte. Taylor was manning  an observation post which came under attack. He died from a  single bullet.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Commission Boosts China Links on </F> Energy Technology"; as released by Brussels EUROPEAN REPORT]    [Text] Efforts to stimulate links between the European  Union energy industry and its Chinese counterpart received a  boost from the European Commission on March 17-18. The  Commission's Directorate-General for Energy (DG XVII) organised  a two-day conference to bring together top Energy industrialists  and officials from the EU [European Union] and China to examine  ways of applying EU technology in clean coal combustion,  electricity, oil and gas to China's problems. As a follow-up,  Chinese participants will make a business tour to facilities in  the Netherlands, Germany, France and the UK on March 21-24 to  see EU energy technology in operation and establish joint  venture agreements. They then return to Brussels for further  discussions with DGXVII on how best to bring the contacts to  fruition.    China ranks third in terms of world energy production and  consumption and fostering Sino-European energy technology  cooperation is a strategy designed to bring benefits to both the  European and Chinese energy sectors. DGXVII has co-operated in  the energy field for more than 10 years with the Chinese State  Science Technology Commission through the EU's Thermie programme  for the promotion of energy technology, and Synergy, for  development of energy policy and management in non-EU countries.  With the theoretical bases well established, the Commission  felt the time was ripe to stimulate their practical application.</p>

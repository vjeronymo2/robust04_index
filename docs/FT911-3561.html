			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / New council tax may set stage for autumn poll: Two out of three households will be better off says government THE government yesterday signalled a return to the political offensive in the run up to the general election with the claim that its new property-based council tax would leave two out of three households better off. As Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, formally administered the last rites to the poll tax in the House of Commons, cabinet colleagues predicted that the stage was set for an autumn election. Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative party chairman, greeted the announcement with the pledge that: 'We now have the opportunity, which we intend to seize, to go on the attack'. Another senior minister said: 'We have not only shot the fox but we have buried it six feet under'. The details of the council tax - which will be levied on the capital value of houses and flats slotted into seven nationally-set bands - marked the final break with the policy which Mrs Margaret Thatcher had once dubbed her flagship. An avalanche of figures for every local authority in England, Scotland and Wales suggested that two out of three households would face bills of less than Pounds 400 a year if the new system were in place this year. The claims were fiercely rejected by Labour, which said the new system would be impractical and unfair. Local authority associations were split, with praise from the Conservative-controlled Association of District Councils balanced by sharp criticism from the Labour-dominated Association of Metropolitan Authorities. Mr Bryan Gould, Labour's shadow environment spokesman, said that the government's proposals meant that the poll tax would remain at least until 1993. He said that Labour's 'fair rates' plan would bring quicker and bigger savings for the voters. The Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation described the government's timetable as 'tight'. Mr Heseltine confirmed that properties would be classified in seven bands - from the cheapest, worth less than Pounds 40,000, to the most expensive valued at over Pounds 160,000. The valuations would be contracted out to private companies but overseen by the Inland Revenue's valuation office. Households in the lowest band would pay about two-thirds the amount of those in the the middle band - based on the average property value in England of Pounds 80,000. At the other end of the scale those in the highest band would pay about two-thirds more. The key elements of the tax would apply also to Scotland and Wales, although there might be technical differences. The illustrative figures produced by Mr Heseltine - hotly contested by Mr Gould - indicated that the new tax would bring an average bill for the cheapest property with two adults of Pounds 200 this year against Pounds 668 for one in the highest band. The environment secretary confirmed that single-person households would receive a 25 per cent discount, an element designed to reduce the burden on elderly people living alone. The decision to base the tax on the assumption of two-person properties was attacked by Labour, however, as a political fudge designed to placate supporters of the poll tax within the government's own ranks. Ministers conceded that the new system would redistribute the burden of local taxation from the north of England to more affluent areas in the south. Households in many Tory marginal constituencies in the North West will be among the main beneficiaries. The political calculation is that although Tory voters in the south will be the main losers, the ceiling on the amount that councils will be allowed to levy from each of the seven bands will cushion the impact. Mr Heseltine - who also published details of his plan to set up a local government commission to lead a move towards the creation of single-tier authorities - added that the government would retain its powers to cap high-spending authorities. While the key points of the new local tax are not negotiable in a consultation period which is due to last until June, the government is far more open to suggestions on the future structure of local government. Mr Patten will signal his determination to regain the political initiative in the run-up to the general election at a press conference early this morning. Ministers believe that the proposals may have come too late to have a decisive impact on next month's local elections, and most have all but ruled out a June general election. Most appear convinced, however, that with the poll tax behind them and further falls in inflation and mortgage rates expected over the next few months, Mr John Major should be in a position to call an election in the autumn.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COUNCIL TAX - MAIN POINTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A council tax will replace the poll tax in April 1993. It will reflect the capital value of a property occupied by two adults and give a 25 per cent discount to single people. Property will be valued in seven bands based on value. Payment in the top band will be limited to 2.5 times that of the bottom band. There will be a single bill for each household. Poor people will be protected by discounts. There will be no minimum contribution. Second homes will receive a discount of 50 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Gamble to end Tory trauma, Page 8 Editorial comment, Page 18</p>

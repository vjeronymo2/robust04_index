			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Accountancy Column: Daimler-Benz gears up for a drive on the freeway - David Waller explains why Germany's biggest industrial group is bowing to Anglo-American accounting practice IT IS time, said the chief executive of Germany's largest bank at a recent press conference, for Germany to enter the civilised world. Mr Hilmar Kopper, head of the Deutsche Bank, was referring to German companies' accounting practices, and his remarks came shortly after Daimler-Benz had announced it would be moving from the teutonic version of accounting to the Anglo-American. Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial group, which is 28 per cent owned by the Deutsche Bank, reached agreement with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission at the end of March over the broad terms of a listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Subject to further, detailed negotiations with the SEC, Daimler is set to obtain a full listing on Wall Street laster this year. The listing will end the anomaly that German companies, among the biggest industrial and financial services groups in Europe, have not had any direct access to the US equity market, the largest pool of capital in the world. The reason for this was that German companies refused to submit to the requirements of the SEC and publish US versions of their accounts. German accounting differs from Anglo-American in a number of important areas, not least that it makes no claim to provide a 'true and fair' view of economic reality. It is conditioned by tax laws and the requirement to put the interests of creditors above those of other users of accounts, for example shareholders. Although recent EC legislation has meant that group accounts have become more transparent, German accounting is still characterised by conservatism and a want of pertinent detail. The differences reflect contrasting styles of capitalism: the Anglo-American variety where the capital market plays an important role in the economy, and the Germanic, where there are only 665 listed companies and the stock market represents far smaller percentage of GDP than in the US or the UK. But, said Gerhard Liener, Daimler finance director, at the time that the agreement was sealed with the SEC, 'Anglo-Saxon accounting has become the language of international business'. Daimler's decision to 'go it alone' to New York follows the failure of a joint approach to the SEC by a number of big German companies. The unilateral step has incurred the wrath of fellow German companies. Mr Helmut Loehr, finance director of Bayer, one of Germany's big three chemicals companies, has condemned Daimler for capitulating before the US authorities and showing a want of traditional German solidarity. Nevertheless, it seems likely that other big German companies will follow suit once they have had the opportunity to study the details of the final agreement between Daimler and the SEC. Throughout the 1980s, German companies could adopt a high-handed approach to the world's largest capital market for the simple reason that they did not need that capital. Recent figures from the Bundesbank show that companies generated so much cash throughout the decade that they could finance the bulk of their investments - excluding acquisitions - from internal resources. But as Ronaldo Schmitz, board director of the Deutsche Bank responsible for corporate finance, explained to a conference of institutional investors in Dusseldorf, this is set to change as Germany industry's cash needs grow substantially in the more difficult economic environment of the 1990s. Bank lending, the traditional source of finance, will not be adequate, requiring German companies to turn increasingly to equity markets. 'During the most significant industrial reconstruction since the war, the cost of capital will gain importance as a competitive factor,' Mr Schmitz said. 'Throughout the next decade there will not be an abundance of capital as wealth will be soaked up by government deficits. German industry will have to change its attitude to shareholders if it is to attract that capital.' Foreign investors, predominantly institutions, own between 40 and 50 per cent of the 'free float' in German companies shares. But their interests have traditionally been neglected in favour of the banks, insurance companies and other corporate shareholders which control the German stock market and have other priorities than short or even medium-term investment performance. One of the ways in which the international investment community is ill-served is in the quality of accounting information. 'The lack of visibility of company prospects is a serious constraint on inward investment in the German market,' said Tracey Campbell, manager of Fidelity Investment's Germany Fund on a visit to Frankfurt last month, 'despite Germany being the largest economy in Europe. 'The poor quality of financial information available from many German companies makes it difficult for investors to buy a stock with confidence since valuations cannot be clearly established . . . Few companies give any indication of divisional profits breakdown at the kind of level which would allow the investor to track margins over time and make comparisons across companies.' Takeover protection devices - in place at many large companies - represent another obstacle to flows of institutional investment into Germany. It is no coincidence that Daimler, within days of announcing its move to investor-friendly accounting, announced it would also be getting rid of its own anti-takeover device. Daimler said it planned to dissolve Mercedes Automobil Holding (MAH), a company which has no purpose but to hold a 25.23 per cent stake in Daimler and serve as a block to unfriendly takeovers. Set up in 1977 to prevent the Shah of Iran buying up the crown jewels of German industry, MAH has no connection with Daimler's Mercedes-Benz automobile business. These two moves are connected with Daimler's plans to hold a large rights issue next year. It was forced to abandon a DM2bn issue planned for the German market last autumn because of poor market conditions (and poor operating performance). Future capital raising will be made easier, not least because 1993 reported profits and equity capital will be sharply higher under US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles than under German rules. Obviously this reflects no real fundamental change in 'economic reality' - but the US version of the figures is likely to make the shares look more palatable to international investors. It still has to be decided how Daimler will deal with a number of tricky issues, for example the write-back of provisions or of DM4bn of goodwill which arose on a spate of acquisitions in the late 1980s and which was written off against equity. But Michael Geiger at NatWest Securities in London believes that current year group profits will benefit from a one-off write back of provisions of up to DM2.5 - 3bn, three times the group's expected net profit of about DM1bn. Equity will be bolstered by up to 20 per cent, Geiger calculates. Just as important as the impact on reported profits are the longer-term cultural changes which are likely to be induced by greater accounting transparency - for example 'segmental' reporting by operating division and a US-style cash-flow statement. Daimler will have to publish more financial information, more often than before, putting pressure on the management of the German company to deliver the financial performance required by the Anglo-American investment community.</p>

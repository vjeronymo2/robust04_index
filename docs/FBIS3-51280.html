			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by D'Artagnan: "Mischievous Luis Alberto"] </F>   [Text] It is difficult to find anyone who generates more  admiring comments than Luis Alberto Moreno, not just because of  his professional competency, but mainly because of his human  qualities.    As a friend, Moreno is one of those persons who will go to  any lengths when he sees that someone close to him is having a  hard time of it or is faced with some problem. I am in a  position to say this because I have been a beneficiary of his  advice and generosity, because his family and mine are joined by  old bonds of friendship, and because, independently of his  intelligence--and that thing they call creative genius, which in  his case is a perfect definition of his way of being and of  bonding--he is, in essence, what Machado called a man, in the  best sense of the word. Such is the well-deserved fame that  Moreno enjoys with nearly everyone.    Furthermore, his intimate relationship with Andres Pastrana  is unconcealable. It is a relationship that presumably began  when the two were teenagers, but which undoubtedly grew stronger  when they began to work together, first as journalists, then on  "TV Today," with Andres as the announcer and director and Luis  Alberto the manager, a successful team effort. We later saw that  Moreno's cooperation was vital to Pastrana's candidacy for mayor  of Bogota. Few could have imagined that, as a political adviser  and the planner of innovative campaign strategies, this tiny  man--but a man gifted with great soul and a superior mind able  to intuit where and how the adversary might respond--could  indeed have such talent for advising. This without mentioning  that the advisee would follow every recommendation he would make  to the letter.    It is because of Luis Alberto's happy-go-lucky nature that  he  has many friends inside and outside of this government in which  he plays such an active part as minister of development,  replacing Jorge Ospina Sardi.    However, it is precisely this factor that forces me to write  the following, albeit with a number of cordial reservations, not  about Moreno's performance as an official, but rather,  concerning his unbounded--and now blatant--pro-Pastranism in his  capacity as minister. Theoretically, it would all be acceptable,  insofar as Andres claims that he is not a candidate and,  consequently, that Moreno cannot head his campaign. However, we  all know that this tactic is as shrewd as it is artful and that  Andres could just as easily be a presidential candidate in a  month as Luis Alberto could be his campaign director and most  trustworthy alter ego.    I am not saying that the minister of development is "shaking  down" or blackmailing industrialists by saying that if they do  not vote for Pastrana or start filling his coffers, they will  not have the sympathetic ear of the business sector's  representative in the Executive Branch, which is, to a certain  extent, the role that a good Development Ministry should play.  However, it remains to be seen how committed or uncommitted  those same businessmen feel--politically and  economically--toward the man who functions as their spokesman in  government. Indeed, it is obvious that Moreno has never missed  an opportunity to "campaign" for Andres and that more than a few  institutions overseen by his ministry have become abnormally  pro-Pastrana, as in the case of the Tourism Corporation and the  Office of Superintendent of Companies. To draw a valid contrast,  no such thing has occurred with the other Cabinet ministers, who  have respected strict official impartiality. Finally, from his  current office, Moreno is and will continue to be--for as long  as he serves as minister--the confidant of Andres, who, even if  he has never formally declared it, is for all practical purposes  a presidential candidate.    The straw that broke the camel's back is the report--which,  if true, would be extremely serious--that as minister of  development, Moreno accompanied Pastrana on his recent trip to  Venezuela and was present during the hour-and-a-half-long  meeting they had with President Ramon J. Velasquez, a meeting  arranged by Moreno at Pastrana's request. What if any one of the  Liberal precandidates had done likewise as the result of our  minister of government's arrangements, for example? Would that  minister not have been condemned--immediately--for openly  meddling in politics and for an absolute lack of neutrality in  his actions, as an employee (and not just any) of the  administration?    So close to elections, it would be as awkward as it would be  useless to claim that Moreno should drop his pro-Pastrana stance  overnight, but I do not think it would be far-fetched or  bold--much less unjust--to ask him to cease being a Pastrana  activist while he holds an official post that undeniably grants  him powers and prerogatives he would most certainly lack without  that Cabinet post. It is one that unquestionably complicates  things in terms of guarantees, all the more so when certain  political observers do not understand the systematic ambiguity  of Pastranism that is so deeply embedded in a Liberal regime, on  the one hand, while at the same time being critical, highly  critical, of that same regime in various ways (witness LA  PRENSA's repeated tirades). The same observers understand even  less the latent accusation that, from the very center of power,  support for Andres is subtly drummed up and in the form of  actions which, like the one reported, are so difficult to cover  up or deny.</p>

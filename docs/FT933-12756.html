			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: Growth in US and Asian sales boosts Mitel RISING sales in the US and Asia helped Mitel, the Canadian telephone equipment maker, to record a profit of CDollars 3m (USDollars 2.4m), or 2 cents a share, for the first quarter ended June 25, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. This compares with a loss of CDollars 7m, or 10 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 107m, up 13 per cent. Mitel, which makes telecom switches, semiconductors and computer systems, said productivity gains also helped. Mr Anthony Griffiths has stepped down as chairman.</p>

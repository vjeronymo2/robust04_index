			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMES GOVERNMENT TO MESS WITH OUR BARBECUES  </P> <P> The future often moves east from the West, being foreshadowed in Southern  California. However, news usually travels east to west, so sufficient notice  was not taken of 123 intimations of tomorrow's social issues and political  choices.  </P> <P> The South Coast Air Quality Management District's jurisdiction is the Los  Angeles Basin. That includes 13,350 square miles, an area larger than nine  states, and 5% of the nation's population, more than the populations of 47  states. The existence of the district may not even be known to most of the 12  million people whose lives will be touched by implementation -- if that happens  -- of the 123 recommendations for reducing smog. If they are implemented, it is  possible that within 10 years average visibility in the basin will be 60 miles  instead of today's 10 miles.  </P> <P> The district operates on the provable premise that when 12 million people live  together, anything that large numbers of them do, from driving cars to painting  patio furniture to firing up their barbecues, matters a lot. It matters because  life is a matter of cumulations.  </P> <P> Not long ago the problem of air pollution was considered a problem of vehicles  and large stationary sources such as power plants and oil refineries. Not any  more. Now the AQMD's proposals range from the minor and mundane (banning  aerosol hair sprays and deodorants) to the major and visionary (electric  vehicles). The proposals include a ban on bias-ply (non-radial) tires, steep  increases in parking fees for cars carrying only one person and limits on the  number of cars each family can have.  </P> <P> The state should stay out of the bedroom? OK, but it may soon rummage around in  the bathroom: Even some non-aerosol deodorants might have to be reformulated to  eliminate certain reactive compounds. Gas-powered lawn mowers (think of  millions of them shattering the silence of a May morning in the basin) may have  to go. So, too, may lighter fluids for back-yard barbecues. But, then, when  millions of barbecuers substitute twigs and crumpled newspapers . . . .  </P> <P> The AQMD agenda has ignited what will be a decade of fierce debate: How much  will it cost in money, jobs and freedom? Will the cost be regressive, falling  heaviest on those with the least disposable income?  </P> <P> Six days after the district spoke, the East was heard from on the subject of  air pollution. Data gathered by the Environmental Protection Agency indicates  that 329 chemicals -- only seven of them regulated by the EPA, 60 of them  cancer-causing -- are being pumped into the air from industrial plants at the  alarming rate of 2.4 billion pounds a year.  </P> <P> The spate of news about air pollution comes while notice is being taken of the  10th anniversary of what news stories still refer to as the Three Mile Island  "disaster." Some disaster: No one killed, not even any measurable health  consequences. The bad environmental consequences of Three Mile Island were the  multiplication of delays in the development of an environmentally sound  technology for generating power. In the name of reducing risks from nuclear  power, we are incurring other risks.  </P> <P> One of the large industries in developed societies, the insurance industry,  embodies the modern determination to socialize risks. The welfare state, more  properly called the social-insurance state, socializes risks of unemployment,  sickness and aging. The pursuit of public health through environmental  regulation is a policy of dispersing responsibility for reducing risks.  </P> <P> Americans are intensely, sometimes unhealthily, health-conscious. But the  nation's public-health priorities often are peculiar. The week that the AQMD  proposed measures that would impinge on many freedoms, the nation was  mesmerized by the health hazard posed by two lightly poisoned grapes. Health is  indeed the first wealth, and Americans, who are more carefully polled  concerning their appetites than concerning their willingness to pay the costs  of them, constantly call for measures to produce a healthier environment.  </P> <P> However, the AQMD agenda is a cold shower of costs. The costs can be calculated  in money and in the social supervision of what once were taken for granted as  spheres of private discretion.  </P> <P> Philosophers of freedom have frequently had recourse to John Stuart Mill's  essay "On Liberty" and his distinction between "self-regarding" and  "other-regarding" acts. Self-regarding acts are those that affect no one other  than the actor. In an open society, they are generally exempt from state  control.  </P> <P> The logic of environmental reasoning (it is scientific as well as social logic)  is this: High-density urban living in the industrial age transforms many  actions, such as driving and barbecuing, from self-regarding into  other-regarding actions. Thus does government grow.  </P></p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / BAe faces Pounds 80m claim by Asda over property deal BRITISH AEROSPACE, the troubled industrial combine, faces an Pounds 80m claim from Asda, the supermarket group, arising from an ill-starred property joint venture. BAe also confirmed yesterday that Mr Dudley Eustace, its finance director, was leaving the company. The parting was 'amicable', it said, but would make no further comment. A formal announcement is due today. Mr Eustace has been BAe's finance director throughout recent turbulent events surrounding the company, including the removal from the chairmanship of Sir Roland Smith, his replacement on a temporary basis by Sir Graham Day and the restructuring of top management under Sir Graham in December. The company has been striving to repair the damage to its City image wrought by the failure of last year's Pounds 432m rights issue and heavy fall in profits. The rights issue collapsed, leaving 95 per cent with the underwriters. BAe is involved in what are described as 'delicate discussions' with Asda, which is calling in a property value indemnity originally signed with Arlington Development Properties just before the property group was acquired by BAe. At last week's meeting to announce an interim loss of Pounds 68.8m, Mr Archie Norman, Asda's recently appointed chief executive, told a City analyst that the group had full indemnity cover on this venture. 'Our lawyers say that the indemnity agreement is absolutely rock solid,' Asda said yesterday. The agreement concerns Burwood House Group, a 50 per cent jointly owned operation formed in 1989, into which Asda put 34 stores then valued at Pounds 350m and Arlington some Pounds 75m of property interests. The indemnity provided that BAe would be liable for any shortfall on valuation of Arlington's Burwood assets on December 31 1990, and it is on this liability that Asda is now basing its call for Pounds 80m. The valuation, carried out by Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, was deferred by agreement until last month, but was based on values as at December 1990. 'We did them a big favour,' commented one Asda executive. 'The shortfall at December 1991 would have been much greater.' The discussions between the joint owners of Burwood House appear to be limited to the precise figure of Aerospace's obligation rather than presenting any challenge to the indemnity itself. The surfacing of widely predicted losses on the Burwood House deal will inflict a further blow on BAe's reputation. The Pounds 278m purchase of Arlington in 1989, at the peak of the property boom, was strongly crit-icised in the City at the time.</p>

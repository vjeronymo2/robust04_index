			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAN ALLIES WEATHER A STORM IN E. EUROPE?  </P> <P> The daily drama of developments within the Soviet empire has mesmerized the  West. Solidarity rules in Warsaw, an unprecedented popular politics has emerged  in Moscow, and there is expectation that anything is possible. Yet if the  experiment begun by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is halted or reversed  -- an ever-present possibility -- the resulting Western reaction could provoke  a major crisis within the Atlantic alliance.  </P> <P> It may be unseemly to dampen the hopes for major progress in East-West  relations and in the enlargement of human freedoms. But there is sound reason  for caution in assessing the prospects for an end to the division of Europe or  for political liberalization from Budapest to Baku. The reason is the potential  consequences if all turns sour.  </P> <P> Detente during the 1970s provided a potent lesson about expecting too much, too  soon. Hardly had the Nixon Administration codified superpower behavior with  Brezhnev's Soviet Union than Moscow played a nefarious role in the 1973 Yom  Kippur War. Renewed East-West tensions culminated in the 1979 invasion of  Afghanistan, the U.S. effort to impose sanctions against the Soviet Union and  the political death of the SALT II arms-control treaty.  </P> <P> As American disillusionment with detente set in, however, reaction in Western  Europe was less categorical. Thoroughly satisfied with the East-West agreements  concluded during the early 1970s over issues like Berlin, the allies were  reluctant to lose what had been achieved in East-West relations. The  half-hearted European response to America's call for sanctions was evidence of  a serious difference of viewpoint.  </P> <P> Today, there is also risk of disillusionment. Few observers believe that a  Gorbachev beset by economic failure at home would embark on new foreign  adventures or invoke the specter of traditional enemies, although this could  happen. More likely, Moscow would put the brakes on change within the empire.  This does not just mean that events in Poland or Hungary -- or potentially in  East Germany, the most brittle of East European states -- could produce another  Soviet invasion. More significant is the current challenge to Moscow's  authority within the borders of the Soviet Union, and nowhere more striking  than in the breathtaking efforts of the Baltic peoples to strike out for  freedom and independence.  </P> <P> All may yet be well. Gorbachev may permit more latitude for the expression of  personal and national aspirations than virtually anyone a few months ago dared  to hope for. Or he may set limits and make them stick. Or leaders in the Baltic  republics, alert to risk and able to effect a controlled release of pent-up  frustrations, may be able to stop short of provoking the brutal reaction of  which Moscow has historically been capable.  </P> <P> Yet Western expectations, particularly in the United States, are rapidly  running ahead of what the Soviet Union is likely to let happen.  </P> <P> Throughout the postwar period, there has been a dual Western agenda: to promote  human freedoms and to reduce the risks of conflict and gain control over the  engines of destruction. For some observers, especially Americans, the two goals  are inseparable, akin to the view that only a Soviet Union that is reformed  internally will no longer pose a threat, or that only democracies can be relied  on not to make war on their ilk.  </P> <P> As hopes rise for decisive change within the Soviet empire, there is also great  risk that the crushing of another spring beneath Soviet tanks, as happened in  Prague in 1968, would erode the political basis in the United States for  prosecuting arms control or the other items on George Bush's agenda, including  an end to the Cold War and the division of Europe.  </P> <P> Soviet repression -- say, in the Baltics -- would produce disillusionment in  Western Europe as well. Europe would be far less willing than the United  States, with its tradition of greater Cold War hostility, to suspend efforts to  transform security on the Continent and to demilitarize East-West relations.  Especially in West Germany, most euphoric about the possibilities of change, it  would be difficult to re-establish allied cohesion around a policy of  confrontation just because U.S.-Soviet relations had again deteriorated over  renewed Soviet brutality at home.  </P> <P> The caution flags are already flying. They can be seen especially in widespread  questioning in the United States about West Germany's reliability, its  ambitions, and its future -- which reflect remarkably widespread failure in the  United States to understand how deeply the Federal Republic's roots are sunk  both in democracy and in the West.  </P> <P> It will be hard enough to keep the Western allies together when times are fair;  West Germany is not alone in yearning for the end of East-West confrontation.  If the limits of Soviet tolerance are reached sooner rather than later, the  United States could find itself seriously at odds with key allies in trying to  reimpose a hard line.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration has shown sensitivity to some of these risks. It has  been reluctant to raise expectations about developments on either side of the  Soviet-European frontier, and it is forcing the pace on conventional-arms talks  in Europe, seeking agreement while the political sun shines. But the United  States is curiously passive as tomorrow's history is being written in Central  Europe.  </P> <P> There is a critical need now for a comprehensive Western strategy, both to set  clear goals for changing the face of European politics and to contain the  consequences of possible failure. Otherwise, both allied cohesion and detente  will remain hostage to Soviet behavior in Eastern Europe and at home.  </P></p>

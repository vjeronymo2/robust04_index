			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Survey of Belgium (8): Mr Wallonia pulls the strings / Profile of Guy Spitaels GUY SPITAELS, who led the French-speaking Socialist Party (PS) for 10 years until early last year, can claim to be the most successful leader the party has ever had. He rescued it from a seven-year spell in opposition, and in 1987 boosted its share of the vote in Wallonia to 44 per cent, the highest proportion of any Socialist Party in the EC, as he was quick to point out to any inquirers. Along the way, he had effectively absorbed the predominantly left-wing separatist Rassemblement Wallon and eliminated the Belgian Communist Party as a parliamentary force, in spite of its very moderate programme. His reward was to be asked to form a government by King Baudouin after the 1987 election, from which his party had emerged as the dominant force, not only in Wallonia but in the national parliament. It did not take Mr Spitaels long to discover that the Flemish parties would not accept him as prime minister. The ostensible reason was that he could not speak fluent Dutch. Yet Mr Spitaels does not believe that this was the whole story. 'Even if I had spoken perfect Dutch', he says, 'it would have made no difference. It is not the fact of not being able to speak their language that the Flemish object to, it is that, as the majority group, they feel the job belongs to them.' He is probably right. Each of the last 11 governments has been led by a Fleming, and the few post-war administrations led by French-speakers have been short-lived. Mr Spitaels settled for being the country's chief power broker, staying outside the government as leader of the PS, but being consulted by the then prime minister, Wilfried Martens, on important points. He also chose and effectively controlled the Socialist-led coalitions that rule the Walloon and Brussels regions and the executive of the French-speaking community. Mr Spitaels, 61, had a strict Catholic upbringing, but lost his faith while studying law and political science at the Catholic University of Louvain. He subsequently became a professor at Brussels University. He joined the PS at the age of 29 and became a full-time politician at 42. There was general astonishment when, shortly after the last general election, he effectively appointed himself as minister-president of Wallonia. It was, he later said, a move he had long pondered. After 10 years of pulling the strings from outside government it was time, he felt, to assume direct executive authority. Although at an earlier period he had been a vice-premier and budget and communications minister, it was a sign of the times that he should choose to head a regional administration rather than joining the national government. In the region, as earlier in his party, his easy dominance is universally acknowledged. His intellectual power and shrewd political judgment give him a head-start over all possible rivals. The Flemish parties have publicly lamented that they could find nobody of comparable stature to head the Flemish regional government. Wallonia is the poorest of the three Belgian regions, but its standard of living is more than 90 per cent of the EC average, and it did not qualify for special assistance from the community. Mr Spitaels's proudest achievement so far has been to squeeze funds out of the EC for the poorest of Wallonia's five provinces, Mainaut. Mr Spitaels may never have quite made it as Mr Belgium, but nobody now disputes his status as Mr Wallonia.</p>

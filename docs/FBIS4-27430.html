			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Confusion of Emergency Bill With Measures </F> To Deal With Economic Sanctions Against North Korea"]    [Text] The issue of North Korea's suspected development of  nuclear weapons has now entered a new phase now North Korea has  begun removing fuel rods at an experimental nuclear reactor.  The issue has obvious security implications for Japan, and so  debates have been held in the Diet. But the debates have tended  to boil down to an exchange of words on the relationship between  universal and collective security. They have failed to focus on  how Japan should ensure its security under the current  international situation.    There has been Diet dispute over interpretation of the  Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. It has been labelled as theological  dispute, and the point of issue was the relationship between  Japan's constitution and the defensive action this permitted the  country to take. The dispute had the effect of putting the  brakes on Japan's buildup of military strength. But the  political parties used the security issue ideologically because,  in the Cold War era, their relationship with the United States  and the Soviet Union was the main factor in determining their  status at home.    Even now, the Cold War's influence still lingers in Japan  and  parliamentary debates on Japanese security are still immature.    Debate has been held in the Diet on whether the collective  security laid down in the UN Charter and the universal security  that is the "global framework for the maintenance of peace and  safety through the United Nations" are different. How meaningful  is this to Japan's security?    If the government and the Diet take a common-sense view of  Japan's security, they must first discuss the North Korean  situation. They can discuss North Korea's domestic situation,  how bilateral U.S.-North Korea talks are expected to go, and  what Japan can do to help find a diplomatic solution to the  issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons.  There are a lot of topics to be discussed.    The main point of concern here is that while government  ministries and agencies are informally examining ways to deal  with the situation should economic sanctions unfortunately be  imposed against North Korea and Japan be obliged to follow, the  Diet has not yet debate the matter.    Perhaps the government thinks it would lessen potential  political friction to submit to the Diet a package of amendment  bills and get them passed at a stroke shortly after the economic  sanctions introduced.    If the government does think that way, it is ignoring the  Diet. The Diet is the supreme body of state power that is  mandated to make a final decision on how the government deals  with emergencies when they occur. Bureaucrats should not be  allowed to deal with the emergency on the basis of their own  judgment. The Diet has delayed holding the debates out of fear  they may incite North Korea or because it was judged  incompatible with Japan's national interests to publicize the  country's measures for dealing with the emergency by debating  them in parliament. The Diet has also not held the debates  because the government has not supplied it with the information  needed by the Diet to provide informed debate.    It is true that government ministries and agencies are  informally "studying" ways to amend relevant laws so that Japan  can put economic sanctions into effect. The Diet, nonetheless,  should hold the debates despite the aforementioned restraints.  Lack of debate is causing a chaos.    And one cause of the chaos is the confusion over the  legislation for an emergency that was studied by the Fukuda  cabinet in 1977. This legislation was in anticipation of a  situation in which Japan goes to war, and is different from the  legal measures that may be needed to deal with the North Korean  situation.    The confusion has arisen because debate on Japan's security  in the Diet has boiled down to a play of words. In particular,  the government must explain the present situation in a way the  people can easily understand. It is impossible for the  government to promote any policy unless it is understood by the  people.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, June 11 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China has  taken a series of steps to increase grain output this year.    Latest figures show that the seeded area this spring in  Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces increased by nearly  one million hectares, including 400,000 hectares of beans and  wheat, and more high-yielding crops such as corn and rice were  sown.    This will increase the grain output in the region by an  estimated 7.2 billion kg this year, said a local grain  production planning official.    By mid-may, Heilongjiang Province had injected more than  5.73  billion yuan to boost its agricultural production. The major  part of the funds -- 65.3 percent -- was raised by the farmers.    In Liaoning and Jilin, more money has been used to buy  fertilizers. In addition, over 250 million cu m of manure has  been applied in Liaoning and Heilongjiang.    Northeast China's total of cultivated land is 16 million  hectares, and its rural population numbers 57 million. It is  one of the country's biggest grain producers, with advanced  mechanized farm machinery.    The region's overall grain output last year reached a record  60 billion kg, accounting for 13 percent of the country's total.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / International Company News: Crucial meeting on Ronson refinancing CREDITORS OF Heron International, Mr Gerald Ronson's property group, start a series of meetings today to decide whether to support proposals for refinancing the group's Pounds 1.4bn debt. Today's meeting, to be held in London, is the most crucial and likely to set the tone for meetings in the Netherlands on June 30 and Curacao on July 5. While Heron's advisers say that early indications are favourable to the company, the outturn is by no means simple to predict. The meeting could be lively, since many creditors are expected to voice concerns about the amount and appropriateness of information provided in the proposal documents. One creditor, First Eastern Developments, a property consulting company owed Dollars 1.7m by Heron, has gathered views from a number of others, including many bondholders. Mr Simon Shane, head of FED, said many creditors who responded to a questionnaire FED sent out said there was insufficient information to form a view on the proposals. He said 'unless you know what debt is secured against what assets in what company you can't form a view if a bank has a secondary recourse elsewhere.' Mr Shane plans to seek a legal review of the information offered even if the proposals are approved. He fears Heron could set the standards for future restructurings. There may also be questions about the continuing role of Mr Ronson at the group, on a salary of Pounds 500,000 a year which some regard as excessive. Also there are concerns that he is leading an investor group which is buying some assets from Heron. Under the proposals, bondholders would swap Pounds 100 of bonds for Pounds 29.80 worth of senior debt and Pounds 7.28 of junior debt, which will both take the form of new bonds, and 6.7949 new shares in Heron. Voting is complex. At today's meeting approval of the proposals requires a 75 per cent majority by value of the votes cast, either in person or by proxy, and a 50 per cent majority by number of votes. This means that a bank holding proxies for a large number of bondholders could sway the numerical vote by putting each proxy in individually rather than as a block. Mr Ronson will chair the meeting and start with a brief introduction, followed by an update of the trading position. He will point to more than Pounds 140m of property disposals already agreed, ahead of schedule and at prices above the value assumed in the plan. This is important since the restructuring proposals assume some improvement in the property market merely to meet repayments of the senior debt. Heron has repeatedly said that if the proposals are rejected the group will face insolvency, an outcome which it says would deliver significantly less to creditors.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Georgiy Satarov: "Pie of Power Already Feasted </F> On..."]    [Text] So the State Duma deputies have spent exactly a  week dividing up the pie of internal power. Two trends emerged  at the very start of the session: The first was that the  deputies were in no hurry to embark on a fierce political battle  for the redistribution of power with the president and the  government, but, on the other hand, they were making  preparations, by arranging their Duma life in detail; the second  was that on day one, without any preliminary maneuvers, the  deputies launched into votes enabling them to determine the  internal disposition of forces, since the size of everyone's  slice of the pie depended on this to a large extent.    The first controversy was over two digits in the text of the  provisional standing orders indicating the minimum permissible  size of a faction. The communists, agrarians, DPR [Democratic  Party of Russia], and LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]  wanted the number 50, and their reason for that was a desire for  organized and efficient work. The opposing flank and  "independent" deputies insisted on a threshold of 14 deputies,  advocating "freedom of association." In actual fact, there were  two things here of great importance to the division of power.  First, it was necessary to block the possible multiplication  (including by means of division) of factions on the other  political flank, which is important because of the natural  factional representation norm both in the debates and in the  various Duma components.    Second, combined with the obligatory order, which is  intended  to be enshrined later in the Law on the Status of Deputy and  which involves strict factional discipline, the high threshold  made it possible to form a strategic majority on the left flank.  As a result of a two-sitting struggle and a series of votes a  compromise figure of 35 deputies was reached as the basis for  forming new groups and factions. It is interesting that it was  when this matter was being discussed that the "main forces"  started to come to the microphones.    There followed an equally fierce battle over other standing  order norms of vital importance. In this case the left flank of  the Duma succeeded in gaining powerful positions by passing  norms whereby the quorum for opening a sitting was reduced to  one-half of the total number of deputies, and this total number  corresponds to the number of elected deputies. In the votes on  these questions the deputies were obviously haunted by the  specter of the Supreme Soviet.    The deputies' love of Aesopian language was most fully  manifested in the discussion of two versions of the article in  the standing orders determining the mechanism for the election  of the Duma chairman. According to the first version, proposed  by the standing orders group, the chairman would be elected by  two rounds of secret votes; the two candidates who had obtained  the most votes would reach the second round -- a natural,  generally accepted norm.    According to the second version, sponsored by the left wing,  a straw poll would be carried out electronically. The reason  for this was that it would be a high-speed operation. In fact,  this mechanism would enable the very slightly larger left wing  to block the passage of candidates from the opposing flank or  center to the second round, which was successfully accomplished.  As a result, I. Rybkin, who overcame Yu. Vlasov in the second  round, won by a majority of half a vote in excess of one-half of  the total number of deputies, since one of the ballot papers  caused arguments in the tellers' commission amd its fate was  decided by the Duma.    The initial days of the lower chamber's work revealed the  disposition of forces to come, which had been predicted earlier  and which is characterized by powerful flanks and a weak center.    On the left flank you have the coordinated bloc of the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation [CPRF] (45 deputies,  which was the figure given in the official registration in the  Duma 12 January) and the Agrarian Party of Russia [APR] (55).  On a number of questions they are joined by the Liberal  Democratic Party (63), the Democratic Party of Russia (15),  "Women of Russia" (23), and several independent deputies, some  of whom had gotten together in the "Russian Path" association  headed by Baburin, Lukyanov, and Vlasov, which has not been  registered yet because it does not have enough deputies  (approximately 20 deputies).    The CPRF, APR, LDPR, amd DPR form the tactical nucleus of  this grouping. What distinguishes all their actions is the  amount of thought that goes into them and the high degree of  preparation. The actions of their speakers and supporting  deputies in the chamber are well organized. All this, creating,  as it does, an atmosphere of confidence in their own strength,  attracts to this grouping the votes of some wavering deputies  amd enables them as a result to obtain in the Duma the votes of  a small majority of the number of elected deputies.    On the opposing flank you have the fragmented "Russia's  Choice" (76), the "Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin" bloc (25), the  Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES] (30 deputies, including  the newly joined independents), and the unregistered "Union of  12 December" group of democratically oriented deputies, which  has I. Khakamada as one of its leaders (around 20 deputies).    These factions are not organized and they are not  coordinated, their preparations are poor, and their proposals  suffer from poor reasoning. A typical example is the  explanation that a quorum of one-half of the deputies is  insuitable because it would lead to the adoption of laws by  one-fourth of the deputies' votes. This logic was a gift for  the communists, who made sure they took advantage of it by  immediately reminding their opponents that that was precisely  how the Constitution was adopted. It is not inconceivable that  this false move might have influenced the outcome of the vote on  this question.    We can confidently assign the "New Regional Policy"  deputies'  associaiton (65 deputies), headed by V.S. Medvedev, president of  the Oil Workers' Union, to the central part of the spectrum in  the Duma. Medvedev was one of the contenders for the post of  State Duma chairman and got 145 votes in the straw poll.    Further events confirmed the instability of this structure  in  which neither flank has a sure tactical majority. This was  manifested in a series of votes on the agenda, in which the  proposals from the extreme left flank "to get to grips with the  press," "free political prisoners," and so on did not get  through. Which explains the desire of the majority of deputies  to resolve the question of the distribution of committee posts  as a single "package," on the basis of accords on the  proportional allocation of seats, which was successfully  implemented.    This could mean that the Duma has a certain constructive  potential, which will be confirmed or refuted in the very near  future. It must be added that, unlike the Supreme Soviet in the  final months, where there was an atmosphere of bitter animosity,  the atmosphere in the Duma in the initial days was that of a  jolly sports festival. The first chairman, G. Lukava, had a lot  to do with that.    Having sorted out the seats, the deputies will busy  themselves with the standing orders and the Law on the Status of  Deputy. Then we should see the start of the regular legislative  work, primarily, one assumes, on federal constitutional laws.  It is not inconceivable that in the interim the Duma will try  to creep up on another pie of power, not in the Duma, but  outside -- in the state. What form this takes and what the  results are will make it possible to answer many questions  concerning the fate both of the authorities and of the state.</p>

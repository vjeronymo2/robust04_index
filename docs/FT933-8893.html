			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Paris moves warily on interest rates SMALL step by small step, France is charting a course for monetary policy, following the European currency crisis which left the French franc hovering uncertainly in a weakened exchange rate mechanism. The Bank of France has this week trimmed overnight interest rates by a meagre 0.75 percentage points from their crisis levels of 10 per cent. The rates for 5 to 10 day loans for commercial banks have been left unchanged. 'It seems they have decided on a general policy,' says Ms Marie-Owens Thomson, International economist at Midland Global Markets. 'They are going to bring down interest rates, but gradually.' But why are the French financial authorities moving so gingerly when the high level of interest rates in France's recession-hit economy was one of the principal causes of the assaults on the French franc last month? For Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, the most important reason for caution is his continued attachment to a strong franc policy despite the widening of the currency's fluctuation bands within the European exchange rate mechanism from 2.25 per cent to 15 per cent. The Franc has fallen by about 2.5 per cent below its old ERM floor rate of FFr3.4305 to the D-Mark, and Mr Balladur is anxious to avoid a larger fall by rapid moves on borrowing costs. Politically, a rapid cut in interest rates could accelerate the depreciation of the franc and undermine Mr Balladur's credibility as an advocate of the 'franc fort' policy. It would also give legitimacy to political opponents, even within his Gaullist RPR party, who have advocated more expansionist economic policies. These include Mr Philippe Seguin, president of the National Assembly, who has called for devaluation and more protectionist policies. Practically, a strong franc is needed to help rebuild foreign exchange reserves at the Bank of France. Figures it published yesterday confirmed that a deficit of almost FFr200bn (Pounds 22.8bn) was incurred in the unsuccessful defence of the franc last month. In addition the franc/D-Mark link, although now greatly weakened, is regarded as the symbol of bilateral co-operation in the process of European union. France may also not want to cut rates faster than other ERM members to avoid the impression of competitive devaluations. The problem for Mr Balladur is how to reconcile currency stability with the need to revive the economy and curb unemployment, forecast to reach 12.5 per cent of the population by the end of the year. The French authorities have some room for manoeuvre. Figures published yesterday which confirmed an annual inflation rate of just over 2 per cent suggest there is little immediate danger in currency depreciation. More important, the fact that the franc has been relatively stable since the half-point cut in the overnight rate suggests that the central bank may also be able to bring rates down further without unsettling the foreign exchange markets. 'Short-term interest rates could return relatively quickly to pre-crisis levels of about 7 per cent, possibly within the next 4-6 weeks,' says Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist at Salomon Brothers in London. Overnight rates are likely to be used as a stalking horse for cuts in other rates, particularly the 5-10 day borrowing rate and ultimately the intervention rate, which stands at 6.75 per cent and which acts as a floor on money market rates. The gamble for the French authorities is whether they can cut rates fast enough to satisfy domestic pressures for economic recovery. However, in the international currency markets, the situation is more delicate. 'They are on a tightrope,' says one Paris-based diplomat. 'If they don't deliver rate cuts fast enough, then investor confidence in the franc will be eroded and the currency will come under attack again.' Mr Balladur will be encouraged by the resilience of the franc after this week's rate cuts. But with the strength of the D-Mark expected to persist as EC central banks pay back their loans to the Bundesbank, the situation remains fragile. Despite the attractions of stepping up the pace of rate cuts, the French are likely to continue to tread carefully.</p>

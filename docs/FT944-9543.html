			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Hoechst sees market value doubling by year 2000 The stock market value of Germany's Hoechst chemicals and drugs group will double by the end of the decade, following restructuring and a management shake-out, Mr Jurgen Dormann, chairman,said. Mr Dormann, who has made wide changes in management and operations since taking over in May, also aims to double sales in Asia from 10 per cent to 20 per cent of group turnover. Outlining his ambitious programme, he told the Financial Times he would continue looking for a further 'two or three' mid-sized pharmaceuticals companies to add to Hoechst's recently-acquired US interests in generic drugs. However, he would wait until prices became more reasonable. Hoechst had 'perhaps' paid too high a premium in last year's purchase for Dollars 546m of a 51 per cent stake in Copley, a US generic drugs maker, he said. Industrial gas production would be expanded with a newly-approved scheme to invest DM500m (Dollars 327.22m) in the company's Messer Griesheim subsidiary. Hoechst had taken a risk spending heavily on moving into emerging east European markets, but all its new businesses there had become profitable within 12 to 18 months of start-up. Negotiations were under way for several joint ventures in China. In one of the chemical industry's most persistent problem sectors, Mr Dormann said further measures might be necessary to reinforce Hoechst's restructured PVC production. Most of its operations were merged last year with those of Wacker of Germany into a new company, Vinnolit, which accounts for some 10 per cent of west European production capacity. But this was not enough, Mr Dormann indicated, and there could be room for a third partner. Combined with structural changes effective from January 1, which will reduce the number of operating divisions from 15 to seven and transfer responsibility for divisional strategy and profits to their managers, the result would be 'a doubling of our share price by 2000', Mr Dormann said. He also revealed he was reconsidering his plans, drawn up in his previous job as chief financial officer, for an initial public offering of shares in the US subsidiary, Hoechst Celanese. An international placing of shares in electrodes subsidiary Sigri Great Lakes Carbon, however, was still set for next spring. The placement plan for Celanese was originally intended to consolidate its independent status, but Mr Dormann said his decentralisation project should serve the same purpose. 'We will know in another 12 months,' he said.</p>

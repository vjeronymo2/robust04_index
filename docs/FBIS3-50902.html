The former environmentalist candidate, who obtained 5.6  percent of the votes in the elections of 11 December, charged  that the chiefs of state of the continent react with "hypocrisy"  to the problems of their indigenous populations.    "They praise indigenous liberators, but harm indigenous  territories by establishing multinational enterprises," Max Neef  said.    According to him, the southeastern Mexican state of Chiapas  is in an overexploited region of extreme poverty, which has been  permanently ignored.    He added that this type of uprising occurs in the continent  as a consequence of a system that does not take into account the  demands and historical rights of indigenous peoples.    Meanwhile, a delegation of the Mapuche "All Lands Council"  movement met 6 January with Mexican Ambassador to Chile Jorge  Eduardo Navarrete, and asked him to request "an immediate,  unilateral cease-fire by the Mexican Government" from President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari.    Dagoberto Cachana, coordinator for the Chilean indigenous  organization, said that a cease-fire on the part of the Armed  Forces "will facilitate a negotiations process."</p>

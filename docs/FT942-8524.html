			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Dominican election 'tainted' Foreign observers of the Dominican Republic's presidential election believe there were widespread irregularities. They said there are indications of a deliberate effort to tamper with the election, held on Monday. Mr Steven Solarz, a US former congressmen and one of the observers, said thousands of Dominicans had been denied a vote because their names were not on electoral rolls. The observers said that a disproportionate number of people disenfranchised were opposition supporters. Tension rose in the Dominican Republic yesterday as the electoral board rejected a request by Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, the main opposition candidate, for a halt to the count and for an investigation of his charges against the ruling party of President Joaqun Balaguer. With 92 per cent of the vote counted, the board showed Mr Balaguer leading Mr Pena Gomez by only 22,000, the total electorate being 3.3m.</p>

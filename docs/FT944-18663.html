			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Sale of Grid may face big tax setback Regional electricity companies could face a tax bill of more than Pounds 1bn from their planned flotation of National Grid after a potential setback in talks with the Inland Revenue. The tax authority has told them it is unable to comment on a scheme by which they hope to keep capital gains tax liability to a minimum in demerging the Grid, which transmits electricity in England and Wales, from their companies. Although the regional electricity companies are seeking guidance, executives fear the Revenue's noncommittal approach means they may have to proceed with the issue unresolved. At worst it could signal the end of their plans to minimise capital gains tax. Pressure is growing on the government to get as much benefit as possible for taxpayers and consumers from the Grid flotation. It has been criticised for undervaluing the regional companies when it privatised them four years ago. The Grid flotation is bound to increase the criticism because the company was valued at just over Pounds 1bn in 1990, but is now estimated to be worth at least Pounds 4bn. Theoretically the government could use its golden share in each regional company to extract windfall payments after the Grid flotation. Its free-market principles mean it is highly unlikely to do so. It would prefer them to cut power bills voluntarily as a means of minimising the political flak of the Grid flotation. Capital gains tax would provide another way of doing do. The Revenue's remarks, in a letter to the companies follow several months of talks. Their proposal, through which the Grid would be demerged with an issue of shares in the transmission company to existing shareholders, is the second to be presented to the Revenue. The first was rejected outright. The 'no comment' on the second scheme does not rule out talks, but some executives fear it may mean that the Revenue will not give any proposal prior approval. 'We may have to go ahead with a demerger without knowing whether we will have to pay capital gains tax', said one. Another interpretation of the letter is that it is a stalling tactic while the government sorts out the other sensitivities surrounding the flotation. The regional companies argue that there should be no tax liability because the shareholders already own the Grid. 'Shareholders will have to pay capital gains tax when they sell the Grid shares. Levying CGT on the recs at Grid flotation would mean the tax was being paid twice,' said one executive. Lex, Page 20</p>

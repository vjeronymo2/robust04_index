			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Salim Ghazi: "Where Is the State?"; first </F> paragraph is EL WATAN introduction]    [Text] Blida seems to be completely in the grip of  fundamentalist terror. Panic-stricken citizens have telephoned  us to say that the atmosphere there is "very heavy"--and that  most of the girls have started wearing the hijab to "avoid  problems."    One mother told us that "here we feel the presence of the  terrorists, who look just like everyone else, more than we do  that of the state."    On what does she base such a definite assertion? "I see it  in  the faces of my children. My daughter is terrified by the  thought that if she does not wear the hijab, she will be  attacked. You know, we are a family of practicing Muslims, and  we do not need to prove it or to be given lessons in Islam by  anyone. The only thing is that the atmosphere is one of  insecurity. One is afraid, and people go along with it."    That feeling is shared by other citizens who have the clear  impression that "they have been abandoned to the fundamentalists  in the absence of authority." The state is absent, there is no  authority! Those words are frequently heard on people's lips,  and not just in Blida, which today is completely helpless. With  the return of the "leaflets" posted just about everywhere and  the incendiary sermons being preached in certain mosques, there  is certainly sufficient cause for the citizens to panic,  especially since the terrorists' threats are followed by action.    Recently, however, it has been noticed in Blida that the  military have "repartitioned" the city following the removal of  roadblocks from strategic locations--no one knows exactly why  they were removed. "Those roadblocks--that military  presence--won people's trust and deterred the terrorists just a  tiny bit."    "It was precisely when they disappeared that fundamentalist  arrogance regained ground. This is not right, because the  citizens have no way to defend themselves from the terrorist  threat," we were told by an official who does not know what to  do next in the face of the fear that has taken hold of his two  children, a boy and a girl. "They have become the stakes for  people who want to make the situation diabolical, but how long  is this going to go on?"    But Blida is not alone. There are reportedly "hot"  neighborhoods on the outskirts of Algiers that are experiencing  the same distress, perhaps with more intensity. In Cherarba, for  example, the fundamentalists have pushed their zeal to the point  of forbidding the citizens to listen to the radio or watch TV.    There again, leaflets are posted announcing that wearing the  hijab is compulsory, but also calling for the murder of  intellectuals. "They want to rule our lives. They are the ones  giving the orders, and soon they will be coming into homes to  say what we must or must not eat. As far as educated individuals  are concerned, it is natural that the fundamentalists would want  to kill them: when one is ignorant and uneducated, one gets  frustrated in the presence of those who possess knowledge.    "So to lessen one's frustration, one must kill them, and  that  is what is happening." The person who told us that feels an  anger that he has trouble controlling. A family man with five  children, he lives in a modest three-room apartment.    He is furious at "not being able to do anything" about the  gang of bastards that is able to terrorize defenseless people  because it is armed. "Do we have to arm ourselves now to defend  ourselves and save the country from this fundamentalist plague?"  he asks.    That is a question running through the minds of many  Algerians who have had enough of standing by helplessly in the  face of the current carnage. "They kill, they burn our fathers,  brothers, mothers, and children, and we say nothing. This is  unbearable; Algerians are not made that way, and they must not  be buried too soon."    So what is to be done in the face of that panic in the  population, which does not understand why the authority of the  state is no longer exercised severely and in a more powerful  manner?    It is true that the security services are doing all they can  to protect the citizens and leaving many victims behind, but  people have the feeling that there has been a sort of  "slackening off" in the antiterrorist struggle or that the plan  of action as organized has become insufficient in the face of  the rising fundamentalist peril. "There are no longer any  patrols or police sweeps. What is happening?" one girl asked us.    On that subject, it should be recalled that a second  security  plan was to have gone into effect two or three months ago, but  that it has been delayed for unknown reasons.    Among other things, it called for constant police sweeps in  "hot" neighborhoods, the massive presence of security forces in  the streets, the interrogation of anyone suspected of complicity  with terrorist fundamentalists (Afghan uniforms), and, above  all, the use of security agents recently trained for  antiterrorist operations.    Incidentally, the month of Ramadan has been exploited to the  hilt by the fundamentalists, who have launched an all-out "holy  war."    A fatwa was even issued exempting the terrorists from the  obligation to fast. The month has been a bloody one, a fact that  has not been lost on the authorities. They will soon introduce  new security measures to reassure the citizens. The few days  left before Aid are likely to be very hard on everyone. We must  remain vigilant.</p>

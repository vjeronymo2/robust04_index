			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report from "Inf. NA": "Overall Results--A </F> Lesson, Not a Failure"]    [Text] The special tactical drills [TSZ] were a common and,  at the same time, serious test for the officers and personnel of  the field communications center commanded by Major Petro  Alekseyev. Even though the drills are monitored from start to  finish by exacting review officers, the supervisory functions  belong to the command personnel of the unit that is actually  performing the TSZ.    The subunit of Major Alekseyev was called up at dawn. The  mobile portion of the unit, headed by the commander, soon made a  march to the appointed area. Taking the scarcity of fuel into  account, the route that was selected was intentionally a  difficult one. Some 15 kilometers was enough for the review  officers to evaluate the capability of the motor vehicles and  drivers to carry out the assigned task. It should be stated that  the column reached the planned area in full complement and  without any serious incidents. The practical combat work then  began--the very work that the communications troops had always  considered, and still do consider, to be their professional  honor and dignity. The officers and young specialists,  regardless of the difficult situation in which they had to  increase their specialist proficiency, acted in quite precise  and confident fashion. The deadline for the entry into  communications with other centers and, through a space  communications station, with a radio link of the General Staff  of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Carpathian Military District  and the radio nets of the division staffs was met with time to  spare. There were a few shortcomings, of course, which were  recorded by the review officers.    They were able to fulfill their mission thanks to the  efforts  and skill of the experienced officers, warrant officers and  young specialists. The deputy commander of the field center for  indoctrination work, Major Valeriy Nedavniy, could not even  single anyone out. After reflection, he named the chief of the  telephone center, Captain Kostyantyn Lotostkyy, the chief of the  space communications station, Lieutenant Hryhoriy Hrish, and  equipment chiefs Warrant Officers Viktor Lepko and Serhiy  Hudzevych. The concertmaster for the entire tactical-special  exercise, as always, was the commander of the field  communications center, Major Petro Alekseyev. It would not be  the whole truth, as they say, if we were to fail to mention one  other thing. The review officers, without looking at the  confident professional actions of the communications troops,  nonetheless gave the center only a satisfactory rating during  the TSZ.    They noted some regrettable trifles connected with the  immediate work in the field. This is entirely understandable.  The minimal quantity of field trips the regiment was able to  make during the winter, after all, owing to the shortage of  motor resources, and the clear shortage of actual work had  negative consequences. The proficiency of the subunits is  dropping, and practical skills are being lost. The  end-of-training-period special tactical drill testifies to this.  It would be incorrect, however, to call it a failure.    This was a lesson--a lesson for the future.</p>

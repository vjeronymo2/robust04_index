			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Not a penny more, not a penny less: Efforts to ensure UK men and women receive the same pay for the same work Should a female finance clerk be paid the same as a male van driver? The question raises complex and sensitive issues. Last week the issues entered the limelight when the Equal Opportunities Commission said the UK government was failing to implement European Community law on equal pay. After 13 years of argument with the government, the commission's governing board said it would refer the matter to the European Commission in Brussels for clarification. 'We are charged by parliament to enforce the pay equality laws but that law is not working as it was supposed to do. It is our responsibility to see that it does,' says Ms Kamlesh Bahl, the commission's part-time chairman. Set up in 1975 to promote equality of opportunity between women and men, the commission has often been called ineffective. By taking this unprecedented public step over equal pay last week, the commission surprised the government. Department of Employment officials had already scheduled a meeting with the commission for October 4 to discuss the legal changes Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, might be willing to make. Ms Bahl welcomes the department's initiative, but sees no reason to abandon the action for clarification of the law from the European Commission. 'Issues of substance will still remain that must be resolved,' she argues. But ministers believe the commission is too impatient over what is a complex area. They deny Britain is dragging its feet over implementing equal pay legislation. The Department of Employment says its legal advisers are confident the UK is not in breach of its EC equal pay obligations. It believes the referral of the issue to Brussels will not help resolve genuine difficulties over implementing the UK's equal pay laws. Ministers' complaints that the commission should put the equal pay issue into a wider perspective are echoed in the private sector. 'British women have made larger advances at work than those from any other EC country in the 1980s,' says Mr Graham Mather, head of European Policy Forum, the independent think-tank. The UK's flexible, deregulated labour market has helped create the biggest female job market in Europe, the government argues; women in the UK are also less likely to be unemployed than men in a recession. In a recent paper to EC president Jacques Delors, the government said: 'The Community must avoid imposing labour market regulations that increase costs, lock member states and employers unnecessarily into existing rigidities or make it harder to create new jobs.' By approaching Brussels, however, the commission has decided not to rely on the government's willingness to negotiate, but to apply pressure by highlighting the UK's legal commitment to equal pay as enshrined in the Treaty of Rome, the EC's constitution. All 12 EC member states are bound to introduce equal pay under article 119 of the treaty. The equal pay concept was widened by an EC directive in 1975. No longer was the aim to ensure men and women received the same pay for doing the same or similar jobs; there was also to be equal pay for work of equal value. It is this requirement which prompts British government concern. Officials claim the EC has failed to define clearly what this means in practice. The Equal Opportunities Commission shares some of the government's frustration. But it is also exasperated at the lack of progress towards equal pay. It points out that women in all sectors in the UK earn on average 71 per cent of a man's weekly pay. In British manufacturing, the figure falls to 59 per cent of the weekly pay of male non-manual workers. There has been no significant narrowing of the gap since the early 1970s. The Department of Employment earnings survey for 1992 shows women's average earnings were Pounds 241.10 a week against Pounds 340.10 for men. The commission believes legal complexities are hampering moves to close the pay gap, adding that complaints procedures for cases of 'equal value', made through industrial tribunals, are tortuous. Equal value claims take on average 32 months, and a number have taken more than seven years. Only 23 claims in equal value cases have succeeded in nearly 10 years. In addition, the wording of the law is imprecise, argues the commission. This puts off potential claimants. According to UK law, a job must be of equal value 'in terms of the demands made on the woman or man (measured by effort, skill and level of responsibility) to that of a man or woman in the same employment'. At present the commission is funding an equal value case brought by a senior grade speech therapist, who is trying to compare her job with that of a senior grade pharmacist. A further concern for the commission is that an equal pay award made to one person cannot be extended to cover others doing the same jobs. The commission wants several changes to existing equal pay laws. It is calling for: The automatic transfer of cases from industrial tribunals to the Employment Appeals Tribunal. The abolition of a tribunal's legal requirement to decide whether a person has 'reasonable grounds' to pursue an equal value claim. The creation of full-time assessors of equal value, and a strict timetable for claims processing. An end to the use of job evaluation studies by employers to stop an equal value claim. The extension of equal pay awards beyond the individual claimant so that all employees in the same employment, who do the same or broadly similar work, would be entitled to the same award. The right for trade unions and the commission to challenge alleged discriminatory aspects of collective agreements. The right for the commission to initiate its own legal proceedings against employers. Mr Hunt told the commission last month that he was willing to make changes to speed up procedures in equal value cases, including: Agreeing to abolish the requirement that a tribunal should determine whether there are no reasonable grounds for claim. Accepting that an employer can only offer one justification of pay differences between male and female workers. Requiring independent experts to decide, within a 14-day time limit, whether they will conduct an investigation. Ministers baulk, however, at moves to extend the applicability of equal pay or equal value awards beyond individual workers to others in a company. Nor will they accept that the commission or trade unions should act on behalf of a group of workers to bring equal pay cases to court. Mr Hunt has reminded the commission that the government needs to avoid undue burdens on employers, which could threaten jobs. The commission feels only Brussels can bring reform. But its hopes may be dashed. A recent confidential European Commission report complains of difficulties in enforcing a commitment to equal pay across the EC. It admits that 'little effective progress' has been made on the issue anywhere in the EC, and suggests there remains 'a widespread lack of knowledge of the legal provisions and practical ways' of dealing with equal pay among governments, unions and employer bodies. As many as six EC countries - including Italy, Spain and Belgium - have not even bothered to define equal value in their legislation. 'Much remains to be done not only to ensure effective implementation of existing community law but also to clarify complex concepts,' the EC report notes. As Europe grapples with the worst unemployment crisis in 60 years, the Equal Opportunities Commission may find Brussels unwilling to strengthen legislation that could imperil job creation. If it has to wait years for an answer and then comes back empty-handed, the cause it is fighting for may be harmed.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Average weekly earnings before tax of full-time employees on adult rates 1992 Pounds  -------------------------------------------------------------------                                          Women        Men Cleaners and domestics                  151.60     199.40 Sales assistants                        149.00     190.20 Launderers, dry cleaners and pressers   141.40     178.80 Kitchen porters and hands               134.50     157.60 Bar staff                               129.70     172.80 Waitresses and waiters                  138.30     169.00  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: News Earnings Survey 1992 Department of Employment  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

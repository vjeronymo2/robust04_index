			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Multinationals seek investment treaty: EU and US companies concerned about threats to national treatment principle European and American multinational companies, concerned about discriminatory investment policies on both sides of the Atlantic, have launched a push for either a US-EU investment treaty or a wider investment pact among members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 'While the rules governing trade have advanced, most recently in the Uruguay Round, the rules on investment have not kept pace,' said Mr Willard Berry, president of the European-American Chamber of Commerce, which is leading the campaign for a new international agreement. 'Practices are emerging everywhere that denigrate the national treatment principle.' The principle of national treatment, enshrined in numerous treaties, guarantees that governments treat foreign-owned companies no less favourably than domestic companies. However, the rise of domestic competitiveness concerns during the last decade has spurred the emergence of 'conditional national investment' rules. The solution for Mr Berry and the 80 European and US multinational companies which belong to the chamber is an international pact which would re-commit governments to the national treatment standard. In exploratory conversations with officials in the US and Europe, the proposal has been received 'warmly', Mr Berry said. The chamber's plan is to develop a draft 'white paper' setting forth 'issues of concern and possible solutions' by the end of this month for distribution to US trade associations and European employers associations. A final paper could be completed by June 30, with the goal of preparing the way for some mention of a new investment pact at the meeting of the Group of Seven industrial country leaders in July. 'On both sides of the Atlantic there is a new focus on greater business-government co-operation to improve industrial competitiveness,' said Mr Berry. 'In this new environment unconditional national treatment for foreign-controlled firms can no longer be taken for granted.' In the US, national treatment has been the unacknowledged focus of a debate which had split the administration and Congress. At issue was whether companies born and headquartered in the US ought to be given government support unavailable to foreign-born companies although the latter may employ thousands of US workers. For an administration which has started to hand out hundreds of millions of dollars in matching grants for research and development, the issue of eligibility is crucial. According to Mr Berry, the administration has developed informal export advocacy guidelines which give preference to US-based companies. Congress has conditioned national treatment for in R&amp;D programmes, liberalised antitrust treatment, regulatory relief, and participation in special government programmes such as the clean car initiative. Foreign-based companies can be shut out from these programmes unless their governments extend reciprocal treatment for US companies, protect their intellectual property and open their standard-setting processes. The Swiss/Swedish Asea Brown Boveri, for example, has yet to be accepted by the Energy Department for participation in a project to develop the next generation of turbines. In Europe, the newly strengthened parliament has emerged as an advocate for reciprocity and domestic preferences. The controversy over Germany's refusal to apply discriminatory provisions of the EU Utilities Directive - and the extent to which it is prepared to challenge that refusal in the European Court of Justice - has come to symbolise the threat to US companies. If the court upholds the EU claim that the Treaty of Rome takes precedence over the US-German friendship, commerce and navigation treaties, than no national treatment commitments will be available to transatlantic business, says the chamber.</p>

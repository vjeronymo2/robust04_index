			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unsigned article: ``Possible Sites in Gard, Haute-Marne, </F> Meuse, and Vienne for Waste Storage Study Laboratories'']    [Text] Paris--Four departments, Gard, Haute-Marne, Meuse,  and Vienne have been suggested as possible sites for installing  two underground research laboratories for the storage of nuclear  waste, according to a 5 January announcement by Christian  Bataille, chief negotiator for these installations. Bataille  also announced that ``everything indicates that the government  will present proposals in the next few days,'' and he added that  only two sites would ultimately be picked.    More thorough investigations led by the Bureau of Geological  and Mining Research (BRGM) are planned for 1994 in those  departments. It will take another year to officially announce  the two sites chosen for installing the laboratories, which are  stipulated by the law of 30 December 1991.    While four geological strata--clay, granite, schist, and  salt--are considered suitable for holding highly active and  long-lived nuclear waste, which is the most dangerous--the  Bataille project has retained only the clay and granite options  after reviewing the initial geological data.    Bataille and his assistant, the prefect Jacques Monestier,  selected six likely departments out of thirty which applied to  the negotiators last year--Gard, Marne, Haute-Marne,  Meurthe-et-Moselle, Meuse, and Vienne. This selection was later  narrowed down to the four mentioned earlier in this article.    Bataille made several recommendations in the report he  presented to the ministers of Industry, Environment, and Land  Management, Messrs Gerard Longuet, Michel Barnier, and Charles  Pasqua. He suggested that ``the dialogue'' initiated under his  authority be ``pursued at the national and local levels.'' When  the time comes to build the storage facility--in 2008 at the  latest--he requests that the possibility of waste storage  reversibility resulting from research conducted by the Atomic  Energy Commission (CEA), among others, be taken into account.  Finally, according to him, the future of the laboratories once  their work is accomplished should be ``guaranteed and  formalized.''    Each laboratory, employing 150 people including about 30  scientists, should require an investment of one and a half  billion francs and will serve for fifteen years. Operating costs  for each are estimated at 70 million per year in addition to 60  million annually for local development.</p>

			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SPRAY AREA WARNINGS ISSUED  </P> <P> State and county agriculture officials, trying to stave off the spread of the  destructive Mediterranean fruit fly, today began distributing about 100,000  flyers to North Orange County residents whose neighborhoods are to be sprayed  later this week with a pesticide.  </P> <P> The assault was prompted by the discovery earlier this month in a Brea guava  tree of a pregnant Medfly, the insect that ravaged the state's agriculture in  1981. County officials said today that they have revised earlier strategies for  combating the Medfly and are planning only one pesticide spraying over a  10-square-mile area of the northern county rather than seven separate  applications.  </P> <P> That will come Thursday night unless heavy winds cause a delay. County and  state officials, although asserting there are no health risks posed by the  spraying with the possible exception of temporary eye irritation, are urging  residents in the affected area to stay indoors Thursday night and to put pets  and cars under cover.  </P></p>

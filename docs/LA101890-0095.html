			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Coming to Court: Eddie Murphy faces yet another plagiarism lawsuit in  connection with Paramount Pictures' "Coming to America."  </P> <P> Prince Johnny Osseni-Bello, a self-proclaimed Nigerian prince and  actor-producer, is seeking $100 million in damages, charging that his 1983  screenplay "Toto, the African Prince" (co-written with Shelby M. Gregory) was  actually the inspiration for the Murphy movie. Last week, Murphy's attorney  sought to dismiss the action but a Los Angeles Superior Court judge refused to  dismiss it. Osseni-Bello said that he knows Murphy and in 1982 told him about  his idea. Co-writer Gregory filed his own copyright lawsuit against Murphy in  1988 seeking $10 million in damages.

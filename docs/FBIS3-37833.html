UN spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said the aim of the two to  three day session was to achieve an overall settlement. Topping  the agenda are the return of 200,000 to 300,000 refugees who  fled Abkhazia in last year's fighting, and a discussion of  Abkhazia's political status.    Under the old Soviet constitution, Abkhazia was an  autonomous  republic within Georgia. The speaker of its parliament in  Sukhumi, Vladislav Ardzinba, told the press here that Abkhazia  could choose between independence or coexistence in equality  with Georgia. Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze has insisted a  solution must respect Georgia's territorial integrity.    The previous round of talks ended in mid-January with  agreement in principle on the withdrawal of troops and a  demilitarisation zone between the belligerents.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Heseltine stresses role in winning Rover safeguards The government's role in seeking to safeguard the future of Rover's operations in Britain after its acquisition by BMW of Germany was stressed by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, in the Commons last night. Pressure from Tory backbenchers and Labour MPs for a cut in interest rates brought no response from the government during a debate on manufacturing industry. Mr Heseltine vigorously denied Labour charges that the passing of Britain's last volume carmaker into foreign ownership would mark the abandonment of the approach to industrial policy he advocated when bidding for leadership of the Conservative party. While acknowledging that he was in the Far East on a trade mission when the agreement by Rover to sell to BMW was announced, he insisted: 'We did not stand back from it.' Mr Heseltine said Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, saw leading figures in BMW, as a result of which 'assurances were given'. He emphasised that if the deal was agreed, Rover would maintain its UK base with independent manufacturing, design and development facilities. Mr Heseltine told MPs: 'I am proud that it was one of my ministers who asked for these assurances and got them.' Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, attacked the government's failure to prevent erosion of the manufacturing base.</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Three anti-apartheid South African political parties announced they have merged  in anticipation of national elections this year. The formation of the new  party, to be known as the Democratic Party, is an attempt to broaden the  political base of white liberals, who are widely seen as being in a state of  disarray. The party will be launched formally in Johannesburg on April 8, but  "concerted planning and action begin today," the organization said after a  meeting. The Democratic Party will have three leaders who presently are serving  as the heads of the merging parties. They are Zac de Beer of the Progressive  Federal Party, Wynand Malan of the National Democratic Movement, and Denis  Worrall of the Independent Party.  </P></p>

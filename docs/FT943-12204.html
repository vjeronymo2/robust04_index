			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Tea There was good demand for bright Africans which, after a hesitant start, closed at fully firm levels reports the Tea Broker's Association. Mediums met less enquiry and lost 3-5 pence, with plainer sorts irregular and sometimes lower. Brighter Ceylons lost some ground but there was improved competition for poorer types which often gained several pence. Demand improved for brighter Ceylons which were dearer, while Africans ruled fully firm. Price indications for the week: best available 215p/kg, nom, good 156p/kg, good medium 138p/kg, medium 120p/kg, low medium 86p/kg. The highest price realised this week was 215p for a rwanda pd.</p>

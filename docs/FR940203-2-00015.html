Live rock means certain living marine organisms, or an assemblage thereof, attached to a hard substrate (including dead coral or rock). In addition to live corals, these organisms may include anemones, sponges, tube worms, mollusks, crustaceans, bryozoans, sea squirts, and marine algae. Management measures adopted could include harvest limitations, such as limited entry or a total prohibition of harvest to prevent fishery habitat loss, a provision for aquaculture of live rock, and permits for scientific and educational collections. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1989, the Florida Department of Natural Resources (FDNR) (now Department of Environmental Protection) determined that live rock harvest (i.e., the collection of rocks with marine organisms attached for use in home aquariums) was detrimental to the Florida Reef Tract and other hard bottom habitat areas. The Florida Marine Fisheries Commission (FMFC) noted that the only current net production of the carbonate substrate underlying live rock occurs on living rock reefs and, in Florida, these areas are either in equilibrium or eroding. FDNR personnel testified that more than 90 percent of the live rock examined at the request of enforcement agents contained visible colonies of prohibited corals, such as stony corals and sea fans. The FMFC concluded that live rock removal (1) can violate State and Federal laws that prohibit taking of corals, (2) reduces the surface area and topographic complexity of Florida's coral reefs and other live bottom areas, and (3) removes entire micro-communities along with targeted aquarium species. As a result of this rulemaking, live rock harvesting efforts shifted to the EEZ off Florida. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FMFC has noted that in 1991 approximately 35 individuals reported combined landings of about 300 tons of live rock from EEZ waters adjacent to the Florida Reef Tract, Florida's east coast reefs, and the Gulf of Mexico hard bottom areas. In 1992, reported Florida landings from the EEZ totalled about 400 tons. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

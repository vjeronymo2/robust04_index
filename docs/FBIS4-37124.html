			<p>BFN     [Text] Tyre, Lebanon, June 17 (AFP) -- Clashes between  Iranian-backed Hizballah guerrillas and allied Israeli  militiamen killed a civilian woman and wounded four people in  south Lebanon on Friday, police said.    The fighting broke out after Hizballah attacked an SLA  outpost on the edge of Israel's self-declared "security zone" in  south Lebanon with machine guns and B-7 rocket-propelled  grenades, police in the southern port of Tyre said.    A group of guerrillas advanced close to the South Lebanese  Army (SLA) outpost at al-Qantarah at mid-morning firing and as  they pulled back the position came under a hail of mortar fire.    The SLA retaliated with a heavy artillery barrage on  villages  just north of the security zone, sending several shells crashing  into civilian homes and killing a 50-year-old woman and wounding  four other people, police added.    They fired more than 20 shells on the villages of Qabrikha,  Tulin and Wadi al-Saluqi which face the al-Qantarah outpost and  fires were reported in the region.    Two Israeli Cobra helicopters gunships also went into  action,  strafing a ravine used by the guerrillas to attack the security  zone, police said.    On Thursday Israeli warplanes blasted a Hizballah base in  the  Iqlim al-Tuffah hills in south Lebanon. Two planes fired a  missile at Mlita without causing any casualties.    Up to 45 guerrillas were killed on June 2 in an Israeli  helicopter raid on a Hizballah training camp in the  Syrian-controlled eastern Ba'labakk region.    Since then Israel has flown daily sorties over Lebanon  searching to wipe out Hizballah resistance fighters.</p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Taking chances for peace While the attention of the US and Europe is focused on the former states of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, the Middle East peace process is suffering. Eighteen months after the inaugural meeting in Madrid, the five teams of negotiators have yet to report progress on any matters of substance, no sense of momentum has developed, and the enemies of compromise are gaining strength. Optimism stems mainly from the fact that talks are continuing, and no participant wishes to bear the responsibility for ending the process. But there is increasing recognition among the Arab delegations and among US officials that domestic pressures on the participants could eventually impose a breaking point. This is particularly the case for the Palestinians. Whatever misjudgements and lost opportunities can be blamed on them in the past, they have come to the negotiating table essentially as supplicants. Much of what was demanded of the Palestine Liberation Organisation by the international community has been conceded. Mr Yassir Arafat is a pale shadow of the man who once ruled part of Lebanon and dreamed of the military liberation of Palestine. Syria has retained more of its political clothing, but it, too, has been forced to accept that it will only regain the Golan Heights, which it lost in 1967, by negotiating a full peace with Israel. Jordan and Lebanon acknowledge that their outstanding issues with Israel can only be resolved in the context of an agreement between Israel, the Syrians and the Palestinians. Take the risks It is understandably difficult for Israel to adjust to the enormity of those changes, precisely because it is the Jewish state which has to take the risks involved in testing the sincerity of its Arab neighbours. It is tempting for a cautious political leadership to conclude that the diminution of the military threat to Israel allows it to be less forthcoming at the negotiating table. That certainly was the view of the last Likud government under Mr Yitzhak Shamir. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, his Labour successor as prime minister, appeared to promise much more. He campaigned on the pledge to secure an interim agreement with the Palestinians within nine months and his senior colleagues stressed their willingness to withdraw from Gaza, most of the West Bank and most, possibly all, of Golan. Under occupation The collapse of Mr Rabin's timetable can be explained by his excessive caution, the limitations of coalition government, and the obvious fact that the peace process does not exist in a Washington vacuum. The Palestinian negotiators and their families live under occupation. Their legitimacy as leaders rests on their ability to ease living conditions in the territories, and in moving towards Palestinian self-determination. This has so far been denied to them in negotiations giving their radical opponents, essentially Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the chance to set the political agenda. Mr Rabin's expulsion of over 400 Palestinians and the more recent closure of the occupied territories, which has cost 100,000 people the opportunity to work, were radical responses to Israeli public concern over worsening violence. But the impact of those actions was also to intensify unrest within the territories, boost the standing of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and make it extremely difficult for the Palestinian negotiators to return to Washington. It has to be in the long-term interests of Israel and the moderate Palestinian majority to reverse this trend as quickly as possible. Israel's decision to permit the return of 30 Palestinians expelled before 1987 is a step in the right direction. Easing restrictions on the West Bank and Gaza would further help. But there is no substitute for offering the Palestinians a great deal more than the chance to carry out some administrative functions under the existing regulations affecting the occupied territories. By refusing to make any offer which might be interpreted as opening the door to an independent state, Israel is limiting the scope of negotiations to the point where even the most moderate Palestinians could find it impossible to continue. If Mr Rabin is really serious about taking chances for peace, the moment to demonstrate it is now.</p>

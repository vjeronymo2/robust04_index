			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Risks of joint ventures Clearly define the objectives, ensure that there is frequent consultation between the partners, and make room for a 'collaboration champion'. According a report* from the School of Management at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, companies that follow those rules when setting up a product development joint venture have a better chance of success. The study, which draws on the experience of more than 100 UK manufacturers of telecommunications systems and equipment, computer hardware and computer software producers, points out that collaboration can often have a negative impact on businesses. Among problems that frequently crop up are the leakage of company information not included in the original agreement, loss of control over development and a lengthening of the product development process. Partners can lose their early commitment, turn competitor, or leave high termination costs in their wake. Most companies in the sample, selected at random from national trade directories, did not generally feel that collaboration improved responsiveness to customer needs or market opportunities. Umist's report, which comes at a time when there is evidence of renewed interest in strategic alliances of all kinds, cites customer initiatives and lack of expertise to exploit market opportunities independently as common stimuli to product development collaboration. Respondents were also motivated by the prospect of reduced risks and costs. The most common yardstick of success was the profitability of the product, though this was typically used in conjunction with other measures such as meeting deadlines and cost targets. Respondents engaging in proportionately more collaborative activity were more likely to measure success by whether it led to a longer-term relationship. *Risks and Rewards of Collaboration.

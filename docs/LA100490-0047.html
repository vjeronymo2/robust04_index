			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NO INDICTMENTS OVER INMATE'S CHOKING DEATH;  </P> <P> JAILS: FEDERAL DECISION FOLLOWS COUNTY REVIEWS THAT CLEARED THE SIX DEPUTIES  INVOLVED.  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors have decided not to indict six San Diego County deputy  sheriffs involved in the choking death of a jail inmate, a lawyer for the man's  family said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Despite a lengthy investigation into the January, 1988, death of Albert Varela,  28, who was choked in a fight with deputies at the County Jail downtown,  prosecutors have opted against pursuing criminal charges against the six  deputies, attorney J. Manuel (Manny) Sanchez said.  </P> <P> The federal investigation follows earlier reviews by the Sheriff's Department  and county district attorney that cleared the deputies of criminal wrongdoing.  </P> <P> Varela's death was among the first in a string of complaints in 1988 about  beatings and abuses by sheriff's deputies in all six county jails. Last year,  the U.S. attorney's office and the FBI decided not to pursue allegations of  civil rights violations in 70 individual complaints of inmates being abused by  deputies, but they continued to investigate the Varela case.  </P> <P> The death also touched off sharp criticism of the Sheriff's Department by  community leaders, particularly from San Diego's Latino community, where some  rights activists charged that Latinos were being unduly abused by law  enforcement officers.  </P> <P> Varela's father, Cruz Varela, 64, of Lakeside, a General Dynamics  missile-building mechanic, said Wednesday he was disappointed and frustrated.  </P> <P> "I feel it's kind of political," he said. "We're small people down here. We  probably don't have the money, that's the main thing, to put in the right  places.  </P> <P> "That seems to be the whole thing, I hear," Varela said. "If you've got money,  your name sits up there high, they sit up and listen to you. But we happen to  be a minority. That didn't help our cause very much. I definitely don't feel we  got a fair shake" in the legal system.  </P> <P> Court records identify the six deputies as Roy DeVault (who has since left the  department to attend college), Carlos Rodriguez, Jon Ellis, Ronald K. Brown, J.  J. Rodi and S. T. Riley.  </P> <P> Albert Varela was arrested Jan. 22, 1988, after he allegedly violated a court  order to stay away from his family because of past temper tantrums. When police  arrived, he asked to be taken to the downtown jail.  </P> <P> According to the district attorney's investigation, a fight broke out while  Varela was being booked. The fight began when Rodriguez "threw Varela's clothes  to him, and Varela, in turn, threw them at Deputy Rodriguez."  </P> <P> A fight ensued, and the five other deputies tried to help Rodriguez subdue  Varela, who was 6-foot-1 and weighed 286 pounds. DeVault applied a carotid  restraint hold on Varela's neck while the other inmates kept him off balance,  the district attorney found, and Varela eventually fell face down on the floor.  </P> <P> With blood coming out of his nose, Varela was handcuffed and dragged by his  legs -- with his chin scraping the floor -- and placed inside a padded safety  cell, where his vital signs were examined and found to be weak, the district  attorney said. He was taken to UC San Diego Medical Center, where he was  pronounced dead.  </P> <P> The formal announcement of the federal investigation's result is contained in a  letter that Sanchez said was in the mail. He said government sources told him  Wednesday that the letter indicates there will be no federal prosecution.  </P> <P> "Every indication up to now has been that the facts and evidence were clear --  that the violation of this man's civil rights, the result of his death, was  criminal in nature," Sanchez said.  </P> <P> He added: "It's a long time to come to this juncture, and I believe the Varela  family is deeply affected by it. Their sense of justice is that the responsible  persons should be made accountable for the death of their son, and are not."  </P> <P> Sanchez also said a decision to pursue prosecution could have sent a message:  "If there's a message out there, it's that you've got to stop these things.  Otherwise, the death of a guy like Varela is going to happen again. Now the  message is, 'We can get away with it, guys.' "  </P> <P> Stephen P. Clark, the assistant U.S. attorney who specializes in civil rights  investigations and who handled the grand jury investigation in the Varela  death, declined to comment on the case Wednesday.  </P> <P> Sheriff John Duffy could not be reached for comment. Neither could various  lawyers involved in the case.  </P> <P> The grand jury targeted the six deputies earlier this year. In letters mailed  to the deputy sheriffs in April, the U.S. attorney's office -- which was  believed to be presenting the case in May to the grand jury for possible  indictments -- invited the deputies to testify about Varela's death.  </P> <P> It is not clear whether any of the six deputies agreed to testify. In May, it  was believed that none of the six had come forward.  </P> <P> The federal investigation, meanwhile, shut down action in an $8-million civil  lawsuit filed in San Diego Superior Court by the Varela family against the  deputies, Duffy and the county.  </P> <P> According to court records, the deputies were invoking their constitutional  privilege against self-incrimination in the civil case by refusing to provide  information about Varela's death until after the federal probe had concluded.  </P> <P> Exactly two years ago, the district attorney's office declined to hold any of  the deputies criminally liable for the death, saying Varela died when his heart  stopped. There was "no evidence" the chokehold blocked Varela's airway, the  office said.  </P> <P> However, county prosecutors did chastise the deputies for dragging Varela  across the floor. The civil lawsuit, which the Varela family filed in October,  1988, alleged that the deputies were engaged in "ultra-hazardous and dangerous  activity" when they used the carotid hold on Varela's throat.  </P> <P> The case was working its way toward a trial when attorneys abruptly advised the  court last year that the deputies did not want to take part in pretrial  discovery, the process through which both sides exchange information about the  case. The lawyers said the deputies feared that any information they provided  in the suit could be used against them in the federal probe. A status hearing  in the civil case is set for Oct. 19, court records indicate.  </P></p>

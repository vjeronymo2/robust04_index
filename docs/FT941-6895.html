			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / India budget expected to continue reforms Mr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, is expected to set out plans for further economic reforms in his annual budget speech today. Import duties, corporate taxes and possibly interest rates are likely to be reduced to both promote growth and to continue with the economic liberalisation programme which Mr Singh and Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, launched in mid-1991. Mr Singh is also expected to announce measures to cut government borrowings, which have soared so far above the targets that financial ministry officials fear over-spending by the public sector could yet stifle efforts to encourage the private-sector-led expansion. The government, in its Economic Survey published last week, said the fiscal deficit for the year ending March 1994 would be 'substantially higher' than the target of 4.5 per cent of GDP. Supporters of economic liberalisation have been pressing the government to use the budget to bring the economy back to the top of the political agenda. They believe much time was wasted last year when ministers' energies were absorbed by the violence which swept Bombay and other cities. Mr Tarun Das, general secretary of the Confederation of Indian Industry, the employers' organisation, said last week: 'This budget must be dramatic, not wishy-washy. It must contain substantive reforms. By next year it will be too late because politicians will be taken up with the next general election (which must be held by 1996).' Stock market investors, including foreign fund managers who have put more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 685m) into Indian equities in the past nine months, are also betting on a pro-reform budget. Share prices have doubled in the past year and could fall sharply if the budget proves a disappointment. The Economic Survey included some general indications of likely reforms. The report said further reductions in government subsidies for food and other commodities were necessary to help cut government spending. It urged ministers to widen the tax net and replace the present complex system of excise duties levied at varying rates with a simple value-added tax-based system. It also called for the government to pull further out of the economy, with more privatisation and an easing of controls on trade, land, finance and labour. Labour law reform is a particularly sensitive area because India's laws severely limit employers' rights to make workers redundant or even to redeploy them. The Economic Survey said companies could not gear up for expanding production if they feared they might later be burdened with excess labour.</p>

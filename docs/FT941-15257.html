			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Sport: Championship on the line - A look at the key tactical battles in today's international at Cardiff / Rugby Union: The Five Nations The Five Nations Championship opens this afternoon with France (the champions) playing rejuvenated Ireland, and Wales (the holders of the wooden spoon) entertaining Scotland in Cardiff. These games will provide an early test of how much the coaches have learnt from last season's experience with the new laws. This is the second year since the changes. Two changes have proved particularly significant. The first is that if a penalty is kicked into touch, the team doing the kicking is awarded the throw-in. As the number of penalties has grown this has put a premium both on the line kicker, who cannot afford to miss touch, and the line-out. Win the line-out and you win the match. The second-row forwards must now be better line-out performers than scrummagers. The hooker must throw in better than he can hook. It does not matter (as the French have shown) who throws in, as long as they throw accurately. Throwing has changed too. The two hookers in Cardiff today, Garin Jenkins and Ken Milne take the ball behind their head (and therefore out of their line of sight). Darts players throw from in front of their face and it makes sense for hookers to follow suit, as does Sean Fitzpatrick, the New Zealand captain. The French won the first Test against Australia in October but this was a fluke because they lost the line-outs. If the Welsh second row pairing of Phil Davies and Gareth Llewellyn out-play the new cap, Shade Munro and the old stager, Neil Edwards, as they should do, then Wales should win. From the line-out the object is to cross the imaginary gain-line as close to the forwards as possible. This has meant that all three back-row players and the scrum-half try to batter their way through the first line of defence. Expect endless variations on this theme from the Scottish trio of Derek Turnbull, Robert Wainwright and Iain Morrison. The key is to make sure that the ball comes back on your side. When their teams win this position, the fly-halves, Gareth Jenkins and Craig Chalmers will hoof the ball up in the air - the 'bomb' in rugby league, the more prosaic Garryowen in union. When the ball comes down a defender will catch it surrounded by the opposition who will make sure the ensuing maul or ruck is inconclusive so their team wins the put-in at the scrum. This change in the laws has altered the very nature of the game. Wales have no players of sufficient individual brilliance to win matches on their own. Scott Quinnell, Rupert Moon and Neil Jenkins at number eight, scrum-half and fly-half respectively have to hold the side together. Jenkins is having a fine season at club level but has struggled in his 17 internationals (much as Rob Andrew did during his first 20 caps). Wales so badly need a fly-half. I hope it is his day. The only certainty about Scotland is that they will turn up for the game. They will need to experiment early on in the line-out by shortening them and must not be afraid to run the ball from deep positions. Too often they have waited until the last quarter of the game before gambling and too often they have depended on Gavin Hastings' place kicking abilities. Wales and Scotland fear failure and will keep their tactics simple. Both teams will kick for yardage again and again. Wales must win. Scotland cannot afford to lose.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Jia Xiping (6328 6007 1627) and </F> XINHUA reporter Han Zhenjun (7281 2182 6511)]    [Text] Beijing, 16 Jun (XINHUA) -- State Councillor Song  Jian met a visiting French space aviation delegation in Beijing  today. During the meeting, Song Jian said: China and France  have a long history of cooperation in science and technology.  The French space aviation delegation's visit is of great  significance to promoting exchanges and cooperation in space  technology between the two countries.    Song Jian said: In the past, China and France cooperated  successfully in the basic sciences and high technology. For  instance, the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station is a  crystallization of cooperation between scientific and  technological personnel in the two countries. The joint survey  of the Himalayas by geological prospectors from the two  countries has basically determined the cause of the Himalayas'  protrusion, winning acclaim from the international geological  scientific circles. France's achievements in space aviation,  atomic energy, and modern communications technology have riveted  the world's attention. China is willing to conduct friendly  cooperation with France in these areas.    During the meeting, Song Jian also briefed the delegation on  the State Aerospace Bureau's [organization name as received;  current name China Aerospace Industry Corporation] functions.  He said: China's commercial space aviation is under the State  Aerospace Bureau's management. On behalf of the Chinese  Government, the bureau signs intergovernmental aerospace  agreements and makes arrangements for participation in  international organizations, international conferences, and  government-to-government scientific and technological exchanges  and cooperation.    The French space aviation delegation is led by Louis [name  as  received], director of the French Aerospatiale. It includes  officials from the major French space companies. The delegation  will participate in activities pegged to "Sino-French Space  Industry Week" in Beijing and Shanghai.</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Poland maintains industrial growth POLAND'S industrial output grew in June for the third month in succession and export revenues continued to rise, fuelling hopes that the country's three-year-old recession could be reversed by the end of the year. The brighter economic outlook augurs well for Poland's forthcoming talks with the International Monetary Fund on an agreement reopening access to credits worth Dollars 1.6bn. These were suspended last autumn when the country overshot its budget deficit and foreign reserves targets. Agreement with the IMF is essential if Poland is to win a further 20 per cent reduction in debts owed to western governments; these have already been reduced by 30 per cent. Industrial output in the first half was still 3 per cent down on the same period in 1991, according to GUS, the Central Statistical Office. However, the rate of decline is slowing markedly: output in the first quarter had fallen by 6.3 per cent. The budget deficit had reached 25,700bn zlotys (Pounds 993m) by the end of June, still within the year-end ceiling of 65,500 zlotys or 5 per cent of GDP. Mid-year export revenues totalled Dollars 6.9bn, a rise of 12.5 per cent on the first half of 1991. Imports shrank 8 per cent to Dollars 5.9bn, leaving a Dollars 946m trade surplus compared to a Dollars 332m deficit in 1991. Inflation is also slowing, with prices rising 1.6 per cent in June from May.</p>

No activity was  allowed in the Rajya Sabha except for question answer and zero  time periods.    Activities in the Lok Sabha was suspended twice for one hour  and until tomorrow. The Rajya Sabha was interrupted for 15  minutes due to the noise by the opposition members, and was  suspended after lunch for the rest of the day.    Nothing was said from the government side even after Shiv  Raj  Patil, the Lok Sabha president, asked for it twice. Mr. Sibte  Razi, acting vice chairman of the Rajya Sabha, told the angry  opposition members after lunch that the commerce minister will  make a statement in the House, however, the opposition members  did not accept it.    In the Rajya Sabha, as the activities began after lunch, the  opposition members began to demand the commerce minister's  statement right away. The acting vice chairman announced that  after talks with Vice Chairman Nazma Heptullah, Commerce  Minister Mukherji had agreed to make a statement the next day.  The opposition members were not satisfied with it and continued  to demand the commerce minister's attendance right then.    During this tumult, Mr. Padamnabham of Telagu Desam demanded  that the commerce minister must come that very day to make a  statement.    Jayapal Reddy of the Janata Dal said there was no use of a  statement tomorrow since the government was signing the Dunkel  draft tonight.    Dr. Subraynam Swami of the Janata Party expressed concern  that the newspapers knew of the Dunkel draft, but the House  members were not given any information. He said that they had  been assured that the commerce minister was going to make a  statement in the House today. However, he did not keep the  promise.    Because of the noise and demand made by some members to  cancel the meeting, Mr. Razi suspended House activities until  tomorrow. The House activities were limited to only 10 minutes  after lunch.    Sit-in: Several political parties and farmer organizations  staged a sit-in outside Jantar Mantar to protest against Dunkel  draft and demanded that it be fully rejected. These leaders said  that the government should not sign on to this agreement as  planned.    The sit-in against the Dunkel draft was organized by Genes  Campaign, a non-political organization. According to Mohan  Prakash, the leader of the group, similar protest rallies were  organized in Ranchi, Agra, Merut, Bareilly, Jaipur, Churu, and  many other cities around the nation.    Raghu Thakur, general secretary of the Samajwadi Party;  Rajesh Tiwari, first secretary of the party's Delhi unit;  Kumudini, general secretary of Indian People's Front; Shiv  Mangal Siddantkar, first secretary of the Front's Delhi unit;  V.S. Rao, parliamentary leader of Telagu Desam; Ashok Mitra,  leader of the Communist Party of India (M); and Mahavir Singh,  president of the Delhi unit of the Indian Farmers Union took  part in this protest rally.    The leaders who addressed the sit-in said that the  government, instead of standing firm, has bowed down in front of  GATT. They sadly declared that the government did not try to  protect the nation's interests.</p>

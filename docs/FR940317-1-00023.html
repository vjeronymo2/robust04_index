			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In analyzing attempts by foreign countries at defining the term the petitioner has concluded that, although many foreign countries generally provide for rather broad, subjective tests to determine the ``reserve'' character of table wine, there is no consistent international standard for use of the term.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although not defined in the regulations, ATF has permitted the use of such terms as ``reserve,'' ``vintner's select,'' ``barrel select,'' ``premium,'' etc. on wine labels. The Bureau considers these terms to be mere ``puffery.'' It has been ATF's position that consumers recognize these terms as expressing the proprietor's subjective evaluation of the wine, rather than as terms denoting any objective standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Wine Institute Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the reasons mentioned above, the Wine Institute has proposed the following definition for the term ``reserve'' when used on wine labels:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For U.S. appellations, any table wine which is a vintage dated grape table wine that is either varietal, or which contains multiple varieties where each of the varieties is listed by percentage of total content, may be designated ``reserve'' wine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, a state, county, or viticultural area may establish more stringent regulations governing the designation of ``reserve'' under rules and regulations to be established by individual states or local agencies.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the Wine Institute's proposed definition applies to domestic wines only, ATF notes that any amendment of the regulations to provide for a definition of the term ``reserve'' would apply to domestic wine, as well as to foreign wine imported into the U.S. ATF believes that for purposes of consistency a uniform meaning of the term is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATF would also point out that the proposed definition applies to grape table wine only, i.e., grape wine having an alcoholic content of between 7 and 14 percent by volume. Consequently, if the petitioner's proposed definition is adopted into the regulations the term could not be used on labels of any other type of wine, such as sparkling wine (e.g., champagne).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ATF is requesting information from consumers and industry members on the desirability of amending the regulations to provide for a definition of the term ``reserve'' when used on wine labels. While ATF has traditionally taken the position that the use of subjective puffery on the label does not result in consumer confusion, ATF wishes to solicit comments from both consumers and industry members on whether the term ``reserve'' is being used in a confusing or misleading fashion on labels. Although ATF is soliciting comments on the following specific questions, the Bureau is also requesting any relevant information on the subject.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. What does the term ``reserve'' mean to consumers?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. What does the term mean to members of the wine industry?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Should the term be defined in the wine regulations? If so, should there be a different standard for still wines and sparkling wines?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Do other similar terms such as ``vintner's select,'' ``barrel select,'' ``premium,'' etc., mean anything to consumers? What about to members of the industry?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Should these terms be defined in the regulations?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The term ``reserve'' also appears on labels of malt beverages and distilled spirits. What does it mean to consumers when it appears on these products? What does it mean to members of the malt beverage and distilled spirits industries who label their products with this term?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Should the term be defined in the regulations for malt beverages and distilled spirits?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. How much American wine labeled with the ``reserve'' designation is exported into EC member nations? Have exporters of American wine encountered problems in Germany or any other EC member nations concerning wine which is labeled with the term ``reserve?''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. ATF has observed that the term ``reserve'' often appears on labels of foreign wines imported into the U.S. Do the countries where these wines originate have any laws or regulations governing the use of this term?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It has been determined that this advance notice is not a significant regulatory action as defined by Executive Order 12866.

Comments received after that date will be given the same consideration if it is practical to do so, but assurance of consideration cannot be given except as to comments received on or before the closing date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATF will not recognize any material in comments as confidential.

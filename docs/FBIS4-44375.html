			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl is confident  that a candidate who is supported by all 12 European Union [EU]  member states can be found to succeed EU Commission President  Jacques Delors before the constituting session of the European  Parliament.    Kohl said Wednesday [29 June] on SAT-1 television that,  first  of all, one has to ask each country whether there is a  possibility of agreeing on the candidacy of Belgian Prime  Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. "Then we have to see," the  chancellor said. He stated, however, that it is completely  absurd to speak of a lasting and profound crisis in the EU  because of this issue. At the EU summit in Corfu last weekend,  Dehaene's nomination failed because of Britain's veto.</p>

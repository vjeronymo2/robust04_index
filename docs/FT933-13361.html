			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Costs of EC laws to be published THE COSTS to business of complying with European Community legislation are to be highlighted by ministers as part of the deregulation initiative. The aim is to focus attention within the government and more generally on the costs of meeting EC requirements. Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, said yesterday that where costs to business would be significant, the government would publish compliance cost assessments to go with the explanatory memoranda that the government submits to parliament on EC proposals. The move comes immediately before today's Downing Street meeting, chaired by Mr John Major, the prime minister, at which ministers will report progress on deregulation. Mr Major has repeatedly emphasised that deregulating should be one of the government's key themes. A bill to repeal outdated pieces of regulation, and to make it easier for ministers to make further deregulatory changes in future will be one of the main planks of the next session's legislative programme. At Downing Street's deregulation seminar in February, it was agreed that Mr Major should receive progress reports every two months to ensure that the current drive against red tape retained more momentum than its predecessors.</p>

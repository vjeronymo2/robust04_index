In contrast, if  the National Front rules Sabah after the 18-19 February  elections, it will respect and provide equal treatment to all  religions. Speaking at a public gathering at the (Kinaru Papar)  junior high school, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said the  National Front does not give priority to a single ethnic group,  but attaches great importance to all ethnic groups.    The deputy prime minister also criticized PBS leader Datuk  Pairin, who was found guilty of corruption and is interested  only in his own interests and those of his family and immediate  circle of friends, without paying attention to the plight of the  people. Datuk Anwar said the upcoming elections will be a golden  opportunity for the Sabah people to get rid of Datuk Pairin and  the PBS if they want a change in Sabah political leadership. He  said he is satisfied with the support given by local voters and  believes that Sabah will get a new government after the  elections if all voters give their support to the National Front.</p>

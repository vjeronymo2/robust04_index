			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONTREAL LOOKS WITHIN ITSELF IN WAKE OF MASS KILLING;  </P> <P> VIOLENCE: SOME SAY THE COLD-BLOODED MURDER OF 14 WOMEN WAS THE WORK OF A  SINGULAR MADMAN. OTHERS AREN'T SO SURE.  </P> <P> Female radio sports-show host Danielle Rainville says she has been plagued for  years by men who contended that she had stolen a job that rightly belonged to a  man. Sometimes the calls came as often as twice a week, she says, adding, "One  of them said that he was going to break my neck."  </P> <P> But Rainville says she ignored the male griping until Montreal's shocking mass  murder this week, in which the unemployed killer deliberately sought out female  victims because he thought feminists in general had ruined his life.  </P> <P> Now, Rainville is so nervous she says that she can't eat or sleep at night, and  is not sure she will ever be the same again on the air. She has become both a  subject of and a participant in a debate here over what the slayings may reveal  about Canadian society.  </P> <P> Wednesday, 25-year-old Marc Lepine entered the Ecole Polytechnique of the  University of Montreal and went on a shooting spree in which he hunted down  women and left men alive. In one mechanical engineering classroom, he even  asked the men to leave the room before lining up the female students and  opening fire on them. He was reported to have accused the women of being  "feminists" as he fired. Fourteen women died, and 13 other people were wounded.  </P> <P> Some Montrealers are saying now that the murders were the work of a  one-of-a-kind madman, a lunatic whose actions say nothing about mainstream  Canadian attitudes toward women. Indeed, the details emerging about the man  make him appear uniquely disturbed.  </P> <P> Other Montrealers, however, argue that the killer's actions are only the most  extreme example of sexism and violence against women -- and resentment of  successful female professionals.  </P> <P> "This is a particularly gruesome expression of anti-feminist sentiment, but we  get this kind of thing every day," says Alice de Wolff of the National Action  Committee on the Status of Women. "Usually, people do a tirade: miserable  feminists trying to ruin the world."  </P> <P> Investigators handling Lepine's case have said that the gunman's Algerian  father left home forever when the boy was only 7, and that as a young man,  Lepine proved himself incapable of maintaining stable relationships with women.  They said that when things did not go his way with women, he would cut off all  conversation and retreat to his room.  </P> <P> Although given the name Gamil Gharbi at birth, he changed to his mother's  French name as a teen-ager. He constantly wore a baseball cap, as if to hide  his curly hair.  </P> <P> Police have also learned that while Lepine aspired to study at the Ecole  Polytechnique himself, he failed some of his preparatory classes and was never  admitted to the elite engineering school. He was also turned down by the  Canadian armed forces.  </P> <P> He seemed to seek refuge from his personal troubles in war movies, which police  said he watched as if "obsessed." He was known to frequent at least one  Montreal gun shop.  </P> <P> Neighbors remember Lepine as a withdrawn and silent tenant.  </P> <P> "I had nothing against him, but the way he was looking at everybody with big  eyes!" said Gerard Claveau, Lepine's middle-aged next-door neighbor. "He was  crazy."  </P> <P> On the evening of the mass murder, police arriving on the scene found a suicide  note in Lepine's pocket, blaming his problems on feminists and containing an  apparent hit list of prominent Canadian women. The next day, sports-show host  Rainville found out that her name was on the list. (Police have been keeping  the other names a secret, to protect the women.)  </P> <P> "I wish I didn't know," Rainville says. "It makes me think that someday  something like this will happen (to me). I haven't been able to eat since  yesterday afternoon. I had nightmares last night."  </P> <P> Rainville's fears echo what some other women here are thinking: That the killer  might just have easily have chosen them, that his notoriety might inspire other  men to kill again and that his hatred of women might represent something larger  than a single diseased mind.  </P> <P> "There's more than one Marc in the world," said the National Action Committee's  De Wolff, whose office received a disturbing call Thursday from an unknown man  who asked whether there were any men on the premises, then hung up when told  there were not. The woman who took the call, frightened that the man was  planning an attack, fled the office.  </P> <P> After the mass killing, Montreal French-language newspaper writer Francine  Pelletier said that she overheard male colleagues joking in the office that  they sometimes felt like killing women themselves.  </P> <P> "Men have to find out what's wrong with themselves," she told a radio audience  here. English-language newspaper columnist Albert Nerenberg aired a similar  view in an article saying he felt "shame for my generation and shame for my  cold-killing sex."  </P> <P> "Marc Lepine took this society's battering, woman-hating secret and made it  senseless, unthinkable mass murder," the column added. Nerenberg says he got a  stream of angry phone calls the day the column was published, from men who felt  he was vesting too much meaning in a single act of violence.  </P></p>

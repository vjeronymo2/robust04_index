			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Royal Bank staff vote for action MANAGERS and staff at Royal Bank of Scotland have voted for industrial action over pay. Managers are protesting against a performance-pay system under which there will be no guarantee of rises, and staff oppose an offer of between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent. In both ballots the turnout was about 50 per cent, according to the Bifu financial services union. Some 57 per cent of managers and 68 per cent of clerical staff voted for action short of a strike.</p>

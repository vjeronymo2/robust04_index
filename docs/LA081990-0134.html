			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESS IS BOOMING AT RECYCLING CENTERS;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: 'A MAJOR UPSWING' IN VOLUME IS REPORTED AT RECLAMATION SITES IN  THE AREA. CHANGES IN STATE LAW, WITTY ADVERTISING AND EARTH DAY HAVE  CONTRIBUTED TO THE SURGE IN INTEREST.  </P> <P> In his 14 years in the disposal business, Ronald Ektarian has seen just about  every kind of person pass through his chain-link gates and unload aluminum  cans, glass bottles, plastic, newspapers and anything else they figure might be  worth recycling.  </P> <P> "We get people in everything from Rolls-Royces to Cadillacs to people who walk  off the street," said Ektarian, a third-generation disposal man who operates Hi  Waste Disposal Co. in Artesia.  </P> <P> But sometime during the last eight months, Ektarian began seeing something new:  greater numbers of people carting more and more recyclables -- especially glass  and plastic beverage containers -- to his disposal company.  </P> <P> That trend was evident Tuesday. Though Ektarian called the day a slow one, cars  filed in and out of Hi Waste's yard nonstop. Fifteen minutes before closing, a  line of about eight cars stretched out onto Arkansas Street, drivers waiting  impatiently for the driver ahead of them to get recyclables weighed, get paid  and get moving.  </P> <P> Throughout southeast Los Angeles County, most of Ektarian's colleagues and  competitors in the rapidly expanding recycling industry said they have seen a  similar boom in business -- a phenomenon underscored by newly released state  Department of Conservation statistics. Statewide, the agency reports a 50%  increase in the volume of glass, plastic and aluminum beverage containers  recycled the first six months of this year, in contrast with the same period  last year.  </P> <P> "We have definitely seen a major upswing in volume," said Ron Schweitzer, the  president of Mobile Recycling Co., which operates centers throughout Southern  California, including 11 in southeast Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> At his company's southeast centers, Schweitzer said, the volume of glass and  plastic beverage containers has tripled since January, and the volume of  aluminum cans being recycled has climbed steadily.  </P> <P> Schweitzer's company also accepts newspapers, tin cans, milk jugs and paper and  plastic grocery bags. He reported that the volume of each of these items has  also increased significantly.  </P> <P> "Every month, we are doing more (business) than we've ever done before," added  Richard Graff, assistant general manager of ENVIPCO California Inc., a  corporation that owns about 40 vending machines that allow customers to deposit  aluminum, plastic and glass beverage containers in the Southeast area.  </P> <P> He said that from January to July, the volume of aluminum being recycled at the  reverse vending machines in the Southeast increased by 3 1/2 times, and the  volume of plastic beverage containers soared fivefold.  </P> <P> Lee Johnson, vice president for government affairs for the 20/20 Recycle  Center, which owns seven Southeast centers, said his company has also noted a  surge since the beginning of the year.  </P> <P> Schweitzer, Graff, Johnson and other industry experts attribute the recycling  spurt to a confluence of factors:  </P> <P> * A change in state law that in January raised the payoff on recycled beverage  containers from 1 cent per container to two containers for a nickel.  </P> <P> * Greater environmental awareness, stemming in large part from the extensive  media attention given to Earth Day earlier this year.  </P> <P> * Witty TV ad campaigns paid for by the state.  </P> <P> Industry experts said the increase in state payments for beverage containers  has brought out more people who recycle primarily for economic reasons. And it  has made the practice more profitable for such people as Robert Tiscareno, who  has been recycling for years.  </P> <P> "There is money out there if you look for it," said Tiscareno, 69, a retired  meat cutter who keeps a tattered record of his recycling transactions and  estimates that he has made $5,000 in the last six years through recycling.  </P> <P> "One day I went out and found some water faucets, brought them back here and  took home $28. I wasn't even out 10 minutes, and I came back and made money."  the Norwalk resident said.  </P> <P> Craig Simpson, 21, a Cerritos resident, said every day after he gets off work  at a nearby Carl's Jr., he drives through neighborhoods and around parks,  hunting for recyclable materials.  </P> <P> Simpson said he takes his finds to Ektarian just about every day, and on a good  day he can take home $30.  </P> <P> "It's a little extra money," Simpson said. "It helps pay the bills."  </P> <P> Along with the growing number of people who recycle for economic reasons, the  focus on Earth Day this year -- together with all the negative publicity  surrounding oil spills, air pollution, rapidly filling landfills and  contaminated water -- has spurred more people to recycle for ecological  reasons, experts said.  </P> <P> For 20 years, Cal State Long Beach has operated a recycling center that does  not pay its patrons. Those who want to recycle simply drive up a ramp and  unload newspaper, glass, plastic, tin and cardboard into huge garbage bins.  Staff members said every year business gets better, but during the last year  things really picked up.  </P> <P> "We used to be open 24 hours a day, but we just couldn't deal with it," staff  member Lauren Goskirk said. "We couldn't get the stuff out fast enough, it was  piled on the ramp."  </P> <P> Goskirk said the staff had to scale back hours, much to the ire of customers  who now find that, particularly on Saturdays, they have to wait in line to drop  off their materials.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the flow of cars was steady and, as people unloaded their trunks,  many said that they were new to recycling.  </P> <P> "Actually, to me it's a bother," said Lakewood resident Lloyd Hughes, who has  been recycling for about a year. "But if it helps a little bit, why, I guess  I'll keep on doing it."  </P> <P> Helen Kerasotes, 23, a Bellflower resident who lives with her mother, said they  both started recycling after the April 22 Earth Day celebration.  </P> <P> "We both watched this special on TV on Earth Day, and it really affected us,"  she said. "It's really scary how we are running out of space in the landfills,  and recycling is so easy to do. Just saving your newspapers or cans."  </P> <P> 20/20 vice president Johnson said that in addition to those who recycle for  economic reasons and those who recycle for ecological reasons, another group of  recyclers is growing fast: the typical consumer.  </P> <P> "It's taken a while for the public to become aware of what this is all about,  but the average household person is starting to become aware of recycling and  redemption centers," he said.  </P> <P> Industry experts said they expect even more people to begin recycling as cities  throughout California begin complying with a tough new state law requiring that  each municipality cut by half the amount of garbage going to landfills by the  year 2000. Many area cities are expected to start curbside recycling programs  along with campaigns to encourage residents to use less and recycle more.  </P> <P> However, the recycling surge isn't making everyone happy. Scrap dealers,  disposal company owners and city officials are grumbling that by passing the  state law expected to lead to extensive curbside recycling, legislators have  created a market for which there is no demand.  </P> <P> Already, most recycling centers are awash in newspapers and are finding that  the market for them is glutted. At one time, newspapers could not be recycled  fast enough; now industry experts said they have a hard time finding someone  who will buy them.  </P> <P> "There is more business, but because of the marketplace there is less profit to  be made," rubbish man Ektarian said.  </P> <P> Officials in Southeast cities, who recently banded together to share costs on a  study that will help them meet the demands of the new law, said the Legislature  has to encourage, perhaps even force, business to use recycled goods.  </P> <P> Bob Lamond, a Long Beach resident and member of the city's advisory committee  on solid waste and recycling, said that although beverage containers are a  relatively small part of the waste stream, the interest in recycling is  encouraging.  </P> <P> "It's a start. . . . As long as we keep reminding people, keep this issue on  the forefront, recycling is bound to increase," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Tirana, April 21 (ATA) -- The chairman of the  Democratic Party of Albania, Eduard Selami, accompanied by Mr.  Tritan Shehu and Ali Spahia, held a press conference April 20 in  the presence of reporters of the press, radio-television, and  representatives of the diplomatic corps accredited to Albania.    At the beginning Mr. Selami read a message for the press  which says that: "Practically, Albania has embarked on one of  the most significant stages of the economic reform, that of  profound privatization, full liberalization of prices, as well  as preparation of vouchers. [passage omitted]    The very tense situation in former Yugoslavia is also being  doubled with the provocative acts of Greece, practically current  leader in turn of the European Union. The April 10 incident,  the gravest of the latest ones, is part of the policy pursued by  certain circles of influence in the Greek Government. There are  circles in Greece which base their policy with Albania on  Hellenism, and this is dangerous. The military provocations,  the antihuman stand against the Albanian emigrants, the stance  towards Cameria, the anti-Albanian propaganda, the policy of  preventing Albania's integration into the international  community, a policy which has been applied for several times by  Greece, testify to that Hellenizing policy of likely  consequences for all the Balkans," Selami's message for the  press says.    Asked about the effectiveness of coalition and remarks in  its  regard, Mr. Selami said that the DP [Democratic Party] stands  loyal to coalition because it has yielded positive results both  in the victory of March 22 elections and later. Coalition, Mr.  Selami said, is dynamic therefore the demands of the SDP [Social  Democratic Party] and RP [Republican Party] have been  reasonable. We have discussed them and have been successful in  resolving our problems. But, naturally, there are things in the  coalition we do not agree upon, something quite normal. But I  want to stress once again that we favour coalition and this is  also in favour of democracy, Mr. Selami confirmed.    In response to a question on outlawing the CPA [Communist  Party of Albania], the DP secretary general, Tritan Shehu, said  that in Albania not only the CP but also the fascist party is  illegal, as there is likeness between each other as regards  crimes at the expense of the people. Asked about the Greek  Government's responsibility for the April 10 incident, Mr.  Selami said that "the stand maintained by the Greek Government  does not release it from responsibility because the band has  come from the Greek territory and has fled in the same  direction. We uphold that it has been a terrorist act, and  under international standards, it bears responsibility for not  pronouncing itself about the incident."    Asked about statements on the Albanians as a destabilizing  factor in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  -- FYROM], Mr. Selami answered that such statements are uttered  by circles really interested in Macedonia's destabilization, as  a very sensitive region in the Balkan crisis. "We consider the  Albanian factor in Macedonia as a factor of stability and  believe that the resolution of the Albanians' question in  Macedonia is a matter of concern not only for the region but  also for Macedonia itself."    Regarding DP's relations with the right front of the  Albanian  political parties, whose idea is being propagated in the press  of this parties, the DP chairman said that creation of new  parties and alliances in pluralism is quite normal. "We  maintain a clear cut stand towards the extreme right, which we  disassociated from the party in our latest assembly."    Regarding the possibility of cooperation of the DP with the  Italian right which has come to power in Italy, Mr. Selami said  that "we have always been in favour of close relations with  Italy. We have hailed the victory of the right of center in  Italy because we consider it as a facility to cooperate with  parties of the same political spectre. We have asked contact  with Berlusconi and demanded close relations not only at party  level but at governmental one."</p>

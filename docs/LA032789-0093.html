			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> GIRL STRANGLED; 14-YEAR-OLD HELD  </P> <P> Seven-year-old Sara Nan Hodges of Newhall was strangled and her body stuffed  into an 18-by-18-inch space beneath the headboard of a 14-year-old neighbor's  water bed, apparently before she was reported missing last Thursday, Los  Angeles County sheriff's deputies said this morning.  </P> <P> The girl's body was found Sunday afternoon in a house five doors from her own  home on Alderbrook Drive. (Story, Part I, Page 3.) The 14-year-old, who had  lived with his mother in the house about two months, was arrested on suspicion  of murder and was being held at Sylmar Juvenile Hall.  </P> <P> Deputies said the suspect, who moved to Newhall from Florida after being  involved in burglaries there, slept at night on the bed where the body was  hidden until it was found Sunday by the owner of the home.  </P> <P> The cause of death had not yet been determined. Deputies said the decomposition  of the body led them to conclude that the girl was killed sometime after she  was noticed missing at 2 p.m. Thursday, but before she was reported missing to  the Sheriff's Department six hours later.  </P></p>

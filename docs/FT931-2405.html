			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Franc under strong pressure on eve of French election THE French franc continued to come under strong selling pressure inside the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday, as investors speculated that a new political administration in France might be forced to sever the link with the D-Mark. In the run-up to tomorrow's first round of parliamentary elections, the franc remained close to its ERM floor against the D-Mark. French franc money market interest rates rose, amid signs that some international investment houses were borrowing francs and selling them in the hope of profiting from a possible devaluation. Mr Edouard Balladur, a finance minister in the last conservative government who is tipped as the next French prime minister, yesterday sought to alleviate the pressure on the French currency. Damping speculation that a conservative government might abandon the socialist policy of protecting the franc inside the ERM, he said on radio that the French right had no intention of following the UK's example of leaving the mechanism. 'It's not a model for me,' he said, describing the consequences for the UK economy as 'almost tragic'. Some foreign exchange dealers, however, believe that a new French administration might abandon the Socialist franc fort policy because it has meant keeping interest rates at about 12 per cent at a time when the French economy is slowing down. Tomorrow's poll marks the first round of voting in the parliamentary elections, with the final round scheduled for next Sunday. The conservative coalition of the RPR and UDF has such a strong lead - with 42 per cent of the vote against the ruling Socialists' 20.5 per cent, according to final opinion polls - that a change of government appears inevitable. The critical question is how the conservative vote will split between the RPR and UDF. The polls suggest the two centre-right parties are neck and neck. However, the final outcome could influence the allocation of cabinet seats and President Francois Mitterrand's choice of premier. Even in its final days the French electoral campaign has been notable only for the absence of excitement. The inevitability of the conservative victory has contributed to the subdued mood, as has the familiarity of the main party leaders, such as the RPR's Mr Jacques Chirac and the UDF's Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, and the similarity between the main parties on critical areas of policy. The franc fell as low as FFr3.416 against the D-Mark at lunchtime in London, with some London-based dealers reporting that the currency was being sold in large amounts. There was no sign of foreign exchange intervention by either the Bank of France or the Bundesbank. The franc later closed unchanged on the day at FFr3.41 against the D-Mark, around 2 centimes above its ERM floor, and was at FFr3.4105 in late New York trading.

The figures confirmed that an economic recovery is  underway in Australia. But economists say they are also likely  to fuel renewed market speculation about an interest rate rise,  despite comments by the prime minister, Paul Keating, last  weekend that it was not the time for a rise.    The latest increase in growth is broadly based, with the  official Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showing  strengths in the housing sector, farming, retail spending, and  manufacturing. The figures reflect a winding back of government  spending as the recession eased, the slack being taken up in the  private sector. However, growth in total business investment  remained weak. Exports grew during the quarter by 2.2 percent,  while imports were up by 1.3 percent.</p>

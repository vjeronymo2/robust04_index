			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (18): A savings plan built on bonuses - Qualifying policies WHAT DO qualifying endowment policies qualify for? This piece of life-insurance jargon refers to the tax relief on final pay-outs from an endowment. Provided the policy 'qualifies', the fund in which the life company invests the money pays tax only at the basic rate. And no tax is payable at all on the lump sum that you receive at the end of the policy's term (its 'maturity'). This makes endowments a potentially valuable tax shelter for top-rate taxpayers. The conditions are that you pay regular monthly premiums into the policy for a term of at least 10 years. Note that these tax concessions are not as generous as those available on a number of other important investments mentioned elsewhere, such as pensions and personal equity plans, which invest in untaxed funds. So how do endowments work? Essentially they are savings plans, which have been encumbered with many unnecessary complications as they have evolved from life policies. Contributions, or 'premiums', are usually paid monthly, and must be maintained to qualify for tax relief. Premiums must continue for a fixed term, decided when you start. An endowment is inflexible. Common terms are 10 years - the minimum - and 25 years, the term of a mortgage. You only receive a worthwhile return if you hold an endowment until its maturity. When you fix a term, you also fix a 'sum assured'. This is the minimum you will be paid at maturity, and may not exceed the total of the premiums you pay in. Fortunately, you should receive much more than this, because bonuses are added to reflect the profits made by the fund managers - hence the label 'with-profits' which these policies carry. There are usually two forms of bonus: Reversionary bonuses, which can also be called 'annual' or 'irrevocable'. They are added on to the sum assured at the end of each year, and cannot be taken away, provided you keep the policy to maturity. Terminal bonuses, which are paid out once the policy has matured. These tend to vary according to market conditions in the final years of the policy. It is rarely as simple as this. Reversionary bonuses can be paid as a proportion of the sum assured, or as a proportion of the sum assured plus all the bonuses which have already accrued. Some offices have two reversionary bonuses, one of which is added to the sum assured, while the other is added to the reversionary bonuses already accrued. This is not easy to understand, but the annual bonuses do make with-profits policies more secure than the unit-linked alternative. However, the fund managers must put money into gilts to cover for bonuses they have declared, so 'with-profits' can also blunt the total benefits you receive. A final unrelated factor is the surrender value. Reversionary bonuses are paid only if you hold the policy until the end of its term. If you stop the premiums early, or 'surrender' the policy, the amount you receive bears no relation to the amount of bonuses which have accrued. All the costs of running the policy - including administration, and commissions to intermediaries - are borne over the first few years. So if you surrender within five years of starting a 25-year policy, you will receive much less than you have paid in total premiums. A new breed of 'unitised' with-profits policies is easier to understand, although it does not offer better value. This does away with the sum assured, and instead each premium payment buys units, on to which bonuses are added in the standard with-profits fashion. These policies are much cheaper for the life insurers to operate. Unitised with-profits contracts are not to be confused with unit-linked endowments. With the latter, the units your premiums buy fluctuate with the market in the same way as unit trusts. This should bring both greater risks and greater potential rewards. Again, however, costs and commissions are front-end loaded, so the surrender value you could receive in early years bears little relation to the performance of the units you have already bought. Endowments used to be much more tax-efficient than they are now - their funds were taxed more favourably, and there was tax relief on the premiums as you paid them in. Now, their attractions are much reduced. Many companies have had to cut their pay-outs this year, and newer tax-efficient vehicles look better.</p>

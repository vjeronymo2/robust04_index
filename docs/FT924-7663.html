			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Travel: Walking in the air - Grand Hotel / Lucia Van der Post concludes our Hotel series with a visit to Reid's in Maderia, a personal favourite YOU COULD, if you were so minded, spend a week or more without ever leaving the genteel environs of Reid's Hotel, Madeira. There you could move effortlessly, from room to balcony, from balcony to swimming pool. You could summon tea, cucumber sandwiches and the ritual Madeira cake, some freshly-squeezed orange juice or something much more exotic and it would all come, exactly as you asked. You could pass your days sitting under the palms or the dragon trees in among the pelargoniums, the plumbago and the bougainvillaea. You could toy with the cold buffet by the pool, spend the afternoon pondering the weighty matter of which of the restaurants you fancied that night. Should it be casual and informal in the Villa Cliff? Or black tie, posh frocks, foie gras and a particularly fine Puligny-Montrachet in Les Faunes? Or, depending whom you are with and why, maybe room service with dinner on your own balcony overlooking the pool, the palms and black, black night? Ah . . . decisions, decisions . . . You could, as I say, idle the days away. But I do not advise it. Cocooned in comfort, surrounded by fellow sybarites, you would never know that up in the mountains is another world, a world of mists and clouds, of laurel woods and forests of eucalpytus and pine, of rivers and banks of flowers. Higher still, above the forests, there is an open moonscape of grey lava stones and lonely roads, of scrub and heather, wild bilberries and rocky hills. Here you can walk and be alone with nothing but you, your companions and this strange landscape. We were lucky, we were taken there by Richard Blandy, an old family friend, whose family owns, among much else, Reid's Hotel. Up we drove from Funchal, through villages, round bays, past forests, until we came to the start of one of his favourite walks, alongside a levada, an irrigation channel. We saw no-one else at all. What we saw were hawks flying high over the hills, butterflies fluttering among the heather, goats scampering away and skies that changed from cloudless blue to cotton-woolly mists and back again. We walked until it was time to unpack the wine, the Madeira ham and cheeses, the fruit and the cake and then we walked again . . . all day long. It was a perfect day. But, although everybody should be so lucky as to have Richard Blandy as a companion, it is possible to walk the levadas without him. Buy the classic book Landscapes of Madeira, by John and Pat Underwood, when you get there. Once a week Reid's Hotel takes a small group of guests walking, packing an Edwardian-style picnic for the traditional lunch-time stop. But then Reid's will make everything easy for you. It will take you to museums, to wine tastings, to embroidery factories. It will organise barbecues by the pools and evenings of that rich, mysterious quintessential Portuguese outpouring of the soul known as Fado. There is no getting away from it, if you judge a hotel by the company it keeps then Reid's Hotel moves in the highest circles. Kings and queens, princes and consorts, counts and pretenders, empresses and film stars have stayed there. Lingering in the corridors is that indefinable sense that history gives, a sense of an hotel that believes itself to be the best. The days have passed since passengers arriving by liner ( . . .'the best hotel is Mr Reid's' . . . said the London Fortnightly Review) were ushered ashore. Today the regular shipping lines no longer call but at Funchal airport there is still the sense that those who are heading for Reid's are heading for the best. In the summer I daresay Madeira has its rivals. But in the European winter Madeira and Reid's come into their own. Where else do you know that is almost certainly warm, sunny, balmy even, within 3 1/2 hours flying time from London and involving no jet-lag? For those who are looking for a trendy, jet-set kind of place, Reid's is not it. Reid's is quiet, almost sedate . . . but if you are in need of unfrazzling, it is perfect. GB Airways flies direct to Funchal on Tuesdays and Saturdays for about Pounds 246 return, depending on the time of year. Several companies, among them Thomson Holidays and Cadogan Travel offer inclusive deals which include flights and 7- or 10-day stays. A single room with a balcony and sea view starts at about Pounds 125 per day.</p>

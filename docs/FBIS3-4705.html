			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government held a strategy meeting of  unification-related ministers chaired by Deputy Prime Minister  Yi Yong-tok at the prime minister's official residence in  Samchong-tong on 1 March, in which the participants agreed to  positively consider to hold the fourth round of North-South  working contact on 3 March proposed by the North Korean side.    The government has decided to inform the North side of this  position around 1000 [0100 GMT] 2 March. Therefore, the fourth  round of North-South working delegates' contact for the exchange  of special envoys is expected to be held at the House of Peace,  the meeting site in the South side area of Panmunjom, at 1000 on  3 March, two days later than the ROK Government had proposed.    The unification-related ministers' meeting also decided to  maintain the position that the South side will announce the  condition-attached suspension of the Team Spirit joint military  exercise for 1994 later if the North-South working contact is  made, as the Ministry of National Defense has announced.  Therefore, the South side may well announce the  condition-attached suspension of the Team Spirit exercise when  it confirms that the North-South working contact is made on 3  March.    Prior to this, North Korea, in a telephone message in the  name of Pak Yong-su, the North side delegate to the North-South  working contact, said it agrees to the resumption of the working  contact, admitting that the South side accepted the North side's  demand for the suspension of the nuclear war exercise and the  abandonment of the international cooperation system.</p>

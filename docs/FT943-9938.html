			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Poland set to enter virtuous circle - Capital &amp; Credit For bond investors willing to bank on Poland's economic fundamentals, the future looks bright. Successive governments' commitment to market-oriented reforms and stringent fiscal and monetary policy have made Poland's the fastest-growing economy in Europe. Real gross domestic product is expected to rise by around 22 per cent in the next three years and inflation is forecast to decline into single-digit territory by 1997, from around 30 per cent this year. Last, the imminent completion of its Brady debt restructuring deal is expected to give an added boost to international investment flows into Poland, which have already risen sharply in recent years. All this augurs well for Poland's planned comeback to the eurobond market, which is expected to receive a warm welcome not only from emerging-market investors seeking to diversify their portfolios, but also from investors betting on Poland's economic convergence with western Europe and eventual membership of the European Union. Before it taps the eurobond sector, however, Poland has to complete the commercial bank debt restructuring with its London Club creditors. In June, it entered the final stage of the Brady process, with the cessation of direct trading of its commercial bank loans and the start of 'when, as, and if-issued' bond trading. Through when-issued trades, investors contract to buy or sell bonds on their issuance date. After Poland's bank creditors sign the final agreement in mid-September, several types of Brady bonds will be issued: par bonds (where the loans are exchanged at par value with no debt forgiveness, in return for sub-market interest rates); discount bonds (where creditors forgive 45 per cent of the principal of the debt in return for attractive floating-rate interest rates); or interest-arrears bonds, where unpaid interest payments have been restructured into a bond. Moreover, the Polish government wants to buy back at least 20 per cent of its debt. Depending on how much debt the government buys back and how many discount bonds are issued, the total amount of Brady bonds issued could amount to some Dollars 7bn to Dollars 8bn, substantially less that the original Dollars 13bn of total debt, estimates Mr Alexander Mitcheson-Smith, head of emerging markets research at UBS. 'The Poles got a very generous treatment from their creditors,' he says. 'Following the completion of the deal, Poland will have one of the best debt ratios of all post-Brady countries,' he adds. The Brady completion could well start a virtuous circle, triggering increased international inflows, especially from its largest natural trading and investment partner, Germany. 'Prospects for a hike in German direct investment in Poland may improve significantly following the Brady deal, given the strong links between the German commercial banking sector and German corporates,' predict analysts at J. P. Morgan. Should such inflows materialise, 'Poland's medium-term prospects can be expected to improve with accompanying infusion of technology, managerial expertise, market access, and more rapid restructuring of the industrial sector.' Booming foreign investment, declining foreign debt exposure, strong economic fundamentals and continued fiscal and monetary discipline should boost Poland's chances for a strong credit rating, which is said to be in the works. 'Poland's external position looks much stronger than Hungary's; its current account and fiscal deficits are well below those of Hungary; its growth rate is stronger than that of either of its central European neighbours, and foreign investment already seems to be responding positively to the debt agreement,' says Mr Jonathan Hoffman, a director of economics at CS First Boston. 'In our view, Polish fundamentals merit a Ba1/BB+ rating,' - the same as Hungary. The successful signing of the London Club agreement and a credit rating are likely to be prerequisites for the Polish Republic's much talked-about return to the eurobond market - its first deal since 1979. International investment banks are currently now jostling for the number-one position in the 'beauty contest' for lead management of the deal, with some 16 proposals due to be submitted by early September. 'A decision may be made by November, but the deal probably won't come until early next year,' says a Warsaw banker. Talk in the London syndicate community is for about Dollars 200m of three- to five-year bonds. They are likely to be priced off the Brady bonds, which are widely seen as being undervalued and are expected to rally in coming months. That, in turn, could reduce the cost of the eurobond. As Polish debt becomes more liquid and accessible, analysts expect investor demand to increase exponentially. 'The Brady deal will attract investors who aren't able to buy when-issued Bradys, and the eurobond will attract investors who can't buy Brady bonds,' predicts Mr Hoffman. 'The universe of investors in Polish debt is widening almost by the week.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "The Damascus Meeting...Toward  Further Coordination," the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: The  Damascus meeting, which comes a few days before the expected  summit between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton, will provide a  new opportunity for Arab coordination and consultation  concerning the peace process and its developments, and give the  Arab situation additional strength, especially since leader  al-Asad will leave for Geneva as a representative of the Arab  nation which seeks to restore its full cultural role in this  world. The Arab nation stood fast and struggled in defense of  its honorable, free existence, and refused, proudly and loftily,  to capitulate to its enemies, through wise stands leader al-Asad  has embodied in sound, unmistakable decisions.    AL-BA'TH notes: The topics the Damascus Declaration member  states' foreign ministers will discuss are comprehensive and  versatile and in the interest of pan-Arab issues that must not  be relinquished.    AL-BA'TH adds: At the time of international changes and the  economic blocs it has produced and whose objective is to control  world economy, the Arabs have no choice but to unify ranks in  order to pave the way for establishing the most important bloc,  taking into consideration the Arab world's location and  resources.    AL-BA'TH says: Our call for establishing a bloc is not based  on hostility to or confrontation with anyone, but on the  principle of defending our livelihood and providing the best  living conditions for a nation that, throughout its history, has  been the nation of generosity and kindness.    Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: Frankly speaking, we call for  further coordination, consultation, and unity. This is because  joint Arab action contains abundant benefits for the masses of  our nation which, everyday, hear about new world blocs, while it  can do nothing. Based on this, the Damascus meeting is of  special importance, particularly, considering the positive  results it will produce, and which will be in the interest of  all Arabs.    The newspaper TISHRIN comments on the meetings of the  Damascus Declaration member states' foreign ministers. It says:  It is not a coincidence that the Damascus Declaration member  states' foreign ministers meet to discuss ways to implement the  declaration, taking into consideration that Syria is the country  of all Arabs, the vanguard of pan-Arab solidarity, and the  supporter of everyone who has been exposed to a spiteful  aggression. The Kuwaiti brothers have realized Syria's concern  about adhering to right and its readiness to confront falsehood.    TISHRIN adds: The Damascus Declaration should have been  implemented long ago, especially since it lays the foundations  for an entrenched and genuine Arab solidarity based on a host of  pan-Arab principles. All Arabs are aware of the fact that the  absence of Arab solidarity and some sides' deviation from the  bases of this solidarity have led the region to two  catastrophes: The first was the Iraq-Iran war which exhausted  the resources of Iraq, Iran, and the region's states. The  second was the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait which led to more  serious results, not only the exhausted resources and  capabilities, but also concerning the West's attempts to  reimpose its hegemony over the region and to control oil prices.    TISHRIN says: In light of this tragic situation, there  should have been a real solidarity that put things on their  right course, entrenches the principles of pan-Arab action,  fraternal relations, and genuine traditions, and confronts all  those who tamper with the nation's fate and give predominance to  their parochial interests and crazy whims over the Arabs' higher  interests. However, the declaration remained only ink on paper,  and the economy and foreign ministers held meetings which  produced nothing although none of the signatories rejected or  renounced the declaration. The Gulf states affirmed their  adherence to the declaration, and Syria and Egypt expressed  their readiness to fulfill their obligations and to give  anything required of them.    TISHRIN clarifies: Arab security is an indivisible whole,  and Gulf security is part of Arab security. No one can  guarantee Arab security other than the Arabs themselves.    TISHRIN adds: In all their countries, the Arabs are looking  forward to implementing the Damascus Declaration and to adopting  Arab solidarity as a tangible and genuine principle. Things are  changing rapidly and the entire Arab region has new obligations  to fulfill. The current Arab fragmentation weakens the Arab  cause. In fact, some have deviated from solidarity and  concluded a deal with Israel, which harmed the Palestinian  people and the region.    Concluding, TISHRIN says: It has been said that the Arabs'  strength lies in their unity and solidarity. Only through unity  and solidarity can territories and holy places be restored.  Syria has called and is calling on the Arabs to rise up to the  level of pan-Arab responsibility. All Arabs can win through  their solidarity, and lose through their fragmentation.</p>

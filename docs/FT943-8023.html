			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / UK Company News: BBB Design sues AA and ICL over contract BBB Design Group, the USM-quoted marketing and computer services group, announced yesterday that it was suing International Computers and the Automobile Association for damages over the cancellation of a contract to supply the AA with a telemarketing support system at its offices in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester. A provision of Pounds 100,000 has been provided in the 1993-94 accounts against litigation and related costs which are expected to be incurred in the short-term. The announcement came as the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 138,000 for the year to April 30, compared with a loss of Pounds 154,000. Last year the group announced that with the approval of the AA it had supplied and installed its Telemation system jointly with ICL. Mr Philip O'Donnell, chairman and chief executive, said yesterday 'to our astonishment the contract was cancelled in February 1994 by International Computers'. He said the issues were complicated but the group was suing for damages in respect of 'breach of contract, loss of future business and harm caused to the reputation of our product and business'. Mr O'Donnell said he had been told by ICL in February this year that the AA had cancelled the contract because of a 'different commercial and technical strategy to meet future business needs'. ICL and the AA confirmed yesterday that legal action had been initiated but were unable to comment further. Turnover was Pounds 1.95m (Pounds 1.89m). Earnings per share were 1.94p (1.84p loss).</p>

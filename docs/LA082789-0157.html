			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> CASE FORCES SPORTS MEDIA TO EXAMINE NEWS ROLE  </P> <P> That the Pete Rose story was a Page 1 item in morning newspapers and the  subject of news cut-ins by the major television networks when official word of  suspension was announced Thursday morning reminds us of the strange  relationship sport has with hard news in this country.  </P> <P> Although Americans are said to be more interested in sport than politics, the  news of our games is usually confined to the sports pages or tightly managed  spots on newscasts.  </P> <P> When sports hits Page 1 and makes headlines on the evening news it's usually a  sign that something has gone wrong in the sports world.  </P> <P> Certainly the Rose case has forced sportswriters and commentators to closely  examine their arena over these past six months. While the story of Rose's  alleged gambling has been told and retold since March, sports commentators have  often asked whether Rose should be elected to the Hall of Fame.  </P> <P> The question of "the player" vs. "the man" will continue to be discussed  because Americans, quite simply, don't like to have their sports stories move  dramatically outside the white lines.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the way ESPN has been following the saga reveals just how much it  means to sports and fans. Thursday, ESPN devoted nearly two hours to live  morning coverage of the news conferences surrounding the day's events and  lengthened its evening SportsCenters to one hour from the usual 30-minute  format.  </P> <P> Bob Ley, who anchored live coverage of the July hearings when Rose gained a  temporary reprieve, was back in the studio Thursday as ESPN completed its long  pursuit of the story.  </P> <P> Charlie Steiner, one of the ESPN SportsCenter regulars, had no doubts as long  as six weeks ago that the Rose coverage was revolutionary for American sports  television.  </P> <P> "Ten years from now our Pete Rose coverage may be a watershed in this  industry," Steiner said in July during the legal parrying involving Rose and  Major League Baseball. "We are the only network that could devote all the time  to it. This is our domain."  </P> <P> The other broadcasters were very much present, however, when the news of Rose's  suspension became fact.  </P> <P> If they don't make sports their 24-hour-a-day business, they certainly were  aware that this particular event transcended the ordinary limits.  </P> <P> CBS had three live morning reports and spokesman Tom Goodman said, "This was a  story of overwhelming importance. We had reports in "CBS Morning News" and "CBS  This Morning" and also went live to Cincinnati for the Rose press conference."  </P> <P> Goodman recalled that CBS News had included such stories as the Ben Johnson  drug scandal, the death of Len Bias and the NFL strike on similar news reports.  </P> <P> At ABC, "World News Tonight" spokesman Scott Richardson recalled that his  network had included the Johnson Olympic drug story and Dave Dravecky's recent  comeback from cancer as news stories, but said that the Rose affair was  different.  </P> <P> "When the story broke it was quickly a news story," he recalled, "and the fact  that it has gone on over such a long period of time added to that. Part of the  story was the delay."  </P> <P> Certainly scandal is no longer unusual in American sports.  </P> <P> Rose, however, always seemed to be in a different category, perhaps because his  style of play had been so universally lauded by the same sports reporters who  had to deal with the less savory side of their beats.  </P> <P> Rose seemed a throwback to the days before the big money came into the game.  Although a millionaire because of his playing skills, Rose always looked as  though he belonged to the Gas House Gang of the 1930s rather than the  businessman's elite of the modern player-agent age. He was a comfortable kind  of hero.  </P> <P> Having helped to perpetuate some of the Rose myth, it is not particularly easy  now to separate that personna and the man on an August day in 1989. That's why  sportswriters and commentators might feel more comfortable wondering what this  does to Rose's Cooperstown credentials.  </P> <P> That, at least, is a question that seems to fit within the neater, sports-first  package.  </P> <P> Yet the Rose story led the evening news on major American networks Thursday  night, proof that its dimensions far transcend such neat categorization.  </P> <P> Ironically the program delayed by ESPN's expanded early-evening SportsCenter,  was a Little League baseball semifinal.  </P></p>

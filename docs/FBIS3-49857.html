			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Quotation marks as received] </F>   [Text] Geneva, 19 Jan (TANJUG) -- The Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia signed a joint  declaration in Geneva today on the process for the normalization  of mutual relations and the opening of representative offices of  their governments in Belgrade and Zagreb. The offices will open  and begin work on 15 February 1994.    A joint statement signed by the two foreign ministers,  Vladislav Jovanovic and Mate Granic, reads:    "The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of  Croatia, starting from the positive experiences in their joint  efforts to speed up the peace process to resolve the crisis in  the area of the former Yugoslavia, and guided by the provisions  of the UN Charter and the basic documents of the CSCE, and  aspiring to the establishment of good-neighborly relations, and  in their desire to contribute in a decisive way to finding a  just and lasting solution to the crisis in the area of the  former Yugoslavia -- and to the reestablishment of stability in  this part of Europe -- agree to embark upon the process of the  normalization of mutual relations.    As a first step in this direction it has been decided to  open  in Belgrade and Zagreb official representative offices of the  two governments -- a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia office in  Zagreb and an office of the Republic of Croatia in Belgrade.    The opening of these offices should ease interstate  relations  and contacts, and contribute to the development of mutual trust,  including the process of the normalization of Serbo-Croat  relations, in the interest of peace, cooperation and stability  in the region.    The Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and  the  Republic of Croatia will ensure the technical and other  conditions enabling the offices to work efficiently, work which  will begin on 15 February 1994."</p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I'm grateful that I saw Howard Rosenberg's enthusiastic review and took on the  12-week commitment of "Game, Set and Match" on "Mystery!" Ian Holm's  performance was so masterful that after one of his brilliant scenes, I found  myself applauding the screen for the first time in 35 years of avid TV viewing.  </P> <P> Meredith Brucker, San Marino  </P></p>

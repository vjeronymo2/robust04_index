			<p>BFN     [Text] South Africa's first deputy president, Mr. Thabo  Mbeki, says that South Africa will conduct arms sales as a  responsible member of the world community and that it will not  supply to governments that use them for repression.    Speaking at the South African Embassy in Washington, Mr.  Mbeki said all countries had legitimate defense concerns,  ranging from sea fisheries protection patrols to land mine  clearing operations. He said South Africa would examine its  role as a competitor to other suppliers.</p>

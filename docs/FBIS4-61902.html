			<p>BFN     [Text] The leader of Georgian Union for the Liberation of  Abkhazia Boris Kakubava said he needed only five thousand men to  return Abkhazia to Georgian control. The Union advocates  military action against Abkhazia.    Speaking on national television, Kakubava said that many men  could be mobilized by the Union in no time at all. What he  needed, he said, was understanding with the authorities and the  Union's Council would soon discuss the issue with Eduard  Shevardnadze.    Kakubava was confident that a united Georgia would find it  very easy to defeat the Abkhaz separatists and mercenary forces.  He said several hundred Georgians were fighting in guerrilla  units on Abkhazian territory.</p>

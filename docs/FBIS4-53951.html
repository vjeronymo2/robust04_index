			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- Twenty-two Japanese firms  will launch a two-year feasibility study on merging cable  television networks and telecommunication systems in preparation  for the forthcoming multimedia era, officials of the organizing  body said Monday [23 May].    The organizer is the Cable TV Conference, formed by Japan's  cable TV Industry Association.    Using cable TV networks, the organizer seeks to provide a  wide range of services, starting with personal handyphone  systems (PHS) initially, and gradually diversifying into  personal computer communications and broadcast shopping  information.    In the face of rapid technological shifts to multimedia  communication, the 22 companies, mostly cable TV operators such  as Tokyu Cable Television Co., and common carriers like DDI  Corp., want to explore the many possibilities, the officials  said.    The firms also include KDD, NEC Corp. and leading trading  house Mitsui and Co., they said.    Japan's phone services industry is currently dominated by  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), but the project will  create another large communications link in the near future,  they said.</p>

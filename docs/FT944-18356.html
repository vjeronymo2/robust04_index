			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Food price war hots up as study warns over sales growth Two supermarket chains joined the latest skirmish in the food price wars yesterday as a report from Verdict, the research group, said retailers faced a disappointing Christmas and years of slow retail growth. Safeway, the superstore chain owned by Argyll, the UK's third-largest food retailing group, launched a Pounds 7m advertising campaign called Lightening the Load to highlight 'value-added' aspects of its stores such as bag-packing and carry-out services, wide aisles, baby-changing facilities, and its refund and replace guarantee scheme. The campaign is designed to support Safeway's new Price Watch initiative - a guarantee to customers that they can buy products at prices competitive with those of rivals such as Sainsbury and Tesco. Independent pricing research suggests that customers see Safeways as expensive. Shares in Argyll fell 5p to 270p, and Asda shares closed down 3 1/4 p at 62 1/4 p. Shares in Sainsbury, however, rose 2p to 402p on news of its Pounds 205m investment in the US supermarket chain Giant Food. Last month, Safeway introduced a range of 100 basic own-label goods at low prices, called Safeway Savers - similar to the Value range launched last year by Tesco, the UK's second-largest food retailer. Also yesterday, Asda, the fourth-largest grocery retailer, announced a No Nonsense price freeze on 7,000 grocery and non-food items until at least January. Fierce price competition between supermarkets shows little sign of abating. It began almost 18 months ago with the Price Check campaign launched by Gateway - renamed Somerfield - in response to the spread of discount retailers and the increasing saturation of the grocery market. Shoprite, the discount retailer which operates mainly in Scotland, yesterday issued its second profits warning in four months. In its annual four-year retailing forecast, Verdict says that price competition will remain 'intense' between food retailers for the foreseeable future. It also warns that retail trading will 'get worse before it gets better', with consumer demand now slowing as a result of higher taxes and the rise in interest rates. These are likely to make Christmas 'disappointing', with slower growth than last year. The report also forecasts that annual retail sales growth will remain below the almost 6 per cent recorded in 1993. Verdict on Retailing 1998. Verdict, 112 High Holborn, London WC1V 6JS.

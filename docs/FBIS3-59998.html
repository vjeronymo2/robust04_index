The police and young fieldworkers have noticed a decided  acceleration in drug use this year and last year. The many  recent drug seizures attest to the fact.    There are more drug addicts in need of treatment than  before,  but local governments are more unwilling than before to make  commitments to pay for those seeking treatment for it.  Especially badly off are young drug users, for whom there are  very few suitable treatment centers. In the opinion of social  service officials and volunteer organizations, the situation is  getting out of hand.    Operating in Espoo, the Free of Drugs, R.A. [registered  association], nursing home is the only one a client can get into  without a referral at any time of day whatsoever and in any  condition whatsoever as long as there is space in the home for  him.    ``We have room for six and we can't increase their number  unless we get more staff,'' executive director Jussi Suojasalmi  said.    Free of Drugs, R.A., keeps a drug addict until his extended  treatment is completed. The treatment takes two weeks on average.    ``The customers that come here have usually been using drugs  for a fairly long time and those good feelings that they may  have enjoyed when they started using them are now over with.  Some of them are in very bad physical shape,'' Suojasalmi said.  <H5>  Police Find Only Small Percentage </H5>   Helsinki Narcotics Police chief Torsti Koskinen can read the  increase in drug use directly from the statistics. During the  first half of this year the police arrested 1,385 people  suspected of using and peddling drugs. During the same period in  1992, 1,159 were arrested and 889 were arrested in the preceding  year.    During the first six months nearly 70 kg of hashish were  seized, but a year before only 22 kg. The number of amphetamine  seizures has increased at nearly the same rate: over 12 kg  during the first half of this year and about 8 kg a year before  that. Amphetamine seizures have multiplied nearly 10 times since  1991.    ``Since the police and customs agents seize from 1 to 5  percent of the drugs circulating in the market, you can judge  how much there is around,'' Koskinen said.    According to police estimates, there are about 12,000 drug  addicts in Helsinki. Thirty-five hundred of them have committed  serious crimes. Other crimes are always associated with drug use  since the drug addict needs a lot of money. Every year the  police take a sampling of property crimes. About a third of them  are linked with drugs.  <H5>  Dealers in Every Part of the City </H5>   Nowadays drugs are sold in restaurants and bars and from  home  to home by telephone. There are dealers in every part of the  city.    There are even a few drug users in the capital under age 15,  but most of them do not begin before about age 18.    Social welfare office youth supervisor Stig Lindholm knows  of  cases in which young people pick up the drug habit through  cannabis. After that, they are told that no one sells it any  more, but that other drugs are available instead, amphetamines,  for example. Many of them become addicted to them and the drug  and crime spiral gets started.    Most of the drugs are still smuggled in via the Netherlands,  but drugs brought in from Russia, Estonia, Poland, and directly  from the Far East are constantly on the increase. The prices of  many drugs have dropped, which makes it possible for even more  people to use them.    Heroin dominates more markets since it is now available for  smoking in addition to intravenous injection. Many users avoid  needles because of the danger of AIDS, among other reasons.  Meanwhile, nearly forgotten, LSD has made a comeback on the  market.    ``Many are mixed users. They use various drugs, beer, and  possibly even medications,'' Koskinen said.  <H5>  Favorable Talk of Drugs Is Alarming </H5>   In Koskinen's opinion, favorable talk of drugs is the most  alarming development. ``I'm appalled by the fact that many  people want to paint a favorable picture of drugs. This is  well-received by young people.''    Free of Drugs, R.A., executive director Saini Mustalampi is  of the same opinion as Koskinen.    ``A quite different phase is now in progress than was only  five years ago. A youth culture that looks upon drugs favorably  supports the use of a new generation of drugs. The current boom  will appear in the treatment statistics in about five years from  now,'' Mustalampi predicted.    Rid of Drugs, R.A., family workers receive over 500  telephone  calls a year and they cannot handle any more than that with  their present staff.    Stig Lindholm stressed the fact that the use of intoxicants  is never a cause, but a symptom.    ``The problem for many users of intoxicants is unemployment.  When a person has a job, he has a regular schedule, like others,  and he feels as though he belongs to something,'' Lindholm  reflected.  <H5>  Doctor Sees Only Problem Users </H5>   Chief physician Antti Holopainen knows that some drug users  can control their use of them, but the doctor never sees them.  Holopainen has to deal with only the problem users.    ``We don't exactly know the reasons why some people become  very quickly dependent on drugs while others hold out for a  longer time. One important factor is the pleasure effect: Those  who get a feeling of well-being from them look for it again, but  for some the experience is unpleasant. Since getting high is  often a communal experience, psychosocial factors are of great  importance,'' Holopainen said.    Most frequently the drug user starts with cannabis products  and goes from them to other drugs. Very few of them are capable  of staying with cannabis, which is not ordinarily a  life-threatening drug, but it alienates the user from reality.    ``Cannabis users relate to their environment in an unreal  manner. They think that they are smarter than other people, but  it's hard for an outsider to notice that they are. A person who  smokes hashish generally withdraws into himself and is not  motivated to do anything.''    Drugs are responsible for about 60 cases of death a year in  Finland. Users under 20 years of age are now beginning to be  counted among them. About 75 percent of regular amphetamine  users die under age 35. Alcoholics do not attain the same high  mortality rate until they are 20 years older.    For Finns the most typical intoxicant is tranquilizer abuse  and the second most typical is mixed use of medications and  alcohol. True drugs come only after these.    Holopainen is alarmed at the large number of unemployed  youths because experience shows that heroin use, for example,  may spread under exceptional circumstances.  <H5>  Youth Supervisor Recommends Firm Hand </H5>   Youth supervisor Stig Lindholm is pained when he thinks how  many young people's lives are in danger of going down the drain  since there is just no way of breaking the cycle of drugs and  crime. Altogether too few social workers are serving in the  field for them to be able to control the situation and the law  does not yet provide for the possibility of sending young people  under age 18 with serious intoxicant problems away for  compulsory treatment.    In the opinion of Lindholm, who handles cases involving  young  people at the Helsinki Courthouse, there are neither enough  treatment centers nor are the existing ones the kind young  people need.    ``Many young addicts would seek institutional care if that  were possible, but local governments are currently more  unwilling than before to pay for treatment.''    In Lindholm's opinion, young people who wind up on the  streets cannot be gotten off them with empathy. The worst  situation is one in which the youth realizes that no one can do  anything for him. Deep down every young person craves authority.    ``Young people caught up in the spiral are mostly good guys  who might go far in life if they had some other kind of  incentive.''    Lindholm's dream is some sort of commando group that would  go  to the spot immediately when families have problems. It would  establish a treatment plan and follow through with its  implementation.</p>

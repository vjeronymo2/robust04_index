			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Have a heart on Valentine's Day: Presents for women - Gifts for men One Valentine's morning, I awoke to find a furry bear - sporting a pair of diamond ear studs - on my doorstep. As romantic gestures go, this scored full marks for technical merit and artistic impression. Such gifts also last much longer than chocolates. But tastes in jewellery are extremely individual and, since the choice of a Valentine's gift - even more than Christmas or birthdays - is meant to be a surprise, men who do not know the preferences of their love might be in difficulty. Most women's jewellery boxes are cluttered with bijoux that failed to please. Follow these pointers, however, and you should succeed in combining surprise with pleasure. An efficient business woman will, almost certainly, want a jewel as simple and low-key as her wear-it-and-forget-it Armani and Donna Karan suits. Thus, Tiffany's gold heart-shaped locket (Pounds 505), a timeless, modern classic (for mail order, ring 071-409 2790); or designer Eric van Peterson's stunningly simple, brushed gold effect, heart-shaped drop earrings (Pounds 9.95) from mail-order jewellery company Caura (071-351-7886). Mothers of small, demanding children enjoy any Valentine pampering as a welcome relief from Pampers. And those spending time with toddlers soon discover that a certain indestructibility is not a bad thing in a jewel: for instance, the Forever Set heart pendants which use an innovative process to make diamonds appear suspended in mid-air, like Perrier bubbles. By Fior Dressage, these start at Pounds 150 from Mappin &amp; Webb branches and Mallory's of Bath. At the Lesley Craze Gallery, 34 Clerkenwell Green, London EC1 (071-608-0393), fat acrylic hearts in jelly-bean colours, dotted with gold, will not break the bank at around Pounds 17. For a woman fond of dogs, horses, children and the countryside, it is wise to opt for a conventional gem. If money is no object (and you are sure she wouldn't rather have a new Aga or conservatory), then she is guaranteed to appreciate Kiki McDonough's amethyst heart earrings, set in 18 carat gold with tiny rubies and light-catching crystal drops (Pounds 925 from 77c Walton Street, London SW3 (071-581-1777). If antiques are more to her liking, Sandra Cronan (18 Burlington Arcade, London W1, 071-491-4851) is offering an exquisite enamelled gold locket dating back to 1870. It is decorated with flowers, overlaid with a gold cherub. Price Pounds 4,600 (071-491-4851). If she is a bohemian creature who likes to think she's a one-off, her heart might won with a unique, hand-crafted, and highly individual jewel. First stop, then, is the studio of mosaic master Andrew Logan (071-407- 6575). He has mirror heart brooches (sized from 1-2 inches) in dazzling red, peacock, silver or harlequin colours and priced from Pounds 50. More extravagant pieces can be found at Electrum (21 South Molton Street, London W1, 071-629-6325): a necklace of amber chunks, with a heart-shaped pendant (Pounds 800 plus VAT), or Michael Bateman's modern copper, silver and brass heart pendant on a silk-braided cord, (Pounds 360 plus VAT). Any female with the litheness and girlish taste in clothing of model Kate Moss (but not her bank balance) is unlikely to have graduated - yet - from affordable silver to the indulgence and grown-up sophistication of real gold. In which case, suitors would be wise to flick through the new Caura catalogue (071-351-7886). This features hallmarked sterling silver rings engraved with romantic sentiments, or raised hearts on a silver band. These can be worn singly or several at a time, depending on the depth of your affections and the length of her digits. Prices are from Pounds 28.50 to Pounds 32. Prove you are trendy with almost anything from 34-year-old jeweller Dinny Hall, a former British accessory designer of the year. Valentine offerings include Moorish silver filigree heart earrings (Pounds 14), or pastel, semi-precious jewels dangling from tiny heart earrings (Pounds 18.50 for silver, Pounds 22.50 for gold). Dinny Hall is at 200 Westbourne Grove, London W11 2RH (071-222-9002). Her bedtime reading is Vogue rather than Verlaine? She will wear any colour so long as it's black? French jewellery name Agatha, which has a boutique at 2 South Molton Street, London W1, offers items which confirm that style and romance are linked inextricably: chunky gilt hearts (Pounds 6) to loop on to hooped earrings (Pounds 12) or worn hanging from an elegant black velvet ribbon choker. A matching charm bracelet, with weighty hearts and crosses, will cost you Pounds 30. (For Agatha's mail order catalogue, call 071-495-2779). At Clive Ranger, unusual pink diamonds - ranging from delicate pastel rose to a deeper hue - are fashioned into rings or can be set in a one-off commissioned design. Prices range from Pounds 360 to Pounds 2,000 at Ranger shops: 2-4 Castle Arcade, Cardiff; 251 Oxford Street, Swansea; and 6-7 Old Bond Street, Bath, Avon. At Verdura, the jeweller in St James's, London, money-no-object options include an amethyst, gold and diamond heart-shaped brooch, topped with a gold-and-diamond cupid that will make her putty in your hands; price Pounds 18,000, to order. (Call Harry Fane at Verdura: 071-930-8606). Last but not least, an inspired alternative to the mushy card you were planning: a simple, golden, heart-shaped bead from Janet Coles Beads (128 Notting Hill Gate, London W11 3QG; call 0905-755888 for mail order), plus a fine strip of leather on which to thread it. ***** Men tend to get a raw deal on Valentine's day. They are expected to provide flowers and romantic dinners but are lucky if they receive a few anonymous cards, a bottle of champagne and two painted glasses. But how does a girl show she cares? The secret is to keep well clear of most things emblazoned with, or shaped like, a heart, which most men find tasteless - even embarrassing. The ideal Valentine present can take two forms: the transient, such as something delicious to eat or drink, or, more subtly, a romantic aide-memoire - a personal object that only a loved one could have chosen and will remind him of the sender. This was taken to lavish proportions by a French woman who celebrated February 14 with two portraits - one of herself to hang in her husband's office, and one of him to grace her drawing room. The idea was that they would never be too far apart. Flowers remain the universal love token. While they might make some men uncomfortable, the more sophisticated are unlikely to feel their virility compromised. But the flowers should not look feminine and red roses should be avoided at all costs. Florist Ming Veevers Carter at Chelsea Gardener (125 Sydney Street, London SW3; tel. 071-370-0549) creates masculine-looking arrangements and, for the man who finds flowers outre, she can build fresh, miniature topiary in assorted shapes and designs. Prices start at Pounds 20. For a different, affordable luxury, try some soft cotton batiste pyjamas from Budd (Shirtmakers), 1a &amp; 3 Piccadilly Arcade, London SW1, tel: 071-493-0139). Available in a selection of colours they are made properly and generously and have contrast piping. Price: Pounds 95. The romantic dresser will appreciate a silk waistcoat from Orford and Swan (5 Church Row, London NW3; 071-495-4103). Taken from Beauvais, Aubusson and Savonnerie designs from the 17th to early-19th centuries, the company's waistcoats are some of the most elegant on the market. Price: Pounds 315. When it comes to underwear, remember Calvin Klein is a brand that seems to have universal appeal to men. Styles range from classic boxers to more athletic underpinnings at Harvey Nichols, Knightsbridge, SW1 (071-235-5000). If choosing a tie, go to Turnbull &amp; Asser, 70 Jermyn Street, London SW1 (071-930-0502). It still sells the best neckwear in London. Accessories could include enamelled gold cufflinks from Kiki McDonough, 77c Walton Street, London SW3 (071-581- 1777). Motifs include shooting, fishing, golf, a camera, dogs, the houses of parliament, monogrammed slippers and a magician's hat. The workmanship is very good but, at prices from Pounds 975, these are probably only for the most ardent of admirers. For a more less costly assortment, go to Paul Smith (41-42 Floral Street, WC2; 071-379- 7133) where you will find light-hearted cufflinks at good prices (around Pounds 32) including ovals painted with LO and VE. If your man's tastes extend to the antique, you could invest in a pen from Jasmine Cameron at Antiquarious (131 Kings Road, London SW3 (071-351-4154); the carefully reconditioned collection includes vintage Conway Stewarts, Shaeffers and Swans ranging from about Pounds 220-260. If he would appreciate something very personal, buy him a gold love disc (Pounds 256) from Aphrodisia, 25 Shepherds Market, London W1 (071-499-2901). Available in three types of gold, you can have it inscribed. Aphrodisia's chocolates, Avant L'Amour, are delicious and include ingredients reputed to have aphrodisiac qualities: ginger, which is said to stir passion; coconut, symbolic of fertility; and Venus's own fruit, strawberry. Prices start at Pounds 8. For the man who cooks, there are two suitable recipe books - The Foods of Love, by Max de Roche (Pounds 8.50), and the charmingly arcane La Cuisine Aphrodisaque (around Pounds 12.50) which has 200 sensual recipes from throughout the ages. The man who needs to be coaxed into a slightly healthier lifestyle might enjoy a short stay (from Pounds 110) at Claridges hotel, Brook Street, London W1 (071-629 8860), where male guests can use the exclusive Bath &amp; Raquets Club. Annabels without the dancing, it is the most civilised and best-decorated health and fitness club in London. More modestly, he might enjoy a Health and Fitness Day at Champneys, Le Meridien, 21 Piccadilly, London W1 (071-437-8114), which costs Pounds 95 a person and includes use of the swimming pool, whirlpool, sauna, steam room, squash courts, gymnasium, cardio-vascular room, a supervised workout, lunch, body massage, facial, manicure and pedicure. The ideal olfactory Valentine comes from Penhaligons (081-809-7799), which will engrave scent bottles with entwined initials, two characters with a heart, or a loving inscription. Prices from Pounds 20. Finally, two unusual Valentine gifts. The first is a romantic sojourn in Le Touquet with Love Air, a small airline that flies from Biggin Hill or Lydd airports in Kent and organises tailor-made holidays in and around the French coastal resort. Prices start at Pounds 165 a person for flights and a two-day stay (0279-681435). The second is musical. The Serenading Service (071-792-1419) will send an opera singer with guitar accompanist to any venue in central London to serenade your lover with two choice romantic arias. Prices start at Pounds 250. Definitely for the man who does not mind being the centre of attention, this present will leave him in no doubt about your intentions.</p>

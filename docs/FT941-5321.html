			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt If investors are not still stunned in the aftermath of the 'horror' 20.6 per cent growth in M3 money supply in January (announced on Thursday last week) and last week's wave of selling from the US, there may in the next few days be grounds for a cautious revival in sentiment. First, the threat of a damaging strike in the engineering sector has been averted. The wages deal reached between the IG Metall union and employers in the early hours of Saturday morning removes one obstacle to further interest rate cuts on the part of the Bundesbank. Second, with this obstacle removed, the Bundesbank may seize the opportunity to steer down money market interest rates by means of a variable rate tender for securities repurchase agreements (repos). The results of the tender will be published on Wednesday and it may be that after a minute three basis point drop in the repo rate last week to 5.97 per cent the rate will be shaved further. A reduction in money market rates, by five basis points or more, would help restore investors' hopes of further generous cuts in the discount rate (at 5.25 per cent) during the first half of the year. But with US interest rates likely to rise, it remains to be seen whether the fortunes of the bund market can be decoupled from those of the US Treasury market.</p>

The staff considers the Russian-Georgian treaty on  friendship, neighborliness, and cooperation signed in February  in Tbilisi to be an example of Georgia's practical cooperation  within the framework of the Commonwealth. This document, in  particular, reflects the intentions of the sides to adopt  measures to implement effectively agreements on the temporary  stay of Russian military formations on the territory of Georgia,  and also to conclude agreements on lending assistance in setting  up Georgian Armed Forces, in fitting them out, and in their  acquisition of armaments, military weapons, and technological  equipment without the right to hand them over to third countries.</p>

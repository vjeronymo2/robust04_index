			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW HOME SALES SOAR 9.6%; RATE DROP CITED  </P> <P> New home sales jumped 9.6% in November, their fastest gain in four months, the  government said Wednesday. Analysts said the housing industry continues to be  aided by lower mortgage rates.  </P> <P> "It shows that when mortgage rates are at relatively affordable levels, buyers  will be buying homes," said Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the Federal  National Mortgage Assn.  </P> <P> Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Assn. of Home Builders, agreed  that the report shows "consumers are responding to lower interest rates."  </P> <P> But Carliner added that many home builders are concerned whether rates will  remain at low levels this year, saying that "in the five years I've been here,  I've never seen them so nervous."  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said new, single-family homes were sold at a seasonally  adjusted annual rate of 710,000 units in November after a revised 0.9% gain the  month before. October sales originally were reported down 0.5%.  </P> <P> It was the sharpest surge since a 14.1% advance last July.  </P> <P> "This certainly should take some of the wind out of stories that the housing  market is about to collapse," said economist Richard Peach of the Mortgage  Bankers Assn.  </P> <P> Peach noted that in addition to new home sales, sales of existing houses also  hit a fairly good pace in November and that housing starts, "while not rising  like gangbusters," are improving.  </P> <P> Some analysts, including Carliner and Obrinsky, saw the possibility of slightly  higher mortgage interest rates this year as the Federal Reserve straddles a  fine line of trying to keep inflation under control by restraining credit while  not pushing the economy into a recession with high interest rates.  </P> <P> The Fed began last June to let short-term rates drop gradually. Mortgage rates  have fallen from an 11.22% peak to 9.74% at the end of November, according to  the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, new home sales for the first 11 months of last year were down  3.5% from the same period in 1988.  </P> <P> The sharpest gain in new home sales in November occurred in the West, which  posted a 29.9% advance. Analysts attributed much of the increase to a rebound  from depressed sales after the Oct. 17 Bay Area Earthquake. October sales in  the region had plummeted 21.6%.  </P> <P> The Midwest also recorded strong sales, up 23.6%. Sales in the Northeast rose  8.5%.  </P> <P> The South had the only decline, a drop of 7.6%.  </P></p>

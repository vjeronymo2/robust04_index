			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / International Company News: Telekom sails into unknown waters - Germany's newly privatised utility had a troubled launch Sailing off into unknown waters with neither steersman nor charts is hardly the most promising set of circumstances, least of all for the gaggle of absolute beginners manning Deutsche Telekom. Yet Germany's state-owned telecommunications utility was launched down the privatisation slip-way last week in just such conditions. Chairman Mr Helmut Ricke was at the Cologne ceremony at which Telekom, the postal service and the post office bank were officially transformed into joint stock companies. But as he had announced two weeks earlier, he was leaving the board 'for purely personal reasons'. Mr Tyll Necker, grizzled doyen of German business, was also present but not in the role the government had intended. Just as Mr Ricke had turned down a two-year extension of his contract, Mr Necker had rejected the government's offer of a seat on the Telekom supervisory board. He was more forthcoming about his cold-shoulder: he was worried about how Mr Gerhard Pfeffermann, state secretary in the post ministry, could reconcile the conflict of interests implicit in his dual role as a representative of Telekom's owners and as a regulator. For his pains he was awarded a verbal mugging from unrepentant post minister Mr Wolfgang Botsch, who thought his reasons 'incomprehensible'. Rejected both by the man who in only four years has wrought deep-seated changes in the monstrous Telekom hierarchy and one of the country's most respected industrial figureheads, Mr Botsch in turn ejected Mr Peter Bross, from his job as the chief architect of German telecoms liberalisation. In the kerfuffle which followed, it emerged that there had long been friction between Mr Bross, the technocrat, and Mr Pfeffermann, the politician, over the principles on which the Telekom privatisation is grounded. Specifically, according to supporters of Mr Bross: talk of liberalisation of telecoms markets - on which swathes of industry are planning huge investments - is 'empty political talk'. 'We need far more transparency,' one government official said. 'Who is helped when the minister says he will liberalise telecoms markets by 1998 without explaining what will be liberalised or how?' Mr Ricke's refusal of a contract extension was bad, but Mr Bross's removal set the signals in the wrong direction and would damage Germany's image, he added. The common thread which appears to link the sequence of defection, rejection and sacking is concern that Telekom's management, which has about 18 months to prepare for the first stage of privatisation and two years to brace itself against the onslaught of free competition is going to find itself hog-tied by political interference and opportunism. A predominance of politicians on the newly-appointed supervisory board and the consequent underweight representation of business and technical skills is already seen as a potential obstacle. Management plans for major investments, structural changes or top appointments have to be approved by the board of supervisors. Then there is the government's surrogate, the so-called Federal Institute for Post and Telecommunications which is to act as an umbrella holding company for all three former post office departments. This 3,500-strong body, which will have certain key tasks such as negotiating employment conditions for a large proportion of Telekom's 230,000 employees, is also to be headed by a group of politicians. As a recent analysis by Deutsche Bank of the company's prospects pointed out: 'The relationship between the holding and its subsidiaries will be an important factor in the valuation of Deutsche Telekom. A key factor will be the ability of the management (Telekom's) to create shareholder value without supervisory conflicts.' Meanwhile, government has to prepare and win approval for new legislation constituting the regulatory framework within which Germany's liberalised telecoms market will function. Existing laws are valid only until 1997, and according to bankers associated with the privatisation share sale, there has been no sign yet of any draft legislation. In so far as potential combatants have already been removed or retired from the scene, the potential for conflict has been reduced. But Mr Botsch's refusal to review his decision to post Mr Pfeffermann to the supervisory board, his brusque treatment of Mr Necker and Mr Bross appear to be the deeds of a man determined to have his own way rather than find a consensus. It is only a matter of weeks since he shocked Telekom with the announcement that Germany would scrap its state monopoly on the federal telecommunications network at the end of 1997. Until then the utility had been working on the assumption, fostered by the minister, that the network monopoly would remain in place until 2000. Mr Rolf-Dieter Leister, supervisory board chairman, protested immediately. 'I certainly do not represent the view that Germany should become the front-runner in European telecoms liberalisation,' he said. He also complained that day-to-day management was hampered by the need for all important decisions to be approved at the political level. If shareholder interest was to be cultivated to assure a successful float, Telekom's mandate had to be clarified as quickly as possible. It was particularly important that it should be able to establish foreign subsidiaries without Mr Botsch's having the final say. The minister made a point at last week's ceremony of stressing that the three former post office companies were now free to spread their wings in commercial ventures beyond Germany's borders. While this is strictly true in German legalistic terms, it fails to take account of the fact that the international playing field - most notably those parts on German and French territory, for example - is in distinct need of levelling. AT&amp;T of the US was quick to object on these grounds to a proposed deal under which Telekom and its French counterpart want to buy a 20 per cent stake in Sprint, a leading US long-distance carrier. The Federal Communications Commission and/or the Justice Department should prevent the investment until AT&amp;T and other US competitors were allowed equal opportunities in Europe, it said. Lack of liberalisation was also an important factor in the recent decision of the Brussels competition authorities to block a proposed joint venture in multi-media between Telekom, the Bertelsmann media and music group and Mr Leo Kirch, a Munich film distribution magnate. If it had been allowed it could have effectively shut out all prospective competition for many years - a state of affairs to which Telekom has grown accustomed over the years, and one to which Mr Botsch still seems strongly attached.</p>

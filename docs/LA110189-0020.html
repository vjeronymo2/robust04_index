			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MEDITERRANEAN SUMMIT;  </P> <P> SOVIETS EXPECT GAINS ON ARMS TREATIES, SHEVARDNADZE HINTS;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: GORBACHEV APPARENTLY HAS HIGHER HOPES THAN BUSH FOR THE RESULTS OF  THE CONFERENCE.  </P> <P> Although the meeting of Soviet and American presidents in the Mediterranean  will be informal and its agenda open, the Soviet Union nevertheless expects  significant progress on arms control and other difficult issues, Foreign  Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze indicated Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Soviet hope, Shevardnadze implied in announcing plans for the meeting, is  that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush will reach agreement on  formulas to resolve the major questions remaining in negotiations on new arms  control treaties, which could then be signed next year.  </P> <P> Describing the shipboard meeting as "a major political development,"  Shevardnadze said that while the two presidents plan to hold a broad,  open-ended dialogue, they will focus on agreements to be concluded at their  subsequent meeting in May or June.  </P> <P> "This meeting should be regarded as the most important stage in preparing the  negotiations that will take place in the United States during the official  state visit there of Mikhail Gorbachev," Shevardnadze told a press conference.  </P> <P> "But we do not exclude that the leaders will give certain instructions to their  foreign ministers and other representatives of our countries so that after this  dialogue there will be practical preparations for the Washington summit."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Boost for Gorbachev  </P> <P> This suggested to Western diplomats that Moscow, as has become customary under  Gorbachev, is setting its sights higher for the Mediterranean meeting than  Washington is, probably in the hope that this will give the talks greater  dynamism and provide the Soviet president with a bit of political leverage.  </P> <P> Since the negotiation of the first strategic arms treaties in the early 1970s,  Moscow and Washington have often used summit meetings to reach agreement on  broad approaches and occasionally on the resolution of knotty questions in  order to move the negotiations forward. The usual device is "agreed  instructions," a term used Tuesday by Shevardnadze.  </P> <P> "Let's wait and see," the Soviet foreign minister said when pressed for  Moscow's agenda for the December meeting. "The main thing is that the meeting  is to take place."  </P> <P> Moscow has said repeatedly that it would like to see a preliminary agreement  next year on reducing strategic arms by 50%, though serious questions remain  open. It also wants agreement on reducing conventional forces in Europe and on  outlawing chemical arms, and on protocols that will permit ratification of  treaties limiting nuclear tests.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze spoke with evident satisfaction, for Moscow had been attempting  for months to engage the Bush Administration in a deeper dialogue but found  itself repeatedly put off, first during a "strategic review" and then by  evident reluctance of key presidential advisers to commit the United States to  negotiations.  </P> <P> Moscow had repeatedly tried to force the pace. Gorbachev went to New York last  December to address the United Nations, putting forward new arms reduction  proposals then and several times since, with the goal of engaging the Bush  Administration.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze, meeting in mid-September with Bush and Secretary of State James  A. Baker III, had offered a series of concessions to clear several of the  remaining obstacles to the strategic arms reduction treaty, and both sides  emerged from those sessions in Washington and Jackson Hole, Wyo., almost  rhapsodic about the improved state of relations.  </P> <P> As Gorbachev has continued his meetings with other world leaders the need grew  more apparent to officials here for a Soviet-American summit conference.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Invited Himself'  </P> <P> "Last year, Gorbachev simply invited himself to the United Nations, and  President Reagan and President-elect Bush came up from Washington," a Soviet  foreign affairs specialist commented after Tuesday's announcement. "But he  can't do that every year."  </P> <P> Although Bush said in Washington that the meeting was originally his idea and  had been accepted by Gorbachev, Soviet officials began searching last summer  for a way to bring the two leaders together, believing that a personal  relationship would likely develop to strengthen ties between them.  </P> <P> A key consideration for Moscow, Soviet officials said, was the need to allay  the concern of many in the Bush Administration, notably Secretary of Defense  Dick Cheney and Robert M. Gates, the President's assistant national security  adviser, on the strength of Gorbachev's domestic position and the durability of  his reform program.  </P> <P> "Skeptics are telling Bush that Gorbachev will fail and so why deal with him,  why negotiate anything?" a Soviet foreign policy official commented. "This has  slowed the negotiations considerably. The prospect of no summit until next  summer would have been unacceptable to us without the understanding that there  would be the pre-summit meeting now."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Insight on Tactics  </P> <P> Shevardnadze, questioned about the announcement, provided limited insight into  Soviet tactics.  </P> <P> "Both sides found it useful and, I would even say, necessary at this time to  hold such an informal, interim summit," he said. They expected, he said, that  the talks would foster "further development and deepening of the positive  changes in Soviet-American relations, which have had a positive effect on the  world political climate."  </P> <P> For some here, Shevardnadze's comments recalled the meeting -- also billed as a  "pre-summit" -- between then President Ronald Reagan and Gorbachev three years  ago in Iceland. That session, hurriedly prepared but intended to produce  breakthroughs on arms control, collapsed with U.S. and Soviet negotiators at  loggerheads over a complex package of interlocking measures.  </P> <P> To keep the meeting in December informal and allow the two presidents and their  advisers to get to know one another better, Shevardnadze said, neither side has  "set a goal of reaching any agreements on any specific issues," although the  whole range of Soviet and U.S. interests will probably be discussed.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 29 (BTA) -- Iraqi government special  envoy Abd-al-Amir al-Anbari today met with Deputy Prime Minister  Evgeni Matinchev, briefing him on Iraq's compliance with UN  Security Council recommendations for the reparation of damage  caused by the Gulf War. Mr. Anbari is here to prepare a session  of the Bulgarian-Iraqi Committee on Trade and Economic  Cooperation.    The visitor said Iraq was strictly compliant with UN  requirements, yet the United Nations has not yet lifted the  embargo inflicting irreparable damage on the Iraqi economy and  people. He said the embargo has had an adverse impact on  countries directly or indirectly linked to that war, including  Bulgaria. Anbari said that after lifting the sanctions, Bulgaria  and Iraq can resume cooperation in trade, construction and  industry.    Deputy Prime Minister Matinchev recalled that as a result of  the strict observance of the four-year long embargo, Iraq has  run up a $3,250 million debt to Bulgaria.</p>

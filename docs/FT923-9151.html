			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TRADING IN stock index futures was dull as worries about the outcome of an opinion poll in France over the Maastricht agreement overhung the market for most of the session, writes Joel Kibazo. The sombre mood took hold early on, and having opened at 2,410 the September FT-SE contract retreated to 2,403 by 11.30am as independent traders led the contract lower ahead of news on the poll. Nerves about the outcome of today's Bundesbank meeting also added to the general feeling of unease in the market. However, a lighter mood combined with a squeeze caused a turnround in the September future at lunchtime, sending it rising to 2,420. A weak Wall Street opening and profit-taking saw the contract once again drift lower, though another squeeze as independent traders went short ensured the contract closed above the day's worst. September ended at 2,415, down 3 from Tuesday's finish but around 10 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 12. Turnover at 5,259 lots was poor. Traded options had one of their worst day's in recent times. Total volume was a mere 14,941 contracts, with the FT-SE 100 option having only 3,388 lots dealt.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Arts: The Wilton Diptych remains enigmatic In an age which has seen blockbuster exhibitions swell to ever more monstrous proportions, the National Gallery in London has pioneered series of modest shows which recognise how rewarding it can be to look hard and think about a single work. For the first in a new series, Making and Meaning, which again focuses on major works in its own collection, the spotlight is directed towards the Wilton Diptych in the aftermath of its recent cleaning and technical examination. This small, portable altarpiece is one of the most refined and sumptuous products of the late medieval world. It is also one of the most enigmatic. Generations of scholars have debated who painted it, and why, and what it meant to those who first saw it. The purpose of this exhibition, which is supplemented by a small number of judicious loans of panels, manuscripts, sculpture, metalwork and jewellery, is to offer visitors the possibility of understanding a private and complex image. The temptation to tell them how to interpret it is scrupulously resisted. Although the Wilton Diptych has the inevitability of a dream, its two halves make for a distinctly odd couple. On the barren earth of the left wing kneels Richard II of England, identified as such by his personal emblems of the white hart on his breast and the broomcods, or pods of the broom plant - the planta genista from which the Plantagenets took their name - laced around his neck. The three figures standing behind him - Edmund, king and martyr, Edward the Confessor and John the Baptist - act as intercessors and have been carefully chosen for their personal significance for the monarch. The frieze of saints is remarkable for its evenly distributed verticality while the profile portrait of the king has all the depth of a playing card. The crowded panoply of the right wing could hardly be more different. Here the Virgin stands cradling the Christ Child in a paradise garden, supported by a company of angels who, wearing broomcods and white harts, seem to have been liveried by the King of England rather than the Queen of Heaven. Arms crossed, wings fluttering, seven of them form a backdrop to her, while four more ring her round. This image is the epitome of a manner of painting that was swept away by the Renaissance and the discovery of perspective, but here too there is pictorial space. The narrative link between the two is provided by the white banner emblazoned by the red cross of Christ's Resurrection which is also the banner of St George. Its pinnacle is a silvered orb and that too alludes to England. Recent cleaning has revealed that it contains a minute representation of a green island, a white tower with two turrets, and a boat in full sail. It is hard not to read it as 'this sceptred isle . . . and precious stone set in the silver sea' of John of Gaunt's speech in Shakespeare's Richard II. This is no standard image of a donor being presented to the Virgin by his patrons. Rather, it appears a carefully orchestrated expression of Richard's notion of the divine nature of his kingship and his hopes for salvation. As such, the altarpiece is likely to have been made for the private devotions of the king, a few years before his untimely death in 1399. The Wilton Diptych is one of the high points of the so-called International Style, that phase of late Gothic art when painters and sculptors all over Europe seemed to be marching to the same drum. Such is the extent of cross-fertilisation that no agreement has been reached about whether its creator was English, French, Italian or Bohemian. The recent technical examination has only confirmed that while the preparation of the ground of the oak panels is typically Northern, the technique adopted for binding the pigments and for the green undermodelling of the flesh tones is characteristically Italian. The use of egg white allowed the painter to exploit the full purity of the precious lapis lazuli which he ground to produce the brilliant ultramarine. Wherever he came from, the anonymous master of the Wilton Diptych was a great painter. This is his (or her?) only surviving work. We have no idea whether it belongs to his youth, maturity or old age. One thing is certain, however: if it had not survived, no one would have felt the lack of it. The picture stands as a poignant reminder of how much of our past has been lost. That, and not just its quality, is part of its enchantment. Sponsored by Esso UK plc, at the National Gallery until December 12, admission free.</p>

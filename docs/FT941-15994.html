			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Alpha Airports expects 19% lift to Pounds 20.6m Alpha Airports Group, which is coming to the market later this month, yesterday forecast a 19 per cent rise in operating profits for the year to January 31. The airport services division of Forte said in its pathfinder prospectus that operating profits would reach Pounds 20.6m (Pounds 17.3m) on turnover of Pounds 423.1m (Pounds 404.5m). Alpha's business is divided almost equally between catering for airlines and retail trading at airports. It expects profits of Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 13.1m) from the catering side on turnover of Pounds 210.1m (Pounds 197.5m). The retail side's turnover is expected to be Pounds 213m (Pounds 207m) with operating profits of Pounds 5.9m (Pounds 4.2m). Half the shares are expected to be taken up by institutions with a further 25 per cent going to retail buyers and Forte retaining the remaining 25 per cent. Market capitalisation is expected to be about Pounds 200m. Mr Rocco Forte, chairman, said the flotation was a further step in the implementation of its strategy of concentration on the core hotel and restaurant businesses. Mr Paul Harrison, chief executive of Alpha, said that the flotation would give it a springboard for development just as its markets were beginning to rise. BAA is forecasting a growth rate of 4.5 per cent a year for UK passengers until at least 2005. Alpha also announced the appointment of Mr Rodney Galpin as non-executive chairman. Mr Galpin, was chairman and chief executive of Standard Chartered from 1988 to 1993. UBS are sponsors to the flotation.</p>

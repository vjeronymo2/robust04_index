			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / We are hostages, say Lebanon's Christians: Lara Marlowe finds despair over Syria's role as Maronite leaders bicker and splinter A NEW poster covers the walls of the Maronite Christian Phalange party headquarters near Beirut port. 'Freedom kidnapped - Lebanon hostage,' it says. Dollops of red ink fall from the arrow-pierced heart of a dove of peace. Prison bars are superimposed over a map of Lebanon and upon a photograph of Mr Boutros Khawand, a party official kidnapped on September 15. Mr Khawand's colleagues say they do not know who is holding the Phalangist central committee member, but the poster's message is simple enough: Syria, which maintains 40,000 troops in Lebanon, has 'kidnapped' the country. While most Lebanese have learned, however grudgingly, to live with the Syrian presence, a hard core of Maronites continues to reject the influence of Damascus as their leadership bickers and splinters in the aftermath of parliamentary elections. 'Lebanese Christians have never been so full of despair,' Mr Issa Goraieb, editor-in-chief of Beirut's l'Orient le Jour newspaper, says. 'It started with the inter-Christian war in 1990. It's been downhill ever since.' Five of the 128 parliamentary seats remain to be filled in a special by-election in the strongly Maronite Kesrouan region on October 11. The August 30 poll was postponed when all candidates in the region agreed to boycott the vote. But 22 candidates have now registered for the by-election  -and their change of heart has plunged Maronite leaders into an unseemly bout of mud-slinging. The candidates include Mr Fares Boueiz, who resigned as foreign minister in August in protest at the holding of the original elections. Mr Boueiz explains the reversal of his decision by claiming that the Maronites are 'committing political suicide' and that Kesrouan cannot be turned over to 'outsiders'. He condemns the Christian leaders most vehemently opposed to the elections - ex-president Amin Gemayel, Raymond Edde, Dory Chamoun and former rebel General Michel Aoun - for 'mixing opposition and tourism' by living in France. From Paris Mr Edde brands Mr Boueiz 'a (Syrian) agent'. Gen Aoun yet again broke his promise to the French to refrain from political statements, demanding that all Lebanese politicians resign from public office. The general, who has a wide but inactive following in Lebanon, will not be allowed to return from his exile in Marseilles until 1995. Phalange party president, Mr George Saade, who resigned as minister of post and telecommunications, also in protest at the elections, now says that he too regrets the boycott. There will be 64 Christians in the new parliament which will convene for the first time on October 16. But, says Mr Saade, 'not all Christians represent Christianity'. 'The Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party (SSNP) has many Maronites. They won nine seats in parliament - they took over our seats. Hizbollah won in Beirut because the Christians didn't participate.' Social changes in Lebanon since the last 1972 poll are reflected in the new legislature: two of the women deputies were among the highest vote winners in the country. The presence, for the first time, of 12 Islamic fundamentalists in parliament puts the Lebanese government in the awkward position of officially negotiating with Israel even as the Iranian-backed Hizbollah, which holds eight parliamentary seats, continue their almost daily attacks on Israeli troops in southern Lebanon. Perhaps the most pressing question which will face the cabinet, likely to be formed next month, is the status of the almost half a million Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. Neither the Palestine Liberation Organisation nor Lebanese politicians want to give the refugees Lebanese nationality. The PLO believes this would in effect relinquish their right of return to what is now Israel. The Lebanese fear that making citizens of the mainly Sunni Moslem Palestinian community would upset the country's sectarian balance by making the Sunnis the largest minority in the country. Many Lebanese suspect that the US wants the Palestinians to stay in Lebanon as part of a final Middle East peace package. But they also credit US pressure on Damascus for the expected withdrawal of Syrian troops from Beirut before the end of the year. Syria has already begun removing heavy weapons from the capital to the Bekaa valley, a redeployment which is improving Lebanese morale, especially among the Maronites. But Syria's influence over the Beirut government - and its military presence in the north and east of the country - will remain for years. Although it dictates Lebanese security and foreign policy, Damascus has largely refrained from intervening in the Lebanese economy. Three World Bank and International Monetary Fund delegations will visit Beirut this autumn, and Lebanese officials hope their findings will generate more than the Dollars 150m World Bank emergency loan already granted for water, electricity and telecommunications. The Lebanese pound has lost nearly two-thirds of its value this year. Yet the bread riots which brought down prime minister Omar Karami's government in May seem a distant memory. Those riots were triggered when the Lebanese pound fell to 2,000 to the dollar. The exchange rate is now 2,473 to the dollar and the trade unions are all but silent. Outrage at Lebanon's impoverishment has given way to stoic resignation.</p>

			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Welcome signs of life It is too early to be sure, but the world's big drug stocks could just be on the turn. Since the peak in early January, their falls have been precipitous. But since April, Merck and SmithKline Beecham have outperformed their local markets by 9 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. In the course of last week Glaxo outperformed the London market by 8 per cent. Wellcome, the one stock which crucially stands to gain from all this, has outperformed by some 3 per cent since the start of the month. Given the market power wielded by the advisers to the Wellcome sale, this change of sentiment might not be wholly fortuitous. But it also makes sense in a wider context. Drug stocks on both sides of the Atlantic were driven up last year in a classic recessionary switch out of cyclicals. Early this year they duly came down again as the markets scented economic recovery. In the UK, market sentiment is now back in the doldrums, while in the US it has been somewhat dented by the latest discount rate cut. The Wellcome tender closes at the end of next week. At this rate, the vendors could just get lucky. There is another strand of thinking which might assist Wellcome. In terms of drug pricing, the 1990s could prove not merely non-inflationary but positively deflationary. In such a world, producing me-too drugs in quantities is not enough, since they will get hammered on price. What is needed is genuinely innovative products which can be charged for. Wellcome has such products in the pipeline, as do Glaxo, Merck and SmithKline Beecham. Having been stampeded indiscriminately into drug stocks before, the market this time round is showing signs of being more choosy.</p>

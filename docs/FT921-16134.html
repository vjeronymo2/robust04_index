			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / No harm in wishful thinking When the European heads of government undertook, at their summit in Maastricht last month, to develop a common foreign and security policy, many people sniggered incredulously. The programme for Economic and Monetary Union might be over-ambitious, but at least the target was definable. A common foreign policy, by contrast, is impossible to define in advance, and its development is wholly contingent on unpredictable events. Moreover, the objective seemed at variance with the national interests or historic reflexes of the member states. They had been at odds over the Gulf war, and they were still at odds over the recognition of Croatia. And yet the 12 proceeded almost immediately to adopt a common doctrine of the principles which would in future govern their recognition of foreign states. It is particularly surprising because these principles are quite different from those normally applied. Western governments have in the past tended to treat recognition as a factual, rather than as a moral question. A state which appears to be reliably in control of pretty well all its territory, within recognised borders, can normally expect to be recognised by other governments. It may be a nice state or it may be nasty, but it exists; it is a fact. By contrast, the new Community doctrine lays down five political/moral preconditions for recognition: observance of the UN Charter and the Helsinki Final Act; guarantees of the rights of ethnic and national minorities; respect for national frontiers; acceptance of existing commitments on disarmament and non-proliferation; and a commitment to settle by negotiation the problems of successor states or regional differences. This new doctrine can be explained on two levels. First, the French wanted to restrain German impatience to recognise Croatia, or at least to clothe it in a general policy. Second, Yugoslavia was seen as a portent of the disintegration of the Soviet Union. This would spawn new countries, and the 12 needed to agree some principles for responding to the situation. In principle, all European countries are already committed, through the Helsinki process, to certain standards of civilised behaviour. The Community is entitled to point this out, therefore, at a time when a dozen new countries are reaching for state-hood. But the doctrine contains a most extraordinarily ambitious hidden agenda, for it implies an intention to follow through with some form of intervention if the conditions are not met. Let us suppose that Ukraine, for example, fails to satisfy the Community's five conditions. There are then two options. The first is that the 12 will refuse to acknowledge Ukraine's existence. The second is that the 12 will try to persuade, or compel, it to meet the conditions. The first option is obviously absurd. In theory, the Community could ignore Montenegro; it could not conceivably ignore Ukraine with more than 50m inhabitants, a seat in the UN, and quite possibly a large nuclear arsenal as well. The inference must be that the Community would be prepared to exert pressure on Ukraine to compel it to meet the conditions; but if moral suasion, the withholding of aid, or a trade embargo failed to do the trick, what then? It is obvious that none of the five principles is being observed in Yugoslavia. This is not preventing German, and later general Community, recognition of Croatia and Slovenia. Yet the inconsistency is not necessarily fatal for the purposes of the Community doctrine, because the real test of whether the 12 mean what they say will come with the ex-Soviet Union. The critical question is that of arms control. The commonsense interpretation of the Community's new doctrine, is that the newly-independent republics must take over the obligations of the former Soviet Union to reduce the level of conventional and strategic nuclear weapons under the CFE and Start treaties. We do not yet know if the new Republics want to carry out these arms control agreements, because their attention is focused much more on each other than on the west. Ukrainian leaders have made ambivalent and contradictory statements about the nuclear weapons on their territory; but statements made in the context of inter-republic bargaining in the formation of the new Commonwealth do not necessarily imply settled long-term objectives. In fact, the new republics almost certainly cannot take over the Soviet Union's arms control commitments, legally, politically or physically. The Start and CFE treaties were not ratified by the Soviet Union; therefore, they cannot be taken over by the republics. On the other hand, the Non-Proliferation Treaty was ratified; so perhaps all the Republics are legally nuclear weapons states. Conventional arms control is just as difficult, because the geographic zones agreed in the CFE treaty were only valid for the Soviet Union. They are manifestly inapplicable to the new situation, because the territorial areas do not correspond with national frontiers, let alone with national ambitions. If Start and CFE have no legal force, the rest of the world has two options: hope that the republics agree terms between themselves which we can live with; or demand a negotiation of new treaties. Neither option looks promising until there is real stability in the east; and that may take years. It looks, therefore, as though there may be a quite unusually large dose of wishful thinking in the Community's five principles. This is not a condemnation of the principles; on the contrary, the Community today, like the US 200 years ago, must be built on principles. But we need to remember that a common foreign policy will not be built in a day.</p>

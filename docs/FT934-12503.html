			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Chips are down for UK potato monopoly - The marketing board's stay of execution could yet turn into a permanent reprieve HAD MR John Gummer still been Minister of Agriculture, you might, by now, have read about the UK Potato Marketing Board in the obituary columns. Like its milk marketing counterpart, the PMB enjoys monopoly status and this, together with its statutory powers to control the area of potatoes planted, fail to match the co-operative and competitive pattern for the marketing of farm commodities set by the EC Commission in Brussels. Brussels-based bureaucrats have been gunning for all such UK institutions since Britain joined the community in 1973. Since then the marketing boards for eggs, hops and wool have been wound up. Those for milk and potatoes were bigger, stronger and had more staying power. But in recent years EC administrators once again increased the pressure for something to be done about them; and in Mr Gummer they found an ally. He initiated winding up procedures for both the milk and potato boards. That for milk has already gone beyond the point of no return and April 1 1994 is the target date for completion of the process. But although it had long been assumed that the PMB would follow the MMBs into oblivion, the appointment in May of Mrs Gillian Shephard as minister of agriculture led to a stay of execution. As a farmer's daughter Mrs Shephard no doubt absorbed the stabilising advantages of the PMB for both farmers and consumers during her Norfolk childhood. Indeed one of her first actions when she arrived at the Ministry of Agriculture was to announce a delay in the winding up of the potato board and a review of the entire marketing scheme. In essence she challenged all sectors of the potato industry - growers, processors and retailers - to get together and come up with an acceptable alternative scheme. By implication it would need to retain the important feature of promoting price stability while at the same time satisfying the demands of the EC and the UK government in their ambitions to expose the potato industry to the rigours of the market place. Last week the minister received the response of the potato industry. For the first time ever growers, merchants, processors and retailers came up with a joint agreed proposal. That in itself is remarkable because in the past they have been poles apart. Growers, as represented by the NFU and the farmer members of the PMB, have called for the continuation of statutory control while the trade has consistently insisted on a totally free market. This new plan, which the Mrs Shephard is now considering, contains several key points. The first and most crucial is that statutory area control be partially relaxed. It proposes that the national quota area of potatoes should be set annually, as at present, by the joint consultative council, a subcommittee of the PMB containing a majority of users and consumers. But rather than setting a strictly controlled area for each farm, which must at present be observed if a grower is to avoid a fine for over-planting or risk losing some entitlement to grow potatoes if he under-plants, the plan proposes 5 per cent flexibility either way. The concept is based on experience in other potato growing countries where there are no statutory area controls. A study of fluctuations in acreage following profitable and unprofitable potato years in such countries has revealed that there is seldom more than 10 per cent difference in the area grown. It is therefore argued that 5 per cent either side of a target area would allow the potato market to operate while at the same time avoiding vast surpluses or shortages. Meanwhile the machinery of quotas would be maintained in case, in a few years' time, the EC were to decide that as for milk, sheep and sugar beet, Community quotas for potatoes were also necessary. Another fundamental aspect to the joint proposals is that producer funded intervention in the potato market be discontinued. In the past the PMB has had the right and the duty to buy surplus potatoes in years of oversupply and sell them at a considerable loss for feeding to livestock. The cash to fund this expensive operation has come, in recent years, from grower levies of some Pounds 85 a hectare. In the distant past the government also made a contribution. The new proposal suggests that, as with area quotas, the intervention legislation remains in place but that for the foreseeable future it is not used. This in turn would allow the area levy paid by growers to be halved with most of the reduced revenue being used for uncontroversial but important matters such as market promotion and technical research. The new levy would correspond closely with similar schemes in other EC countries and amount to about Pounds 1 for each tonne of potatoes grown. It is also proposed that the size of the board to run the new scheme should be drastically reduced. At present the PMB consists of 22 members. A few years ago there were 33. It is now proposed that the number be cut to a more workable eight. Surprisingly perhaps, this may be more difficult for some growers to swallow than the more fundamental proposals. For many farmers are wedded to the illusion of regional representation, even though the statutory duty of board members is to run the present marketing scheme efficiently. Representation is, and always has been, the job of the National Farmers' Union. Even so the fact that the plan is agreed by all parties involved should give it a head start. And the modest amount of production and price stability it should provide may help to maintain UK potato consumption at the top of the EC league. Advocates of the present board's activities have always claimed that this consumption record is directly related to the relatively stable prices paid for potatoes by UK consumers for many years. It is argued that price volatility cuts consumption, even in countries, like Holland, where potatoes are an even more important crop. The authors of the new plan are convinced that it will prove acceptable to Brussels; that the administrators there will recognise that it would lead to a less intrusive scheme than that currently operated by the PMB and that they may even sanction the adoption of something similar in other EC countries where volatility in potato markets is the rule rather than the exception. Given Mrs Shephard's recent pronouncements on the need to develop markets and to make it more attractive for UK consumers to buy more UK produced food, together with her encouragement for farmers to collaborate more with processors and retailers, there would appear to be no logical reason for her not to accept the proposals. It is rumoured that she will do just that very soon.</p>

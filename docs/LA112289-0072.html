			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PANEL OKS CURBS ON COLD BEER, WINE SALES AT 3 PACOIMA STORES  </P> <P> A Los Angeles City Council committee, told that Pacoima has become the  "drunk-driving capital of the city," voted Tuesday to impose strict rules on  three Pacoima liquor outlets, including a ban on selling cold beer and wine and  on the sale of single cans or small bottles.  </P> <P> The proposed rules were applauded by some community leaders who have been  fighting widespread drunkenness and resulting crime. But some local activists  said the rules were too harsh and would discourage other East San Fernando  Valley liquor sellers from voluntarily complying with anti-drunkenness  measures.  </P> <P> Before they become law, the new restrictions -- proposed by Councilman Ernani  Bernardi, who represents the area -- must be approved by the full council and  mayor.  </P> <P> City Zoning Administrator Jon Perica, who drafted the rules, said police  reports showed more than 750 drunk-driving arrests during the past 16 months  near the intersection of San Fernando Road and Van Nuys Boulevard, "making  Pacoima the drunk-driving capital of the city. No other area comes close."  </P> <P> Bernardi said that the three outlets chosen for the stricter regulations were  "the worst of the violators," but that others would be included in the  crackdown "if they don't clean up their act."  </P> <P> The targeted stores are Leon's Liquor, John's Liquor and Pacoima Food Market.  The restrictions would affect only the three because they were written as  amendments to the zoning permits the stores operate under.  </P> <P> Councilman Hal Bernson, who chairs the committee, said the bans on selling cold  liquor and liquor in small quantities are "aimed at discouraging the individual  from loitering outside after buying liquor or drinking it in his car."  </P> <P> In addition, the three outlets must promptly remove graffiti and remove all but  a single sign advertising liquor for sale. They also must stop selling alcohol  at 10 p.m. Sundays through Thursdays and at midnight Fridays and Saturdays,  instead of selling until 2 a.m. as state law permits.  </P> <P> Police Officer Sandy Jo MacArthur told the committee that liquor stores  elsewhere in the city "have had no problem sustaining a thriving business with  these conditions."  </P> <P> But attorney Josh Kaplan, representing John's Liquor, argued that requiring  customers to buy more than one can or bottle is "utter nonsense" and will  encourage rather than discourage liquor consumption.  </P> <P> Fred Taylor, who recently founded an activist group called the San Fernando  Valley Community Advisory Board, said that giving the rules the force of law  "will mean that we will no longer be able to get merchants to voluntarily  comply. Why should they go along if the city cracks down anyway?"  </P> <P> Taylor's group claims that 22 Pacoima merchants, including Leon's and John's,  are voluntarily following most of the same rules the city is moving to impose.  </P> <P> Bishop Milford Harvey of the San Fernando Valley Ministers Alliance said  banning the sale of cold beer and wine is "pointless . . . because 75% of the  trouble in our community is hard liquor, not beer and wine."  </P></p>

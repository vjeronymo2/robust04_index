			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "k.h.": "Use Intelligence Services"] </F>   [Text] Berlin -- Eckart Werthebach, president of the  Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV], has  come out in favor of using the intelligence services also to  combat organized crime. At an international expert conference  of the Friedrich-Ebert Foundation about the responsibilities of  police and intelligence services in the democratic rule-of-law  state, Werthebach said in the Berlin Reichstag that this  expansion of authority must be decided by politics. It would  preserve the separation of powers and the independence of police  and intelligence services. As the representative of the police,  Leopold Schuster, head of the Counternarcotic Department in the  Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA], objected to  Werthebach's statements. Expanding the tasks of the  intelligence services is not absolutely necessary, he said. In  addition, there are constitutional obstacles to it.    Werthebach justified his proposal by saying that the BfV has  experience in counterespionage and in keeping an eye on both  national and international underground terrorist movements. His  office is better equipped in terms of "means of surveillance"  than the police. The precondition for taking over the task of  combating crime is an increase in personnel as well as an  amendment to the Federal Constitutional Protection Law.  Werthebach sees potential work for the BfV in observing  organized crime structures that might exert influence over the  media. It is urgently necessary to harmonize the methods and  legal bases of intelligence services all over Europe. In  addition, in Germany there is no central interlocutor for the  European intelligence services. Werthebach said that currently  the most dangerous form of organized crime is the illegal  transport of radioactive substances from the CIS into West  Europe.    Schuster explained his rejection of BfV cooperation by  saying  that preinvestigations are usual in the police and not a  privilege of the intelligence services. Rather, in view of  about 7 million crimes in 1993, the BKA is forced to cope with  "considerable problems regarding resources." In order to  "comprehensively" combat organized crime, the BKA demands the  authority of a central body. According to Schuster, last year  there were 776 investigations of 10,000 individuals suspected of  involvement in organized crime.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Davos by Nitzan Horowitz] </F>   [Excerpt] A senior political source has estimated that it  would be difficult to attain practical agreements with Yasir  'Arafat without making significant progress in the negotiations  with Syria. According to the source, 'Arafat has been  maneuvering the talks on a daily basis in order to avoid  reaching a final agreement with Israel because his position as  talks coordinator gives him much more influence than he would  have once he assumes control over Gaza and Jericho, and the  problems this entails. The political source believes that once  Israel reaches a significant understanding with Syria, 'Arafat  would rush to conclude all the issues in dispute because he  understands that after the agreement with Syria is made,  agreements with Jordan and Lebanon will immediately follow, and  the PLO might find itself deserted and with no international  support.    Another senior Israeli source who participates in the  negotiations with the Palestinians also believes that Syria is  the key to progress on all tracks. He maintains that only an  agreement with Damascus will guarantee that the Rabin  government's peace policy will become an irreversible situation.  According to him, the government will not cross the "point of  no return," as long as the conflict between Israel and Syria  remains the same. This could lead to a situation in which, if a  right-wing government comes to power in Israel, it could pull  out of the peace process.    The foreign minister's entourage in Davos expressed  satisfaction in view of the various public opinion polls  published in Israel regarding a possible peace agreement with  Syria. The polls, conducted by YEDI'OT AHARONOT and MA'ARIV,  show a significant majority opposing a withdrawal on the Golan  Heights. Peres' men, however, claim that the polls were held  before any agreement on security arrangements has been made, and  before a public relations campaign explaining the advantages of  peace with Syria was held. The fact that more than 30 percent  support a full withdrawal and another 30 percent support a  partial withdrawal indicates that the government will not find  it hard to attain the support of a very large majority for the  agreement -- if and when a referendum is held on this subject.  Peres himself had stressed that holding a referendum is still  only an option.    Several officials in Davos have asked why Israel does not  start discussing the permanent arrangements with the  Palestinians and, instead engages in discussing border crossings  arrangements which, in any event, will only last for a short  period. The senior source said in response that the main reason  why Israel drafted the Oslo agreement as it is pertains to the  issue of Jerusalem.    According to the source, if Israel were to deal with the  permanent arrangements at this time, the talks would have  encountered serious difficulties over the Jerusalem issue.    The source stressed that, although the government enjoys the  support of the majority of the Israeli public, "there are issues  on which the majority is not sufficiently large, and it would  not be wise to turn large parts of the public against the  government."    The source used the same argument regarding the issue of  evacuating the isolated settlements of Netzarim and Kfar Darom  in the Gaza Strip. A government source who is not a Foreign  Ministry official stressed that although the issue in question  refers to several dozen families -- the defense of which would  entail the deploying a large number of IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] troops and controlling the roads in the very crowded  Gaza Strip -- Israel must show that it insists that the Oslo  agreement be fully honored. According to him, the agreement that  will be signed with the Palestinians is just the first in a  series of agreements which will be made in the near future, and  it is important to establish the principle that signed  agreements should not be reopened.    At the same time, sources in Davos expressed the possibility  that, after the parties sign the agreement on the transfer of  authorities, Israel may unilaterally decide to disband certain  settlements. The sources stressed that this decision will be  made by Israel alone, based on Israeli interests, and not in the  framework of the negotiations with the PLO. [passage omitted]</p>

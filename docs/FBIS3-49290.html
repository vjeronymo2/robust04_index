			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The international news conference by Madeleine  Albright and Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky ended a  few minutes ago. Our correspondent Istvan Szelloe reports:    [Szelloe] It is no longer a question for Hungary whether we  will enter NATO, the only question is when, Foreign Minister  Geza Jeszenszky stressed. Hungary welcomes the Partnership for  Peace cooperation, and we are of the view that it promotes  joining the Euro-Atlantic security system. Our foreign minister  added that relations between our country and NATO had been good  up to date. The fact that Hungary opened its airspace for AWACS  planes also proves it.    Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,  conveyed a message from President Clinton, according to which  Hungary's security is very important for the United States and  the Partnership for Peace cooperation can lay the foundation of  security. However, as John Shalikashvili pointed out, it does  not automatically mean [security]. It is NATO membership that  can give full security.    Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky added: There is virtually  no  difference of view in the most important issues between the  Visegrad countries.</p>

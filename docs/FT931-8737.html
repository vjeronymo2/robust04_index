			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / How Mr Pung makes gold pay 8%: Its high status in Cambodia is the result of two decades of war LIKE much conventional wisdom, the belief that gold never earns interest is wrong. You can earn as much as 8 per cent annually and add 80 grammes to each 1kg bar every year; but to achieve this, you have to take the gold to Phnom Penh and deposit it in a small Cambodian bank called Canadia Gold and Trust Corporation. Asked how he can pay 8 per cent interest on gold deposits, Mr Pung Kheav Se, the general manager, gives a banker's answer: he lends out the gold at 18 per cent. 'Gold,' he says, 'is accepted by everybody.' The unusually high status of gold as a medium of exchange in Cambodia is the result of more than two decades of war and financial chaos. Cambodians know that the riel, the local currency, has a tendency to plummet in value, and they remember that the guerrillas of the Khmer Rouge, who seized power in 1975, abolished money during their reign of terror. Mr Pung, a Cambodian of Chinese ethnic origin, was a businessman in Phnom Penh when the Khmer Rouge took over and force-marched the inhabitants of the capital into the countryside. After three years of working in the rice paddies and hiding his bourgeois origins, he took refuge in Thailand, eventually emigrating to Canada (hence the bank's name). Canadia Gold and Trust, a joint venture in which Mr Pung's family holds a 70 per cent stake and the central bank the remaining 30 per cent, was established in 1991. Mr Pung imports 25kg boxes of gold from Swiss Bank Corporation in Hong Kong, puts it through a mill and, with the authority of the central bank, issues gold bars in the traditional Cambodian weights. Jewellers in Phnom Penh's busy central market display the bars alongside the watches and gold necklaces worn as a form of security by a people unable to shake off the fear they may one day have to flee at a moment's notice. Gold, its price in dollars and in fast-devaluing riels set daily by a group of ethnic Chinese traders, is routinely used for the purchase of property in Cambodia and for transactions involving local products such as tobacco or beans, although it has lost out to the US dollar as a means of paying for imports. 'Cambodian property-owners don't worry about the US dollar,' says Mr Pung. 'They compare gold and riels. . . so they always think they are making money.' Mr Pung says Canadia has issued Dollars 80m (Pounds 56m) worth of gold since December 1991 (there was a surge in demand at the peak of the property boom last year), but the actual amount that has come into Cambodia is much greater. Hundreds of kilogrammes are flown in tax-free every month and smuggled into neighbouring Thailand and Vietnam to avoid import duties in those countries. Inside Cambodia, soldiers serving with the United Nations peacekeeping forces, particularly from the Indian sub-continent where there are curbs on gold imports, are as eager as the Cambodians to buy gold. Some of them have it made up into chunky bracelets so they can take it home unhindered. The overall effect of the UN presence, however, has been to undermine the gold market by flooding Phnom Penh with cash dollars; dollars are more liquid and more convenient to carry than gold, even if they are easier to counterfeit. When Mr Pung opened Canadia in 1991, half his business was in gold and half in dollars. Now dollars account for about 75 per cent of turnover, gold for 22 per cent and riels for 3 per cent. (Canadia pays a remarkably high 8.5 per cent interest on dollar deposits, lending dollars at a much higher rate to local property developers). But Cambodia's chronic instability, and the departure of most of the 22,000 UN soldiers and civilians after elections in May, may secure a place for gold in the country's domestic business dealings. 'The gold market will continue in the future unless the government issues a law not to allow the circulation of gold,' says Mr Pung. 'I don't think they will do that.'</p>

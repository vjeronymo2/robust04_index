			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Stronger exports lift Amcoal 33% An improved export performance helped Amcoal, the coal company in South Africa's Anglo American group, to report a 33 per cent increase in attributable earnings to R162.2m (USDollars 46.3m) for the six months to September, up from R121.8m last year, writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg. Although total sales of coal and coke dropped slightly to 22.51m tonnes from 22.85m tonnes due to lower domestic market sales to Eskom, the state electricity utility, turnover rose 12.3 per cent to R1.1bn from R944m. The dividend has been increased to 180 cents from 150 cents. However, a rise in exports on the strength of the weaker rand/dollar exchange rate, combined with successful containment of working costs, led to higher margins, and operating profit increased 33 per cent to R237.4m from R178.6m. Mr David Rankin, Amcoal chairman, said he expected earnings for the year to show a similar improvement to the first half due to improved prices. However, he warned that two derailments on the railway to Richards Bay, the port from which exports are shipped, have delayed certain shipments and will dent export earnings for the second half.</p>

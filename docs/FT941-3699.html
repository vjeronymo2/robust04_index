			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Christopher prepares way for renewing China's trade status Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, yesterday appeared to be preparing the ground for a recommendation that the administration should renew China's Most Favoured Nation trading status, saying the two sides had narrowed their differences on human rights. He sought to put the best gloss on two days of bruising talks with Chinese officials in Beijing. Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, was however less conciliatory, noting that there was still a wide gap between the US and China in their human rights 'concepts'. Mr Qian also warned that US business would be excluded from the vast Chinese market if the administration failed to renew the country's MFN status. Two-way trade exceeded Dollars 40bn last year. Mr Christopher, who has to advise President Bill Clinton within the next two months on whether to continue China's preferential trade access to the US, described his meeting yesterday with Mr Qian as 'businesslike and productive'. He was confident China wanted 'broad and solid' relations with the US. 'I find that the differences between China and the US are narrowing somewhat,' he told reporters before leaving Beijing for Vladivostok, where he met Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister. In Washington, however, President Clinton said he was disappointed with the Chinese talks. He would make a judgment on MFN 'at the appropriate time', he added. Mr Christopher was hard put to point to specific progress on the vexed human rights issue, beyond a memorandum of understanding on trade in prison labour products. He said there had been progress on emigration and political prisoners, with the Chinese side providing lists of 235 detainees, including 106 Tibetans. US human rights experts would be evaluating these cases. He had urged China to begin discussions with the Dalai Lama about 'cultural and religious matters' in Tibet. Tibetan activists allege widespread human rights abuses, including the destruction of traditional culture. The secretary of state's visit was marked by acrimonious exchanges with officials, and by harassment of dissidents, some of them 'exiled' from Beijing while Mr Christopher was in town. China and the US also marked the visit by agreeing to resume military consultations broken off after the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989.</p>

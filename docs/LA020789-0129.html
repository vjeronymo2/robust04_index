			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAR CRASH KILLS VICTORVILLE MAYOR, INJURES WIFE  </P> <P> Victorville Mayor Jeff Goodwill was killed and his wife critically injured in a  head-on collision with a driver attempting to pass a mini-van on a two-lane  desert highway, authorities said Monday.  </P> <P> California Highway Patrol Officer Robert Huizinga said no one was charged in  connection with the death Sunday of Goodwill, 41, but that an investigation was  continuing because the third vehicle continued on after the crash.  </P> <P> Goodwill's wife, Deborah K. Nagle-Goodwill, 37, who was driving a 1982  Volkswagen that collided with a 1978 Dodge van about 20 miles east of  Victorville, was flown by helicopter to San Bernardino County Medical Center  where she was listed in critical condition. The driver of the van that was  attempting to pass, Ben Owen, 66, of Lancaster, was listed in critical  condition at Victor Valley Community Hospital.  </P> <P> Goodwill, a lifelong resident of Victorville and principal of High Desert High  School, was elected mayor of the San Bernardino County community of 30,500  people last April.  </P> <P> "We are all in shock," said Victorville City Clerk Marian Nygaard. "All  meetings of the City Council, Planning Commission and advisory committees have  been canceled this week."  </P> <P> George Davis, superintendent of the Victor Valley Union High District, added:  "We are flying flags at half mast at each school in the district. Jeff was a  unique and deeply committed man who touched a lot of lives in this area."  </P> <P> The crash occurred at 4:30 p.m. Sunday on El Mirage Road when Owen's westbound  van tried to pass a mini-van driven by Gregory Fox, 37, of Palmdale, Huizinga  said.  </P> <P> "The Owen and Goodwill vehicles struck head-on," Huizinga said. "The vehicle  that was being passed continued on."  </P> <P> Huizinga said Fox acknowledged that he was driving the mini-van when the  accident occurred.  </P> <P> Attempts to reach Fox were unsuccessful.  </P></p>

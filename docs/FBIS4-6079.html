			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 17 KYODO -- A key ruling political  player indicated Sunday [17 April] the governing coalition will  not back former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) as new prime minister.    Komeito [Clean Government Party] Secretary General Yuichi  Ichikawa said in TV programs, "The coalition parties are making  efforts to establish a sense of unity over policies within the  current framework of the coalition. There will be no major  changes under the current situation."    Watanabe has expressed his readiness to leave the LDP to  challenge the premiership, but Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata,  head of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a core party in the  seven- party coalition, is emerging as a front-runner to succeed  outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    Hata returned home earlier Sunday from Morocco, where he  attended a ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade, to plunge himself into a race for prime  ministership.    Speaking to reporters upon arrival at Tokyo's Haneda  Airport,  Hata, however, was evasive in answering a question whether he  will enter into a race for premiership. "I have never said  whether or not I strengthened my resolution," the foreign  minister tersely said.    However, Ichikawa, one of the main strategists in the  coalition, welcomed Watanabe's move, saying the possible  secession of the head of one of the LDP's power blocs will  facilitate a split of the LDP, in power for 38 years until last  August when it was ousted by Hosokawa's coalition.    Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic  Party  (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ], said in a TV program Sunday the SDP  will not vote for Watanabe in the upcoming Diet premiership  election.    The official of the largest power bloc in the coalition was  responding to a question about the SDP's reaction if Watanabe  were to run for the premiership vote. Kubo, when asked about a  coalition candidate for the next prime minister, said the SDP  will respect a coalition agreement.    Ichikawa showed his willingness for a would-be tie-up with  an  LDP splinter group headed by Michihiko Kano, a former state  minister in charge of the Management and Coordination Agency.  He said he has no reason to reject cooperation with Kano's  group if Kano expresses his intention for a tie-up and if the  coalition is able to reach an accord on major policies with his  group.    Kano, who seceded from the LDP on Friday, indicated during a  TV program Sunday that his five-member group may support Hata  for the Diet premiership election, saying, "I have promoted  political reforms together with Mr. Hata and I have an  understanding of his political posture."    Hata, with his close associate Ichiro Ozawa, bolted the LDP  last summer and inaugurated Shinseito in order to form a  coalition with other non-LDP parties.    Kano said they will not vote for LDP President Yohei Kono as  they have withdrawn from the conservative party. Kono plans to  stand as a candidate for the nation's top administrative post.</p>

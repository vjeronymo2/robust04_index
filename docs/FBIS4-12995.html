			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpt] Russia has decided to renew its arms sales to  Syria, and the two countries will sign a large $500-million arms  deal in the near future. For the first time, Russia has  informed Israel in advance of its intention to sign a new arms  deal with Syria but did not specify the type of weapons covered  by the transaction or the timetable of the weapons' delivery.    Moscow recently informed Jerusalem of the expected deal  through diplomatic channels. According to the report, Russia  has agreed to reschedule Damascus' $7-billion debt to the former  Soviet Union, which was given as credit to finance previous arms  purchases. After Syria makes the first payment of $2 billion to  Russia, the two countries will sign a new arms deal.    Until now, Syria's huge debts were an obstacle to relations  between Damascus and Moscow. For a long time the Syrians  refused to discuss returning the money, claiming that Russia was  not the sole heir to the former Soviet Union. Syrian President  Hafiz al-Asad has recently recognized Russia as the sole  creditor for outstanding debts and agreed to discuss resolving  the problem.    In their message to Jerusalem, the Russians asserted that  Moscow was still playing a marginal role in superpower arm sales  to the Middle East, especially in comparison to the United  States. The Russians also noted that Israel was selling weapons  to the former Soviet republics bordering on Russia, such as  Estonia, much to the displeasure of Moscow, which fears that  these weapons may in future be turned against the Russian Army  or Russian minorities in the republic.    According to reports which recently reached Israel from  other  sources, Syria is deliberately putting off its arms purchases  from Russia in order to pressure Moscow to write off most of  Syria's debt and settle for one payment of $2 billion.  According to these reports, the Syrians hope that the economic  crisis in Russia will force Moscow to write off their debt in  order to supply work to the Russian arms industries.    It was recently reported that Syria seeks to purchase  sophisticated SA-10 anti-aircraft missiles and new fighter jets  from Russia.    Officials in Jerusalem have still not decided how to react  to  the reports on the new arms deal between Syria and Russia.  Senior political sources yesterday said that Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin may discuss the Russian arms sales to the Middle  East when he visits Moscow at the end of the month and meets  Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev.    Relations between Syria and the United States have become  tense over recent weeks. Christopher Ross, the American  ambassador to Syria, held an especially tough meeting, focusing  on the continuing terrorist attacks in Lebanon, with Syrian  Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'.    Information reaching Jerusalem indicates that the tension in  U.S.-Syrian relations was the main reason for al-Asad's trip to  Egypt last week to meet Egyptian President Husni Mubarak.  Al-Asad expressed his deep disappointment with U.S. promises to  improve relations with Syria, especially with regard to removing  Syria from the list of countries sponsoring terrorism and the  drug trade. The Administration recently decided to leave Syria  on "the drug list" despite an earlier promise to remove the  Syrians from the list. [passage omitted]</p>

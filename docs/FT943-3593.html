			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Swire buys holding in Carlsberg HK brewery Swire Pacific, the Hong Kong conglomerate, has acquired a 39.2 per cent stake in Carlsberg Brewery Hong Kong, formerly a joint venture between Carlsberg, the Danish brewery group, and the East Asiatic Company, the Danish-based trading group with interests in the Asia-Pacific region. The Hong Kong brewer has also signed a memorandum of understanding to acquire a 99 per cent share in Huizhou Brewing Company, in China's Guangdong province. 'The new agreements, and not least the co-operation with the Swire Group, will contribute to our prospects of continued growth, especially in China,' said Mr Poul Svanholm, Carlsberg's chief executive. 'The China potential is considerable, but it is also a very demanding task which initially requires quite substantial investments, inter alia in marketing and distribution. Satisfactory levels of profitability can hardly be expected in the immediate future,' he added. The East Asiatic Company, which is restructuring after suffering heavy losses in recent years, will reduce its half share in the Hong Kong brewery to 20 per cent, with Carlsberg owning 40.8 per cent and Swire 39.2 per cent. The financial details of this deal and the acquisition of Huizhou Brewery were not released. The Carlsberg parent has turnover of about DKr16bn (Dollars 250m) and beer sales total about 27m hectolitres, of which 22m are sold outside Denmark. Production by the Hong Kong brewery is about 48m litres, sold mainly in Hong Kong and Singapore, with Carlsberg claiming an 18 per cent share of both these markets. The Huizhou Brewery, which was founded by the Australian Bond Group and has been bought from Tomson Group, listed in Hong Kong, has production capacity of about 60m litres.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jerusalem, 20 Apr (EFE) -- Antonio Erman Gonzalez --  Justicialist Party deputy and former Argentine defense minister  -- said on 20 April that Argentina and Israel may cooperate in  the reconversion of modern military technology, including car  manufacturing.    Asked about the visit he made to Israeli military industries  this week, Gonzalez said in a news conference: "We will  undertake feasibility studies to apply military technology to  civilian life."    Gonzalez, who is making a seven-day official visit to  Israel,  arrived here on 17 April accompanied by Justicialist Party  Deputy Ana Raquel de Kessler, who was the No. 2 person in the  defense portfolio. Gonzalez categorically denied they were  interested in the purchase of weapons from Israel.    He stated that the longstanding border disputes between  Argentina and its neighbors are on the verge of being settled,  "and from a hypothesis of conflict we have now come to a  hypothesis of cooperation."    The Argentine deputies invited General Dan Shomron [name as  received], the director of Israeli Military Industry (IMI), to  visit Argentina, where the government has not yet privatized  small-scale military hardware manufacturing companies, which may  be recycled with Israeli technology into mixed corporations.    Commenting on the possibility of manufacturing car  components, Gonzalez stated: "The proposal to establish mixed  corporations has been well received."    He added that Argentine car manufacturing companies  currently  turn out 350,000 cars annually and this requires a comparable  expansion of accessory industries.    Israeli military industries have been forced to lay off  thousands of engineers and workers on account of the world  crisis. It has had experience in adapting military technology  to civilian uses in East Europe.    After visits to Aeronautic Industries and the IMI, "we  agreed  to exchange information on an ongoing basis about operational  manufacturing companies in both countries. Personal knowledge  will come in a third stage," he said.    Gonzalez noted: "Israel is neither an underdeveloped country  nor is it counted as a highly industrial one; therefore, it can  understand better than others our need for investments and  technology transfer."    In response to a question of whether richer countries will  transfer their leading-edge technology to less-developed  countries, Kessler asserted that "major countries will have to  do so and will charge for that, but it is what they will be able  to sell in the next century."    Kessler, who sits on the Defense Committee with Gonzalez,  noted that "Israel is in an excellent condition to do so and  forestall other countries in this area."    She added that Argentina also may benefit from its economic  relations with Israel since through these mixed corporations it  will have access to the EU, of which Israel is an associate  member, and the United States, with which Israel enjoys free  trade.    Gonzalez reported that today, he and Bank of Israel Governor  Ya'aqov Frenkel analyzed the influence of major economic blocs  and the danger of their adopting a protectionist policy to the  detriment of others.    The Argentine deputies also learned about Israeli labor  legislation and the working of Parliament. Tomorrow, they will  sign a cooperation agreement with Ben Gurion University --  located in Be'er Sheva,' capital of the Negev desert -- on  research and exploitation of arid areas in Argentina's central  and northwestern regions.</p>

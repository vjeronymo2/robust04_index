			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Trans World accepts Emap offer Trans World Communications, the Preston-based local radio group, yesterday advised shareholders to accept the Pounds 71m bid from Emap, the media concern. Directors, who had led a fierce battle to maintain USM-quoted Trans World's independence, grudgingly admitted defeat in the wake of the High Court ruling last week that the decision by the Radio Authority, the industry regulator, to sanction the deal should be upheld. The ruling, which could spark a widespread rationalisation of the commercial radio industry, appeared to expose a loophole in the 1990 Broadcasting Act. By acquiring Trans World, Emap will hoist its radio licenses from three to eight - two more than present regulations permit. It plans to set up a joint venture with Schroders, its merchant bankers, to allow two of the licences to be 'warehoused'. Trans World yesterday warned shareholders that they may be left with a limited market for their shares if they did not accept Emap's final offer of 181p per share. Directors reiterated, however, that in their view, the offer 'represents an inadequate premium for control' and failed to show a 'full reflection of improving performance and prospects'. To illustrate the latter point, Trans World's results for the six months to June 30 were also released yesterday, showing pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.29m, against Pounds 254,000 last time. Turnover jumped 30 per cent to Pounds 7.43m (Pounds 5.71m), including a near-50 per cent leap in national airtime advertising sales. Earnings per share improved from 0.5p to 2.3p but 'in view of the offer' the interim dividend is omitted (0.3p). Emap shares rose 7p to 430p; Trans World's dipped 1p to 179p.</p>

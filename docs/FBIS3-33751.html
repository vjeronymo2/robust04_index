			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has said that some  progress was made in the Davos talks, but no agreement has yet  been reached between Israel and the PLO. Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres said last night that Israel and the PLO have  overcome two or three of the toughest issues in the  negotiations. The prime minister was speaking in a conference  call with the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish  Organizations, while the foreign minister also spoke in a  conference call, but with Israeli journalists in Washington.  Arye Golan reports from Washington:    [Begin recording] [Golan] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres  will start a two-day visit to Washington this afternoon. The  main event on the first day is a meeting with Secretary of State  Warren Christopher to update him on the talks with 'Arafat in  Davos. In a conference call from Florida, where he started his  U.S. visit, Peres refused to detail the solutions worked out in  Davos.    [Peres] We agreed on the contents, but we have not yet  reached agreement on the wording. I did not want to draft it  hastily or without holding consultations at home, because  telephone consultations have their limitations. Since each word  is important, I came to the conclusion that before we add our  signature, it would be best to wait several days until I have  the opportunity to speak with the prime minister and others  involved in the talks. This requires a lot of time and  patience, but I remain firm in my belief that we can reach a  full agreement, although under no circumstances am I ready to  say how long it will take.    [Golan] Both Prime Minister Rabin, in his conference call  with the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish  Organizations, and Foreign Minister Peres stress that the  government will make sure that Israel remains responsible for  overall security and that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will  protect the settlements. Both promise the government will not  compromise on security.    [Peres] We have not compromised and will not compromise on  security matters, and we must be extremely careful in wording  any agreement on security. As I have already said, I prefer to  go over the draft word by word, because we have reviewed many  drafts during the negotiating process. I would like the final  draft to be acceptable to my colleagues, the prime minister in  particular.    [Golan] Before Peres leaves the United States to continue  the negotiations with 'Arafat in Cairo, he will confer here with  Senate and House leaders, and tomorrow he will meet with Vice  President Al Gore and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake.

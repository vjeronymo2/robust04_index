			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Brokers' secret weapon is a wrap - The appeal in the US of these accounts IN Wall Street's drive to discover new ways to make money from retail stockbroking, the wrap account has become an important weapon. Yet this hottest new product in the money management business has itself recently come under fire with critics arguing that the wrap account gives investors little in return for their money. The concept is not particularly new - early versions date back a decade or more - but it is only in the past year or so that the product has really taken off with individual investors. Normally, broking houses charge customers for a variety of separate services like investment advice, order execution, custody and clearing - charges that fluctuate depending on how often the customer trades in the market. With a wrap account, the broker hands over the responsibility of managing the customer's assets to an approved professional money manager, and in return the customer pays the broker a flat fee (based on a percentage of the assets under management) for finding the money manager and servicing the account. For the investor, the wrap account has a two-pronged appeal. First, it puts a cap on broking costs. Investors prefer paying a flat fee because it prevents stockbroking firms from promoting high-commission products or indulging in 'churning' - the unnecessary trading of stocks in a customer account just to boost revenues. The second selling point is that investors with Dollars 50,000 to Dollars 100,000 in their brokerage accounts can get access to professional money managers who normally handle individual's accounts valued in their millions. In a country where the best investment managers are treated like superstars, this is a strong draw for private investors. To the money manager, wrap accounts not only bring in extra business, but it is business that requires no marketing or servicing effort. All the manager has to do is make the investment decisions. Stockbrokers, meanwhile, love wrap accounts. They are an especially lucrative product. The standard fee is usually between 2 per cent and 3 per cent of the assets held in the account. In comparison, investors pay 1 per cent or less for investment funds, and brokers' commission charges for trading stocks in an averagely busy account are even less. The wrap account also attracts the type of investor brokers love - the conservative client who is more likely to stay with the broking firm, who is likely to be less active in trading the market (thus keeping brokers' execution costs down), and who may end up allowing the broker to handle all of his financial assets. This is the great prize brokers hope the wrap account will help them win. As the US savings rate rises, Wall Street is competing hard with banks and insurance companies to attract the billions of new investment dollars. Yet stockbrokers are not the only financial companies to discover the allure of wrap accounts. Banks like Chase Manhattan, insurers like Equitable and giant fund groups like Fidelity are also now offering versions of the wrap account to customers. It is difficult to get hold of statistics to show how fast they have grown, although industry experts estimate that about Dollars 30bn is currently held in wrap accounts. Shearson Lehman is the leader in the field, and has 60,000 clients in wrap accounts with total assets of Dollars 13bn. Moreover, they are currently selling like hot cakes. A few weeks ago an executive at the firm said that Shearson was selling wrap accounts at the rate of Dollars 7,000m a month. Despite its popularity with investors, the wrap account has its critics in the investment community. The common complaint is that the 3 per cent annual fee is far too high, and that investors get little in return for their money that they cannot get cheaper elsewhere. Brokers say investors get access to the investment expertise of top-level money managers. Yet money in a big US investment fund is in the hands of equally experienced professionals, and the average expense ratio on mutual funds is 1 per cent of total assets. Contrary to what some investors may think, their wrap account does not entitle them to particular individual attention from the money manager. Mr John Gepfert, an investment consultant with the Randolph Group in Connecticut, believes the small fee that the money manager receives (usually around 0.5 per cent of the assets), makes it improbable that he or she will devote a great deal of time to the account. 'You can't be available to a Dollars 100,000 client who is paying you only 50 basis points a year,' says Mr Gepfert. There are also concerns about disclosure (how much do investors know about who is managing their money, where it is being invested, and how the fee is split between broker and manager?), about potential conflicts of interest between broker and manager, and about the quality of managers recommended by brokers. There are 17,000 registered investment advisers in the US, and any one of them could manage a wrap account. In their defence, brokers say they only choose the best to put before customers. Industry concern about wrap accounts has been sufficient to attract the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission. At the behest of the investment community, the SEC has been looking into wrap accounts for about a year. Although it has no current plans to take any action, industry insiders believe the least the SEC will want to do is improve the level of disclosure to wrap account holders.</p>

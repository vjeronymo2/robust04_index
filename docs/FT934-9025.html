			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Arts: Car designed by nature 'We say that the world's magnificence has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty of speed. A racing car whose hood is adorned with great pipes, like serpents of explosive breath - a roaring car that seems to ride on grapeshot  -is far more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace,' Marinetti's Futurist Manifesto proclaimed in 1909. Racing cars may have long lost their serpents of explosive breath but, as Design for Speed: Three Automobiles by Ferrari at the Museum of Modern Art in New York also illustrates, the pursuit of maximum speed and performance has forged its own aesthetic. This is the first automobile show at MOMA for 15 years and the first to focus on the process of design. Curator Christopher Mount had long nurtured the idea of staging an exhibition around a Formula 1 racer and his show considers the evolution of the red Ferrari Formula 1 and its relationship to the firm's road cars. Enzo Ferrari built his first sports car in 1950 to finance his racing career. Ferrari remains the only manufacturer to produce cars for both track and road, and to build both engine and chassis. MOMA's escalator deposits the visitor before the surprisingly smooth and sculptural but oddly silent 641 that Ferrari has given to the museum. This is the 1990 car in which Alain Prost won four Grand Prix titles and Ferrari claimed its 100th championship. Appropriately for a museum of modern art, such a Formula 1 racing car is arguably the most triumphant exemplar of the Modernist ideal of form following function. The beauty it possesses is due to its purity of purpose: to transport a single human being around a track as quickly as safely possible. Its shape is determined by the laws of aerodynamics; it is virtually designed by nature. Every feature is geared towards holding the road at speeds in excess of 200mph. Nothing is superfluous. To emphasise the point, we find a computer-generated profile of the racer - a minor piece of Op Art in its own right - and a scale model used in the wind tunnel to work on aerodynamic detail. It seems, most unfairly, that British designer John Barnard had only to provide a skin with which to cloth a pre-ordained anatomy of cockpit, gearbox and engine. The latter, with its matt-black cast-iron and curling pipes of gleaming, patinated aluminium, is one of the most pleasing objects in the show. Ferrari's first production car, represented here by a 166MM of 1950 with a Barchetta or little boat body, was both racer and road car. Its fluid curves and elegant streamlining speak of the 1950s aesthetic of speed. This is pure sculpture. Its form is determined not by the effects of wind, drag or downforce but by the desire to create an object of beauty. Like bronze sculpture, the steel shell was even hammered into shape by workmen. As a result, no two cars are the same. As befits this more innocent age, design drawings are executed in childrens' coloured pencils. Federico Formenti's design for the spyder version in 1948 endearingly includes a driver drawn to scale sporting helmet and goggles. Racing and road car design were soon to take divergent paths. The F40 here was made to celebrate Ferrari's 40th year, one of a limited edition of 1,000. When the F40 made its debut a year before Enzo Ferrari's death in 1988, it was said to be the fastest road car available. Once again, Ferrari had brought to the production car a technical standard of performance only usually found in a racing car. Unsurprisingly, the F40 looks just like one. Given the dependence of their design on our understanding of physical laws, Formula 1 racers inevitably look very much alike. There is no comparable conformity of design for high performance passenger sports cars. Optimal performance is compromised by considerations of space, comfort and the ability to travel at low speeds. In this market, styling is crucial. Virtues are made out of necessities. The F40's most distinctive feature  - the 13 scooped-out triangular air vents that cool the powerful turbo-charged engine - are purely functional. In its overall design the F40 bears the unmistakable imprint of the 1980s with its tight-waisted, lipstick-glossy body, awkward elbows and aggressive angles. There is no doubt that this is a flashy and mean machine. As guests at the private view cooed over the soft curves, leather lining and glinting marine tints of the Barchetta, the American Modernist architect Philip Johnson, admiring the F40, assured me that 'in 40 years time, this is the car that everyone will prefer'. Designed for Speed, made possible by a grant from Ferrari SpA, continues at The Museum of Modern Art in New York until March 1 1994.</p>

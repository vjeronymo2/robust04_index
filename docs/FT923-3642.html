			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Mandela agrees to talks with de Klerk on political violence THE African National Congress last night pulled back from the brink of confrontation with the South African government by agreeing that Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, should accept Pretoria's invitation to meet President FW de Klerk to address the question of political violence. The decision to hold talks with the government over violence which earlier this week claimed the lives of more than 20 people in the Ciskei black homeland represents a victory for the moderate faction of the ANC, which is committed to negotiating a new constitution for South Africa. It was an important move to defuse one of the country's most serious political crises since Mr de Klerk launched his political reform programme in 1990. During a two-day meeting of the policymaking national working committee of the ANC, which ended last night, powerful voices within the organisation's leadership were raised in favour of halting negotiations altogether, and pursuing mass protest actions to weaken the government. However, leading moderates won the day, arguing that Mr Mandela should meet Mr de Klerk, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. These included the release of remaining political prisoners, the banning of dangerous weapons in public and action to reduce violence emanating from hostels in black townships. Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC secretary-general, said he was ready to meet Mr Roelf Meyer, the minister of constitutional development, as early as today to prepare for a summit between the ANC and National party leaders. He said ANC leaders would welcome a visit from a UN representative to mediate in the crisis - a move proposed earlier in the day by Mr Pik Botha, foreign minister.</p>

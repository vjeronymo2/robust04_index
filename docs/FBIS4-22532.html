			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [AzerTadzh Report: "How Will We Earn and Spend Foreign </F> Currency"]    [Text] The Ministry of Economics of Azerbaijan has for the  first time prepared and submitted for the consideration of the  Cabinet of Ministers a prognosis of the republic's foreign trade  turnover and also a draft of the country's foreign exchange  balance sheet for 1994.    As an AzerTadzh correspondent was told by the chief of the  consolidated department of general economic and structural  policy of the Ministry of Economics, Oktay Akhverdiyev, the  overall volume of foreign trade turnover this year, according to  the prognosis, should be $727 million, which is $297 million  more than last year. Revenues from exporting goods and services,  whose volume will reach $395 million, will increase by $160  million mainly because of the elimination of barter  transactions. As before, the greatest share of it will be made  up of petroleum products (almost 40 percent) and cotton (28  percent).    Iran and Turkey are still the largest exporters of  Azerbaijan's products. It is from these countries that most of  the goods that can safely be called "food" are exported.  Practically all the funds allotted for it, and they amount to  approximately $300 million, will go to purchase food products:  55 percent of the imports will be grain, flour, and raw material  for manufactured concentrated feeds, 33 percent--meat and  butter, and the rest--children's food, dairy products, and other  products. At the same time it should be noted that it was  possible to plan on this volume of imports as a result of  special-purpose credit from the European Council, Turkey, and  China, the overall sum of which will be $161 million.    The volume of foreign trade turnover is taken into account  in  the draft of the foreign exchange balance sheet. The revenue  part of it, according to the draft, will be $700 million and  will be formed from foreign exchange revenues from export  operations ($301 million), foreign credit ($161 million), and  also conversion of currencies of CIS countries, customs duties  and fees, and other sources.    The republic will spend less foreign exchange--about $670  million, $410 million of which will be used for the needs of the  national economy, including the aforementioned food imports, and  also the purchase of medications, wheelchairs for disabled  persons, and Ikarus passenger buses for Baku, and for solving  problems of the railroad and the food and other branches of  industry. Some of the foreign exchange funds are to be used for  servicing Azerbaijan's foreign debt.    But still, in the words of O. Akhverdiyev, the foreign  exchange balance sheet was drawn up taking into account the  economic situation in the republic and its maximum capabilities,  but not the real needs of the national economy, which amount to  approximately $1 billion.</p>

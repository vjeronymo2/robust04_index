			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Foreign Ministry sources yesterday reported that  Chile does not consider the Lima Convention lost, and hopes that  Peru will abide by the original terms and continue to negotiate.  The objective of these negotiations is to conclude a  supplemental agreement on some aspects of the convention and a  protocol for the peaceful settlement of possible controversies.    The sources said that resigning its aspiration to be granted  the use of an esplanade -- which joins Sector 7 of the northern  dock and the terminal of the railway to Tacna, on the bay of  Arica -- will be considered a clear gesture that Lima has the  political will to resolve the "impasse."    This would be especially significant because the request --  which was made at the last moment -- is regarded as a maneuver  by some Peruvian sectors to cause the failure of the two  governments' efforts to resolve the pending issues of the 1929  Treaty.    Under such circumstances, the announcement that President  Alberto Fujimori will visit Santiago for the presidential  changeover becomes even more significant. The Foreign Ministry  has received a very favorable reaction to this announcement.    Foreign Minister Enrique Silva Cimma yesterday met with  Peruvian Ambassador Alfonso Rivero, with whom the issue was  addressed for more than one hour at the minister's office.    After the meeting, Rivero made no comment and Silva Cimma  said only that the dialogue was positive and that he remains  optimistic that Congress will approve the Lima Convention.    The minister thus sought to minimize reports on the  suspension of the bilateral talks that were being held to  clarify some points of the Lima Convention. The talks were  stalemated because Peru requested, at the last moment,  exchanging the compensation that Chile promised to pay for the  land used in "El Chinchorro" without the owner's permission, for  the use of the esplanade.    Ministry sources said that rather than a legal-diplomatic  problem between Chile and Peru, a domestic Peruvian political  problem was the result.    Some people maintain that the situation entails a problem of  nationalism because Fujimori, Democratic Constituent Congress  (CCD) President Jaime Yoshiyama, and Victor Joy Way, the CCD  Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, are all third-generation  Peruvians -- the first two are of Japanese and the third of  Chinese descent. Consequently, strong nationalist sectors  believe the fact that they are willing to approve agreements  with Chile shows ignorance of Peruvian historical roots.    Some sources have said that another noteworthy fact is that  President Fujimori is not at his political best at the moment.  His meager victory at the constitutional referendum did not  help him to insist on the approval of the Lima convention by the  CCD. This year he will confront elections within Congress and  he will have to decide whether to run for reelection in 1995.    Observers believe that Peruvian Government opposition forces  are using the issue of the resolution of historical  disagreements with Chile as an easy weapon against Fujimori.  Because this criticism does not touch in-depth matters, it can  be concluded that the opposition is not willing to give Fujimori  the opportunity to boast that he managed to end the pending  points of the 1929 Treaty.    The Chilean negotiators' refusal to give Peru an unbroken  territory in Arica was positively regarded by Carlos Valcarce,  RN [National Renewal] deputy for Arica. He said there cannot be  any exchange.    For 64 years, Chile and Peru could not agree on how to  implement the terms of Article 5 of the 1929 Treaty, involving  different interpretations given to the assertion that Chile will  build a dock, a customs office, and a terminal on the railroad  to Tacna "for the use" of Peru.    On 11 May 1993, the two governments signed the so-called  Lima  Convention, in which Peru expressed its approval of these  facilities that were built in Arica, and the two countries  established the legal framework in which they will work.    This agreement, a free transit convention, and four exchange  notes concluded the pending issues of the 1929 Treaty.    Under the terms of the Lima Convention, Chile grants Peru --  permanently -- the use of the northern side of the dock, which  is to the north of the bay of Arica, the customs office built  there, and the railroad terminal on the line to Tacna.    The convention rules that ownership of the facilities shall  be registered with Arica's Real Estate Registry as Chilean state  property, yet noting the right to use it permanently.    Peru will authorize a private company to operate the  facilities. This will be a corporation based on Peruvian capital.    In an exchange note, Chile promised to make a monetary  compensation to Peru in lieu of the "El Chinchorro" areas that  were used without the owner's consent. "El Chinchorro" is a  145,500 square meter area owned by Peru and located north of  Arica.    These agreements were negotiated on bases proposed by then  Peruvian Foreign Minister Augusto Blacker Miller and were  endorsed by his successor Oscar de la Puente. Among the  proposals was Blacker Miller's novel formula to grant the  operation of the facilities to a private enterprise, without  touching "El Chinchorro," a highly sensitive issue for Peru, or  splitting Arica's territorial continuity, which Chile will not  allow.    The Lima Convention should have been rapidly approved by  Congress, but the opposition to Fujimori and traditionalist and  regionalist Peruvian sectors protested. The strongest voice was  that of United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de  Cuellar, who said that the convention can be improved.    Some experts believe the problem emerged because the Chilean  Government stated that all agreements can be improved, and by  the decision to reach an agreement to "clarify, specify, and  supplement" the Lima Convention.    After making clear that the Lima Convention would not be  modified, Chile made concessions to Peru seeking to help  Fujimori present such a historical understanding. The Peruvian  side -- without explanation and disrespecting the basis of the  negotiation -- asked for the use of the esplanade, which gave  rise to the problem of breaking Arica's territorial continuity.    It should be recalled that the efforts made in the  mid-1980's  to settle the pending issues of the 1929 Treaty did not yield  any results precisely because the Act of Lima provided for the  use of the esplanade by Peru, a matter that was categorically  rejected by Chile. Peru's promise to sell "El Chinchorro" was  as strongly rejected in the neighboring country. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS  </P> <P> Travelers were enraged this week after learning of a new (old, actually) state  tax law pertaining to goods bought in foreign countries. Although on the books  since 1935, the law allowing billing became enforceable following the  automation of U.S. Customs files. And while the tax amounts to peanuts (6.5%),  it is proving irksome.  </P> <P> Californians complain that it comes as a surprise addition to duty (10%)  already imposed by the federal government. Thus far only a handful of  Californians have been billed. Still, the numbers promise to increase as  residents make their 1990 Customs declarations. Customs requires the  declaration when merchandise exceeds $400 ($800 in the case of Guam, American  Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands). One state official suggested that travelers  who failed to declare their 1989 purchases come forth voluntarily and pay up.  To which a returning resident declared, "You must think we're crazy!"  </P> <P> French/American Affair: France is launching a new campaign to lure Americans to  the provinces. Direct flights from the United States to 10 hubs besides Paris:  Nice, Lyon, Lille, Mulhouse, Strasbourg, Nantes, Bordeaux, Toulouse,  Montpellier, Marseille. Inside France, Air Inter (the nation's domestic  airline) has stepped up service on 50 routes. At the same time, the 300-m.p.h.  TGV Atlantique (world's fastest train) has begun service from Paris to Rennes,  Nantes and beyond to "land's end" in the Finistere.  </P> <P> A new 72-page guide (available from travel agents and the French Government  Tourist Office, 9454 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 303, Beverly Hills 90212) provides  sightseeing tips, detailed itineraries. The "France Discovery Guide" can also  be ordered by dialing a new 50-cents-a-minute hot line: (900) 420-2003. Hours:  6 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, beginning Feb. 1. This same office  will answer questions on transportation, tour packages, skiing, hotels, special  events, restaurants, car rentals, weather. Replies to all queries.  </P> <P> Heart's Hideaway: This question from Mrs. Dorothy McKay of Ventura: "What is  the name of the resort with the villas you've written about in Palm Springs,  with the push-button fireplaces and private swimming pools?" (Says she's  considering this as a valentine destination for herself and her husband.)  </P> <P> It's La Mancha Club &amp; Villas. (High on the list of romantic hideaways in  the Coachella Valley, along with Ingleside Inn and Villa Royale Inn.) On  Valentine's Day, La Mancha will present red roses to the ladies plus other  surprises. A strolling violinist will crank out love ballads.

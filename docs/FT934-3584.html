			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Lonrho drops Lockerbie film: Board persuaded not to co-fund controversial documentary Lonrho, the international conglomerate, has withdrawn financial backing from a controversial film about the Lockerbie bombing, which it is co-financing with Libya. Mr Stephen Walls and Mr Peter Harper, two of Lonrho's newly-appointed non-executives, persuaded the Lonrho board to end its involvement in the film. They are also expected to press for Lonrho to withdraw from further co-operation with Libya, which owns a third of Lonrho's Metropole Hotels subsidiary. Mr Dieter Bock, the German joint chief executive, was also keen to abandon the film project, which had been started on the initiative of Mr Tiny Rowland, his fellow joint chief executive. However, Mr Allan Francovich, the film's producer, said yesterday he had not been informed by Lonrho of its withdrawal of a Pounds 633,000 contribution to the film. He added: 'I am not going to be stopped (from completing the film) by anyone'. He said he had insisted there should be no interference from Libya or Lonrho in the content of the film and that he had uncovered new evidence about who carried out the 1988 bombing, which resulted in 270 deaths. The United Nations recently froze Libyan assets held abroad to increase pressure on it to hand over for trial in the west suspects accused of blowing up the Pan Am airliner. Mr Rowland, however, yesterday said he and Mr Bock were 'at one' on the Libyan issue. While the board had decided to stop the financing of the film 'for the time being', he said that work already completed was of commercial value to Lonrho. He recently said that Lonrho was ready to complete deals worth hundreds of millions of pounds with Libya if the documentary film showed it to be innocent of the Lockerbie bombing. Mr Rowland is now satisfied that the Libyans were not involved in the bombing. 'There was no sign of their involvement at all. If there had been any evidence . . . we would have handed it over to the British government,' he said.</p>

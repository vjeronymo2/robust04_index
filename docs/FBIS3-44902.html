The time for Major's second trip to Washington since last  February has not been set, the spokesman said.    However, Major will hold informal talks with Clinton during  the summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in  Brussels to be held on January 10-11, the spokesman added.  There, Major will also meet with French Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur and Italian Prime Minister Carlo Ciampi.    The spokesman said the NATO leaders will make important  decisions, which will guide NATO's future policy, on:    How to develop its relations with Russia, Ukraine and  countries of Central and Eastern Europe;    How to adapt itself in both political and military spheres  to  be better able to perform peacekeeping and other peace-support  missions;    And how to accommodate a European defense policy with a  continuing, viable and "to us extremely important" Transatlantic  alliance.</p>

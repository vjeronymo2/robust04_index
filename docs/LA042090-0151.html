			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LARSON WILL HEAD CSUN CENTER FOR DEAF  </P> <P> Herbert Larson has been named permanent director of the National Center on  Deafness at Cal State Northridge, it was announced Thursday.  </P> <P> Larson was appointed acting director in mid-March after the center's former  director, Victor H. Galloway, was asked to resign amid complaints of mismanaged  funds.  </P> <P> The center provides interpreting and note-taking services for deaf students who  attend regular CSUN classes. Larson formerly was administrator of support  services at the center.  </P> <P> An audit of the center's budget conducted at the end of March found that  Galloway had spent nearly all of the budget for the 1989-90 school year by the  third month of the second semester. Campus administrators cut travel, hiring  and student worker funding for the remainder of the year and agreed to provide  additional money to continue interpreting services through June.  </P> <P> A review of the center's programs -- including an analysis of whether it would  be more efficient to fold it into the School of Education -- is expected to be  completed in the fall.  </P></p>

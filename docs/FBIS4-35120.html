			<p>BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo, 28 Jun (AE) -- This morning on Radio Nova  Eldorado AM, Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero said that the  minimum salary hike from $64 to $70 per month will not provoke a  budget imbalance. Ricupero said Social Action Minister Sergio  Cutolo participated in drafting the proposal and that the  additional cost will not affect the Treasury.    Ricupero said the increase will be covered by rethinking  some  benefits, by eliminating the payment of irregular benefits, and  by fighting fraud. He reaffirmed that the economic team will  continue to balance public accounts because the stabilization  plan is based on fiscal adjustment.    Ricupero advocates the use of regional minimum salaries. He  said this will help solve the problem facing poor municipal  districts that are unable to pay high minimum salaries.  Ricupero thus answered a question about the effects on state  and municipal governments of increasing the minimum salary to  $70. He reiterated that the main stumbling block for increasing  the minimum salary is the public sector because most private  companies are already paying more than the established minimum.    Ricupero said the stabilization plan seeks to lay the  groundwork for "reasonable" interest rates following the  implementation of the real. He said, however, that if there is  speculation on commodities and prices during the transition  period, a "firm" control on the issuance of new currency will be  used to provoke a shortage of cash. Ricupero added that interest  rates would therefore rise and force those who speculate with  their products to sell them to obtain cash. He added that care  will be taken to ensure interest rates do not become excessive.  Ricupero said the fear expressed by businessmen about high  interest rates is unjustified. He sees a contradiction in their  claims about high interest rates. In his opinion, some  businessmen "would like to stockpile their products, but they  will be unable to do this if interest rates are high."    Regarding the impact the recent frost will have on food  prices, Ricupero said the government is prepared to use its  buffer stocks, if necessary, to avoid excessive price increases.</p>

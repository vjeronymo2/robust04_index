			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Pollard quits at Sunday Express The husband and wife editing team of Sir Nicholas Lloyd at the Daily Express and his wife at the Sunday Express was split yesterday with the abrupt resignation of Lady Lloyd, Ms Eve Pollard. Ms Pollard, the former editor of the Sunday Mirror who was appointed editor of the Sunday Express in May 1991, is 'to go in search of other interests'. In an agreed statement Ms Pollard agreed to remain a consultant to Express Newspapers. Mr Brian Hitchen, a former deputy editor of the Sunday Express and present editor of the Daily Star, takes over as editor of the Sunday Express on September 1. Mr Hitchen, who has for many years wanted to edit the Sunday Express, takes on one of the most difficult jobs in national newspapers - trying to reverse the apparently remorseless long-term decline in the paper's circulation. During Ms Pollard's editorship the Sunday Express became a tabloid and there have been periods of rising circulation. Trying to displace the the influence of the Mail on Sunday has proved more difficult. The vacancy at the Daily Star prompted speculation that Mr Kelvin MacKenzie might fill the chair. The former editor of The Sun recently resigned abruptly from the managing director's job at BSkyB, the satellite television broadcaster, after losing a power struggle with Mr Sam Chisholm, chief executive. However, it is thought unlikely at United Newspapers, owner of the Daily Star, that Mr MacKenzie will move to the newspaper. An internal appointment is thought more plausible. In a statement yesterday Ms Pollard said she had enjoyed her years as editor of the Sunday Express. 'It has been an exciting and innovative period but now the newspaper is in prosperous health I think the time is right for me to seek new challenges,' said Ms Pollard.

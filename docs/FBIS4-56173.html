			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 1 May (PL) -- Cuban deputies today demanded  the adoption of measures to curb illegal enrichment, a  demoralizing factor for social and labor discipline.    Historian and Deputy Eusebio Leal issued an appeal to act  without delay against "scoundrels and speculators" according to  the revolution's legal system.    In a special session of the National Assembly of the  People's  Government (parliament) held today, Rolando Lao, parliamentary  member for Plaza de la Capital Municipality, emphasized the need  to adjust the taxes imposed on self-employed workers according  to the income they earn.    "We must not expect miracles. The deputies, government, and  public administration officials are responsible for preventing  the diversion of state resources to the black market," he said,  adding that he endorses the gradual enforcement of measures that  will affect a majority of the population.    The deputies argued for and against changing the currency as  an instrument to put finances on a sound basis and to control  and penalize illegal enrichment.    Deputy Lazaro Barredo proposed changing the currency,  freezing funds, and the eventual confiscation of assets owned by  citizens who cannot justify their incomes.    Osvaldo Martinez, chairman of the parliament's Economic  Affairs Commission, said that changing the currency can be  another measure used but that it is not a solution per se. He  did not link it to the policy against the so-called "currency  hoarders," citizens whose wealth stems from the black market or  from speculation.    He said: These people converted a sizable part of their  funds into assets a long time ago, so changing the currency  would not be efficient. He said there are other options  available without resorting to a change of currency.    He reminded everyone that if you analyze savings accounts,  you will see that 62 percent of the population has money  deposited in the national banking system.    An exchange measure can be traumatic because it would entail  establishing a limit on the money that can be exchanged and  freezing funds, with the subsequent negative effects on people  who have not necessarily grown rich illegally.    Under the Cuban economy's current situation, when no  substantial short-term increase is foreseen in the production  sector, the change of currency would not have a permanent effect  on the black market, the economist said.    President Fidel Castro also spoke about this issue. He said  that changing currency is one weapon in the arsenal of measures  that may be used, but it must never be exclusively aimed at the  eradication of the so-called "currency-hoarders."    He said that the parliament's final decision, whatever it  may  be, cannot allow these speculators to walk away scot-free for  their illegal activity.    The assembly, which is being attended by 551 deputies plus  dozens of foreign guests invited to the 1 May celebrations, has  only one topic: the analysis of measures to put internal  finances on a sound basis.</p>

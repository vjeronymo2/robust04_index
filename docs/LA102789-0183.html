			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> TREASURY TO BORROW $17 BILLION  </P> <P> The Treasury Department said today it will borrow $17 billion on an emergency  basis early next week so it can pay Social Security benefits to 38.9 million  retirees and avert an unprecedented government default.  </P> <P> Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said the emergency borrowing will enable  monthly Social Security checks to go out on schedule Nov. 3 regardless of  whether Congress breaks a deadlock and passes an increase in the national debt  limit.  </P> <P> Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) denounced the emergency  action as "obviously a transparent political move to enhance the effort to get  a capital-gains tax cut. There apparently is no limit to what they'll do" to  reach that goal.  </P></p>

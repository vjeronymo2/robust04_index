			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Chevron to Sell Mineral Assets: The San Francisco-based oil company said it  would take a $30-million charge against second-quarter earnings to sell a  number of mineral assets and restructure its Chevron Resources Co. subsidiary.  In a "fundamental shift" in strategy, Chevron said it would sell all but three  major non-coal minerals projects -- a platinum and palladium mine in Montana, a  copper and silver property in Chile, and zinc and lead deposits in Ireland.  Chevron Resources will oversee the sale of other minerals assets, which are  expected to fetch more than $70 million before taxes and result in a net loss.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Stephen Alderman, PRESS ASSOCIATION parliamentary staff] </F>   [Text] Britain needs to ensure "democratic legitimacy and  the rights of minorities" are sustained in today's negotiations  on enlarging the European Union [EU], the Prime Minister  declared.    He told the Commons at question time that Foreign Secretary  Douglas Hurd would be seeking to do this in the Brussels talks  on the terms for Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway to join the  EU.    Against a background of some Tory Euro-sceptics threatening  a  Maastricht-scale revolt if Mr Hurd agrees to voting changes  reducing the UK's ability to block unwanted proposals, Mr Major  said the Government attached "great importance" to qualified  majority voting by EU member states.    He was responding to Dr Liam Fox, Tory MP for Woodspring,  who  called for an assurance "it is the protection of British  interests in Europe which will lie at the heart of our position  in the current negotiations."    The Prime Minister said: "It is important that this country  plays a full part in the European Community and exercises its  influence both on behalf of people in this country and on behalf  of Europe as a whole."    The UK was "very much in favour" of EU enlargement and  negotiations were very nearly complete, he added.    "The present discussions between the 12 are about the  institutional changes that will accompany the enlargement.    ``Like many other states, we attach importance to qualified  majority voting. But I think it is right to consider very  carefully the effect upon [word indistinct] of an increase in  membership.    ``What we need to ensure is that democratic legitimacy and  the rights of minorities are sustained within the EU.    ``That is what Mr Hurd will be seeking to do in his  negotiations.''    The dispute concerns a proposal that, to take account of the  forthcoming accession of Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway to  the EU, the number of votes that must be secured to block EU  legislation be raised from 23 to 27.    The British Government currently needs backing only from one  other large member state and one small one effectively to veto  EU proposals.</p>

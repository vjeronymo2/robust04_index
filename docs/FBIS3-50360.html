			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Katowice, 27 Jan--The Board of the Katowice Region  of the "Kontra" Trade Union decided today to transform itself  into a regional strike committee [RKS], committee chairman  Krzysztof Fijalkowski reports.    "Trade unionists envisage strikes in the mining sector, and  that is why it has been decided to create the RKS. For the time  being, we have declared a strike alert in the mines. We have  marked out specific dates for strikes, Andrzej Andrzejczak, the  chairman of the "Kontra" National Commission [KK] said, but he  nonetheless declined to cite them.    The RKS demands from the government that, among other  things,  it equalizes disproportions in pay for miners and that it  restore the ratio of pay for miners to the national average at a  level of 2:1; hold back increases in prices; enact immediate  debt restructuring for mines; and create a mining bank, which  would allow mines to be made independent of the "usurious rates  of the banks."    "Kontra" also demands that mining be recognised as a  strategic industry, that the government promises to procure  permanent coal reserves, that annual and anniversary bonuses be  free of tax, and that the right to a retirement pension after 21  years' work underground be introduced.</p>

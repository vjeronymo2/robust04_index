			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By Makoto Utsumi, Keio University professor and former </F> deputy vice minister for financial affairs at the Ministry of  Finance]    [Text] April is the "season for international finance."  Several important conferences such as the provisional meeting of  the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are scheduled for the  month. Among them, one that commands special attention is the  seven-nation (G-7) meeting of financial ministers and central  bank presidents.    Normally, the G-7 meetings are preceded by a G-2 meeting  between Japan and the United States. Past practice called for  the two nations to meet and to attend the G-7 meeting after  arriving at a basic understanding. It has not been the case that  a complete agreement would be reached on all issues and there  were times when the meetings would result in unanticipated  problem areas. However, a comparison of notes in advance enabled  a more meaningful debate during the formal G-7 meetings.    But, this time around, the picture is different. A deadlock  in the Japan-U.S. collective talks on trade has led to a  complete suspension of a Japan-U.S. dialogue. Even the  "Japan-U.S. Yen-Dollar Committee" which once served as an  important venue for exchanging information and discussing policy  matter has ceased to function.    The coming G-7 conferences will be held under unusual  circumstances. Moreover, issues to be laid on tabled will be of  major proportions. Just as Japan will be asked to implement  economic stimulus packages, the other nations face major issues.  However, if an attempt were to be made in focusing on a single  common issue, that topic would cover the question of whether a  rise in long-term interest rates can be stopped.    Expansion in international balance of payments deficits, an  expensive yen, and cheap dollar serve as a background for an  incipient rise in U.S. interest rates. Germany still faces the  need to liquidate the costs of unifying East and West Germany.    Japan cannot remain unconcerned as the environment continues  to build for rising long-term interest rates in Europe and the  United States. In fact, it might be more accurate to say that  Japan is now a direct participant in the move towards higher  interest rates.    Issuance of debt instruments in the form of government bonds  to handle the expansion of public works projects, of debt  instruments by regional autonomous government entities, and of  government deficit bonds following the cut in income taxes have  cast a dark cloud over the Japanese bond market.    A continuation of these trends is likely to expose the  Japanese financial structure to the problems that struck the  United States during President Reagan's administration. In those  days, U.S. bond markets reacted sharply to the U.S. national  deficit picture on a day-to-day basis.    The U.S. demand for Japan to employ such financial measures  to stimulate domestic demand will cause higher Japanese interest  rates and turmoil in bond markets. Essentially, the simplistic  theory that financial measures should be deployed to expand  domestic demand is no longer valid.    A rapid rise in long-term interest rates will ruin the world  economy. Even as they concern the U.S. economy alone, rising  interest rates run the risk of a "triple fall" in the form of a  weaker dollar, lower bond prices, and a drop in stock prices.    Rising interest rates will also have a profound effect on  developing nations and former communist bloc nations. There is  the risk that high interest rates will preclude the availability  of funds for those nations that need huge sums of capital to  attain greater economic expansion or to move towards a market  economy.    Even if sufficient funds exist on a worldwide basis, high  interest rates will preclude those funds from being shifted to  areas where they are needed. There is the risk that a very  illogical situation will arise, even from the standpoint of a  balance between savings and investment.    That failure to take action to counter current trends could  result in the worldwide spread of problems is an awareness that  should be gradually embraced by the G-7 member nations.    Certainly, the fact that U.S. authorities expressed  themselves selectively on previous occasions about a persistent  trend in a high yen-cheap dollar situation may have been a  reflection of awareness that there was a need to give priority  to international financial cooperative measures. Even in Europe,  there is a strong feeling of crisis about rising long-term  interest rates amidst an economic slowdown. The upcoming G-7  conference should severely question just how much the various  nations share in such awareness and just how much cooperation  can be exercised in coping with such issues.    The G-7 forum is not one in which specific policy decisions  are made. The G-7 serves as a forum in which representatives of  the member nations engage in a frank discussion about  international finance.    Policy decisions and their implementation are handled by the  respective member nations, but discussions in the G-7 forum are  supposed to be reflected in the financial policies of member  nations.    Under rapid deregulation of international financial markets,  bond and currency exchange markets move sharply as if to reflect  the intentions of various international leaders. The question is  just how much can the member nations cooperate in the cause to  prevent a worldwide rise in interest rates?    One wonders if we are ready to face the consequences of  violent market reactions, resulting from an abortive G-7 meeting  in which everyone engages in a free-for-all exchange of  unilateral positions and member nations are forced to resort to  irresolute countermeasures.</p>

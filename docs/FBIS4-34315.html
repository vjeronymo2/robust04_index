			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with President Fidel Castro by Radio </F> Cadena Nacional, RCN, journalist Antonio Caballero in Cartagena  de Indias, Colombia, on 16 June -- recorded]    [Text] [Caballero] [Words indistinct] Radio Cadena Nacional  [RCN] of Colombia. Good morning.    [Castro] Good morning and thank you.    [Caballero] Well, let us begin at the beginning, as the  saying goes. Was it a rhetorical summit again, or did it include  important, substantial things to show not only to Latin America  but also to the world, Mr. President?    [Castro] All the summits are full of rhetoric, wherever they  are held, especially this type of summit, right? They include  outstanding figures from many places. They are not the everyday  type of meeting such as those held in Europe. First of all, each  summit is an event eagerly awaited by political leaders from the  participating countries. This summit also has historical  significance in that it is the first time Latin Americans met on  our own. In the past, we met only when we were summoned by the  United States. This phase began in Guadalajara, and this is the  fourth summit.    I sincerely believe it represents a very important event  inasmuch as heads of state met to discuss various topics. It has  played an important role in the rapprochement between countries  and country leaders. A rapprochement between countries cannot  occur if there is no rapprochement between country leaders. All  kinds of initiatives, practical initiatives, have been submitted  -- courses, cooperation, funds for specific purposes to benefit  communities, for example, a fund to support the Indian  population.    In other words, this type of specific thing has been  approved  but, above all, these summits are important for the future and  represent an effort toward the integration of the Latin American  peoples: economic integration, first of all, political  rapprochement, and what will perhaps be political integration of  Latin American countries in the future. People get to know one  another through these summits; bilateral rapprochement has been  sponsored through these summits; regional organizations like the  Latin American Integration Association, the Southern Cone Common  Market, the Andean Pact, and the Latin American Economic System  have acquired importance and strength through these summits. I  notice that progress has been achieved so these summits project  themselves toward the future; they have become  institutionalized, and I believe they will truly become an  important factor in what has been so much discussed, the Latin  American integration progress.    [Caballero] Mr. President, Cuba is always a mandatory topic  at these summits -- beginning with the one in Guadalajara and  continuing with this one. Let us say it is one of the important  topics. Some of your counterparts, fellow presidents from  various countries -- the presidents of Peru and Argentina, for  example -- disagree with your version, with your concept of  democracy. They attack you, and they continue to insist on the  need to democratize Cuba.    [Castro] Well, those concepts are completely different and,  in general, are mostly ignorant of things in Cuba. For example,  they ignore that we have a constitution that was discussed with  all the people and that it was approved by more than 95 percent  of the country's citizens. It was our socialist Constitution  with all its government and representation mechanisms. That  Constitution functioned until 1975 [as heard]. Two years ago, we  made some modifications to the Constitution, to perfect it. Many  people believe there is not even a Constitution in Cuba.    [Caballero] Does the criticism from your counterparts bother  you?    [Castro] No, man. I would say we are somewhat used to this.  Rather than discuss the criticism from my counterparts -- we can  talk about that later -- I would discuss the ignorance in which  many live regarding what happens in Cuba. They do not know there  are elections in Cuba and that the people's representatives are  elected by the people. Although no one knows about this system,  in my opinion, it is among the most modern and allows for the  greatest participation of the people because the party is not  the one that chooses the candidates; it is the citizens in each  district. They appoint those who will choose the candidates. It  is like having 1,000 parties because any district can propose  any citizen, discuss his merits and virtues in assemblies, and  elect him.    Those citizens later become candidates and they do it with  the participation of mass organizations and representatives of  the workers, the peasants, the students, women, and the  Committees for the Defense of the Revolution. The mass  organizations are composed of commissions that discuss and  submit lists of candidates to delegates who are directly elected  by the people in the neighborhoods, and the party does not  intervene in that or decide that; so there is enormous freedom,  more than any system known to date. Candidates must get over 50  percent of the votes.    The National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP] is  comprised this way. The ANPP is the one that elects the  executive branch. In other words, the ANPP is the highest  organization in the state and everyone is accountable to the  ANPP. Candidates may be elected and they may be reelected, as a  norm, as a principle. They must systematically submit reports to  their voters. All this is unknown. If Cuba had no Constitution,  there would be no state of law. Everyone's rights and duties are  well defined.    We do not have a presidential government. You should analyze  the Cuban president's authority. You will realize he has less  than any president in Latin America. He does not even have the  authority to appoint ministers. Ministers must be appointed by  the Council of State. The Council of State is an institution  elected by the ANPP for the periods when it is in recess. All  the ministerial posts and other important posts, the posts of  ambassadors, must be discussed by the Council of State before  they are appointed, or before they are dismissed. I can assure  you that the authority of the president of the Republic is  minimal in our country. There is truly consensual leadership.  That is why I am not president of the Republic; I am president  of the Council of State.    [Caballero] Mr. President, regarding your last speech about  your concept of democracy, which I respect, you will obviously  ratify that concept and continue to implement it in Cuba.    [Castro] Of course. We are satisfied and our people are  satisfied with the system we have established. I believe we do  not [words indistinct]. I am criticized when I use a uniform,  yet others want to make institutions uniform, make them exactly  alike. Nevertheless, there is a great diversity of government  institutions in the world.    [Caballero] By the way, how did you feel with a guayabera,  showing up wearing a guayabera?    [Castro] I adapted quickly. All my life I have felt normal,  calm, and satisfied to wear the same clothes I wore over 35  years ago when I was in the mountains. Many asked why I wore an  uniform. I said: Because it is more comfortable and economical.  I do not have to follow fashions; and I got so used to the  uniform that I took it off only when I went to sleep. It is a  campaign uniform, without adornment, without many attributes. It  is as simple as can be. Therefore.. [pauses] we have another  uniform, a formal uniform, but it is also very simple -- pants,  coat, and tie -- and the rank insignia. I do not have many. I  have the insignia of a commander. It is the rank I had when I  landed with the Granma. It is the only rank I have had. I am the  only one who has not been promoted. The only thing is that I was  called commander in chief -- that is how I always signed -- and  the title of commander in chief stuck. I always used the  uniform. Well, when I go to the beach to swim, fish, or dive, I  have to don shorts. That is the only time I do not wear a  uniform.    [Caballero] Do you still swim a lot?    [Castro] Well, I swim....    [Caballero, interrupting] It is said you swim a lot. How  many  km do you swim nowadays?    [Castro, chuckling] Well, sometimes I swim more; sometimes I  swim less -- but I do it somewhat offshore.    [Caballero] How many km, more or less?    [Castro] A maximum of... [pauses] that was in 1979, on my  birthday, on the victim -- no, not victim, on the eve of the  sixth summit. That time I swam slowly, not kicking like a frog,  and I used a snorkel. Sometimes I used the backstroke; sometimes  I used the breast stroke. I swam for eight hours -- but that was  in 1979. I have not dared repeat the effort since then, but I  can swim -- at a moderate pace, naturally -- three or four km. I  always swim farther offshore. I go to a buoy or a lighthouse. I  cannot adapt to the beaches. I have done this for many years,  for over 30 years.    [Caballero] Mr. President, going back to the issue of Cuba,  what will happen with these people who entered the Belgian  Embassy, the German Embassy, and the Chilean Consulate?    [Castro] This is sponsored from abroad. This type of  incident  can be used to generate publicity, to create a scandal. The main  reason, however, is that these people want to immigrate. It is  not a political problem but an immigration problem, a problem of  economic immigration or of people who have relatives abroad who  cannot get a U.S. visa. They do this to sponsor... [pauses] They  may do this for different reasons, but, in my opinion, one of  its main effects and one of its main goals is to sponsor illegal  departures from the country and to sponsor incidents that give  them political dividends. I want you to know that anyone who  wants to leave our country may leave. Anyone of legal age can  visit his relatives and return to the country. We are much more  open about arrivals and departures to and from the country. We  maintained certain restrictions for a long time, given U.S.  plans, sabotage, and CIA activities. We have been quite open  about immigration, however, as a rule, since the beginning of  the revolution. We based ourselves on the principle that free  men and women must voluntarily sustain socialism. We never  prevented those who did not want socialism and who wanted to  immigrate to another country from doing so. There were  restrictions, however, more or less, until a number of years  ago. We adopted the policy of allowing all those who wanted to  leave to do so.    Nevertheless, will they not be granted political asylum,  which is what they requested?    [Castro] No, because neither the Belgian Embassy nor the  other European embassy is registered. There is no political  asylum. Political asylum exists in Latin America and in Latin  American embassies. They have the right to grant political  asylum. They are the ones who decide what must be done. Anyone,  however, who enters any embassy by force... [pauses] If the  embassy has the right to grant political asylum, it will decide  itself whether to order them to leave or to grant them asylum.  They, however, do not want to do that because the people who  show up there are not political refugees. This is not a matter  of persecuted people seeking political asylum. These people want  to immigrate. If they are not granted a visa through normal  channels, they enter by force and create a scandal to pressure  them into granting visas. We have established a principle in  light of this: We give anyone in the country the right to leave;  only those who enter an embassy by force will not receive  permission to leave, regardless of the circumstances. Therefore,  whoever enters an embassy by force... [pauses] We authorize him  to leave, we adopt no measures against him, and we grant him  full guarantees, but we also guarantee we will not give him a  visa to leave -- if he is ever granted a visa -- because we must  adopt some kind of measure to stop this and to avoid having to  use violence and force. While we are dutybound to protect the  embassies, we cannot use excessive violence. Instead, they are  protected by the principle that whoever enters by force loses  his right to leave the country. There would be no way to protect  the embassies if we did not adopt that measure.    People in Cuba, Santo Domingo, and many other countries must  leave and immigrate. They go to Mexico. Millions of Mexicans  somehow manage to overcome the gigantic wall that the United  States has built between Mexico and [word indistinct]. The  people of Santo Domingo leave through many routes, but they are  not given a permit if they enter the United States illegally.  They are not automatically given a residence permit. The only  citizens in the world who have the right to enter the United  States, by any route, whoever they may be, are the Cubans. They  are automatically given a residence permit. The only citizens  who are given this are the Cubans.    That is a measure adopted at the time when more hate and  hostility was felt against us. No Colombian could arrive on U.S.  shores aboard a boat and immediately be granted asylum. No  Dominican, Haitian, Mexican, no one from any Latin American  country. Naturally, this encourages illegal departures [words  indistinct] because, as soon as they arrive, they become  publicity material and are received as heroes. That is the truth  of the story about these illegal departures and the problems at  the embassies.    [Caballero] Now that you mention the United States, do you  believe President Clinton has opened the door a bit? Do you  think he could meet with Commander Castro, with President  Castro, and settle all this a bit?    [Castro] Nothing has been really said about this, and  Clinton  has not given the slightest indication that he is willing to  follow that line and meet me. Quite the contrary, Clinton is  thinking primarily about a second term. Since Florida is the  fourth most important state in the union and Bush and Reagan  campaigned there a lot, it is considered a republican state with  the support of the immigrant community there. They do not know  that a large part, an increasing part of that immigrant  community opposes the blockade and the aggressive policy against  Cuba. A minority group there, however, has power because they  are the powerful; they have the money; they have the media; they  exert pressure and lobby against Congress and against the  administration.    Therefore, since Clinton wants to win the next election, he  wants to curry favor with those people to get their votes and  their (?advice). The Cuban issue has become a U.S. domestic  policy issue, even though the number of Cubans who immigrated  and who advocate an improvement of relations with Cuba has  increased, is big, and is important now. Something else is also  growing in the United States, namely the opinion of  intellectuals, academicians, people in general, and businessmen  who consider the blockade unjustified and obsolete. That  movement is growing even in the United Nations. The United  States is scandalously isolated every time the blockade issue is  discussed, and the vast majority of countries is manifestly  opposed to the blockade against Cuba.    [Caballero] Part of the summit's document mentions this. A  paragraph of the document.    [Castro] A paragraph of the document is dedicated to the  issue of the blockade against Cuba.    [Caballero] Mr. President, do you believe that when  President  Cesar Gaviria goes to the OAS... [pauses] First of all, what is  your reaction to President Gaviria's appointment? Do you think  that once the Colombian president becomes OAS secretary general,  the issue of Cuba will be brought up?    [Castro] This is a complex issue. First of all, we support  Gaviria's appointment. We were happy that a person like him,  with his capabilities, a well-known person, an experienced  person, was appointed to the OAS. We cannot discuss his ideas  because he has yet to assume the post. I imagine he will assume  his post, reflect, and possibly adopt an initiative in that  regard, but we are not exerting pressure in favor of this. Since  we have been out of the OAS for such a long time, we see this  issue of the OAS calmly; we do not see it as a priority issue  for us. The priority is the struggle against the blockade.    The blockade should end; it is unfair, doubly unfair,  doubly criminal at a time when the socialist bloc has  disappeared, when the Soviet Union has disappeared, and when the  Cold War is over. There was never justification for the  blockade, much less at a time like this when it is much more  harmful because we lost that point of support -- meaning trade  with the USSR and the socialist countries, the credits, the  technology. Eighty percent of our trade was carried out with the  socialist bloc; we received a tremendous blow. The blockade is  causing us much more damage than it did when normal conditions  existed concerning Cuba's relations with the USSR and the  socialist bloc. Therefore, that blockade has no justification  and our number-one priority is the struggle against that  blockade.    [Caballero] Mr. President, speaking of bilateral issues, I  would like to ask you something. When you previously came for a  visit to Cartagena, many politicians here stated their views to  RCN. They criticized you because you did not condemn the armed  struggle that unfortunately continues in our country.    [Castro] As a rule, I do not meddle in the internal affairs  of other countries. We should not meddle, and that is why we  have not adopted policies or issued statements in connection  with internal affairs. We are determined to follow that  guideline regardless of criticism because we believe our  position is fair. Therefore, it is a problem that must be solved  by each country. Those are political problems that should be  solved by each country.    [Caballero] In fact, President Castro, one of the candidates  with the best chance of winning on Sunday, Andres Pastrana, said  it will be necessary to revise relations with you because he  does not think they should exist.    [Castro] I believe it would be a mistake to recant  concerning  relations that have been developed between the Cuban and  Colombian people and Governments. I think that whoever wins in  the elections should follow that guideline because we have  things in common, such as the summit; we have other issues of  common interest; we cooperate within the United Nations; and we  have also played an important, active role concerning Colombia's  election for hosting the next nonaligned countries' summit. That  is an extremely important step that involves not only some Latin  American countries, but also most of the African countries and  almost all of the Third World countries, with which we have  excellent relations.    It would not be possible to suddenly adopt a hostile policy  toward Cuba, from an important post within the nonaligned  countries' movement because it would be very detrimental to the  movement. We are founding members of the movement; we have a  long history within the movement; and we have a large number of  friends. We suppose they would not appreciate any hostility  toward Cuba or any decision to recant, in the relations between  Cuba and Colombia; so I hope whoever becomes president will bear  in mind all those factors and continue to work in favor of  relations that are going along excellently.    Moreover, we have no right to meddle in the elections or  support any party because, well, the people should decide which  candidate should be elected, which candidate should be given  their vote of confidence. We hope this does not imply a change  in strategic issues because it would be tantamount to turning  back the wheels of history.    [Caballero] Mr. President, this thing they say... [pauses]  For example, Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle and  Argentine President Carlos Menem called you quote, a dinosaur,  and your strategy dinosaurian, unquote. What is your opinion?    [Castro -- laughs] They told me that. Generally, when they  speak with me, they do it nicely, especially Menem. In this  meeting, we talked a lot; we discussed many topics in which we  have common interests. I thought he was very nice. They have  their own political ideas and, so far as epithets are concerned,  everyone has heard -- even I have heard -- about the dinosaur of  capitalism. [laughs] I would say this also applies to  liberalism. I do not believe it solves the world's problems. I  am not a neoliberal. I believe in the future; I believe in  changes in the future; I believe in a more noble, generous,  supportive, egalitarian world.    I said I became a socialist before I read Karl Marx. I was  what you would call a utopic socialist. Later, when I read Marx,  I had my mind prepared to be conquered by a scientific concept  of history, a scientific economic concept. The idea about an  egalitarian, just society awoke my sympathies. That attracted me  the most. I was attracted by Marx's idea, the principle that the  state should disappear one day. I say true democracy cannot  exist where there is no equality, where there is no brotherhood,  where some people are immensely rich and others are immensely  poor. The sine qua non condition of true democracy should be  equality and brotherhood among men, and equal opportunities.    I believe the best formula ever invented -- even if no one  has been able to implement it yet, even if the world has yet to  go in that direction -- is the formula in which each human being  works according to his capabilities and receives according to  his needs. That is the most noble thing ever written. In fact,  that is what most closely resembles the Christian sermons. I say  that one cannot talk about democracy when there is a beggar  beside a millionaire. Equality is essential. Theoreticians of  the liberal, democratic doctrines stated three principles for  their famous French Revolution -- liberty, equality, and  fraternity.    You do not see this prevail in the world. I, however, see  that the masses are becoming increasingly aware of social  justice, equality, and democracy. Democracy has gone through  various phases. The first was the Greek democracy. It was a  democracy in which a few people had all the rights and the rest  had no rights. Then there is the case of Athens, which was  considered a model of democracy even though there were 30,000  free citizens and 70,000 slaves. I think the democracy of Athens  still prevails in some countries of the Third World, in Latin  America -- a vast majority of extremely poor people and a small  minority of rich people. Just imagine, in Latin America....    [Caballero, interupting] Excuse me a moment. I must [words  indistinct].    [Castro] Just imagine....    [Caballero, interrupting] Mr. President, we were talking  about Athens.    [Castro] We were talking about Athens. I was telling you  there were 30,000 free citizens and 70,000 slaves. It was a  model democracy. Democracy has achieved progress throughout  history, in many countries. There is no slavery, at least a form  of slavery, because there is also actual slavery. For example, I  said there are republics in Latin America where it seems they  still have Athens' democracy, a vast majority of extremely poor  people... [pauses] There are 270 million poor people in this  hemisphere and our Latin American region is the region of the  world with the worst distribution of land. It is the world's  region with the worst distribution of income, to such an extreme  that 40 percent of the poorest people have 10 percent of the  income and 20 percent of the rich have up to 60 percent of the  income. There is no other region in the world with these vast  economic and social differences within one society. That is why  all these obstacles must be overcome before we can talk about  full democracy. Millions die, approximately 1 million children  under the age of 15 die when they could survive. It is truly a  slaughter [words indistinct]. When that reality exists and  prevails, we cannot talk about full democracy.    [Caballero] Mr. President, to conclude the exclusive  interview you have so kindly granted to RCN, it is being said  that you are sick, that you are tired. Are you tired? Do you  feel tired of power?    [Castro] I do not have the energy I had when I was 20, 22,  or  26, like the first time I went to Colombia and the great  rebellion broke out in Santa Fe de Bogota. I was a young student  and was always with the students, so I also became involved. I  had more energy then -- even at 30, 40, or 50 -- than I do now.  But I still have some energy, enough to let me work 15, 16, or  17 hours sometimes. This does not mean I work like that every  day. Fortunately, work is very well distributed in our country  and there are many new people, many young people, with whom we  share the work. This allows me to adjust my activities to suit  the energy level that I have at my age. Nevertheless, I can  attend a summit like this. I can work the number of hours I  worked yesterday, beginning very early and ending at 0200.  Yesterday, we worked 12... [pauses] 14... [pauses] It was 19  hours.    [Caballero] Fidel will be....    [Castro, interrupting] I slept three days... [pauses] three  hours the first day; five hours the second day -- I got even;  two and one half hours last night. The rest of the time has been  spent on commitments and activities.    [Caballero] This means Fidel will be around for a long time.    [Castro] Well, I hope Fidel is around for a long time, but  not Fidel with the same amount of work, the same  responsibilities and obligations. They should give me a chance  to....    [Caballero -- interrupting] Vacations?    [Fidel] Vacations. A long vacation. I should be given the  opportunity to retire at an appropriate time. This should not  happen during difficult times, for anyone who pulls back during  difficult times looks like a deserter. I am afraid of looking  like a deserter.    [Caballero] Where would you like to rest?    [Castro] Well, I would very much like to read, to have free  time to read and chat.    [Caballero] Always in Cuba?    [Castro] Always in Cuba.    [Caballero] Until you die.    [Castro] Until I die. I would like the hole to be dug in a  small plot of land there and to be able to rest there, the  eternal rest which few people desire but which nature has  imposed on us all.    [Caballero] Mr. President, you have been very kind. Thank  you  again on behalf of RCN of Colombia.    [Castro] It was a pleasure for me to answer your questions.    [Caballero] You are very kind. Good-bye.</p>

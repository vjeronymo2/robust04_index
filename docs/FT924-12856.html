			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Arts: Today's Television There are several hefty current affairs programmes for those feeling strong enough. BBC2's Newsnight Special for instance is about Somalia (8.00). The idea of beautiful models returning to their homelands to be photographed in immaculate make-up and striking clothes with their less fortunate countrymen seems questionable, yet we shall no doubt be told it creates invaluable publicity. On this occasion it is Iman who returns to the country she left 20 years ago. World In Action (8.30 ITV) considers the way that wealth and privilege somehow survived in Russia despite 75 years of communism, and Panorama (9.30 BBC1) investigates the smuggling of people from eastern to western Europe following the fall of the communist regimes. In the last of C4's series Animal Squad Undercover (9.00) the RSPCA's special unit is on the trail of a consignment of sheep and pigs, travelling to Italy. KYTV, the spoof series about television itself, was not watched by all that many people when first transmitted, but the episode repeated today (10.00 BBC2) won two prizes at the Montreux festival of light entertainment.</p>

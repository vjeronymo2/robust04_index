			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GUYS &amp; GALLEYS: HE HAS HUNGER UNDER CONTROL  </P> <P> Brian Roberts can't stand the heat, but he stays in the kitchen anyway.  </P> <P> A Costa Mesa fire captain, Roberts would just as soon the alarm -- signifying  human tragedy out there somewhere -- never rang.  </P> <P> But the kitchen is a different story because that's the fun part of the job.  Roberts, 37, loves to cook and obviously enjoys preparing large meals at the  Baker Street station where he works.  </P> <P> "Quantity matters more than anything else," he says. "These guys eat!"  </P> <P> One of the favorites of the eight-man crew is the chicken wing recipe Roberts  shared with Guys &amp; Galleys. "It's simple but very tasty," he says. "I  usually make a minimum of 15 pounds of the things. We eat them hot or cold, as  a main course or as an appeizer."  </P> <P> Roberts says he and one other firefighter generally share the cooking chores.  "All fire stations are different," he says. "In some of them, all the guys like  to cook, and in others -- like ours -- there are a couple of us who really  enjoy it, so the others just say, 'Have at it.' "  </P> <P> Roberts, a 14-year veteran of the department who lives in Trabuco Canyon with  his wife, Mary Jane, and 5-year-old son, also pitches in at home. "My wife is a  wonderful cook, but she lets me try my hand now and then.  </P> <P> "While I like Mexican and Oriental foods, at home I generally keep it simple --  roasts, steaks and some chicken dishes."  </P> <P> And Roberts says that even though his son is the envy of all of his friends for  having a firefighter in the family, the boy doesn't plan to follow in his  footsteps.  </P> <P> "He's decided to be an ice cream man."  </P> <P> Each week, Orange County Life spotlights a man who enjoys cooking and features  one of his favorite recipes.

Chill at  least 5 hours before serving (the longer it sits, the better). Trim tips from  wings and discard. Halve rest of wings at joints. Dredge pieces in flour and  fry in vegetable oil until done. Serve in bowls so that chicken pieces (hot or  cold) can be dipped.  </P></p>

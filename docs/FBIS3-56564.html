In an interview with the news agency BELINFORM, Kebich said  that "on the contrary, (Belarus's) more modern fixed assets than  in Russia, highly skilled labour, and well developed  transportation and industrial infrastructure will ensure that  the merger of the two monetary systems will become a long-term  condition of the stabilisation of the common currency."    The announcement followed a statement by former Russian  Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar that the merger of the two  systems is detrimental to Russia.    Kebich believes that the dispute is caused by "the very  monetary approach towards complex economic processes in the  economy of the transitional period. Certain circles are tossing  up an idea that only a monetary system can affect the economy,  while ignoring other factors which are equally important."    Speaking about inflation in Belarus, Kebich stressed that  the  devaluation of the Belarusian coupons is partly caused by the  huge debts of Russian consumers to Belarusian enterprises, as  well as by a big discrepancy between energy prices in the two  republics.    Earlier today Belarusian First Vice-Prime Minister Mikhail  Myasnikovich said that the merger of the Russian and Belarusian  monetary systems is beneficial to both republics.    The Belarusian vice-premier said that Belarus is doing  everything possible to agree the tax, banking, customs and  foreign economic policies. The talks on these issues were in  progress during the entire last year. On many of them  agreements have been reached. "We are working within the  framework of an agreed tax, licence and quota policy,"  Myasnikovich said.    He stressed that the merger of the Russian and Belarusian  monetary systems aims at removing barriers in trade and monetary  cooperation that emerged after Russia seceded from the rouble  zone, starting the chaotic development of independent monetary  policies in CIS states.    In a joint statement signed on January 5, the heads of  government of Russia and Belarus stated that the necessary  preliminary work for merging the two monetary systems has been  completed.</p>

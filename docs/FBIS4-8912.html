			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] A radio link-up with Gorazde was  again established this evening. The person who spoke with  domestic and foreign journalists was Esad Ohranovic, chairman of  the executive committee of the Gorazde district. Edib Music  reports on the link-up:    [Music] Judging by information that we received from Mr.  Ohranovic this evening, the situation in Gorazde is further  deteriorating. Let us hear what was happening around 2030 this  evening, and also earlier in the day:    [Begin Ohranovic recording] At this moment the Hotel Gradina  and the neighboring building are ablaze. On the right side  apartment blocks called [word indistinct] and Panorama are also  on fire. Everything is enveloped in smoke. Earlier today, six  people were wounded in a building housing a Red Cross refugee  center. The chetniks are no longer attacking front lines. They  simply wish to kill as many civilians as possible by shelling  residential areas. Between 0800 and 2000 today, 26 people were  killed and 62 were wounded. It is difficult to bury the dead as  there is intense sniper fire over the cemetery.    A great problem is drinking water, as there are no springs  that we have access to. Poisonous gases were also released  today. The people affected are feeling dizzy and faint. The  situation along the defense lines is extremely difficult, but we  must persevere. At this moment both the right and the left  sides are coming under intensive fire; I can no longer say from  which weapons. [passage omitted] In every case, the biggest  problem is the population without any accommodation who are  sheltering in entrances, in porches. This is the biggest  problem at the moment. We really do not have the facilities to  accommodate at least 10,000 people. This evening the hospital  again came under fire, and two people were wounded. Poisonous  gases were thrown directly on the hospital. [passage omitted]  [end recording]</p>

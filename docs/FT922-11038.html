			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (25): Minister in the hot seat - Profile of Andrzej Olechowski POLISH politics is full of ambitious men, but few mask their intentions better than Mr Andrzej Olechowski, 44, the new finance minister. Tall, good-looking and with an irreverent sense of humour, Mr Olechowski slipped into the hottest seat two months ago. The appointment transformed the government's image at a difficult moment. His predecessor, Karol Lutkowski, had just resigned amid desperate calls for further cuts in spending. An academic by nature, Mr Lutkowskihad felt unsure of curbing the spending instincts of his cabinet colleagues and keeping the budget deficit within acceptable limits. Abroad, his resignation was taken as a signal that the monetary floodgates were about to burst and that Poland's free market reforms were fated to founder in waves of inflation. Mr Olechowski moved fast to control the damage. He quickly established a rapport with Mr Jerzy Eysymontt, the chief economics minister. This meant accepting the latter's priority of halting Poland's recession at the cost of achieving single-digit inflation before 1994. In Washington, he pursuaded the International Monetary Fund to accept a budget deficit pared to 5 per cent of the GDP. Next, with the strong backing of Mr Jan Olszewski, the prime minister, he persuaded the cabinet to accept the strictures of the new budget. The greatest test is ahead as the budget still has to be implemented and more painful spending cuts may be necessary. In his youth Mr Olechowski was as passionate about western pop music as he later became about western economics. He became a disc jockey on a Warsaw radio programme while studying at Warsaw's school of economics in the later years of party boss Wladislaw Gomulka. His climb up the career ladder has given him unmatched experience. He stands out among most of Poland's political establishment for whom honours won in struggles with the communists still count more than competence. He is politically unattached. His views are a mixture of conviction that monetary controls must be tough to check inflation, and a pragmatism which recognises that change in the efficiency of government and in the state industrial sector will come faster if pushed from above. A patriot with a keen sense for Poland's history, Mr Olechowski shares the belief of most Poles that the country must forge close links with the west if modernisation is to be achieved.</p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET CRISIS AND ARMAMENTS  </P> <P> So officials of the Soviet Union have decided to tell the citizens of that  country the truth about the breakdown of their system for the distribution of  consumer goods! It was news to me, also. Recent articles in The Times have  painted a picture of such gross mismanagement, confusion and bad faith that I  think we should re-evaluate our alliances and priorities in foreign relations.  </P> <P> Mr. President and Congress, the Soviet Union is down for the count! The Soviets  are no longer a threat, as they can't even get their trains and trucks to run!  It's time to stop spending money to defend our nation against an old "enemy"  which is so gravely ailing.  </P> <P> Why not balance our budget by canceling defense industry projects such as the  B-1 Stealth bomber and nuclear armaments? Why not?  </P> <P> PHILIP D. LOIZEAUX, San Marcos  </P></p>

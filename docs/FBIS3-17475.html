"Restrictions on arms sales have been  quite strong so far," he said. "Also countries that have been  politically close to us and with whom we are cooperating closely  for integration with Europe have not been ready to sell us  weapons," the Defence Minister said. Estonia has only bought  weapons from Israel, Romania and China. Minister Kannik  expressed hope that other countries will follow the example of  United States and lift their arms sales restrictions. U.S.  President Bill Clinton on Tuesday lifted the embargo on arms  sales to the three Baltic states, and to Bulgaria, Romania and  Albania. A memorandum from the U.S. President to the  Secretary of State says that "furnishing of defence articles and  services to the governments of ... Estonia, Latvia and  Lithuania will strengthen the security of the United States and  promote world peace."</p>

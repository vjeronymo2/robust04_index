			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 1 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serb leader  Rodovan Karadzic today agreed in Moscow to lift the blockade of  Tuzla airport to allow in UN humanitarian relief operations, but  demanded Russian supervision for fear that it would be used for  shipping arms to Muslims.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev agreed to the demand  during the talks with Karadzic, who is visiting the Russian  capital. Kozyrev also promised that the first aircraft arriving  at Tuzla airport would be a Russian one, reports reaching here  said.    Also today, Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy in former  Yugoslavia, inspected Tuzla airport to observe its preparations  for receiving relief supplies.    However, Bosnian Muslims have expressed opposition to the  presence of Russian military observers in Tuzla airport,  claiming it would be "an insult to the United Nations."    They also opposed Russian intervention in the Bosnian issue,  saying that by backing the Serbs Russia had abandoned neutrality.    Meanwhile in Zagreb, a top official of the UN peacekeeping  forces in Bosnia praised the Russian-Serb accord describing it  as another Russian diplomatic success in the international  efforts to bring peace to Bosnia.    Last month, Russia succeeded in persuading the Serbs into  withdrawing heavy guns from around Sarajevo before a deadline  set by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization left them open to  air strikes, thus defusing the Sarajevo crisis.    Western countries have expressed a similar desire to use the  tactics at Sarajevo to solve the Tuzla airport impasse, the  biggest military airport in the former Yugoslavia under Muslim  control.    The airport was closed down at the beginning of May, 1992  due  to a Serbs blockade aimed at preventing the use of the airport  for shipping arms to Muslims in the nearby town of Tuzla.    Last year, the United Nations declared Tuzla a security  region and has repeatedly called for the opening of the airport  to help them supply relief goods to the inhabitants of the  Serb-besieged city.    After the Sarajevo crisis was over, the Tuzla airport issue  was put on the agenda again. On February 25, Akashi secured  Serbian support for the opening of the airport.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Peru promised long wait for next election PERU'S military-backed emergency government has promised a referendum on its planned constitutional reform and Congressional elections within 12-18 months. Mr Augusto Blacker Miller, foreign minister, told a news conference late on Tuesday that President Alberto Fujimori would resign if the plebiscite rejected the reforms. On Sunday, the president dissolved Congress, arrested opposition politicians and suspended constitutional rights, in what he called temporary measures to cleanse the judiciary and the political system of corruption. The length of time the government is proposing before the return of some semblance of democracy was a surprise. Diplomats had expected a shorter interval, in view of the suspension since Sunday of much-needed international economic aid. Mr Blacker Miller said it would take at least six months for a special commission to draft reforms to the constitution, the judiciary and the constitutional tribunal. The minister added that a dozen opposition Congressmen under house arrest would be freed within two weeks and press curbs would be lifted.</p>

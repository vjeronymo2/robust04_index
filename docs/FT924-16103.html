			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Mexican finance minister expects second half growth to mirror first half Mr Pedro Aspe, Mexico's finance minister, expects growth for the whole of this year to be similar to that in the first half - about 2.8 per cent and so even lower than yesterday's latest OECD forecast, itself revised downwards. He anticipated an increase in growth in the first quarter of next year, but emphasised that inflation would have to fall to single figures before growth of 4 or 5 per cent could be achieved, Damien Fraser writes in Mexico City. Mr Aspe also appeared to rule out any additional devaluation of the peso. As long as the current tight monetary and fiscal policy was maintained, the peso's 2.5 per cent annual slide against the dollar could continue without problems, he said. The current account deficit - expected to top 6 per cent of GDP this year - did not represent a risk to the economy, because it was generated by private-sector investment, Mr Aspe argued.</p>

The republic  government reexamined the package of stabilization measures  because the government task forces working on the implementation  of the program proposed certain changes and additions to the  original decisions.    The government also called for the active involvement of  government officials and authors of the measures in order to  mobilize all the public, from enterprises to state bodies and  citizens, to work for the implementation of the program. Thus,  the citizens of Serbia will be informed as soon as possible  about the substance, nature, and implementation of the measures  offered as the most suitable manner for coming out of the crisis.    The republic government examined the draft of the new  criminal law and established the procedure for sending this  important law to the National Assembly of Serbia for adoption.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / The Business Traveller: Rouble replaces dollar - Travel Update The US dollar is due to disappear officially from Russia's shops in an attempt to put Russians more in control of their own finances. Economists said a central bank regulation preventing traders from accepting foreign cash could help the rouble in the short term. But the real impact would be psychological. Russia announced the ban on cash dollar trade in early October, days after President Boris Yeltsin sent in the tanks to quell a rebellion from the old conservative parliament. Central bank officials say they hope the ban on foreign currency trade will add to the volume of dollars on offer at the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, increasing the value of the rouble. The rouble more than halved in value in the first five months of last year, but the sharp fall ended in June and losses since then have been steady rather than dramatic. It now trades at around 1,250 to the dollar. Under the new rules, credit card bills will still be denominated in dollars but cash payments must be made in roubles. The dollar had virtually become a parallel currency in the two years since Russia launched its economic reforms.</p>

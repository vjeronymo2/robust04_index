			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Kohl heads west thinking of east Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, arrived last night in Washington for a two-day visit which, according to diplomats, will focus mainly on developments in Russia. Germany and the US are increasingly aware that Nato's Partnership for Peace programme, designed to lead to more co-operation with the countries of eastern Europe, will also have to evolve into a new security structure. German diplomats say that Washington and Bonn will now have to decide what form any additional aid to Russia should take after the resignation of key reformers from the Moscow government. They will also have to agree on what relationship they want with both the ousted reformers and the new cabinet. However, there is concern in Germany that the rise of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the Russian far-right Liberal Democratic party, is forcing European Union members and the US to focus too much attention on Russia at the expense of integrating eastern Europe at a faster pace. German officials in Washington are likely to repeat that eastern European countries require crucial economic assistance via greater trade liberalisation. 'It is not just the Partnership for Peace which must serve as a psychological anchor for eastern Europe, (so should) the economic sphere,' a senior German diplomat said. He added that greater liberalisation, from the EU and the US, for imports from eastern Europe, as well as greater support for creating cushions against the reforms in the region, were crucial for eastern Europe's stability. At the recent Nato summit in Brussels, President Bill Clinton stressed the need for greater investment in eastern Europe. But German officials, despite resistance from Germany's agricultural and steel lobby, still insist this be coupled to greater market access. Also, Mr Kohl will lobby Washington for the US business community to invest in both eastern and western Germany. Mr Clinton, however, is expected to remind Mr Kohl that breaking into the German market, especially eastern Germany, has proved difficult because of resistance from monopolistic structures and high labour unit costs.</p>

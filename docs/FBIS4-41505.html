			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- The poach-control operation  "Putina-94" inflicted a blow on criminal gangs in Russia's  south, militia Colonel Aleksandr Skurtul, deputy chief of the  poach-control operation headquarters, said in an interview with  ITAR-TASS on Monday.    Militia officers seized 149 firearms (including  submachine-guns) from law-breakers, several thousand rounds of  ammunition, 45 explosives and considerable quantities of  grenades.    Militia officers exposed over 20 previously committed crimes  and detained 248 criminals who were on the wanted list. In  Skurtula's opinion, criminal families in the Caspian region now  make attempts to restore their operations after suffering  considerable damage (authorities instituted 305 criminal cases).  For instance, a carrier of caviar was recently detained on the  Astrakhan-St. Petersburg train with 487 cans of caviar.    According to Skurtula, the poach-control operation is  expanding. Interior Ministry forces are now joining fight to  preserve national wealth in the Far Eastern region. Experience  gained in the Caspian region will help to carry out succesfully  operational measures.    "The underworld quickly responds to our actions. Therefore,  the struggle will be difficult and long," Skurtul said in  conclusion.</p>

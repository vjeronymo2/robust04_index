Figures are boring, but also thought-provoking.    Do you know that we can trace back from 1949 to 1864, a year  in which the British imperialists waged an Opium War and blew  open China's door with big guns, and a year in which our  country's total import and export volume was $286 million, of  which the export volume was $147 million?    Eighty-five years later, it was 1949. Can you guess how much  the total import and export volume had increased? It was only  $52 million, less than 20 percent; whereas the diagram (below)  [original item shows line graph with following information  illustrated; unable to reproduce graph here] shows that from  1949, when the country was liberated, to 1993, that is, in a  period of 44 years, the volume rose from $340 million to $195.72  billion, an increase of some 570 times. Judged from the  absolute figures, the most rapid growth took place after the  reform and opening up: In 1978, our country's total import and  export volume was $20.64 billion; in 1993, the figure had  increased by more than $175 billion over 15 years before.    The picture and diagram also show that the composition of  our  country's exports also changed markedly: In 1978, primary  products accounted for more than half of the export volume [pie  chart reflecting the "Composition of Exports" referred to as  picture and diagram above indicates primary products accounted  for 53.5 percent of the export volume while industrial products  made up 46.5 percent of the total], whereas in 1993 they made up  less than 20 percent of the export volume, that is to say,  finished industrial products accounted for the great majority of  our country's exports [second pie chart indicates industrial  products accounted for 81.8 percent of 1993 exports while  primary products made up 18.2 percent of the total.]    When we look at history we acquire new knowledge. Speaking  in terms of foreign trade volume in the international community,  in 1992, our country ranked 11th in the world (the statistics  for 1993 are not yet available). Obviously, this result was  hard-won, but for a big country with 1.1 billion people, we  still have to catch up. Speaking in terms of composition of  exports, we have just accomplished the first change from  exporting large quantities of primary products to exporting  mainly finished industrial products. The second change, that is,  changing from exporting industrial products of low added value  to exporting industrial products of high added value as much as  possible, is still an arduous task. Someone has mentioned the  following: Our country has exported 50 million pairs of shoes  to a certain country, so everyone in that country has a pair of  shoes, but the value of these 50 million pairs of shoes is less  than that of two airbuses!    Here we can see that we still have to do a great deal of  work.</p>

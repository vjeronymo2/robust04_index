			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Radka Petrova: "U.S. Diplomats Are Forming </F> Turkish Axis Between Us and Greece"]    [Text] The visit by two U.S. diplomats to Kurdzhali and  Krumovgrad last week, which was represented to the media and the  public as a routine visit, was in fact connected with fulfilling  a strategic task of drawing the Turks of the eastern Rhodopes  closer to the Muslim community in northern Greece, excellently  informed sources claim. An independent Greek source adds that  he noticed unusual activity by Greek special services in the  Greek provinces of Thrace and Rhodopes precisely at the time of  the diplomatic visit to the eastern Rhodopes by Thomas Price,  deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Sofia, and Second  Secretary John Kunstadter.    As is well-known, Greece has good reasons for its fears  regarding the attempts to draw together the Muslims on both  sides of the Bulgarian-Greek border. According to circles close  to the Greek cabinet, this is the main reason for their  unwillingness to open up the Makaza border crossing point.    According to experts, the U.S. position concerning drawing  together the two Muslim lobbies on either side of the border  aims to hold Greece in check because of its stubborn stance  regarding Macedonia. This supposedly is to be achieved by  insinuating that in the eastern Rhodopes and Thrace only a spark  is needed to ignite a new Bosnia. When asked if they were  checking on the existence of such a possibility during their  visit to Kurdzhali, diplomats John Kunstadter and Thomas Price  denied such an insinuation with amazement. However, according  to someone who took part in the closed talks with the DPS  [Movement for Rights and Freedoms], this was precisely the  problem that worried the emissaries of Ambassador Montgomery.  Serious observers of this problem are firm in their view that  there is no doubt that the Americans are mediating in trying to  bring together the two Muslim lobbies of the eastern Rhodopes  and western Thrace. The number of illegal visits by two Greek  parliamentary deputies, the Muslims Ahmed Saduk and Ahmed  Faikoglu, to the former Kurdzhali Okrug during the last election  campaign in Bulgaria allegedly formed only part of the plan that  had been hatched up by strategists in Washington to draw the two  Muslim communities together. Ahmed Saduk is known to have  claimed that the Muslims in northern Greece are Turks.  According to Greek sources, in northern Greece the Muslims  number between 100,000 and 120,000. Ankara considers that about  300,000 Muslims inhabit this region. Greek lawyers recall that,  before he became a member of the previous Greek Parliament, an  investigation was mounted against Ahmed Saduk on suspicion of  fomenting nationalist enmity.    According to sources close to the U.S. Embassy, certain  diplomats are supposed to have quite seriously discussed the  possibility of the DPS becoming a model for the Muslims of  northern Greece. The Muslims there were recognized as a  community by the 1923 Lausanne Conference, but do not possess  anything like the rights now enjoyed by the Turks in Bulgaria.  This is a very difficult task, because the Greek Constitution  forbids the existence of ethnic parties, and in Greece it is  impossible even for Slavonic-speaking Greek citizens to form a  party. According to REUTER, infuriated Greeks were reported to  have hurled stones at a Turkish parliamentary delegation in  Xanthe in early February. It is alleged that the Turkish  deputies also held talks with the Muslim community in the town  about them forging closer links with their brothers in the  neighboring countries.    Sources in northern Greece claim that U.S. radars are still  controlling the airspace there, and they point to such equipment  mounted in Maria and other nearby villages. Furthermore, it is  known that all the financial aid for the mosques in the eastern  Rhodopes and western Thrace, declared to consist of donations  from Islamic organizations, really comes from U.S. banks.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Mon. [30 May] -- The bilateral  relations between Malaysia and China have reached a new level of  understanding and cooperation, and the two countries should take  pride in the steady development, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed  said.    He said in the last five years, bilateral relations had  increased by leaps and bounds in many fields of cooperation.    "I am confident this trend will be further reinforced in the  years to come," he said in a two-page letter to Chinese Premier  Li Peng on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of diplomatic  ties between the two countries. His letter was released by  Wisma Putra [Foreign Ministry].    Formal ties were sealed in Beijing on May 31, 1974 by the  late Tun Abdul Razak, then Malaysian Prime Minister, and his  then Chinese counterpart the late Zhou Enlai.    Dr. Mahathir paid tribute to Razak's vision and courage in  making Malaysia the first ASEAN country to normalise ties with  China.    "I believe credit for the development of the excellent  relations between Malaysia and China should also go to the  pragmatic and outward-looking leadership of China," he said.    He said the policy of friendly relations with neighbouring  countries had encouraged positive developments in bilateral  relationships, particularly in recent years.    Both Malaysia and China could take pride in the steady  development of mutually satisfying relations over the last two  decades although links between them actually go back a long way  in history, he added.    Apart from the rapid increase in economic cooperation,  trade,  and investment, Dr. Mahathir said cooperation in other fields  such as tourism, cultural exchanges, and people-to-people  contacts would further encourage better understanding and  friendship.    Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi also sent a  message on the occasion to his Chinese counterpart and Vice  Premier Qian Qichen.    Li, in a congratulatory message to Dr. Mahathir, said both  China and Malaysia were developing countries with similar  historical experiences and were now facing the great tasks of  developing the national economy.    "The seeds of Sino-Malaysian friendship sowed 20 years ago  have now yielded rich fruits. I am convinced that the tree of  our friendship that is being fostered will grow even healthier  in the years to come."    Noting Dr. Mahathir's three visits to China in recent years,  the Chinese premier said the visits had promoted mutual  understanding and trust and brought Sino-Malaysian relations to  a new stage of all-round development. The economic and trade  cooperation between the two countries had now made remarkable  achievements, he said.    "It has been proven by facts that the maintenance of  friendly  and good neighbourly relations between China and Malaysia is not  only in conformity to the fundamental interests of the two  countries, but also conducive to the peace, stability, and  prosperity of the region."    Qian sent a similar message to Abdullah expressing the hope  that the existing strong relations between the two countries  would continue to be consolidated in the future.    "We highly regard your government for upholding justice and  speaking out from a sense of justice in international affairs  and promoting the political stability and economic prosperity of  this region," he said.</p>

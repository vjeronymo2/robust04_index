			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian Liberal  Democratic Party [LDPR], told Interfax Monday [7 February] that  "there will be no air bombardment of Serbian positions in  Bosnia." He was commenting on the UN Secretary General's appeal  to NATO headquarters to consider the possibility of air strikes  designed to break the siege of Sarajevo.    If Butrus Butrus-Ghali "heads an organization which is a  subsidiary of some country" and "suppresses the freedoms of  other countries," then "we and other East European nations will  leave that organization," the LDP leader emphasized.    His second-largest party group in the Russian State Duma is  outspokenly pro-Serbian when the Yugoslav crisis is discussed.    Asked whether he will propose any initiative if the Serbian  positions were bombed, Zhirinovskiy said that "there is no if"  for him.    "We reject all kinds of violence. We do not want even to  hear of air strikes against Bosnian towns," the LDP leader said.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Monopolies probe on Independent less likely The Department of Trade and Industry is increasingly likely to allow the consortium that includes Mirror Group Newspapers to take over The Independent newspaper without a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. But a waiver on the grounds of economic urgency is expected to be accompanied by conditions designed to protect the editorial independence of The Independent and the Independent on Sunday, both owned by Newspaper Publishing. The consortium, which is bidding for the shares in Newspaper Publishing that it does not already own, brings together MGN, Mr Andreas Whittam Smith and the principal founders of the paper, and two existing shareholders, El Pas of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy. Meanwhile, further details emerged yesterday of the consortium agreements and the service deal under which MGN would handle all the operations of Newspaper Publishing apart from editorial. The Spanish and the Italians have an agreement to vote as one on the NP board which they will therefore control with four of the seven board seats. MGN will operate Newspaper Publishing's bank account and have a veto over board decisions on new lines of business such as the launch of titles.</p>

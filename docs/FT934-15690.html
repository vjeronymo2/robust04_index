			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / International Company News: General Dynamics may sell off rockets side GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence company which has been aggressively selling off subsidiaries, is believed to have been discussing the sale of its space launch business to fast-growing defence group Martin Marietta. General Dynamics makes the Atlas/Centaur family of vehicles, powered by liquid fuels, while Martin Marietta makes Titans, which have a much larger lifting capacity and are powered primarily by solid fuels. A deal would be the latest in a series between contractors as the US defence industry consolidates against a background of a shrinking Pentagon budget and the end of the Cold War. Both companies declined to comment on reports of the possible sale, which first appeared yesterday in Aerospace Daily, an industry newsletter. However, industry sources suggested that discussions had been going on. General Dynamics shares rose strongly on the reports to close at Dollars 97 3/4 , up Dollars 1 1/2 , while Martin Marietta was unchanged at Dollars 42 1/4 . Mr Norman Augustine, chairman of Martin Marietta, said last week the company was looking for more acquisitions, following its purchase of General Electric's aerospace division for Dollars 3bn last April. Both the US Air Force and the NASA, the space agency, have signalled they would be happy to see a consolidation of the launch vehicle industry, which could lower costs and increase efficiencies. Analysts suggested that a deal would help both companies. Martin Marietta would enjoy a broader technology base and elimination of duplicated functions, such as research and development. For General Dynamics, a deal at the right price would fit with its strategy of buying or selling businesses to cope with the declining defence market, and returning any spare cash to shareholders.</p>

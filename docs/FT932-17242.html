			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Bank Leumi returns to black BANK LEUMI, Israel's second-largest bank, yesterday reported a return to the black with net profits of Shk210.4m (Dollars 76.1m) for 1992, after losing Shk85.4m in 1991, writes Judy Maltz in Jerusalem. This turnround was the result of a decrease in the bank's bad debt provision to Shk573m from Shk900m. A law passed by parliament had forced the bank to make large write-offs in 1991 for the country's semi-collective farms. Total assets were Shk78.4bn at the end of 1992, an increase of 6 per cent from a year earlier. United Mizrahi Bank, Israel's fourth-largest bank, yesterday posted trebled net profits of Shk111.5m in 1992 from Shk35.7m the year before. The main factor behind the rise was a sharp drop in its bad debt provision to Shk97.3m from Shk182.2m. Its return on equity was 15 per cent.</p>

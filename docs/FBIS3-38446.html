			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner by </F> Gyoergy Foris in Brussels; date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Foris] Mr. Secretary General, I would like to  ask you about the Partnership for Peace program. What does it  specifically offer, and why does it not offer security  guarantees?    [Woerner in English with superimposed Hungarian translation]  First and foremost it provides a whole range of new  opportunities for military and political cooperation under a  bilateral agreement, including the possibility for the country  in question's defense system to approach NATO standards. The  latter is one of the most important tasks in the course of  preparation of membership.    However, we cannot offer security guarantees with  Partnership  for Peace, since these are linked to member status. But it  would be a mistake to think that without formal guarantees you  are left alone. By cooperating more and more closely with NATO,  your security is increasing. Should there be any threat against  you, everybody should take into consideration our alliance's  probable reaction. Because probably we would not just idly bide  our time.    [Foris] Indeed, the document mentions the fact that  Partnership for Peace also means a kind of new security  relation. What does it mean in specific terms?    [Woerner] As a part of Partnership for Peace, we offer an  opportunity for consultations. In the event there is a threat  against your territorial integrity, it enables you to ask  immediately for consultations with NATO. In reality, it does  not only mean that you will simply be listened to, but together  with this we will find ways of eliminating the danger.    [Foris] [passage omitted] In my view the UN's mandate [to  NATO] is a trap -- since without this, NATO is doomed to  idleness, even if it wants to take steps.    [Woerner] I am convinced that we would be able to act, but  only under certain circumstances. But you are right, we have  some member states which are insisting on the UN mandate, just  like everybody is insisting on the UN.    [Foris] Can you see a way out of this trap?    [Woerner] I would not call it a trap. But as far as a way  out is concerned, I would encourage the UN to act more  resolutely. [passage omitted]</p>

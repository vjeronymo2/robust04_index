			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News at One" program] </F>   [Text] The British Ambassador to China, Sir Robin McLaren,  says he hopes to see senior Chinese officials to explain how the  British Government intends proceeding with the implementation of  the governor's electoral reform package for Hong Kong. Speaking  on his return to Beijing after receiving treatment for a back  problem in Britain, Sir Robin said he was present at last week's  British cabinet committee meeting on Hong Kong and would relay  the views expressed there. He added that he would not go into  details but would restate London's commitment to the Joint  Declaration and Basic Law.    [Begin McLaren recording] I hope I shall be seeing various  senior Chinese officials, now that I have returned, and I should  be able to explain to them how the British Government sees the  way forward. I think that I won't go into any detail about  that, but, as you know, the British Government is firmly  attached to the Joint Declaration; we want to work with China to  bring about a smooth transition in 1997; and we are ready to  resume talks about the matters still remaining to be dealt with  on the Legco [Legislative Council] elections if the Chinese side  is prepared to do so.

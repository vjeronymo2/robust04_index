			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: Air London lower with Pounds 300,000 Air London International, the USM-quoted charter broker, reported lower pre-tax profits of Pounds 300,000 for the six months to January 31, against Pounds 411,000. Although turnover improved from Pounds 6.9m to Pounds 7.8m, operating profits were affected by pressure on margins and a marginal increase in overheads, Mr Anthony Mack, chairman, said. The interim dividend is held at 1.6p, payable from lower earnings of 2.2p (3.2p) per share.</p>

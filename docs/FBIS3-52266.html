It was unclear how long this latest round of talks, focusing  on trade, labour, financial, banking and other economic issues,  would last.    The head of the Israeli delegation, David Brodet, was not  present at the talks Monday. The Palestinian delegation is  headed by Muhammad Abu-Ghawsh, in charge of international  economic issues for the PLO.    Israeli Foreign Minister Shi'mon Peres said in December that  Israel had made various "concessions" to the PLO in terms of  economic issues and was in favor of setting up a common market  among Israel, Jordan and autonomous Palestinian territory.</p>

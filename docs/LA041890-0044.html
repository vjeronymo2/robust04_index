			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIRMEZ LOSES DAY'S PAY BUT NO GAME TIME  </P> <P> Midfielder Waad Hirmez was suspended by Socker President Ron Cady Tuesday for  one day without pay for sitting out the second half of the Sockers' 2-1 loss to  St. Louis Sunday.  </P> <P> Hirmez will not miss any games and will play against Wichita Friday.  </P> <P> Hirmez decided not to return after arguing with Newman, who told him he needed  to speed up. Newman said he wanted Hirmez on the bench in the second half, but  Hirmez decided he didn't want to be there if he wasn't going to play and  watched from the stands.  </P></p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Pools heir hopes to draw 100,000 to gallery THE HEIR to the Littlewoods pools empire yesterday announced plans to develop an art gallery to rival the country's leading collections. The gallery will be part of a new centre for exhibitions and the performing arts. Mr Peter Moores aims to open the gallery within five years at Compton Verney, a mansion near Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire. Mr Moores is a son of Sir John Moores, the Littlewoods founder who died at the weekend. The project is being overseen by the Peter Moores Foundation, a charity which purchased the 18th century mansion last week for an undisclosed sum. It was bought from Period &amp; Country Houses, the London-based restoration company. Foundation officials said that the purchase price, development costs and budget set aside to expand Mr Moores' private art collection would run into 'several million pounds'. Separately, another charity aims to build a Pounds 50m opera and ballet house in the grounds of the estate pending a public inquiry and approval from the Department of the Environment. Stratford district council has already approved the scheme, which involves a 1,150-seat auditorium. If planning permission is also granted by the department, the opera and ballet house would take two years to build and would open in 1997. Sir Kenneth Bradshaw, administrator of the Compton Verney Opera Project, said yesterday the charity would seek backing from private and institutional investors for the Pounds 40m construction and a Pounds 10m endowment fund to underwrite running costs. 'This will be the UK's only purpose-built auditorium for both opera and ballet, and together with the gallery it will be a remarkable arts centre for the country,' Sir Kenneth said. The Peter Moores Foundation said the costs of setting up the gallery would be funded from Mr Moores' own resources. More than 100,000 visitors a year are expected to visit the gallery when it opens in the late 1990s.</p>

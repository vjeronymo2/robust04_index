			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Lan Ning (5695 0413)] </F>   [Text] Chengdu, 19 May (XINHUA) -- While inspecting  Sichuan recently, Qian Qichen, member of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau, vice premier of the State Council,  and concurrently minister of foreign affairs, stressed that the  current international and domestic situations are conducive for  China to develop its tourism. Localities should take advantage  of the opportune time to accelerate the development of the  non-trade industry that creates foreign exchange. Especially,  we should attach importance to developing and improving tourism  software.    Qian Qichen arrived in Chengdu 15 May. During his stay, he  attended a national forum of tourism bureau chiefs and heard  reports by leaders of Sichuan Province and Chengdu city. Later,  he inspected well-known scenic spots in Sichuan and attended the  opening ceremony for the 1994 Chinese Cultural Relics and  Historic Sites Tour of Leshan International Tourism Buddha  Festival on 18 May. While in Sichuan, Qian Qichen extensively  exchanged views with Sichuan's leaders and people in charge of  tourism from various provinces on the current state of and  prospects for tourism development.    Qian Qichen said: China, rich with tourism resources, a long  history, and a unique cultural tradition, is a great attraction  to the world. Judging from the current international and  domestic situations, now is the opportune time to develop  tourism. Some Western economies are in recession; and the  political situation in some regions, in chaos; while China,  developing in a healthy and stable way, has attracted many  investors. In three years, Hong Kong will be returned to China.  To tourism, this is a great opportunity. We should seize and  take advantage of the opportune time. With the launching of  economic and financial reforms and the establishment of a  socialist market economy in China, China will surely make great  headway in developing tourism.    Qian Qichen pointed out: Tourism is a comprehensive  industry. Its development depends on various industries such as  communications, telecommunications, hotel, and transportation,  as well as safety. Tourism development will also give an  impetus to the development of these industries. As an  outward-oriented industry that creates foreign exchange, tourism  represents a major nontrade channel from which China earns  foreign exchange. Statistics show that, from 1978 to 1993,  foreign exchange income from tourism totalled $32.1 billion,  becoming a major part of China's foreign exchange earnings from  nontrade channels. This has laid a good foundation for further  development.    Currently, we should improve software and service quality,  strengthen safety in travel, and perfect the management system.  In 1993, China received some 7 million foreigners who toured  China. Tourism is a good channel for foreigners to get to know  China. We should leave a good impression on foreign tourists.  Qian Qichen also hopes that localities should strengthen  production of tourism commodities and develop China into a  "shopping paradise" for tourists worldwide. In speaking of  tourism development in Sichuan, Qian Qichen pointed out: As a  populated province with abundant tourism resources -- a rare  favorable condition, Sichuan should concentrate its efforts on  development, coordination, and service, so as to make good  progress in tourism.    Qian Qichen will inspect other parts of Sichuan on 19 and 20  May. Accompanying Qian Qichen were He Chunlin, deputy secretary  general of the State Council General Office, and Liu Yi,  director of the National Tourism Administration.</p>

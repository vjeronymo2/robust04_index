			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Richmond inquiry finds no evidence of cash circle RICHMOND Oil &amp; Gas, the natural resources company, yesterday sought to lay to rest questions over the underwriting arrangements of the company's flotation in July 1989. Matters arising from the flotation are being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office, Mr Robert Fox, chairman, said an internal investigation of the company's files had not revealed 'any evidence of any irregularities on the part of the company or any member of the board of directors' at the time of the flotation. Nor had the company found evidence of a circle of funds, he said. However, Richmond is expected to make a further announcement later this week about a change in the role of Mr David Wilkinson, chairman at the time of the flotation and currently joint managing director. The inquiry was carried out by Richmond's company secretary, Mr David Webb. He has held the post since May 1989. Richmond's inquiry confirmed that Pounds 15.8m - the proceeds from the original offer - had been deposited with Jersey-based Oakwood Management Enterprises on the advice of brokers, Corporate Broking Services. Mr Wilkinson was a director of CBS at the time. The decision to deposit the money with Oakwood had been taken by 'disinterested' members of Richmond's board, Mr Fox said. These were Michael Hayes, then-finance director and Mr Michael Hogue, formerly chief executive and now joint managing director. Mr Hayes left the company earlier this year. Mr Fox said the company had received Pounds 1.2m in interest from Oakwood, which had been accounted for in the 1990 results. An investigation by Price Waterhouse in May cited evidence that Oakwood was involved in a 'cash flow circle' which appeared to give the impression that the sub-underwriting had been fully financed. According to PW, various amounts of money totalling Pounds 15.8m were pumped repeatedly around the circle via three banks in the days after flotation. PW's inquiry - described as a preliminary investigation - was based on documents discovered at Jersey accountant, Bryant &amp; Co. Bryant managed several sub-underwriters for the flotation. Mr Kelvin Myles, a former Bryant manager who supervised some of the sub-underwriters, appears as a signatory for Oakwood. Documents appeared to show that money flowed from Bryant's account at Royal Trust in Jersey to Richmond's underwriting account at Barclays Bank in London. Richmond then lent a similar sum to Oakwood, which transferred funds back to Bryant. The PW report prompted an SFO investigation into dealings in Richmond and another company, Butte Mining. The SFO confirmed it was not investigating the current activities of Richmond. 'We are investigating certain share transactions . . . over 18 months ago,' the SFO said.</p>

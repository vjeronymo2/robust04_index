			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hisham Milhim from Washington] </F>   [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, the  Yemeni minister of planning and development, has told Radio  Monte Carlo that during his meeting at the United Nations with  the Aden representative, Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, both men  agreed on a mechanism to deploy observers under the supervision  of the UN envoy [Lakhdar Brahimi]. He added that discussion was  still continuing regarding Arab and non-Arab states that might  contribute to these observers.    The states that might participate in this effort include  Morocco, Oman, Egypt, Jordan, India, Nigeria, and Senegal.  [passage omitted]    Al-Iryani said that the UN secretary general will establish  a  special fund to which some member states will contribute to  finance the observers whose number is not expected to exceed  150. Al-Iryani added that his government will try to reach a  temporary emergency cease-fire for two days as a test of good  intentions and to give the International Committee of the Red  Cross an opportunity to bring a ship from Djibouti to Aden and  to send a land convoy to evacuate the wounded and extend  humanitarian and medical assistance. He also said that if the  cease-fire continues, the U.S., Russian, and French military  attaches in Sanaa will monitor the cease-fire before the  international observers are deployed.    Al-Iryani said that after the cease-fire has been  consolidated, Lakhdar Brahimi will ask the two sides to resume  the political dialogue adding that the dialogue may be held  either in Jeddah, Cairo, or in Paris, which is Brahimi's  headquarters.</p>

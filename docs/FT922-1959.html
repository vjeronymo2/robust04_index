			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Photoprocess cuts LIG profit A DROP in photoprocessing results caused London International Group, the consumer products and services company which makes Durex condoms in the UK, to report a dip in pre-tax profits from Pounds 17.4m to Pounds 16.9m in the year to March 31. LIG said these results reflected a good operating performance in health and personal products but a worse than anticipated downturn in photoprocessing services as a result of the continuing recession. Overall turnover rose by 7.8 per cent to Pounds 398.1m (Pounds 369.2m). The group took Pounds 22.5m of restructuring costs above the line, in line with the new accountancy draft standard. The restated comparable exceptional figure for the previous year was Pounds 21.9m. LIG's photoprocessing division saw operating profits drop by more than half to Pounds 5.9m (Pounds 12.5m) on marginally increased turnover of Pounds 119.5m (Pounds 117.3m). ColourCare continued to gain market share, but sales were cut by the recession and profits were substantially affected. ColourCare had seen some some volume pick-up since the year-end, but there was little sign that the photoprocessing market was improving. Traditionally, 60 per cent of photoprocessing volume is in the first half, with almost 40 per cent concentrated in July, August and September, so LIG said it was too early to make any comment on photoprocessing performance for the year. Health and personal products saw operating profits increase by 15.4 per cent to Pounds 42.7m (Pounds 37m) on turnover of Pounds 278.6m (Pounds 247.7m), up by 12.5 per cent. LIG said the condom business worldwide continued to grow at an average annual rate of 2 to 3 per cent, and overall the group's brands gained market share. As planned, Biogel surgeons' gloves came into operating profit in North America and continental Europe. In the US, Biogel had achieved more than 15 per cent of its target market, against 6 per cent last year. Throughout the UK and continental Europe, Biogel continued to increase its market shares. Following last year's announcement, all primary manufacture of surgeons' gloves had been transferred to the group's new factory in Malaysia. Closure of the UK plant, with the loss of 650 jobs, accounted for Pounds 13.4m of the exceptional item. On the restated basis, earnings per share fell to 6.34p (6.86p), but the final dividend was held at 6.25p, giving a total for the year of 9.45p (9.25p).</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Saga to buy North Sea oil field stake from Esso Saga Petroleum, Norway's largest independent oil company, is to buy a 50 per cent stake in the undeveloped, 80m-barrel Norwegian North Sea Fenris oil field from Esso Exploration and Production Norway. Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, is the field's operator and holds the remaining 50 per cent stake. This gives it pre-emptive purchase rights until the end of this month to acquire the 50 per cent shareholding sought by Saga. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Analysts in Oslo say Statoil is unlikely to exercise these rights, because it would want to spread the estimated NKr3bn (Dollars 620m) costs to develop the field. No other Norwegian oil field is wholly-owned by one company, they also noted. Fenris is in the southern part of the North Sea in 85m of water. A development plan for the field may be lodged with petroleum authorities in 1995 and, if approved, production could commence by the summer of 1996. Several development schemes are being considered, but because the field is not close to existing infrastructure, the development would have to include oil processing and off-loading facilities. The deal between Saga and Esso will also have to be approved by the oil and industry ministry, but this is not expected until Statoil declares its intention.</p>

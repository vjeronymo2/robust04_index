			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Manoj Joshi: "A Growing Sense of Disquiet"] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, April 27--During the Talbott visit to the  subcontinent earlier this month, U.S. officials candidly  accepted that the "Pakistan track" of their programme to  eliminate nuclear and missile capability in South Asia was the  "F-16s for capping" arrangement. But they claimed that they had  not quite formulated what they had in mind for India.    It would appear now, looking at the composition of the  Indian  delegation, that the London "secret" talks are being used to  discuss the "India Track" of the U.S. plan.    Also not merely some "principles" or modalities for a  multilateral conference to eliminate strategic weapons  capabilities in South Asia. The presence of Ms Meera Shankar,  commercial attache in Washington and Mr K. Santhanam, Chief  Adviser Technology in the DRDO [Defense Research Development  Organization] dealing with Indo-U.S. technology transfer issues  suggests that the talks will also take up India's taking  "interim" steps to halt the production of fissile material for  nuclear weapons, maintaining its cap on its Agni development, as  well as desisting from deploying the Prithvi missile system in  exchange for some commercial and technology transfer incentives.    The government's decision to use a retired diplomat, Mr N.  Krishnan to hold the fourth round of the Indo-U.S. dialogue on  capping India's self-defence capability in "secret," and that  too in a third country--UK--appears to defy commonsense and  logic. Depending on the point of view, it appears either  redundant or ominous. Not surprisingly, it has raised a storm of  protest in Parliament. The composition of the delegation appears  to be an effort by the senior-most bureaucrat in the Prime  Minister's office (PMO) to bypass the established official  channel through the Ministry of External Affairs. But even the  choice of the leader of the delegation appears questionable.    Mr Krishnan is a distinguished diplomat who has served the  country in a number of important and challenging assignments.  But he also has, according to many of his former colleagues,  strong and not-so-secret views in favour of India signing the  Non-Proliferation Treaty, something which the government is even  now saying it is opposed to.    Ever since the Prime Minister, Mr Narasimha Rao's meeting  with President Bush in New York in early 1992, India has been  committed to a dialogue with the United States on the nuclear  weapons issue.    The United States has made it clear that it would like to  see  the elimination of strategic weapons capability in South Asia,  i.e., ending India's unexercised option to make nuclear weapons  and its research and development programme for missiles. India  has, however, till now insisted that this policy is unrealistic  since it did not take into account India's wider security  concerns, viz. China.    Since March 1992, three rounds of dialogue have been held  till now with teams led by senior foreign ministry officials. So  why the change for the fourth round?    No clear explanation is available. The public relations  mills  at the PMO claim that the MEA [expansion not given] was not  executing the Prime Minister's policy efficiently. Some  suspicions that there may be more than just alleged MEA  incompetence emerged from the dismantling of the team set up by  the former foreign secretary, Mr J.N. Dixit, in his ministry to  focus on the dialogue. Some clues are now available from the  composition of the delegation to London.    The presence of Mr Satish Chandra, India's permanent  representative at Geneva is a fig leaf that cannot hide the lack  of a substantive MEA representation in the talks considering  that the first three rounds have been coordinated by them.    Mr Rakesh Sood, Director disarmament had to be included in  the team since he is, at present, the only official familiar  with various Indian negotiation stances at various bilateral and  multilateral fora on disarmament issues.    The presence of two other persons as well as the leader has,  as has been noted, provided an ample inkling to the nature of  the dialogue.    But whether this is good for India or not, that it can do  anything is another aspect. India has no institutional  arrangements such as a national security council to decide on  the issues. So policy has been made whimsically.    As it is there is now a growing sense of disquiet among  senior civil servants as well as armed forces officers at the  recent directions in India's security policies and the  "extra-constitutional" role being played by some elements in the  PMO in formulating them. Not unlike Europe, the nuclear and  missile capabilities in South Asia have stabilised the regional  situation notwithstanding the Kashmir rebellion.    Ironically, the "secret" talks are likely to increase  Islamabad's sense of unease rather than the other way around  since there is a belief there, conditioned by its perceptions of  New Delhi, that the improved tenor [as printed] of Indo-U.S.  relations is directed against Pakistan. There is some question  as to whether the United States knows what it is doing and,  perhaps more germane, whether India does.</p>

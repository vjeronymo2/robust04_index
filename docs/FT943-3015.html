			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / N Korea seeks fresh pay-off North Korea wants several billion dollars compensation if it agrees to demands to shut down its nuclear reactors, a Pyongyang negotiator said yesterday, Reuter reports from Berlin. That compensation would be in addition to international financing for a US plan to lower the risk of Pyongyang building nuclear weapons by giving North Korea new nuclear power technology. North Korea's delegation leader, Mr Kim Jong-u, speaking after five days' talks in Berlin with US experts, said there had been no agreement on the financing demands. 'Details of that will be discussed at higher-level talks,' he said. Talks are to resume in Geneva on September 23. 'There are two types of compensation,' Mr Kim said. One would be for buying new light-water reactors, and the other would be 'compensation for electric losses and investment after 30 years' of nuclear research and power generation. Asked how much North Korea wanted for its investment costs, Mr Kim said: 'Several billion US dollars.' The US has divulged nothing about the negotiations, billed as 'technical' talks as a branch of the main Geneva negotiations on ending a nuclear dispute between the two countries. Washington wants communist North Korea to switch from its graphite-moderated nuclear technology to light-water reactors that would be financed and supplied by a US-led international consortium. Mr Kim said his country wanted to increase its reactor capacity to 1,550MW by 2002. But he repeated Pyongyang's rejection of light-water models offered by South Korea, saying they were not advanced enough. The North Koreans are interested in technology from Russia or Germany.</p>

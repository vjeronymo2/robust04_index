			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Revolt against Washington: The US president's falling popularity will hinder Democratic candidates as they prepare for midterm polls On Tuesday Marion Barry, convicted four years ago on cocaine charges, was in effect elected for the fourth time as mayor of Washington, DC. On Monday Oliver North, whose criminal conviction on Iran-Contra offences was only overturned on a technicality, was basking all over Virginia in the day-long company of Senator Robert Dole, titular head of the party of Abraham Lincoln. There might not seem much in common, beyond brushes with the law and political ambition, between Mr Barry, whose Democratic primary victory virtually assures that he will get his old job back on November 8, and Mr North, who has a good chance of becoming the next US senator from Virginia. But their very disparate supporters - poor and black in the nation's capital and disgruntled and white in the contiguous state to the south - are saying pretty much the same thing and it resonates across the country. The message, which amounts to 'we want ours', is that the disenfranchised and dispossessed, as they see themselves, have had enough of the political establishment. It was a voice heard loud enough in the 1992 presidential elections when 62 per cent of the country voted for Bill Clinton and Ross Perot and against the Washington status quo. But now it is the Democrats who represent the establishment. Mr Clinton's message of 'change' is faltering in the public perception while the party cannot hide the fact that it has ruled Congress largely uninterrupted for the past 40 years. For the Democrats, the triumph of the disgraced and discredited Mr Barry is simply another embarrassment. For Mr Dole, who earlier this summer had expressed reservations as to whether Mr North was the sort of person he wanted representing his party in the Senate, the prospect of any Republican gain on November 8 is now reason enough to cast personal doubt aside. He has, after all, always fancied his instinct for the jugular and the Democratic throat is invitingly exposed. Its margin for safety in the congressional and state midterms, especially in the Senate, is slim. It commands the Senate by 56 seats to 44, the House by 256 to 178 (with one independent) and the governorships by 29 to 19 (with two independents). As usual, Democrats are defending far more seats than Republicans and anything much worse than the average loss incurred by every new president in maiden midterms since the war - four in the Senate and 26 in the House - could hand the Senate back to the Republicans for the first time since 1986. A real Democratic debacle, unlikely as it may be, could produce a Republican House, last seen in 1954. It may seem odd that this should be so, given the relative health of the US economy, the dominant issue in Mr Clinton's election two short years ago. But the midterms, with their focus on local issues and personalities, rarely are driven by national themes. The public mood remains very sour on politicians in general and on Democrats in particular. Mr Perot may only intermittently visit this planet and his nascent political organisation, United We Stand, still rests in the cradle. But his supporters, all contactable on computerised registration lists, are increasingly identified with Republican, not Democratic, positions. Voter turn-out, compounded by Democratic disaffection, is likely to be typically low, which favours the more motivated Republicans, above all the zealots on the right. Mr Clinton's own popularity, now 40 per cent and falling, is of no help to Democratic candidates who are distancing themselves by the dozen from him. The failure to pass meaningful healthcare reform has deprived the president and his party of a prime domestic issue, while the crime bill was so messily approved that credit is hard to claim. The Democratic national committee is in disarray, its young Clintonista chairman, David Wilhelm, put out to pasture, with the White House political staff under Leon Panetta too preoccupied in Washington to fill the void. Foreign policy is not intruding much but the prospect of an unpopular invasion of Haiti does not help Democrats, except possibly with blacks. Opposition to illegal immigration is a popular cause in California and Florida, providing rich pickings for two incumbent governors in tight races, Pete Wilson, the California Republican, and Lawton Chiles, the Florida Democrat, both only too willing to blame local problems on Washington mismanagement. The immigration issue suggests that the strain of isolationism so evident in the 1992 campaigns of Perot and Pat Buchanan, the Republican conservative, is still virulent. Although only a handful of incumbents was turfed out in party primaries this year, holding office is probably no more of an asset now than even in 1992. Up for grabs on November 8 are 35 Senate seats, 22 held by Democrats; all the House; and 36 governorships, 21 of them in Democratic hands. Open seats, created mostly by retirement, leave the Democrats further exposed since they occupied six of the nine Senate seats and 49 places in the House. Additionally, as many as 35 of the party's large House freshman class appear vulnerable. In the Senate, a six, not seven, seat Republican net gain is all that is required in practice, since Senator Richard Shelby, the Alabama Democrat, as often as not votes with the opposition and could even be tempted into switching sides. The best Democratic hope at present seems to be to limit the haemorrhage to four or five seats. But the list of its endangered species is disturbingly long. It even now includes Maine, where Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, would have walked back in had he not chosen retirement but where Republican congresswoman Olympia Snowe is now favoured. Ohio, Arizona, Michigan and Oklahoma are incumbent-less Democratic seats at serious risk, while at least three prominent senators, Dianne Feinstein in California, Harris Wofford in Pennsylvania and Frank Lautenberg in New Jersey, appear in the tightest of races. Even presumably rock-solid Democratic seats, such as those held by Edward Kennedy in Massachusetts and James Sasser in Tennessee, are now, according to local polls of varying reliability, fragile. It does, however, boggle the mind that Mr Kennedy, 32 years a Senator, might lose to Mitt Romney, son of George Romney, a fleeting favourite in the 1960s for the Republican presidential nomination. Offsetting this, the Democrats retain some hopes of picking up the open Republican-held seats in Minnesota and Wyoming and conceivably that occupied by Conrad Burns in Montana. They also console themselves with the knowledge that a lot can happen in two months. The realistic Republican target in the House seems to put control beyond reach, but a 30-seat pick-up would give the party more seats than it had held in 40 years and would surely shift the chamber's ideological balance appreciably to the right. This would be manna from heaven for Congressman Newt Gingrich, the aggressive conservative from Georgia who is virtually certain to assume the Republican leadership. Some of the wafer-thin margins of victory won by the administration on issues such as the budget, trade and the ban on automatic weapons would be hard to replicate. Republican control of the Senate would not mean business as usual for either President Clinton or the rest of the world. Columnist William Safire of the New York Times recently noted with barely disguised glee some of the consequences for key committee chairmanships if power were to change hands. Senator Jesse Helms, the rightwing scourge of all liberally-inclined diplomats and foreigners, could, if he wanted, have foreign relations, unless he chooses to protect his North Carolina tobacco farmers by taking agriculture. Strom Thurmond, age 91 and hardly less conservative with the passing years, would succeed Sam Nunn at armed services. Al D'Amato would surely turn the banking committee into a running forum for Whitewater charges. It is a partisan team that would give the White House fits and pretty much ensure short shrift for any presidential policy initiatives in the next two years. Intriguingly, the Republicans stand on the brink of what would be a relative nirvana without necessarily offering much of a coherent alternative of their own to the policies of President Clinton and his party. The party's own severe fault lines between its traditional centre and hard-line right remain palpable and a potential handicap for the national campaign in 1996. Nor, history suggests, would a midterm disaster for Mr Clinton necessarily consign him to the 1996 presidential wastebasket. House seats lost in both Eisenhower's and Reagan's first midterms (18 and 26 respectively) were larger than the 15 and eight of 1978 and 1990 under Jimmy Carter and George Bush, who did not survive the next elections. But that may be a small consolation if the morning of November 9 lives up to Mr Dole's expectations.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US MIDTERM SEATS: UP FOR GRABS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Virginia: the Senate race  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The incumbent:     Democratic two-term senator Chuck Robb The challengers:   Ollie North, Republican; Doug Wilder, former                    Democratic governor running as independent; Marshall                    Coleman, independent Republican  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- California: governorship  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The incumbent:     Republican Pete Wilson.

At the conclusion of three days of debates and works  in small committees, gathered at the National Theater, about 100  delegates representing the nine geographic departments of the  country demanded the formation of this government consisting of  Notary Public Raoul Kenol; industrialist Charles Plaisimond, and  Cap-Haitien Court of Appeal Judge Louis Toussaint.    This government's mission is to normalize conditions,  promote  national reconciliation, and restore the authority of the state.    The congress, which was held on the initiative of the Great  North citizens group, calls for general concerted action and  condemns the embargo ordered against Haiti. The delegates  brought their principal voted resolutions to the office of the  Chamber of Deputies in the hope of enforcement as a matter of  urgency.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas has said that the Cyprus  report UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali submitted to the  Security Council was prepared with prejudice and condemns the  Turkish Cypriots.    Assessing the report to journalists today, President Denktas  pointed out that the report was drawn up unilaterally, based on  threats. He added: The UN is trying to make its scenarios  accepted by disregarding the feelings of the Turkish Cypriots  and through artificial answers to problems.    Denktas stated that the confidence-building measures were  sacrificed when the UN Secretariat General reached an  understanding with the Greek Cypriots and turned the nondocument  into a proposal. It is unacceptable, Denktas stressed, that the  Turkish Cypriot side should be easily blamed in the report when  it displayed so much goodwill.    Denktas stated that the report was announced before there  was  time to properly assess his meeting with Feissel. He said: The  report hides several truths by claiming that Greek Cypriot  leader Kliridhis is ready to implement the confidence-building  measures.    The president recalled that Kliridhis accepted the  confidence-building measures only for the purpose of tactics.  Denktas also criticized Butrus-Ghali for having said in the  report that he doubts if an agreement can be reached even if the  changes demanded by the Turkish Cypriot side are made. Denktas  added: This shows how the honorable secretary general views the  Turkish Cypriot community and what kind of feelings there are  between him and the Turkish Cypriot leadership.    Denktas stressed that Butrus-Ghali does not have the right  to  say such a thing. He added: Had they included the changes they  promised us -- for the good of our people, as they said -- in  the 21 March document, and had we rejected that, then he would  have the right to conclude what he concluded.    The president said it is very regrettable that Butrus-Ghali  is acting with prejudice. Denktas recalled the remarks in the  report which say: At the end of one month of efforts to reach  an agreement, we have lost hope from the Turkish Cypriot leader.    Denktas pointed out that during that month of talks, efforts  were made to ensure that the promises made to the Turkish  Cypriots were fulfilled.    Commenting on the coercive measures mentioned in the report,  Denktas said: They have been using coercive measures against us  in the form of embargoes for the past 30 years. Undoubtedly,  they can do worse things. People who defend their rights cannot  be defeated by coercive measures. If the UN does that, it will  be the greatest shame for the UN Security Council. Denktas  stressed that coercive measures would unite the Turkish Cypriots  and the Turkish nation. This must be well thought of, he said.    On Butrus-Ghali's contention that the Turkish Cypriot side  lacks political will, Denktas said: We have political will.  This political will will be used in line with the 30-year  development of Cyprus realities. It is our political will that  makes us resist the Greek Cypriot Administration which has been  recognized as the legitimate government of Cyprus for the past  30 years. We have the steel will to sign any balanced agreement  that is based on the sovereignty of two equal partners, and that  does not weaken Turkey's guarantees.    Denktas pointed out that the report says that the Turkish  Cypriots had bitter experiences before 1974, and that the  current efforts aim to prevent the recurrence of such  experiences. Denktas said: It is impossible to see from New  York what can affect the basic security and political stand of  the Turkish Cypriots.    Denktas said Butrus-Ghali claims in his report that Denktas'  stand will lead to grave results as far as the prosperity of the  Turkish Cypriots are concerned. Denktas said: All this depends  on the assessment of the Turkish Cypriots. The main thing is  our political equality and future, Turkey's guarantees. We will  continue to reject anything that casts a shadow over these.    Denktas pointed out that the two sides must come together to  diagnose realistically and assess why the problem has remained  unresolved for the past 30 years. The only reason why the  problem has remained unresolved, he stressed, is because the  guilty party has been accepted as the legitimate government of  Cyprus.    Denktas denied the allegation that the Turkish Cypriot side  ignores international requests. He stated that the Turkish  Cypriots themselves complain that the international community  ignores their rights. He said: If we are to be punished  because we do not accept their pressures, the Turkish Cypriots  can easily face this punishment.    The president pointed out that the report mentions an  alternative to the talks on confidence-building measures --  talks on the 1992 maps and set of ideas. Denktas said: On  behalf of all my people, I say a strong no to that, never. That  package is dead.    Denktas stated that the confidence-building measures will  not  be complete unless the rights promised to the Turkish Cypriots  are given to them. On the alternative of an international  conference, Denktas said: The Turkish Cypriots would  participate in such a conference only as the Turkish Republic of  Northern Cyprus. We will never participate in such a conference  unless our status is recognized. Also, we will reject any  decision to be reached at a conference where we are not  represented.</p>

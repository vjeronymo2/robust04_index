			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special Dispatch" by staff reporter Hu Hsiao-i (5170 2556 </F> 0308): "Guangdong Organizes Army-Police Joint Discipline Teams  to Investigate Bogus Army, Police Vehicles"]    [Text] Guangzhou, 25 Apr (TA KUNG PAO)--Commencing  tomorrow, the Guangzhou Military Region, Guangdong Military  District, and Guangdong Public Security Department will take  joint action to crack down on the use of bogus Army and police  vehicles.    The 20 joint disciplinary teams, each composed of 80 men,  have been organized jointly by the Guangzhou Military Region,  Guangdong Military District, and Guangdong Public Security  Department, will leave Guangzhou tomorrow for the  Guangzhou-Conghua, Guangzhou-Shenzhen, Guangzhou-Shantou, and  Guangzhou-Nanhai highways to check the violation of regulations  by military and police vehicles and crack down on the illegal  use of bogus military and police vehicles.    This is the third unified action following the ones in 1991  and 1993 against vehicles with special plates. The current  action will be the largest in scale and will last a long  time--until the conclusion of the struggle against the theft of  motorcycles and vehicles. The headquarters--which will have  Chen Shaoji, director of the Public Security Department, as its  head and an official in charge of the Guangzhou Military Region  as deputy head--will continue to exist and exercise management  over special vehicle plates.    This reporter also learned from the Guangdong Public  Security  Department that since moves were taken to counter the theft of  motorcycles and vehicles on 1 April, the number of stolen  vehicles has dropped by two-thirds and that of motorcycles has  dropped by 50 percent.    Figures provided by the Public Security Department indicated  that, by 20 April, the province arrested a total of 1,781  persons involved in stealing motorcycles and vehicles, cracked  2,086 theft cases (12 of which involved murder), uncovered 396  rings (which had 1,600 members) involved in stealing and selling  stolen vehicles, recovered 1,560 stolen vehicles and motorcycles  (267 vehicles and 1,293 motorcycles), smashed 120 dens which  sold the stolen goods, and demolished 4 underground factories  which produced counterfeit license plates. Moreover, a total of  351 shops were ordered to close down for selling remodeled and  stolen cars, and the licenses of 29 other shops were revoked.  An official from the Guangdong Public Security Department said  that, thanks to the precautions and stern measures taken against  the criminal activities, the sharp rise in the theft of  motorcycles and vehicles in Guangdong has been brought under  control. In the first quarter of this year, the province lost  an average of 16 vehicles and 72 motorcycles every day. Since  April, the figure has dropped to 5.4 vehicles and 42 motorcycles  a day, representing a drop of two-thirds and 50 percent  respectively. Except for Zhuhai, where the crime rate remained  the same, the crime rate in 19 cities throughout the province  dropped by varying degrees.    Since launching the special struggle, public security organs  have transferred large number of policemen to react promptly to  ongoing criminal cases and investigate and crack these cases as  quickly as possible. They have acted to intercept and examine  vehicles, and conduct patrols, ambushes, and general check-ups.  The taxi looting incident that took place on 3 April in Foshan,  and the car theft and murder that took place on 10 April in  Maomin were both cracked within the short period of 3 and 12  hours respectively. The primary objective of the move was to  uncover crime rings. The Zengcheng Public Security Bureau  spotted a very large ring in early April, which had stolen 29  vehicles and motorcycles worth 9 million yuan. The bureau has  recovered 12 vehicles, 3 motorcycles, and over 200,000 yuan of  ill-gotten money.    The work of returning recovered stolen vehicles and  motorcycles to their owners also started recently. Shenzhen  took the lead and returned 200 motorcycles and 78 vehicles to  their owners on 23 April. Over the next three days, Guangzhou  will also follow suit and set up centers at various districts to  return stolen goods to their owners.</p>

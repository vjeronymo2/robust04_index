			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAKERS SIGN OLDHAM TO 10-DAY CONTRACT  </P> <P> Believing they needed another experienced backup center in preparation for the  NBA playoffs, the Lakers on Monday signed journeyman Jawann Oldham to a 10-day  contract.  </P> <P> To make room for Oldham, a nine-season veteran coming back from reconstructive  surgery on his left knee in March of 1988, the Lakers waived Steve Bucknall.  </P> <P> The Lakers already have three centers -- starter Mychal Thompson and reserves  Vlade Divac and Mark McNamara. But concern about Thompson's injured left heel  and ankle, plus Divac's inexperience, apparently persuaded the Lakers to sign  the 7-foot Oldham.  </P> <P> Oldham, an excellent shot-blocker before having the knee surgery, was waived by  the Sacramento Kings before the season. He played in 15 games for the Santa  Barbara Islanders of the CBA, and recently played in three games with the  Orlando Magic. SAM McMANIS  </P></p>

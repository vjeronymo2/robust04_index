			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Aborigine land fund setback The Australian Senate, the federal parliament's upper house, yesterday referred the government's contentious Aboriginal land fund legislation to a select committee for further examination. The move came despite warnings from Senator Gareth Evans, the government's Senate leader, that this could trigger a 'double dissolution', that is, a dissolution of both houses, necessitating fresh elections. The legislation proposes to establish a ADollars 1.4bn (Pounds 680m) land fund by 2004, through a series of government payments over the next 10 years. By using the money to make land purchases, the fund would aim to help dispossessed Aborigines who are unlikely to benefit from last year's Native Title legislation. The proposed structure of the land fund and the relatively low level of financing have been criticised by some Aboriginal groups. In recent weeks, the Senate, where the government does not have a majority, has made a large number of amendments to the bill. But the government refused to accept these and returned the legislation to the Senate. Yesterday, Senator Evans, Australia's foreign minister, warned the government would treat a select committee reference 'as a failure to pass this legislation within the meaning of the Constitution, Section 57'. This states that if legislation passed by the House of Representatives is rejected or obstructed by the Senate twice within certain time limits, Australia's governor general may dissolve both houses simultaneously. The notion that the government will seek to call an early election, before the economic outlook clouds, has circulated for some months, and the land fund hiatus could provide an excuse. But, in issuing his warning, Senator Evans emphasised yesterday that the government was not looking for an 'artificial trigger'. Meanwhile, Senator Brian Harradine, an independent whose vote was crucial to securing the committee referral, pointed out that a double dissolution trigger was already in place because of the Senate's decision to reject certain immigration-related legislation.</p>

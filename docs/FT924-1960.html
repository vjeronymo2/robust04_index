			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Money Markets: French futures fall CURRENCY futures through-out Europe fell back sharply yesterday as dealers had mixed feelings over the outcome of the European Community's weekend summit in Edinburgh. Some dealers felt that it had failed to ease tension on the foreign exchanges, writes James Blitz. There may have been little reason to believe that EC leaders would come up with a plan to ease European interest rates or tensions in the exchange rate mechanism. However, dealers had got it into their heads that such moves were possible, and were consequently disappointed at the result. The March French franc contract was worst hit, falling 40 basis points to a low of 90.68. This assumes that three-month money will be at 9.32 per cent in the spring, a high level considering that the Bank of France's intervention rate is at 9.10 per cent. In spite of the Edinburgh accords on the EC budget and the Danish referendum, the view of one dealer yesterday was that the French franc 'remains firmly in the melting pot'. With no cut in the Bundesbank's official interest rates, dealers believe pressure on the franc will remain intense into the new year. Three-month French francs were yesterday quoted at between 11 1/4 per cent and 10 7/8 per cent, a very high level considering that France appears on the verge of recession. With one-year money trading at 9 1/2 per cent, the sloping yield curve suggests that the market believes a cut in official interest rates is inevitable sooner or later. Euromark futures also fell back yesterday on disappointment over the events in Edinburgh. The March contract declined 8 basis points to a close of 91.92. German call money rates were steady at around 8.90-9.00 per cent yesterday and dealers expected them to remain high this week as demand rises in line with December tax payments. The sterling cash market stayed calm. Three-month money ended marginally firmer at around 7 3/16 per cent, from 7 1/8 per cent previously. This partly reflected the pan-European disappointment on German rates. But there is uncertainty over the shortages that the Bank of England will declare this week. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 950m yesterday and Pounds 10m of late assistance was provided.</p>

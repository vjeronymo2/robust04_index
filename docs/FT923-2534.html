			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Sterling over the cliff THE END was both swift and expensive. With base rate up to 15 per cent and perhaps as much as Pounds 9bn of foreign exchange intervention thrown in too, the UK government put the public's money where its mouth has long been. But it was not enough. The ERM policy became unsustainable because no British government can defend a parity at the price of a slump. Now the policy has collapsed and the government must start afresh. The crisis is not limited to the UK. The ERM itself is under threat, at least outside its inner core. The 7 per cent devaluation of the lira over the weekend already seems insufficient, while the Spanish peseta is also falling fast. The British government must have wanted to hold on until this weekend's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Yet it would be wrong to exaggerate the significance of this vote. French affirmation of the treaty had earlier been expected to renew the journey towards economic and monetary union. But that vote may now not make much difference to the future of the ERM, since the prospect of Emu is so remote as to be almost invisible. The dwindling plausibility of Emu has left the ERM naked. What has been needed to clothe it is reconciliation of the Bundesbank's desire for lower inflation with the hope of the rest of Europe for sustainable economic growth. This conflict of objectives, following German unification, has not created purely economic difficulties. It has undermined the European harmony that the ERM was intended to promote. Evident conflict Nowhere has this been more evident than in comments made sotto voce by German policymakers about British policy and, more openly, by far too many British politicians about the Germans. The conflict was evident at the meeting of European finance ministers in Bath earlier this month. It was implicit in naive remarks from Downing Street that Monday's tiny German interest rate cuts had 'probably brought forward the time when British interest rates will move'. They did, but the direction was inevitably upwards. Some will criticise the British government's tactics: its failure to raise interest rates earlier, for example, or more sharply at first yesterday. But either measure might have been viewed as a sign of panic, not of determination. It is easier to criticise the way the government reiterated its desire for lower interest rates, except that the wish would have been evident even if it had never been expressed. Less feasible Continued economic stagnation is what made this policy impossible to pursue. Indefinite continuation of rates of interest of 15 per cent would have been still less feasible. When the government said the chances of realignment were zero, it was being economical with the truth. The chances were hugely greater than zero, because the costs that would be endured to avoid devaluation were bound to be limited. Now, with the sensible decision to suspend sterling from the ERM, the macroeconomic policy of the government is in a shambles. First it tried monetary targeting. Then, starting in 1985, the Treasury tried to target the exchange rate. Now it must think policy out from scratch. One possibility is to try to clamber back into the ERM as swiftly as possible. But the argument for joining an ERM that seemed to have credibly fixed exchange rates is different from the one for joining the present unstable version, even if it survives in a recognisable form. The alternative is to continue floating. This would give the government a higher degree of interest rate flexibility. That, combined with a depreciation, should allow some recovery, though inflation will probably continue to fall for some time. The challenge would be to take advantage of the new opportunity, while preventing the loss of all those hard won disinflationary gains. This is a defeat. It is a defeat for the British government's economic policies, just as it is a defeat for European co-operation. But life goes on. The British government will have to find new ways of achieving non-inflationary growth. It will also want to renew co-operation in Europe. Despair cannot be afforded, still less envenomed recrimination.</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Gloomy view of housing market despite loan rise A rise in new lending by building societies in November was a sign of increasing market share rather than a housing recovery, the Building Societies Association said yesterday. In a pessimistic assessment of the housing market, the association said prospects were still bleak and that the market was likely to remain subdued for some time. The comments came as the association published statistics showing that both gross net new lending last month was higher than in November last year, and also higher than in October. The figures also showed a net inflow of retail savings for the fifth month running. The total of Pounds 301m was the highest for November since 1988. Savings usually fall before Christmas as people withdraw money for festive spending. However, Mr Adrian Coles, director-general, said the strong savings figures could be explained by weak retail sales, the rise in interest rates since the start of the year, and pre-Budget consumer caution. 'The pattern may not be continued in December if consumers have delayed Christmas shopping in order to pick up last-minute bargains,' he said. Mr Coles said underlying factors such as low consumer confidence still pointed to a very weak mortgage market. New net lending was almost 30 per cent higher in November, at Pounds 1.02bn compared with Pounds 788m the previous month and Pounds 880m in November 1993. New gross lending was Pounds 3.07bn in November - against Pounds 2.79bn in the same month last year, and Pounds 2.91bn in October. Net new commitments - loans agreed but not yet undertaken - rose by 13 per cent to total Pounds 3.19bn last month compared with Pounds 2.81bn in October.</p>

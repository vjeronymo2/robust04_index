			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Gornostayev report in the "Details" column: "Two </F> Sides of Partnership for Peace. Kozyrev and Kostikov Have Meant  Different Things"]    [Text] By the end of last week Russia's top officials gave  the press cause to talk about confusion within the state  structures on a foreign policy issue currently being given much  prominence: Russia's joining the Partnership for Peace program.  Or rather, about the time frames mentioned last Friday [1 Apr].    As is known, during U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's  visit to Moscow in mid-March his Russian colleague Pavel Grachev  stated that the Russian Federation will sign the Partnership at  the end of March. On Thursday, 31 March, Russian Federation  presidential press spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov announced that  the process of acceding to the Partnership could take between  six to seven months, thereby shifting, as it seemed, the date  for joining the program at least until September-October.  Citing Boris Yeltsin's opinion, Kostikov attributed this to the  fact that the "Partnership for Peace formula does not quite  correspond to the scope of Russia's political and military  power." Next day, Friday, Russian Federation Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev told journalists that Russia will accede to the  Partnership as early as April.    It turned out, however, that the presidential press  secretary  and the head of the Foreign Affairs Ministry were speaking about  different things. Subsequently Kozyrev's supposition that  Kostikov was misunderstood was also confirmed.    Commenting Saturday, at the request of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's  correspondent, on the current situation, Russian Security  Council Deputy Secretary Valeriy Manilov said that "everyone who  has commented on the Partnership for Peace has meant different  things: First, the intention to join the framework agreement,"  which is only a statement of intent and does not impose any  obligations on the signatory. This was also what Andrey Kozyrev  meant. Second, there is also "another aspect: a representative  [prezentativnoye], individual agreement with NATO defining  specific terms on which the state intends to cooperate with this  bloc within the Partnership for Peace framework."    Owing to its strategic importance, the resolution of this  question, as it appears, is not the domain of separate  departments. In the very near future, the Partnership -- its  substantive, not declarative, part -- will be considered by the  Russian Security Council, which will task the corresponding  structures to develop and substantiate Russia's position on  Partnership for Peace which would not be detrimental to its  national interests. After this the Russian Federation president  will make a decision in the shape of an edict or his approval of  the Security Council protocol. Then, according to Valeriy  Manilov, "I suppose that this decision will be presented to  parliament for ratification."    Yesterday Pavel Grachev stated that his department's and the  Foreign Ministry's views on Partnership for Peace coincide. In  addition, he said that he does not see any disagreements on this  issue between the government and presidential structures,  referring to his talks with Yeltsin.</p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Tomkins' US strategist receives Dollars 15m reward MR RICHARD CARR, the man who fashioned a crucial US expansion for Tomkins, the UK-based conglomerate, has received Dollars 15.1m (Pounds 10m) for his efforts. The US move probably secured Tomkins' growth as one of Britain's largest companies. The payment, modest by the standards of many US style incentive packages, is believed to be one of the largest made to a working British director. Mr Greg Hutchings, Tomkins' chief executive, said that without the three US acquisitions made by Mr Carr, Tomkins would not have survived the recent recession in the UK. Mr Carr, who remains international mergers and acquisitions director, received the payment in March in accordance with a 1987 agreement set up when Tomkins was seeking to expand through acquisition but was not prepared to start a US office. Beating a path first trodden 14 years earlier by Lord White, who led the successful US acquisition programme for Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, Mr Carr set up a one-man office in a New York apartment in 1987 to find Tomkins potential targets. But unlike Lord White, who was employed by Hanson when he crossed the Atlantic, Mr Carr was not employed by Mr Hutchings and was required to invest Dollars 160,000 of his own money, which he would have lost had the acquisitions failed. Mr Carr would not comment yesterday, leaving Mr Hutchings to field questions. He said: 'We knew nothing about America and we had no contacts. I wanted to incentivise him but put him on risk. I was not prepared to put someone there and find three years later we had not made an acquisition.' Mr Hutchings said Mr Carr 'had a lot of downside and we had no downside'. Mr Carr only joined Tomkins' executive team after he made the first acquisition in June 1987, the Dollars 113m purchase of Smith &amp; Wesson, the handgun manufacturer, and the conglomerate set up a US office. Tomkins then acquired Murray Ohio for Dollars 228m in August 1988 and Philips Industries for Dollars 550m two years later. Mr Carr's 1987 agreement stated that he would be entitled to an interest of 10 per cent 'in the growth of the assessed value of businesses he identified which Tomkins purchased', according to the Tomkins annual report published yesterday. These three US businesses generated sales of Dollars 1.72bn and earnings of Dollars 75.2m in the year to May 1992, entitling Mr Carr to the Dollars 15.1m payment. Mr Hutchings denied the decision to buy out Mr Carr's interest suggested Tomkins would make its next acquisition in the US. Tomkins is currently digesting last year's Pounds 935m acquisition of Ranks Hovis McDougall, the milling and baking group.</p>

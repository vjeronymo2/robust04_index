			<p>BFN     [Text] According to People's Deputy Uladzimir Zablotskiy,  deputy chairman of the Belarusian Popular Front [BNF], BNF  leadership is considering the option of creating the Front of  National Salvation [FNV]. "The state is being surrendered,  therefore all must be abandoned in order to deal with this  issue," Zablotskiy said, having in mind the signing of the  Belarusian-Russian documents on the monetary merger of both  states. It is planned that the creation of the FNV will be  discussed with other democratic organizations.    Zablotskiy also stated that the BNF parliamentary opposition  will demand that the 14th Supreme Soviet extraordinary session  put on its agenda the issue of responsibility of the Belarusian  Government leadership for the violation of the Constitution by  signing the agreement on a monetary merger between Belarus and  Russia. In particular, according to Zablotski, part 2 of  Article 8 forbids signing international agreements that  contradict the Constitution. Moreover, the Russian-Belarusian  agreements of 12 April, while providing for the location of the  money issuing center in the Central Bank of Russia, violate  Article 1 of the Constitution, which stipulates that the  Republic of Belarus will conduct its domestic and foreign policy  on an independent basis, as well as Articles 141 and 145, which  entrust the Bank of Belarus with the sole right to implement  money and credit policy. All these violations threaten the very  fundamentals of Belarusian statehood, said Zablotskiy.</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Sport: Seles set for high-decibel showdown - Tennis TO GRUNT or not to grunt, that was the question for Monica Seles at last year's Wimbledon. In the final against Steffi Graf the world champion remained silent and lost 6-2 6-1. At the time I was convinced that her lacklustre performance was due to the conscious effort she made to change the habit of a tennis lifetime. Any athlete forced to operate on the conscious level is doomed. For the first time since that Wimbledon meeting, the two rivals for the world No 1 ranking clash again in today's final of the ADollars 6 (Pounds 2.6m) Ford Australian Open at Flinders Park, Melbourne, worth ADollars 410,000 to the winner. Although Monica has lowered her average decibel level in the six matches that have taken her to her third consecutive final here, that is only because she has slaughtered the opposition. In her quarter-final against Julie Halard, where she failed to convert three match points and lost her first set of the tournament, she was positively snarling as she reeled off the last six games for victory. The grunting issue is never far away. Irritated by the constant media questions, the disgruntled champion said at the start of the meeting: 'I just don't want to keep talking about it. If I grunt, fine. If I don't grunt, that's fine too.' After her 6-1 6-2 destruction of the world No 3 Gabriela Sabatini in a semi-final on Thursday, the champion was positively . . . well, gruntled. 'I played a good game today. I just kept concentrating and when the pressure was on I played quite well.' That simple understatement reveals the total belief in her own ability that is the foundation of Monica's greatness. Make no mistake, this remarkably unathletic teenager is already a great champion. She has reached the final in 33 of the last 34 tournaments she has played and won 22 of them, a run that includes six Grand Slam wins from seven consecutive finals. In her four-year professional career she has won 242 matches and lost 28, a winning average of 89.6 per cent, and a player on the way up usually loses more matches than she wins. Chris Evert can better this - just - but only if you take her entire career. Her record is: won 1,309; lost 149; average 89.9 per cent. Graf's record is almost as impressive. In her ten years as a professional she has won 591 of 667 matches for a winning average of 88.6 per cent. Graf and Seles now rule women's tennis as completely as Evert and Martina Navratilova did in the early 1980s. Their clash in this first great Championship of 1993 should launch us on another year of intense rivalry. Although Graf leads 6-3 in career meetings, the first three wins came as Seles made her grand entrance on the tour in 1989 by reaching the final of the French Open unseeded and taking a set from Graf. The intriguing thing about today's match is that both women are improving. Seles is serving much better than she did last year and shares the lead with Jennifer Capriati for the fastest recorded delivery among the women in Melbourne, an impressive 169kph. She is also volleying with enthusiasm. In the first game of her match against Sabatini there was a two-handed drive volley and a beautifully struck sliced backhand volley of which Navratilova would have been proud. Graf, too, is volleying occasionally and is thumping that forehand as well as ever. She has also reverted to her excellent sliced backhand as her basic shot on that wing, an admirable decision because the ball skids through fast and low off the Rebound Ace surface. Seles will spend much time this afternoon digging up low balls as Graf speeds about the court to find the crosscourt angles that will expose the double-hander's lack of reach. The outcome, therefore, is likely to depend upon the mental qualities of the two. This is where Seles has the edge. This intelligent teenager has a mind like a steel trap. Against Graf in the French Open final last year, after being thwarted on four match points at 5-3 in the final set, Monica twice had to serve to stay in the match. She never flinched, and when she sensed Graf's resolve weakening, the jaws snapped shut. She has been equally canny here. Asked about playing Graf in the final she said: 'Steffi is going to serve very strongly . . . she is playing great tennis with great tempo, very strong on both sides . . . I will just have to go for my shots.' In the men's final tomorrow the holder and world No 1, Jim Courier, and the number two seed, Stefan Edberg, meet for the eighth time. Edberg has won four of their meetings, his last victory - the US Open final of 1991 - revealed the 25-year-old Swede at his greatest. Since then their only meeting has been last year's Australian final, won by Courier in four sets. At these Championships Edberg has celebrated both his 27th birthday and a welcome return to top form - in spite of a back spasm during his fourth round win over Amos Mansdorf that threatened to end his challenge. In 1989 and 1990 he was forced to retire from the Australian Open with injuries and it has taken courage for him to continue. His 7-6 6-3 7-6 semi-final win over third seeded Pete Sampras yesterday was heroic. The American led 4-0 in the first set but Edberg, easing himself into the match, stepped up the tempo with some devastating returns of serve and typically athletic volleys that finally destroyed Sampras's confidence. Courier, the top seed, was equally impressive in beating Michael Stich 7-6 6-4 6-2. Only once, at 1-2 in the first set, was the American behind. Once he had recovered the break of serve he proved that the basic qualities of groundstroke control can usually beat a rampant serve-volleyer on relatively slow courts. This 100th Grand Slam Championship of the open era has been an impressive meeting for the one-sidedness of the later rounds in the men's event. Not since the US Open of 1977 have all four men's quarter-finals and both semi-finals been won in straight sets. Someone must be doing something right.</p>

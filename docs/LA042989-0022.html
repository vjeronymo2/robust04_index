			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SENATE OKS COMMERCE OFFICE IN COUNTY; VETO APPEARS CERTAIN  </P> <P> The Senate Thursday easily approved legislation to force the state Commerce  Department to open an office in San Diego County to aid the development of  business between companies in the United States and Mexico.  </P> <P> But the measure, passed by the Senate 34-0 and sent to the Assembly, appears  headed for a certain veto, just as a similar bill was rejected last year by  Gov. George Deukmejian. Both bills were carried by Sen. William Craven  (R-Oceanside).  </P> <P> Deukmejian objected last year to the cost of the new office, which would need  about $200,000 a year to operate, according to the Commerce Department. And the  lobbyist for the department said Thursday that the state still lacks the  resources to open an extra Commerce Department outpost in San Diego.  </P> <P> "The problem is money," said Rich Allen, the department's legislative  coordinator. "There just isn't the money to open an office -- not that we don't  want to."  </P> <P> Allen said the department does "a land-office business" at its offices in San  Jose and Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "San Diego, being the second largest city in the state, I'm sure that we could  do business there," he said. But Allen added that San Diego is served  adequately by the department's other offices.  </P> <P> Craven said the office is warranted because San Diego is the "gateway" to the  Pacific Rim's Latin American sector.  </P> <P> As the California city bordering the United States' third-largest trading  partner, San Diego has become increasingly involved in the maquiladoras program  -- under which U. S.- or foreign-owned companies build plants on the Mexican  side of the border that produce or assemble products destined for sale in the  United States.  </P></p>

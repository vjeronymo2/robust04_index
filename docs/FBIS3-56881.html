Yegor Gaydar Tells Journalist Leonid  Radzikhovskiy Why He Resigned"]    [Text] [Radzikhovskiy] Yegor Timurovich, what do you  feel? Relief? Disappointment? Concern?    [Gaydar] You know, all those things together, everything at  once. It was not a spontaneous decision, certainly not an  "outburst of emotion." It was a considered political decision.  At the same time I naturally had doubts until the final second.    [Radzikhovskiy] You mentioned as reasons or, to be more  accurate, grounds the decision on financial union with Belarus  and the decision to allocate $500 million to construct the new  parliament building. Was this the final straw?    [Gaydar] No, this was not the reason nor even the grounds,  it was more an example or sample of the grounds, of which a  great many had accumulated. But, of course, the problem which  we were discussing...    [Radzikhovskiy] Discussing where?    [Gaydar] In the bureau of the "Russia's Choice" faction in  the Duma.... That problem is far more serious. In general, the  alternative was this: Either I could stay on, using the  opportunities provided by the post of first vice premier but at  the same time increasingly serving as a screen for a policy with  which I disagree, or I could ensure total political clarity at  the price of losing my post. In recent weeks my real political  scope within the cabinet had shrunk drastically.    [Radzikhovskiy] To what do you attribute that?    [Gaydar] Now we are coming to the most important question.  Ultimately the isolated resignation of a minister or group of  ministers is what is known as a "ministerial crisis" and is  generally of interest only to a specific group of people -- the  political elite, diplomats, bankers, and so on. But in our case  the situation is different. This resignation is not an episode  of "infighting behind the scenes." I see it as a manifestation  of very important, very serious political and, if you like,  historical trends. Social strata in our country are now in a  powerful state of flux. And this resignation is an outward  manifestation of this flux. There is a perfectly clear logic  here.    [Radzikhovskiy] Did it begin with your return to the  government in September of last year?    [Gaydar] No, I would say that it all began earlier, last  summer. That was when we -- a group of reformers, people with a  clear democratic orientation -- announced the creation of the  "Russia's Choice" movement. Strategically several things were  clear: The authorities are experiencing an extremely grave  crisis that they cannot resolve "from within," they need  powerful external support and an external fillip; the ideology  of reform is losing support among the people and it is not  proving possible to create a really broad socioeconomic stratum  of "reform people"; we are on the threshold of another  "stagnation of reform" with its most dangerous features --  inflation, a collapse in production, and so on. All this  provides a breeding ground and forms a "culture" for real plague  bacteria -- for fascism in Russia. Without whipping up  passions, I can say that it is now impossible to imagine  anything more terrible than this. So my main aim and the aim of  my colleagues throughout this time has been the same: to do  everything possible to halt the process.    [Radzikhovskiy] Did you cope successfully with this task?    [Gaydar] We sought various methods of solving the problem.  It was obvious that the power crisis was mounting far faster  than we could build our movement. Think back: Summer and then  the early fall of last year were a period of a real leap in  inflation and paralysis of power. The president-Supreme Soviet  parallelism reached its zenith. The authorities began simply to  skid on the spot like a car, and all that the "motor" did was  fuel inflation.    [Radzikhovskiy] All we were missing for total disaster was a  mass fascist party....    [Gaydar] Yes, correct. Had there been such a popular party,  it could easily have infiltrated itself into the gap between the  president and the Supreme Soviet and could easily have  steamrollered the Supreme Soviet (which was absolutely morally  prepared for this) and seized power "legitimately" or otherwise.    [Radzikhovskiy] And at this moment you received an offer to  join the government.    [Gaydar] I could not refuse. As you know, I was perfectly  well aware of the role of "fireman for hopeless causes" that lay  in store for me. I was perfectly well aware of how difficult it  would be to curb inflation -- the economic mother of fascism.  It was obvious that once I had done my job...    [Radzikhovskiy] "The Moor can go"?    [Gaydar] At any rate that there would be forces in the  government that would want this. But at the time I thought in  the following terms: Urgent measures must be taken simply to  bring about an immediate improvement in the situation. Only  once the political process had been somehow stabilized, a degree  of controllability at least had been created in the country, and  the spreading blaze of inflation had been extinguished would it  be at all possible to hold elections and prepare and accumulate  the forces for progress.    [Radzikhovskiy] Which elements of this plan succeeded and  which did not?    [Gaydar] Everyone can plainly see the events, and everyone  assesses them in their own way. In my view, it did nevertheless  prove possible to smash the dyarchy, albeit at terrible cost  (unfortunately it was smashed rather than rectified). One  danger disappeared. The president played the main role here, of  course. We, my colleagues (especially B. Fedorov) and myself,  succeeded in breaking the trends in the inflationary process.  On this the figures speak for themselves: In August inflation  was running at 26 percent, in September 23 percent, in October  20 percent, in November 16 percent, and in December 13 percent.    [Radzikhovskiy] Fedorov said that if this trend continued,  it would be possible to bring inflation down to 5 percent by  March or April.    [Gaydar] Yes, I think this would have been entirely  possible.    [Radzikhovskiy] How did you manage this?    [Gaydar] There is no secret here, nor any universal  prescription. In September we immediately decided to halt the  provision of soft loans. The mechanism is well known:  Commercial banks and other structures receive huge sums from  the state at low rates of interest and then either resell this  money themselves at immeasurably higher rates or do something  else with the "free" money and turn it to their own advantage.  That is, thanks to soft loans billions and tens of billions of  rubles are conjured up out of thin air, or to be more accurate  out of the exchequer.    Incidentally, this does not just do economic harm. This is  also an extremely powerful source of corruption (after all,  these "loans" are often granted in exchange for providing  similar "interest-free loans" to the functionary who has  "extracted" the loans). It is also a terrible source of  "commercial depravity." This is often ignored -- to no avail.  When money is made "out of nothing" -- whether by playing the  casino or "playing the exchequer" -- this corrupts business  itself. The "honest sweat" of business is devalued. What is  the point in engaging in really difficult, tricky, and creative  commercial activity (including finance) if it is all so simple?  Get a soft loan and you have already achieved commercial  results. There is a dangerous fusion of the financial and  bureaucratic elites here.    In addition, we got import subsidies ended. These subsidies  were introduced when the ruble's exchange rate against the  dollar was drastically understated. At the time this was  justified. But since then the exchange rate had changed  sharply; the purchasing power of the dollar in our market is now  dozens of times lower than it was in 1991. Yet the import  subsidies remained. Here the problems were the same as with the  soft loans, there was the same "radioactive source" of  corruption. The same ruining of the exchequer and provoking of  inflation.    [Radzikhovskiy] Are these the kind of measures that are  described as "monetarism"?    [Gaydar] If this is "monetarism," then what is "common  sense"? I have long since realized that you cannot carry  "political water" only in an "economic sieve." The elementary  sensible, self-evident measures I have listed (and there were a  whole series of others) are capable of halting and changing the  process. But nevertheless they will not produce a radical  change. There is a need for a powerful social, political will.  If this is applied, if this bolsters a sensible economic  policy, you get a regrouping of fundamental political forces,  and then the crisis is soluble. But if this political will is  lacking...    [Radzikhovskiy] Then what happens is what is happening?    [Gaydar] But political will is not the arbitrariness of an  individual person. Under a democratic system the political will  of the leader and government is the product of the political  process, the product of voters' political will. No matter how  imperfect the mechanism of universal and equal elections may be,  it is the only method for the nonviolent resolution of social  contradictions. In September 1993, when I joined the  government, the plan was approximately as follows: To eliminate  the most acute phase of the crisis through sensible economic and  political moves; then to win the elections; to acquire powerful  new political impetus on the basis of the elections; and,  relying on this, to begin a new, decisively important stage in  the reforms. I think we succeeded in carrying out the first  part of the task. But we lost the elections. And the  subsequent stages are stymied. Now we must pay for this. After  the elections we lost a considerable proportion of our influence  in the government. The government's policy began to change:  First, many people think that the most acute stage of the  crisis is over....    [Radzikhovskiy] And that means there is no further need for  Gaydar?    [Gaydar] And that means that I have no further unconditional  moral need at any rate to remain in the government.    But there is one more element of decisive importance. Our  influence has declined largely under the influence of the  voters' verdict. We are that part of the cabinet which has put  itself and its policy before the voters' court. Our relative  failure at the elections largely predetermined our withdrawal.  I would say it predetermined the rationality and expediency of  our withdrawal.    And another thing. I know that there is a category of  voters, perhaps not excessively versed in political subtleties,  who argue more or less as follows: Yes, there is a danger of  hyperinflation and of power moving toward imperial nationalism  and so forth but as long as Gaydar is in the government that  will not happen. I am far from exaggerating my own role, but  there is that feeling among a certain part of the population.  Gaydar in the government is a reassuring factor suggesting that  "everything is within normal limits." So there is no longer  this reassuring awareness. Let someone's brain start sounding  alarm bells, that is far better than complacency.    [Radzikhovskiy] How do you explain the failure at the  elections?    [Gaydar] I see the main reasons in the fact that so far we  have not managed to create a powerful social class which  consciously supports the reformist course. Enormous masses of  people, the majority of the population, have adapted to the  reforms, but they do not comprise the political aktiv of  reformist policy. Enormous masses (up to 20-25 percent of the  adult population, I believe) have started to live better and  have been able to use the reforms, but they have not made up the  political aktiv of a party of aware reformers.    It is not only a matter of the living standard. People often  ascribe their successes to themselves personally (and rightly  so!) and their defeats to the system, for instance excessively  high taxes on medium and small entrepreneurs.    In other words: Today a new, powerful integrating political  idea is needed. A political idea from the liberal and  democratic camp and not Zhirinovskiy's so-called Liberal  Democratic Party.    [Radzikhovskiy] What new idea are you talking about?    [Gaydar] I do not know how it should sound at the semantic  level. I see its meaning approximately as follows.  Economically, a stable society with low inflation and freedom  and safety for economic activity. Purposeful efforts are needed  to form a healthy middle class rooted in this land and proud of  its country, its business, its prosperity, and its healthy  Russian bourgeois nature. A bourgeois nature does after all  include qualities like honesty, precision, responsibility,  sobriety, and thrift. Economically we have done far from  everything that is needed for that. There are means of really  reducing taxes without creating enormous holes in the budget.    The new democratic idea also has another side. At present  our state cannot be considered democratic. Once again the  ossification of bureaucracy is taking place. Once again the  alienation of the state and its apparatus from the people has  been intensified. The production of new "partymobiles" and 500  million on the construction of a palace for the Duma and so  forth are only the tip of the iceberg, the small visible part of  this process. And people, who are in fact democratically  inclined, "took their revenge" for this at the elections.    [Radzikhovskiy] They took their revenge on "Russia's  Choice"?    [Gaydar] Yes. I hope they were choosing the wrong target  for their vengeance. But while we were in government, while we  acted as the leaders of the "democratic nomenklatura," the  voters were indeed unable to understand. In reality the  "democratic nomenklatura" is to a tremendous extent a myth. The  nomenklatura does not need to recruit the "broad masses" of  democratic politicians and even demagogues. The nomenklatura  largely remains as it was before. It has drawn back very  slightly and swallowed up the "best" democratic cadres, absorbed  them, and returned to its initial position. "The Neva was  clothed in granite."    There is an ethical and a political aspect here. If  everything is clear ethically -- the "stone fundament of  bureaucracy" is again outweighing the head of democracy -- then  this does after all lead to political consequences.    [Radzikhovskiy] The alliance of bureaucracy and corrupt  capital under cover of fascist demagogy?    [Gaydar] Absolutely right. That is the closed, rotten,  truly "Weimar" atmosphere in which the terrible homunculi of  fascism are born. If democrats today have no powerful new idea,  those people always have an idea ready -- the idea of national  grievance, national arrogance, a national inferiority complex  reaching hysterical imperial proportions.    [Radzikhovskiy] An ever-living and ever youthful idea.    [Gaydar] But how to draw a clear boundary between national  dignity and national hysteria? That is the question. I believe  we must be the party of Russian national dignity -- the dignity  of the Russian man's intelligence. A new state purge is a purge  of bureaucratic arrogance, of bureaucratic cruelty and  corruption, free enterprise, the opportunity for honest,  dignified life and labor -- that is what a Russian resurrection  is. We must explain that the resurrection of hatred is the  resurrection of scoundrels, adventurists, and aggressors. That  is the "Russophobia" they seek everywhere except in the mirror.    [Radzikhovskiy] And you need a free hand to build such a  party?    [Gaydar] Unless the democratic movement is consolidated, the  slide toward fascism about which we were speaking will become  reality. Palace intrigues, corruption, populism, and  saber-rattling combine here. A terrible cocktail! If it is  used to poison the people there will be a real catastrophe which  all the horror which Russia has experienced will pale beside. I  know that this cannot be stopped either by bureaucratic methods  or by purely economic edicts or by parliamentary fighting. We  must use all these methods but the main thing nonetheless is a  mass-based democratic movement. A party.    [Radzikhovskiy] And this party's attitude toward the  president?    [Gaydar] We support the president. We must return the  president's link with the people, return Yeltsin to Yeltsin, if  you like. The president has been strong through his openness to  the broad masses of society. That must be restored.    [Radzikhovskiy] Yegor Timurovich, but do you see yourself as  a "pure" politician and as a leader and creator of a party? The  squabbling, the minor and petty ambitions, the empty talk --  will you withstand all this inevitable prosaic aspect of party  life?    [Gaydar] We are only beginning and you are already  frightening me.... As long as I have a sensible goal and  understand that we are not wasting our efforts, that we are  doing what I believe in, albeit slowly, albeit in zigzags, then,  of course, I shall pull this cart as best I can.</p>

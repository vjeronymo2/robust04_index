			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> JEWISH COUNCIL SUED BY RABBI'S FOLLOWERS  </P> <P> Followers of the ultra right-wing Israeli Rabbi Meir Kahane are suing the  Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles, contending they were  wrongfully excluded from two upcoming Jewish festivals.  </P> <P> Kach International, which says its members look to Kahane as a spiritual  leader, contends that it was improperly denied permission to set up booths at  Jewish festivals scheduled at Pierce Community College in Woodland Hills on  April 9 and Rancho Park in West Los Angeles on June 4.  </P> <P> Kahane, an American who emigrated to Israel, is a leader of the radical Kach  Party, which advocates expulsion of Arabs from Israel.  </P> <P> The federation excluded Kach International because it represents an unpopular  point of view, said Barry Fisher, an attorney for Kach International. But  federation spokesman Ron Rieder said the organization has the right to keep  politics out of its festivals.  </P></p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (8): Grey skies and Disney - How will the Pounds 2bn complex, near Paris, function off-season? WHEN THE Pounds 2bn Euro Disney project opens outside Paris in just seven weeks' time, most attention will be focused on the theme park's attraction as a leisure destination for children and adults wanting to experience Disney's unique brand of entertainment. But the Euro Disney resort could also become one of the most significant European conference and incentive travel destinations in the 1990s. Disney's management is only too aware that, while the theme park will be filled to bursting during the opening, summer months, it will prove more difficult to attract visitors out of season. The 1,900-hectare complex - about a fifth the size of Paris - contains six hotels and about 5,000 bedrooms to fill every night. Disney is emphasising the resort nature of the area, located some 32km east of Paris, but knows that when the weather is bad and children are in school across Europe, then it will need conference delegates to help fill those rooms. Already there is considerable interest in using Euro Disney as a conference destination, says Mr Chris Jarvis, Euro Disney's UK manager for conferences and incentives. 'Paris is already the most popular short-haul destination for conferences and incentives out of the UK,' he says. 'But we're finding the level of inquiries and bookings well ahead of projections.' Not surprisingly, Disney does not want to name UK companies which have already booked conferences in the theme park but they are understood to include several large concerns. Conferences will be accommodated in a purpose-built convention centre adjacent to the Hotel New York, one of the six themed hotels on the Disney property and which is likely to be used as the main conference hotel. Other hotels range from the 'moderately priced' Hotel Sante Fe (with about 21 square metres of room space) through to the first-class Hotel New York (31 square metre sized rooms) and the de luxe Disneyland Hotel (34 square metres). The convention centre will offer 3,000 square metres of multi-purpose meeting space, able to accommodate from 20 to 2,000 delegates, although the latter number might be a bit of a squeeze. Facilities include all the expected ability to tailor-make the space for particular requirements, as well as 16 projection rooms which Disney claims are the most advanced in Europe. 'Every city in the US has a hotel conference venue on this scale, but the situation is different in Europe,' says Mr Jarvis. 'We will be the only place in Europe offering this kind of facility.' What Disney also has to offer will undoubtedly become the biggest single tourist attraction in Europe over the next decade. The Euro Disneyland theme park, similar to the Magic Kingdoms in Florida and California, will be joined in two years' time by a second park, based on the Disney-MGM Studios in Florida's Walt Disney World. Disney is well aware, however, of potential criticism that a theme park resort is not the most conducive location to keeping conference delegates working. 'The conference centre is located well away from the theme park, so there is no direct overlap with the park,' insists Mr Jarvis. 'We have considerable experience in helping to construct itineraries, which enables delegates to enjoy both a conference and the facilities that the resort has to offer.' After the park closes to the general public - which will be early evening at less popular times of the year - Disney is expected to allow large conferences (of more than 500 delegates) to make use of one of the themed lands within the park for a private party. 'This must be the ultimate incentive - to have exclusive use of Adventureland or Fantasyland for a party,' adds Mr Jarvis. Disney has yet to decide whether or not it will allow alcoholic drinks in the theme park for these private parties (alcohol is banned at all other times), although it does permit drink when the park is opened for private parties at Disneyland in California. Alcohol is freely available in all the hotels, so conference delegates are unlikely to stay dry for long. At night delegates will also be able to enjoy the nightlife at its Entertainment Centre (similar to the Pleasure Island complex at Walt Disney World), including discos, restaurants, and a live Wild West Show. Conference and incentive trips to the new Euro Disney resort, however, are likely to be short - up to three nights on average - although some organisers might combine a trip with a night or two in Paris as well. Disney's determination to woo the conference and incentive business to its newest park is a far cry from its approach to attracting such business several years ago at Disney World in Florida. At that time, conference and incentive groups were not actively sought as the then Disney management felt that this would detract from the park's fun image. But under the leadership of Mr Michael Eisner, Disney's chief executive since 1984, the company has taken a more realistic view of the attractions of high-spending conference business. It has recently opened two new convention facilities at Disney World, adding more than 90,000 square feet of meeting space. In all, it now has some 600,000 square feet of meeting space on site. One of the new convention centres is 40,000 square feet of space at Disney's most prestigious hotels, the 900-room Grand Floridian. The other is a 51,000 square feet complex at the Contemporary Resort hotel. But Disney is not just after the massive conventions market. It has launched a service called Priority One geared solely to booking meetings of less than 50 delegates. 'We provide smaller groups with the same Disney amenities we offer larger groups,' says Mr George Aguel, vice president in charge of conferences and incentives. To help organisers, it has also published a detailed guide to the resorts amenities, including on-site catering facilities and meetings space. Moreover, it can put together special themed parties for conferences. 'With a cast of thousands available to us, any type of themed party is possible - from a country hoedown to a beach party,' says Mr Aguel.</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / A crowd with only one aim: armed rebellion - John Lloyd witnesses the turmoil on the capital's streets THE CROWD, gathering in October Square under the capital's largest Lenin statue, wasted no time on speeches. With tough young men, many in camouflage, in the vanguard the crowd launched itself on the police line across the Moscow River bridge just past Gorky Park. It was a march which by nightfall would take many of them into a pitched battle with forces loyal to President Boris Yeltsin in a fight for control of Moscow. The speed of their advance along the ring road left police and interior ministry trucks and buses abandoned: these were smashed, their contents looted. From one, bizarrely, came a big carton of Wagon Wheel biscuits, which were grabbed hungrily. 'See what the democrats give to their defenders', screamed one woman.' I can't buy these for my kids'. At Smolenskaya Square, in front of the Foreign Ministry, the police again tried to hold them with smoke bombs and water cannon: again they were swept aside. Between the Foreign Ministry and the US Embassy, also on the ring road, a bus full of troops was surrounded by men and women hurling rocks through the windows as the troops huddled behind their shields. A few leaders tried to tear away their enraged comrades, shouting: 'Don't waste your time, get to the White House'. Through the perfect autumn afternoon the crowd swept on towards the parliament building. As they surged up to the barricades blocking the entrance to the White House, automatic fire rang out. Most dived to the street or cowered behind trees and lamp posts. The firing, however, seemed mainly into the air - though it was then, probably, that a policeman was shot dead and another injured. Again the troops fell back and scattered. The crowd broke through and charged up the ramp and round to the back of the parliament, where they were embraced by the long-term defenders. On the balcony stood a cheering group of deputies and staff. Then, to a huge cheer, out came General Alexander Rutskoi, his bodyguards holding a flak jacket before him as he gripped the microphone. His suit freshly-pressed, he addressed the crowd. 'All able men who wish to join us, form yourself into detachments before the White House. You'll be given arms: we'll take the mayor's office and then Ostankino (the TV centre, some 4-5 kms away)'. Some 30 to 40 armed defenders then attacked the mayor's office. A captured truck was reversed against the barred glass door, smashing it back into the foyer. The firing stopped. Minutes later troops sheltering in the building smashed through a window to one side and trotted away across the street as White House defenders contemptuously fired into the air above them. The crowd invaded the mayor's office, taking hostages almost at once. Their captives were spat on and beaten. Behind the building, some dejected soldiers led by a corporal named Alaxander were also held captive. Asked if he would now join the parliamentary side, he said: 'I don't want to fight against the people . . . I can't answer that.' A doctor standing by said three people had been injured seriously. Many of the White House defenders wore flashes with 'Russian National Unity' on them; others wore a swastika-like device. Mr Ilya Konstantinnov, one of the hardest-line deputies and a leader of the Russian Unity political bloc, appeared to be in command of the operation. 'Now,' he called to the men, 'forward to Ostankino'. The crowd, many waving sub machine guns, baying with victory, swept back up the New Arbat - to meet a second crowd of thousands of demonstrators coming along the inner ring from the direction of the Foreign Ministry. The crowd, which had begun the day at 5,000 - 10,000 strong had now grown to 30,000 - 40,000. All were intent on going to Ostankino, hated for its unequivocal support over the past two weeks for President Boris Yeltsin. Round the ring road they went, the banners out now - mostly the Soviet red flag and a few portraits of Stalin. As they passed the newly refurbished US embassy, they chanted, in Russian and English - 'Yankee Go Home' or 'Sovyetsky Soyuz' (Soviet Union). Ostankino appeared lightly guarded. It was already dark when the frontal assault began, with heavy explosions punctuating the machine gun fire. From within the building, fire was returned. Behind the front line, youths smashed fences to form barricades and build fires. 'What the devil do you think your hands are for?' one demanded. 'Help us]' By 11pm the firing had grown heavier and more frequent. Bullets raced down the avenue leading to the centre, forcing people to their bellies. Fires had broken out on the first floor and the deployment of the armoured personnel carriers seemed to have halted the advance of the parliamentary forces.</p>

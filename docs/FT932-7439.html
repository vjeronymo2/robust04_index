			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Companies warned on terror cover: 'Immense pressure' to raise rates INSURERS have warned that moves to increase the cost of terrorism insurance following last month's Bishopsgate bomb in the City of London could reduce the effectiveness of a new government-backed re-insurance scheme and leave many businesses unprotected from the IRA. One insurer close to Pool Re, the mutually-owned reinsurer, said: 'The real danger is that higher premiums may discourage people from taking out the cover.' The company was 'coming under immense pressure' from the government to increase its rates, he explained. But this would undermine the scheme and 'send the wrong signals to business'. Pool Re was set up after insurers withdrew terrorism cover from commercial policies in the wake of the IRA's mainland bombing campaign last year. The reinsurer pays claims only until its own funds - which are generated by new terrorism insurance premiums - are exhausted, with the government meeting at least 90 per cent of further costs. Take-up of the new terrorism policies has been more limited than expected and claims of more than Pounds 400m from the Bishopsgate bomb will exhaust the new company's funds. Last week Mr Eric Coward, chief executive of Pool Re, said in a letter to insurance companies - which collect premiums on Pool Re's behalf - that a rate review was under way. He said companies should not quote rates for terrorism cover for policies coming into effect after July 1. Any quotation already offered should be withdrawn immediately unless it had been accepted. The Department of Trade and Industry said on Friday that no decision about rate increases had been taken, although the department pointed out that insurance companies themselves had signalled that rate increases would be necessary following last month's bomb in London. The DTI also stressed that for most businesses terrorism premiums represented a relatively small proportion of overall costs. A city-centre office block valued at Pounds 10m would pay a premium for terrorism of between Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 12,000, an amount equivalent to rental payments for two days. Mr Mike Jones, chief executive of the Association of British Insurers, said, however, that costs were sufficient to lead many businesses to take a chance on terrorism. 'The more premiums go up the more businesses and local authorities will not buy the cover.' Failure by government and the insurance industry to agree rate rises could increase pressure for a compulsory levy. The Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce (Airmic), which represents insurance buyers at about 300 UK companies, favours such a solution.</p>

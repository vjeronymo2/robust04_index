			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has decided to form a Unification  and Security Policy Coordination Council that will be in charge  of summing up and adjusting policies on national unification and  security to prevent confusion in policies on the North Korean  nuclear issue.    The Unification and Security Policy Coordination Council was  organized in a meeting on 7 April of security-related ministers  presided over by President Kim Yong-sam. The council will hold  meetings once or more a week with the vice unification minister  as the chairman and the foreign and defense ministers, and the  senior presidential aide on foreign affairs and security will  analyze and examine the prevailing security situation and  coordinate various offices' opinion. Anyone of the council  members can immediately call a meeting of the council.    Proposing the organization of the Unification and Security  Policy Coordination Council, President Kim Yong-sam asked  security-related ministers to consult with one another more  efficiently and to cope with situations promptly.    Regarding the rumor on North Korea's possession of nuclear  weapons that was recently reported by some media, today's  meeting came to the conclusion that there is no clear evidence  to prove that North Korea possesses nuclear weapons at this  point of time.    In addition, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae reported that  there has been no particular moves by the military around the  truce line or in other areas in North Korea.</p>

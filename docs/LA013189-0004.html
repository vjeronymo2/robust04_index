			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> H. BRADLEY JONES; LEGAL SCHOLAR  </P> <P> H. Bradley Jones, a nationally prominent tax lawyer who helped found what its  attorney members called simply "The Group," a band of legal scholars who fought  successfully for the right of professional people to incorporate, died Saturday  at St. John's Medical Center.  </P> <P> He was 69 and his family said he died after a short illness.  </P> <P> A 1945 graduate of Harvard Law School, Jones' civic and professional  affiliations fill more than two single-spaced pages of his professional resume  while his writing and speaking credits involve nearly four more.  </P> <P> Most of his activities took place in corporate board rooms or before tax and  appellate courts. But in 1982 he briefly became a public figure when he spoke  out on what he and many colleagues saw as potential devastation in federal  tax-increase legislation, specifically its effect on private pension and health  plans.  </P> <P> Jones warned at the time that without incentives to set up private pension  plans, professionals who are already incorporated would dissolve their  corporations, leaving their employees without retirement and health rograms.  </P> <P> Years earlier he had been the driving force behind "The Group," having written  an article for the autumn, 1958, Fordham Law Review that became a rallying call  for the incorporation movement.  </P> <P> Survivors include his wife, Mary, two daughters, a son and four grandchildren.  </P> <P> A funeral service will be held at 11 a.m. Thursday at All-Saints Episcopal  Church in Pasadena.  </P></p>

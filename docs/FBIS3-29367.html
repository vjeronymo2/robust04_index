The move is to  be taken on President Kim Yong-sam's instruction that public  servants learn management expertise from the business circles in  light of the need to increase the nation's competitiveness, the  official said.    Five teams of officials are being sent to the training  centers of such companies as Samsung, Kolon and Lucky-Goldstar.  The first eight-member team attended the Samsung Training  Center in Yongin, Kyonggi Province, on Feb. 14-16. They  listened to lectures on business survival strategies, new  administrative skill, and ways to increase competitiveness in  the world market along with other participants from private  companies and government bodies.    "The lectures' contents seemed somewhat unfamiliar, but they  were still helpful," an official said.</p>

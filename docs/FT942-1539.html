			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Survey of Korea (6): Pyongyang must wait - Investment in the north Though it sounds unlikely, North Korea hopes to compete successfully with ther Asian countries in attracting foreign invest- ment. For the moment, the policy is on hold as the US attempts to co-ordinate UN sanctions because of the ref- usal of Pyongyang to allow inspectors access to its nuc- lear facilities. But in the long term, the government hopes foreign investment will save the economy and incidentally sustain North Korea's polit- ical system. Pyongyang needs overseas investment because the North Korean economy has moved into sharp reverse. The collapse of the former Soviet Union has cut off the nation's most important sources of foreign trade, previously representing half of all trade. The North Korean economy shrank in 1990, 1991 and 1992, according to Dr Hongstack Chun, fellow of the Korea Development Institute. Latest figures from the South Korean central bank suggest it fell 4.3 per cent last year. Professor Aidan Foster-Carter of Leeds University estimates North Korea's GNP last year at only Dollars 20bn, the same as a single year's GNP growth in South Korea. Faced with a growing economic crisis, the Pyongyang government has been mesmerised by the success of reforms across the border in China. The North Koreans have already emulated Chinese legislation to create the right legal environment for invest- ment, according to Dr Chun. Special investment areas, similar to Chinese special regions, have also been created. These include a site at Nampo near Pyongyang aimed at South Korean inv- estment, and another near the Chinese border. Tourist areas are also being created in the Kumgang mountains near the demilitarised zone, and Paektu on the Chinese border. However, the most advan- ced project is the Tumen River Area Development Programme which has been co-ordinated by the United Nations Development Prog- ramme. This region is at the junction of the borders of North Korea, Russia and China. The rationale is that the North Korean coastal zone would provide sea-access to northern China, explains Mr Jacob Guijt of the UNDP. However, progress has been slow and recently the Chinese and Russians have proved less than enthusiastic partners, he admits. Indeed, the North Koreans' efforts have not proved part- icularly successful anywhere. So far, the only invest- ments have been small-scale projects by Korean Japanese sympathetic to Pyongyang. 'The North Koreans been really disappointed,' says Mr Anthony Michell of Hong Kong-based consultants Euro-Asian Business Consult- ancy . 'However, it takes about two years between considering an investment and actually putting building the plant. The programme only really started recently, so there's still time.' One reason for the absence of investment is the north's continuing unwillingness to repay loans to the inter- national banking community. The principal sum amounted to Dollars 747m, although that has doubled because of interest. In addition, some loans to the former Soviet Union dating back to 1949 still remain unpaid. Another reason for the international community's reluctance is the failure of most of the Japanese-Korean joint ventures. Some North Korean business practices have also been questionable. Infrastructure, or rather lack of it, is another concern. 'There are no container facilities at the ports,' explains Dr Chun. 'More than 80 per cent of travel is by rail and the trains have an average speed of 40kph.' North Korea does have some advan- tages, how- ever. Mr Michell points out that labour is well- educated, disciplined and highly productive. The internal market represents about 22m potential con- sumers. In addition, there are huge mineral and forestry resources. The north, a cheap manufacturing location at the heart of one of the world's fastest-growing regions, would also provide access to nearby markets in Japan and China. In the long term, all agree the north and south will be united. North Korea would offer a cheap point of entry to a market of about 70m consumers, says Mr Michael Breen of Merit, the Asian consultancy. 'There would be no tariffs from the north to south - they're the same country. There's bound to be investment over the next six months, although it depends on the Asian investment cycle. By 1996, North Korea could be on the cover of Newsweek as the new Vietnam,' enthuses Mr Michell.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  NORTH KOREA: ECONOMIC INDICATORS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        1989       1990      1991      1992    1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Real GNP growth        2.0%      -3.7%     -5.2%     -5.0%     n/a Rice production ('000 tons)          6,400      5,900     5,300       n/a    1,300 Population           21.0m      21.4m     21.8m     22.2m    22.6m                    Dollars     Dollars    Dollars   Dollars Exports             1.69bn     1.86bn    1.40bn    0.92bn      n/a Imports             2.90bn     2.93bn    2.31bn    1.55bn      n/a Trade deficit       1,219m     1,073m      902m      630m      n/a External debt          n/a        n/a     4.7bn       n/a      n/a Exchange rate*        0.94       0.94      0.96      2.16      n/a  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Won/Dollars: average  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Economist Intlligence Unit  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

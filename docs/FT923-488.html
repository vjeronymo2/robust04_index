			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Derivatives: Stiff test for the banks' risk management systems THE past fortnight has provided a stiff test for the skills of banks active in the swaps and other derivatives markets. Has the huge cost of systems in recent years - built both to manage risk and to make it possible to price complex financial instruments - been money well spent? The answer is: 'Not entirely'. The crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism has revealed some of the weaknesses in banks' risk management systems for two reasons. First, computer models developed from historical data have in many cases been subjected to the most extreme market conditions they have yet had to face. What looks fine on the laboratory bench does not always work so well in practice. 'It was almost impossible to keep track with where you were,' said an executive at one bank in London. 'Any arbitrage opportunity, where you are talking about two or more instruments, became very difficult.' The speed of events was one reason for this. Valuing derivatives portfolios takes considerable computing power. 'The systems take a long time to crank out the answers, and when they come, the market's changed,' said this executive. The scale of the volatility also made it difficult to keep up with events. Some banks discovered that the parameters built into their models simply were not broad enough to cope with events. 'Any model can cope with 15 per cent interest rates. What no models can cope with is 1,000 per cent rates,' said an executive at another bank. The foreign exchange markets, which saw the most active trading, are immune from most of these problems. Dealers have less need for real-time information, since they do not face the same difficulty in marking their positions to market. 'In the heat of the moment you don't rely on the system to keep your position - you keep your own,' said a risk management executive at National Westminster. It isn't possible to trade in derivative markets in the same way. The second weakness in risk management that has been exposed in recent days has been lack of liquidity in some financial markets. Managing risk is only possible if there are markets and instruments available in which those risks can effectively be laid off. The sterling swap market, for example, was left high and dry on the day that the currency left the ERM as the money markets dried up. The lack of a liquid money market made it impossible to price a swap, or to value a sterling swap portfolio, making hedging equally impossible. It was a case of waiting for normal market conditions to return, and then hoping that your bank came out as one of the winners rather than one of the losers. It was highly timely that the International Swap Dealers Association should have held a conference in London last Friday on risk management. Mr Michael May, head of derivatives marketing at Westpac, was one of several speakers to point to liquidity as an important concern: 'Is anyone brave enough to say that the Ecu swap market will still be here in five years time?' The experience of recent days has given senior managers in some banks - and banking regulators - a taste of what extreme market conditions can do to financial institutions' risk controls. The outcome was not catastrophic, but that may provide scant consolation if allegedly foolproof systems failed to cope. It is all reminiscent of the 1987 stock market crash. Then, so-called 'portfolio insurance' was meant to have eliminated the market risk from holding securities. In practice, such promises of risk-free investing proved unfounded. One of the main things to come under scrutiny will be the volatility assumptions built into risk management systems for derivatives. These are built on historical data, which is used to project how instruments will trade under most circumstances. They do not pretend to cover all market conditions. Most work on a 'confidence level' of about 95 per cent. That is, they are based on the assumption that a particular instrument or market has traded within a certain range at least 95 per cent of the time in the past, and so can be expected to do so in the future. The trouble is, 'worst-case' situations can be devastating when they occur. Referring to the high confidence level used at Bankers Trust, Ms Marion Robieson, head of product risk at Bankers Trust in New York, said at the Isda conference: 'In practice, you almost never reach this level - except when you grossly exceed it.' How many senior bankers realise this - and are they happy to live with the consequences, given the enormous volatility in financial markets demonstrated recently? Another risk management expert said: 'Senior management have to accept that these are trading markets, and that not everything can trade within a 95 per cent confidence level.' It may be, though, that the experts have failed to get this message across. There is certainly a lot of communicating that needs to be done in the coming weeks. As Mr John McCormick, head of Bank of America's financial engineering and risk management group in London, said: 'Senior management will be asking, in the light of recent events, what we're doing here.' He can be sure that Bank of America certainly will not be alone.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Crop worries put wheat market through the mill - World stocks remain tight and harvest prospects now seem less bright than they appeared at first If the ash comes out before the oak, they'll be a soak. But if the oak comes out before the ash, they'll be a splash. This year, in Norfolk anyway, the buds on oak trees came out first, indicating, according to that usually reliable sore that the coming summer may be characterised by occasional light showers rather than steady downpours. Should that turn out to be the case cereal yields will be adversely affected. For in spite of the freshening rain of last weekend - which was itself a crop-saver on many farms - soils will quickly dry out as temperatures increase and plant transpiration rates rise. Add to that the legacy of the wet winter, which left many arable fields scarred and bare in places, where lakes of rain water stood for weeks on end and it is hardly surprising that optimism in this area is in short supply this spring. But it is very easy for a farmer to make judgments on prospects for the entire harvest on the basis of the few fields around his house. Last week I travelled south and west and was surprised to find that in Hampshire, Wiltshire and Dorset winter sown cereals were looking a lot better than those at home, with growth about a couple of weeks further forward. Perhaps the UK harvest will not be a total disaster after all. These days, however, as the reform of the European Union's common agricultural policy progresses and guaranteed prices decline, the value of UK cereals is coming to rely far more on supply and demand both in the EU and the rest of the world. Current trends suggest that the gap between these factors is narrowing. Last week, for instance, the UK ex-farm spot wheat price increased by Pounds 4 to Pounds 119 a tonne and that for June by a similar amount to Pounds 120. Both levels were a few pounds above the EU buying in price - and that in spite of recurring stories throughout most of last winter of sizeable, unsaleable surpluses in British barns, which were likely to have to stay there through the next harvest. Some of the bearish sentiment was undoubtedly inspired by merchants talking down the price. But there was apparent evidence to support their case and many cereal growers who sold early must now be kicking themselves. Forward prices for next harvest have also risen above support levels. The November intervention price for feed wheat, for instance, is Pounds 97 a tonne delivered to the store. But last week it was possible to sell forward to merchants at Pounds 98.50 a tonne ex-farm. Bread wheat, or common wheat as it is now known, could be sold for November at Pounds 112.50 a tonne, compared with an intervention price of Pounds 107. So, why the turnround? One reason must be that EU-wide domestic demand has increased now that guaranteed prices are lower. It must be assumed too that estimates of the outturn of last year's EU harvest were exaggerated. But it must also have something to do with the tightness of world cereal supplies. According to the April report from the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organisation, a decline in world wheat output this year may be countered by a recovery in the maize crop. And although availability should be adequate to meet demand stocks will remain close to minimum safe levels. The report shows that stocks as a percentage of world cereal consumption are expected to decline to 18 per cent this year having been between 19 and 21 per cent during the previous 3 years. Moreover the 1994 figure is similar to the stock level of 1990 and indicates that supplies have been bordering on the critical for at least 4 years. The FAO has the responsibility to tell of starvation risks around the world so might, perhaps, be accused of stressing potential problems. The International Wheat Council, however, has more commercial priorities and its forecasts coincide with those of the FAO for wheat while painting a worse picture for maize. According to the IWC world maize stocks are set to decline by about 5 per cent this year. There are reports, moreover, of poor growing conditions for winter-sown cereals in Russia and Ukraine, while shortages of inputs have also caused problems with spring sowing. Canada and China are both expected to produce lower tonnages this year and there are frost problems across the high plains of the US, which may have damaged spring plantings. A useful guide to future world prospects for wheat can usually be gained from the USDA's decision on the level of set-aside, or acreage reduction, it imposes on farmers wishing to qualify for crop loans. The decision for 1995 is expected within the next two to three weeks and rumours from Washington are already suggesting that the set-aside for wheat will, as last year, be zero. Meanwhile, in spite of obviously tightening supplies, most British and European arable farmers will again have to set-aside 15 per cent of their cereal land. But they are now becoming reconciled to it, and as long as they continue to be compensated for leaving land uncropped and the market for the crops they do grow stays as lively as in recent weeks they should not complain too much.</p>

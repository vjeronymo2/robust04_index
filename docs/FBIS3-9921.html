			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by William Melendez from the "Up to Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] Presidency Minister Oscar Santamaria has revealed  the government has uncovered a plan to attack political leaders,  as was disclosed yesterday by FMLN [Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front] leader Francisco Jovel. Minister Santamaria  said the information available is still vague, but he added that  those who might be targeted have already been alerted.    Minister Santamaria said the government abides by the  principles of respecting human rights and rejecting violence,  and, therefore, it is illogical to think any government official  is involved in the recent attack against the bodyguards of FMLN  candidate Nidia Diaz. Santamaria stressed that whenever the  government has received information of this nature, it has  warned those who might be targeted.    [Begin Santamaria recording] I believe no one could receive  this kind of information without reporting it, because it would  be tragic if anything happened to a person who could have been  alerted. [end recording]    Santamaria said in light of the fact that the information  received is sometimes sketchy, it is difficult to arrest the  people reportedly involved in plans to attack political figures.    [Begin Santamaria recording] When a person is arrested, the  arrest has to be based on evidence and not on simple information  that cannot be used as a basis for detention. In addition, we  have taken other measures. [end recording]    According to Santamaria, whenever the FMLN has asked for  assistance from government organizations, it has received  assistance without any problems. He recalled that the  Investigations Division of the National Civilian Police is  investigating the attack on Nidia Diaz's bodyguards.</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> WACHS, POLICE URGE CONTINUED BARRICADE OF SEPULVEDA AREA  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs and police officials today called on the  council to let barricades thrown up around a 12-square-block Sepulveda  neighborhood remain standing to keep out drive-by drug traffic.  </P> <P> Police say the program has been so successful that the streets should be  permanently closed off, allowing residents and guests to enter only through a  guard station at Sepulveda Boulevard and Rayen Street.  </P> <P> The City Council, which would have to approve permanently removing the streets  from public use, was scheduled today to consider an interim measure introduced  by Wachs that would keep the roadblocks up as long as police deem necessary.  </P> <P> Seven of the 15 council members said last week that they support the idea --  and two said they are considering it -- but some have reservations about the  impact on nearby areas. Last week, police officials conceded that narcotics  activity has increased in nearby areas.  </P> <P> Council members Joel Wachs, Ernani Bernardi, Hal Bernson, Mike Woo, Gloria  Molina, Zev Yaroslavsky and Robert Farrell said they support the proposal.  </P></p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Copper, tin and nickel prices began 1993 on a strong note at the London Metal Exchange. The COPPER market ended at the highest level for three months in a follow through to last week's move above Dollars 2,300 a tonne. Yesterday traders noted good Chinese buying and some suggested that today's LME warehouse stocks figures might show a fall. Sentiment was also buoyed by news of a 2.1 per cent rise in US construction spending in November, which continued a recent wave of positive data from the world's major economy. The three month copper price closed Pounds 39.75 up at Pounds 1,577.75 a tonne. Copper's bullish mood spilled over into NICKEL up Dollars 214.50 to Dollars 6,237.50 a tonne for three months delivery, and TIN, up Dollars 157.50 to Dollars 6,002.50 at tonne, although conditions in both markets were described as thin. At the London Futures and Options Exchange the March robusta COFFEE futures position surrendered its New Year's Eve rally to close Dollars 11 down at Dollars 1,012 a tonne after trade selling in New York had put the market on the defensive.

Offerors who object to review of their proposal by persons other than Government employees shall so state in Volume I of their proposal. Offerors are cautioned that DOE may be unable to give full consideration to proposals which indicate that only Government evaluation is authorized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Japan's money supply up 2.3% Japan's money supply grew 2.3 per cent year-on-year in September, slightly faster than expected. The rise, in M2 plus certificates of deposit, is a gentle acceleration compared with a 1.9 per cent increase in the money supply in August. It shows the squeeze on credit may be easing, though money supply is still weak compared to the late 1980s period of high economic growth. The rate of increase in money supply eased from May to June, but has been gently gathering pace ever since. A broader measure of liquidity, also including postal savings, government bonds and investment trusts, rose 3.5 per cent last month, a slight easing in pace from the 3.6 per cent increase in August. This remains well below the 5 per cent annual growth several economic analysts in Tokyo believe is the minimum needed to fund a durable economic recovery.</p>

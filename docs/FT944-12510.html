			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Improving the survival index - Daniel Green and Tim Burt analyse biotech investment prospects Is the UK biotechnology sector now becoming respectable? British Biotech has consolidated its position in the world's top handful of biotechnology companies by market value, and others, such as Celltech and Scotia, are making steady progress through clinical trials. But investors have yet to be convinced. British Biotech is alone among those joining the market in recent years to see its shares remain above the flotation price. And the sister sector in the US continues to labour under the burden of poor sentiment. Investor scepticism in the US has left companies there in serious financial difficulties. Accountants Ernst &amp; Young say 50 per cent of the industry has sufficient capital only for the next two years. In its latest biotechnology annual report, the firm has cut its survival index - the time until the cash runs out - for the median US company from 34 months to 25 months. Some 26 per cent of companies are scheduled to run out of cash within a year unless they can find new sources of finance. This is happening at a time when investor confidence in the sector is at a low ebb. There has been a series of failures ' three in the last two weeks alone  - of drugs at the latest stages of clinical trials, when most of the uncertainties ought to have been eliminated. The consequence of failure is usually a slide in the company's share price and an unforgiving mood among investors, most of whom have yet to warm to the sector. Without the confidence of City or Wall Street investors, biotech companies have turned for funding to drugs companies. Deals have been concluded, for instance, between Celltech and Merck, Proteus and American Home Products, and Celltech and Bayer of Germany. The strategy is risky because pharmaceuticals companies try to buy control of a biotechnology company's products. Mr Bernard Taylor, chairman of the acquisitive drugs company Medeva, warns that biotech companies which seek support through alliances are 'selling their birthrights'. Nevertheless, Mr Louis da Gama, executive director of the BioIndustry Association, says that 'mergers and acquisitions are likely to be the dominant aspect of the industry over the next five years'. Biotechnology company executives recognise that strategic alliances may cost a company dearly in terms of lost future earnings. They follow two simple strategies to limit the damage: Good news items about progress, however minor, in drug trials is published. Little effort is made to point out that success at the early stages means little. Less than one third of drugs that successfully complete Phase I trials eventually become products, according to stockbroker Lehman Brothers. Drugs are pushed through trials quickly because the more advanced the clinical research, the higher the price it fetches in cash-raising negotiations. Some borderline drugs that might have been dropped by a larger company make it through to the late stages of testing. Only in the glare of large scale trials do they show up their weaknesses. But these tactics risk lulling investors into thinking their company is doing better than it really is. 'Some UK biotech companies are asking us to accept 'good news' without so much as even a scientific meeting abstract let alone a peer reviewed publication,' complains Mr Ian Smith, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. He says that UK biotech companies are not as vulnerable to failure as many of their US rivals because they have broader development portfolios. Nevertheless, the statistics imply that some of the UK biotech sector's drugs that now look promising will fail at some stage. The sector may be approaching respectability, but it is in its nature to continue to deliver a few nasty surprises.</p>

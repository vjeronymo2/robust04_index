Applicants assert that shared funding does not present any issues that do not already exist where a single insurance company is licensed to do business in several states. Applicants note that where Participating Insurance Companies are domiciled in different states, it is possible that the state insurance regulatory body in a state in which one Participating Insurance Company is domiciled could require action that is inconsistent with the requirements of insurance regulators in one or more other states in which other Participating Insurance Companies are domiciled. Applicants state that the possibility, however, is no different and no greater than exists where, as is currently permitted, a single insurer and its affiliates offer their insurance products in several states. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. Applicants argue that affiliation does not reduce the potential, if any exists, for differences in state regulatory requirements. In any event, the conditions (adapted from the conditions included in Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)) discussed below are designed to safeguard against any adverse effects that different state insurance regulatory requirements may produce. If a particular state insurance regulator's decision conflicts with the majority of other state regulators, the affected insurer may be required to withdraw its separate account's investment in the relevant Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. Applicants also argue that affiliation does not eliminate the potential, if any exists, for divergent judgments as to when a Participating Insurance Company properly may disregard voting instructions of Contract owners. Potential disagreement is limited by the requirement that a disregard of voting instructions be both reasonable and based on specified good faith determinations. However, if a Participating Insurance Company's decision to disregard Contract owner instructions represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote approving a particular change, such Participating Insurance Company may be required, at the election of the relevant Fund, to withdraw its investment in that Fund. No charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. Applicants state that there is no reason why the investment policies of a Fund with mixed funding would or should be materially different from what those policies would or should be if such investment company or series thereof funded only variable annuity or only variable life insurance contracts. Applicants therefore argue that there is no reason to believe that conflicts of interest would result from mixed funding. Moreover, Applicants represent that the Funds will not be managed to favor or disfavor any particular insurer or type of Contact. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18. Applicants note that no single investment strategy can be identified as appropriate to a particular insurance product. Each pool of variable annuity and variable life insurance contract owners is composed of individuals of diverse financial status, age, insurance and investment goals. Those diversities are of greater significance than any difference in insurance products. An investment company supporting even one type of insurance product must accommodate those diverse factors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19. Applicants further note that Section 817(h) of the Code is the only section in the Code where separate accounts are discussed. Section 817(h) imposes certain diversification standards on the underlying assets of variable annuity contracts and variable life contracts held in the portfolios of management investment companies. Treasury Regulation 1.817&hyph;5(f)(3)(iii), which established diversification requirements for such portfolios, specifically permits, among other things, ``qualified pension or retirement plans'' and separate accounts to share the same underlying management investment company. Therefore, neither the Code, the Treasury regulations nor the revenue rulings thereunder present any inherent conflicts of interest if Plans, variable annuity separate accounts and variable life insurance separate accounts all invest in the same management investment company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20. While there are differences in the manner in which distributions are taxed for variable annuity contracts, variable life insurance contracts and Plans, Applicants state that the tax consequences do not raise any conflicts of interest. When distributions are to be made, and the separate account or the Plan is unable to net purchase payments to make the distributions, that separate account or the Plan will redeem shares of the Trust at net asset value. The plan will then make distributions in accordance with the terms of the Plan. The life insurance company will surrender values from the separate account into the general account to make distributions in accordance with the terms of the variable contract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21. With respect to voting rights, applicants state that it is possible to provide an equitable means of giving such voting rights to Contract owners and to Plans. Applicants represent that the transfer agent for the Trust will inform each Participating Insurance Company of each Account's share of ownership in the Trust, as well as inform the trustees of the Plans of their holdings. Each Participating Insurance Company will then solicit voting instructions in accordance with Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

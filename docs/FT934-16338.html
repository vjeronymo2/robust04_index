			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Israel and PLO to press on with peace talks ISRAEL and the Palestine Liberation Organisation will open talks on implementing their historic peace agreement in Egypt on October 13, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, said after an unexpectedly productive mini-summit yesterday. Mr Rabin, who said he had called for the quickly-arranged talks, described them as 'constructive and positive' and a 'very good beginning' to implementation of the outline peace deal signed on the White House lawns three weeks ago. He told reporters: 'We are committed to whatever we signed - but it's not enough to sign, you have to translate it through negotiation into reality.' The two leaders accordingly agreed to set up four joint negotiating committees to cover all aspects of the deal which will give limited self-rule to the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. At least two of the groups will convene in Egypt, satisfying in small part a long-standing Israeli call to move elements of the peace process from Washington to the Middle East. The agreement to begin implementation talks on October 13 follows the schedule of the outline accord signed in Washington. But the progress came as a surprise, given PLO anger over recent tough Israeli security operations against Palestinian activists in Gaza and the West Bank. PLO officials had accused Israel of 'flagrant violation of the spirit' of the accord. But while Mr Rabin declined to repeat his historic Washington handshake with Mr Arafat for the benefit of the cameras, and the leaders insisted on separate news conferences, no such bitterness was allowed to mar what Mr Rabin called simply 'a working meeting'. Under yesterday's agreement, Israel and the PLO will form a joint liaison committee at ministerial level to supervise implementation of the outline peace deal. This group will start work in Cairo next Wednesday. The same day a second joint committee will start talks in Taba, the Egyptian Red Sea resort near the Israeli border, on the Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. The pull-out is set to start on December 13. A third economic committee will also be established, the details and venue for which will be decided by the liaison committee. A further series of talks will continue under the framework of the 22-month-old Washington peace talks on the powers of a Palestinian Council due for election in July and details of Palestinian 'early empowerment' over a range of administrative and civic functions across the West Bank. The separate bilateral talks between Israel and its other Arab neighbours - Jordan, Syria and Lebanon - are expected to continue in the US capital. No date has been set for the resumption of these talks since the adjournment of the 11th round last month. Mr Arafat also suggested there was progress on the supremely contentious issue of Jerusalem's status, saying they had appointed negotiators to discuss proposals to include in the peace process the city both sides consider as their historic capital. 'We agreed from my side (PLO negotiator) Faisal Husseini and someone else from the Israeli side will be appointed to deal with the issue of Jerusalem,' Mr Arafat said. But an Israeli official dismissed the notion that anyone had been detailed to deal with Jerusalem at this stage, saying the city's status was a subject only for talks on a permanent solution in more than two years' time. Where Jerusalem was concerned Israel had agreed only to 'look into' PLO requests that Palestinians from the occupied territories be allowed freer access to the city. Israel currently limits the numbers of Palestinians allowed to cross from the West Bank and Gaza. Both sides had agreed to defer the issue of Jerusalem during the secret Oslo negotiations which led up to the breakthrough agreement signed last month. In the Cairo meeting hosted by President Hosni Mubarak, Mr Rabin resisted any ceremonials, telling reporters: 'We believe the time has come to move from ceremonies, photo opportunities, handshakes, to move from that to business'. Neither did Mr Rabin offer any 'confidence-building' gestures, such as the release of Palestinian detainees in Israel, which Mr Arafat was believed to have sought. Discussion of Israeli security operations in Gaza and the West Bank were also referred to the new liaison committee next week.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Tractebel buys into Spanish utility TRACTEBEL, Belgium's electricity company, has breached the barriers preventing foreign entry into Spain's utility sector by paying Pta18bn (Dollars 178m) for 3 per cent of Iberdrola, the blue chip privately-owned group that controls some 30 per cent of domestic generating capacity. The acquisition forms part of a global industrial co-operation agreement between the two companies and was engineered by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), the Spanish retail bank. BBV has strengthened its position as Iberdrola's chief shareholder by raising its holding by 2.5 per cent to 10 per cent. The Spanish bank's role in the deal, and its increased investment in Iberdrola, appear to have allayed the fears of the industry ministry which at the end of last year blocked a share swap agreement between Tractebel and the domestic utility that would have given each a 5 per cent stake in the other's business. Mr Claudio Aranzadi, the industry minister, had conditioned that agreement to the creation of a strong domestic shareholder block in Iberdrola for the latter's equity is widely spread while Tractebel is 40 per cent owned by Societe Generale de Belgique.</p>

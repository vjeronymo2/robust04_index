			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Presidential Council Member Leonid Smirnyagin: </F> "The Time Set Aside For Sorting Out Relations Between the  Authorities Has Been Completely Exhausted"]    [Text] Any assessment of the elections to local organs of  power must be more than depressing. The extremely low voter  turnout and the greatly reduced quality of the candidates  demonstrate major shifts in the Russian electorate. A number of  the previous local authorities were wallowing in corruption, and  voters are only too well aware of the fact. Many of the new  candidates are merely running for office in order to get rich.    Moreover, the speed of the economic reforms and the desire  to  do everything at one fell swoop, which may be borne out by  history some day, has occasioned extremely profound  disappointment among voters at these elections with regard to  the present forms of Russian statehood and the institution of  democracy as a whole.    I think it very dangerous that the federal authorities do  not  realize the significance of these processes. They have not only  failed to pay the slightest attention to the local elections, to  say nothing of applying any sort of pressure, they have not even  bothered to show the most basic interest in this process.    I am afraid that against this background the struggle over  the Memorandum of Civil Accord will appear to voters as merely a  deal stuck between politicians in Moscow. The Memorandum of  Accord should be presented as an appeal to the people by power  structures and social organizations, letting them know that a  new stage has been reached in the establishment of Russian  statehood: "We have finished the power struggle, we have  stopped pushing each other off our chairs. The Constitution has  been adopted, and constitutional work lies ahead of us. If  possible we will do everything in our power to correct mistakes.  Our work aims to drastically change the nature of state power."    The fact that the authorities have been preoccupied with  themselves is justified and necessary up to a point: After all,  we have been building a new kind of statehood and setting up new  institutions. And time has been needed to establish these  mutual relationships. However, the time set aside for this  purpose has been somewhat protracted. Moreover it has been  completely exhausted. There is no longer any need to address  this issue. We now have a Constitution, and all parties are  united in the opinion that consensus can and must only be  reached within the framework of the current Basic Law.    Thus we already have a basis for consensus in the form of  the  Constitution, and it is time to get down to specific tasks  rather than the infighting between various authorities.    We need consensus not just for its own sake, as a sort of  agreement contest, but in order to open a path toward creative  work, to correct the mistakes of the past and move ahead.</p>

			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Letter: America's corporate Who's Who also at Clinton conference Sir, Michael Prowse's account of President-elect Clinton's economic conference ('Little Rock conference sees much talk, fewer policies', December 15) left the impression this had been a gathering of secondary representatives of America's business. Only one of the 300 attendees was mentioned by name - Ms Kathleen Piper from South Dakota. In fact, this innovative conference was attended by the Who's Who of America's corporate world. Distinguished individuals who are the chair and/or the chief executive officer of their respective corporations included: John Sculley, Apple Computer; John Reid, Citicorp; David Glass, Wal-Mart; Harold Poling, Ford; Paul Allaire, Xerox; Edwin Artzi, Procter &amp; Gamble; Drew Lewis, Union Pacific; Robert Grandall, American Airlines; Robert Goizueta, Coca-Cola; Richard Jenrette, Equitable; Frank Popoff, Dow Chemical; P Roy Vagelos, Merck; John Young, Hewlett-Packard. These individuals do not fit the reported description of '. . .only Democrats - or people known to sympathise with his (Clinton's) views . . .'. They were invited to express their views and present possible solutions on how to correct America's crippled economy. John Love Kelly, 21 Furnace Woods Road, Cortlandt Manor, New York 10566, US</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Santiago Piedra] </F>   [Text] Quito, 8 Feb (AFP) -- Ecuadoran Indians today  occupied roads and blocked traffic while students continued to  stage major disturbances in Quito to protest a recent  71.2-percent increase in gasoline prices -- a price increase the  government has applied to compensate for a budget deficit.    With the support of student groups and of the powerful  United  Workers Front (FUT), the Confederation of Indian Nationalities  of Ecuador (Conaie), which comprises the majority of the  nation's Indian groups, initiated a 48-hour peaceful uprising to  protest the "unpopular" economic measures adopted by the  administration of right-wing President Sixto Duran-Ballen. On  28 January, the president ordered a gasoline price increase that  hiked the price on a gallon of regular gasoline from 1,460  sucres to 2,500 sucres (from $0.71 to $1.22).    Government spokesmen have explained that the price  adjustment  will generate revenue to compensate for a $260 million budget  deficit prompted by a surprising drop in Ecuadoran oil prices on  the international market, where Ecuadoran oil traded at less  than $11 a barrel in December and January. The increased fuel  prices led to strong protests in Ecuador, where a tense calm has  been reigning for the past two weeks because of street  demonstrations carried out by students who have stoned vehicles  and government buildings, as well as burned tires in the streets.    The disturbances have become violent in the port city of  Guayaquil, southwest of Quito. In Cuenca, in the Andean  province of Azuay, attempts were made to torch the governor's  office with "Molotov" cocktails.    While the workers showed their opposition to the gasoline  price increase by calling for a general strike last Thursday,  the Indians joined the protest today with a peaceful uprising,  which is blocking the country's overland traffic. According to  initial reports received in Quito, the Indians -- who comprise  about 3.5 million of Ecuador's population of 11 million people  -- blocked the Panamerican Highway in several areas north of the  capital. These demonstrations have practically paralyzed all  traffic, which could adversely affect trade with neighboring  Colombia.    Numerous communities in the provinces of Cotopaxi,  Tungurahua, Chimborazo, Canar, and Azuay, south of the Ecuadoran  capital, also witnessed the blocking of roads with barricades,  some of which were removed by police and Armed Forces personnel  deployed to preserve public order.    Government Minister Marcelo Santos said the Indian uprising  is attempting to destabilize the economy by preventing normal  business activities. He added this is why the public forces  will work to guarantee the free flow of vehicles. Santos also  talked about the need to hold a national dialogue in which, he  said, "we should attend with tabulae rasae, without conditions"  in the search for solutions to Ecuador's problems.    Defense Minister Jose Gallardo, meanwhile, said he was  concerned because the Indian protest is paralyzing exports of  Ecuadoran flowers, which have increased in the past few days  because of Valentine's Day in the United States. According to  Gallardo, the Army and the police will do everything possible to  clear the roads, and he said exact instructions have been given  to avoid possible confrontations.    President Sixto Duran-Ballen yesterday spoke about the  possibility of ordering a state of emergency to prevent public  disturbances. "We are not going to allow the country to be  paralyzed," he said in a meeting with journalists.    The Indians staged a two-month-long uprising in 1990 against  Rodrigo Borja's social democratic administration (1988-92). At  that time, the Indians demands included autonomy for territories  in the Amazon region, the site of rich oil fields. Borja  rejected the demand, saying the Indians were trying to create a  state within the Ecuadoran state itself.</p>

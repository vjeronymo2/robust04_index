			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Letter: Engineering firms in the south-east not complacent over pay Sir, Your article 'Earnings rise continues' (May 15) suggests the manufacturing sector shows 'complacency over its pay-setting arrangements'. With a membership of over 700 engineering companies in the south-east, the Engineering Employers London Association represents an important part of the manufacturing sector. In recent times, pay settlements have been some two percentage points below the average rise in earnings, and EELA has recorded a 12-month moving average of 4.02 per cent as of April 1992, well below the quoted earnings rise of 8.25 per cent in manufacturing. Wage drift has been minimal. Significantly, EELA has recorded that pay deferments and pay freezes still constitute over 20 per cent of all settlements, and, taking this into account, the average settlement during April 1992 was 2.95 per cent, also well below the quoted floor of 4 per cent. I suggest engineering in the south-east is well aware of the ERM constraints imposed. More importantly, the ability to award higher-than-inflation pay increases is limited by pressure on profit margins as material prices continue to rise faster than output prices. Caution has enabled many companies to gain a competitive edge both in export markets and in the UK. Encouragingly, EELA's quarterly business activity survey for the first quarter of 1992, with additional forecasts, shows the first signs of recovery.

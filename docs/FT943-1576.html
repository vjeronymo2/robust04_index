			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Package in need of reshaping Sir, Last year, John Gummer, the environment secretary, called together a group of manufacturers of packaged goods and retailers, and challenged it to develop and implement a plan to recover value from used packaging ('Packaging industry given deadline for recycling waste', July 28). Since then, there have been reports in the media of how this unrepresentative group of companies - known as the producer responsibility group - has addressed the challenge. Unfortunately, the group has failed to broaden its membership to reflect the importance of packaging manufacturers in properly developing such a plan. However, it has suggested that these same unrepresented packaging manufacturers should pay any additional costs of increasing recovery and recycling rates. In addition, the group's estimates of the amount of these costs may well prove to be wildly inaccurate. And now it is reported that the group is developing a plan to implement its ideas through a top-heavy bureaucratic organisation to be called Valpack, whose structure will further disadvantage packaging manufacturers. Surely the time has come for Mr Gummer to call a halt to this process which he, himself, initiated. He should insist that the group reconstitutes itself to be more broadly representative of the entire packaging chain before finalising proposals which are of such long-term, strategic significance to this leading industry.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata with </F> unidentified correspondents in front of the prime minister's  official residence, in Tokyo -- live]    [Text] [Correspondent] The current situation seems to be  extremely abnormal because at the very start of your assumption  of the post, the administration's foundation has begun to break  down. Concerning the abrupt formation of a new parliamentary  group, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] regarded it  as clearly an intentional action, disclosed its opposition, and  announced its decision to break away from the coalition this  evening. First of all, would you explain how you feel about  this series of incidents?    [Hata] Yes. Since I was elected the new prime minister at  the sessions of both houses today, I originally intended to  organize the cabinet as soon as possible. However, it is a  matter of regret that SDPJ Chairman Murata came to see me and  that during our talks, he told me that he personally thinks the  creation of the new group -- Kaishin [Reformation] -- is an  abuse of confidence and, as a result, he would like to have  consultations with his party.    And then, after midnight -- at about 0130 or around 0100 --  he gave me a phone call, saying that he had talked to each of  them and that each felt -- though it is regrettable -- that it  is an abuse of confidence. Therefore, he said if the situation  should remain unchanged, his party will not be able to go along  as a member of the ruling coalition parties. He said that  though it is a matter of regret, it is what he wanted to inform  me.    Nevertheless, as far as I am concerned, I feel that what he  has told me was exactly what they had talked over within their  party. But I was nominated as prime minister through voting by  various parties. I am determined, in my position, to carry out  my duties with their cooperation, and I requested that further  talks be held. However, the fact is that he informed me of their  decision after fairly thorough discussions, and then, 10 or 20  minutues later, the announcement was made. We regret it very  much.    [Correspondent] Concerning this concept of creating a new  parliamentary group today, Mr. Prime Minister, did you know that  it was included in today's schedule?    [Hata] No. I heard that a notice for the group's formation  was made at 2000 [1100 GMT] tonight, but I did not know that it  would be done today. At any rate, as I have stated on various  occasions, such as on television programs or in my interviews  with you, when I review the past eight months of my work under  the Hosokawa administration, I would give a high appraisal of  the work done by each party since each had to overcome various  difficulties.    However, the point at issue lies in the fact that we could  not discuss various problems among ourselves, but these issues  had to be taken back to their parties for discussion. Under  such a situation, I feel that it will be a serious problem  because it will take much time to deal with the difficult  problems we will have to handle in the future, and, moreover, we  may not be able to take concerted action. In this sense, I have  stated that it would be desirable to have two major forces in  the true sense of the word. And if this cannot be done in one  stroke, it would be desirable that in the process of creating  something like a parliamentary group, the two major forces form  gradually in the future. To tell the truth, this is what I have  stated recently on television programs, and I have also stated  that efforts should be made to this end.    [Correspondent] However, the SDPJ maintains that it is an  abuse of confidence. What do you think of this point?    [Hata] Speaking of an abuse of confidence, I was watching  television just now, and the action seems to have been  interpreted as being aimed at driving away the SDPJ. As is  known to you all, I feel...[changes thought] For example, when  the name of Mr. Michio Watanabe was mentioned and when I felt  that the idea was to exclude the SDPJ, I stated that since the  SDPJ had so far made efforts to deal with various issues, plans  should be worked out on the basis of maintaining the framework  of ruling coalition parties. Therefore, I do not think it is  right for the SDPJ to say that we betrayed them.    Moreover, concerning the creation of this group, Mr. Ouchi  and Mr. Hosokawa have stated their views. And, regarding the  result of the action, it does not mean that the group will  include only those who have gathered here. An appeal will be  made to several other political parties -- or should I say all  parties -- to join us, and in fact that appeal has actually been  made. In this connection, this does not involve an abuse of  confidence. For example, a parliamentary group was once formed  by the Japan New Party and Shinto Sakigake [Harbinger], and we  have stated different views on this group. However, no one has  ever mentioned an abuse of confidence. In this connection, I  would say there must be some misunderstanding. This is what I  feel now.    [Correspondent] My next question concerns the schedules  for tomorrow and after. For the time being, you have given up  the idea of forming the new cabinet tonight. What plans do you  have for tomorrow and afterward?    [Hata] The situation now is that it was at about 2100 or  2130  that Mr. Murayama left here, and then he did not return here,  rather the announcement was made. In this sense, there are  questions as to how this result has been brought about and what  discussions were carried out by the SDPJ. All parties, that is  all other ruling coalition parties, have not gathered yet to  talk about these questions. In this connection, I think all of  us will probably get together to have discussions among the  various parties tomorrow. Meanwhile, I will get in touch with  other leading membes of our party, and I have been talking with  leaders of other parties who were here just now. And I think it  is important to tell the SDPJ our true intention. Therefore, I  think the first thing I will do tomorrow is to have candid  discussions with the SDPJ and try to ask them to remain in the  coalition government.    [Correspondent] Does it mean, Mr. Prime Minister, that you  will have talks with Chairman Murayama yourself?    [Hata] Of course, I will have to meet personally with Mr.  Murayama, and I am ready to have talks with him at any time.  Just now, I had talks -- what shall I say -- not with stinging  words, with Mr. Murayama, but he told me frankly that the  decision was made, though it was regrettable. However, I told  him that maybe a little more time should be spent on discussing  this issue. In reply, he told me that the decision was made  after thorough discussions. And someone else told me just now:  Mr. Hata, it is a matter of regret but Chairman Murata just left  for a news conference. And when I asked him whether it would be  possible to hold out a little longer, he told me that the  chairman had actually left. My conversation with these two  persons was not at all talk with stingy words.    Therefore, first of all talks will have to be held among  various political parties on the reason why the action was seen  as an abuse of confidence. And if necessary, I will be ready to  hold as many talks as called for. And we would like to appeal  for further talks. And since ours is a coalition government, it  involves many difficulties. However, I have never given up on  the idea that there still remain chances for further talks.    [Correspondent] However, if the SDPJ does not change its  original intention, the Hata administration will probably be  forced to run state affairs as a minority administration.    [Hata] Since one party has disclosed its decision in such a  way, there is a possibility that the situation will turn out as  you have just pointed out. However, since we will continue to  make efforts, I would like to refrain from making any prediction  in saying such and such actions will be taken.    [Correspondent] In that case, what will be the time limit?    [Hata] Talking about the time limit, we are going to have  consecutive holidays soon. If actions should not be taken  before these holidays, the situation will probably become rather  unstable. I would not like to set any time limit at this  moment. However, I hope some sort of an orientation can be  worked out as soon as possible.    [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, I think there must be  change in the scheduling of Diet sessions, including your policy  speech scheduled to be delivered tomorrow. Faced with the  consecutive May holidays drawing near, what is your prospect for  the scheduling?    [Hata] I did not expect this situation. But the scheduling  for the Diet sessions has to be decided. I cannot make any  clear scheduling of the Diet sessions now because we have to see  what the situation will be. Other ruling parties are supposed  to hold a meeting here at 1000 tomorrow morning, and at the  meeting I want to consult with them on how to deal with the  issue.    [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, I remember you  previously  saying that politics that cannot win the people's understanding  is not politics. Do you think that what is happening now is  understandable to the people?    [Hata] Frankly speaking, to avoid the people's  misunderstanding, I want to stress that the coalition is formed  by groups who have their own political backgrounds and policies.  Unlike that of other nations, the coalition government in Japan  is just eight months old, and there may be criticism of the  coalition for delays in making quick actions. But since the  coalition, formed after exchanges of sharp debates among its  members, has made a fresh start amid a new trend in the world, I  intend to always explain the status of the situation as much as  possible to win the people's further understanding. Television  programs are increasingly regarding me as a common person. My  policy is that I always try to put my political activities on  the common people's level. As I said earlier, I want the people  to understand that the coalition is just eight months old,  during which time it has had to overcome many difficult issues.  I think that in that process, cooperative ties and mutual  understanding among the coalition parties have been further  deepened, and even when I talked to heads of the ruling parties  such as SDPJ Chairman Murayama as well as secretaries general, I  reaffirmed the cooperative relations among the ruling parties.  But now, I strongly feel that although the coalition partners  have so far cleared many hurdles, there is still difficulty in  getting along with each other. I think within the SDPJ there  must have been various opinions on how to form the coalition.  Despite this, members of the SDPJ voted for me, and I cannot  forget their support and hope to keep it in mind.    [Correspondent] I want to reconfirm that you are still eager  to manage the government beginning tomorrow while maintaining  the current framework which the SDPJ joins, are you not?    [Hata] We would like the SDPJ to stop thinking that we are  betraying it. The coalition partners have agreed on policies by  putting in many hours of discussions on such policy  coordination. In view of this, I want to make all-out efforts  to the end to ask the SDPJ to remain in the coalition. I think  this is what politics should be.    [Correspondent] So, you want to form the cabinet tomorrow?    [Hata] Yes, I intend to do my utmost to do so.</p>

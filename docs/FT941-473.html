			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Watchdog calls for steps to restrict water demand More household water meters should be installed to curb rising demand for water, the National Rivers Authority, said yesterday. In a strategy document published yesterday the authority, which is the water-quality watchdog for England and Wales, predicts that water consumption will grow steadily in almost every region by the year 2021, in some cases by as much as 43 per cent from 1991. According to the highest of its three sets of predictions, the biggest increases are expected in the south-west region, with 43 per cent, East Anglia with 37 per cent, and Severn Trent with 28 per cent. The lowest is the north-west region with 15 per cent. It calls for water companies to be obliged legally to promote efficient water use. It wants them to cut leakage of water - estimated at about a quarter - to 'economic' levels, to help remove the need for expensive new reservoirs. The water companies said yesterday: 'Most water companies will be able to meet future demands without major new resource developments. The exceptions will be those where population continues to grow.' Meanwhile, Friends of the Earth yesterday failed to mount a High Court challenge to the government's policy for improving water standards. A High Court judge dismissed a claim by the environmental pressure group for a judicial review of its claims that the government had breached both UK and European law by agreeing to undertakings from Thames Water and Anglia Water to reduce pesticide levels. It had asked the judge to overturn an October 1991 decision by Mr Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary, not to take enforcement action against the companies, even though their water quality breached a European directive on pesticide levels. Member countries should have complied with the 1982 directive by 1985. However, the government has allowed UK companies more time for compliance - until December 1998 in some cases. Friends of the Earth had argued that the government had broken the law by not taking more vigorous enforcement action. However, Mr Justice Schiemann said there was no evidence the government had acted illegally in any way. Water: Nature's Precious Resource. HMSO or local NRA offices. Pounds 22.50.</p>

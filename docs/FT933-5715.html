			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / PLO meets to discuss terms MR Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, was last night meeting his executive committee to take one of the most decisive steps in the organisation's history: signing a document which commits the PLO to recognising Israel and giving up its armed struggle against the Jewish state. In Jerusalem Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, said Israel objected to 15 of the 33 clauses of the Palestinian National Covenant, the PLO founding charter, which call directly or indirectly for the destruction of Israel. Mr Peres said a document on mutual recognition was ready to be signed if the PLO pledged itself to four conditions: The PLO must issue a communique that all those items calling for the destruction of Israel are now invalid. The PLO must make a clear announcement of its complete rejection of violence and 'terrorism' and declare that all disputes will be settled by peaceful negotiation. The PLO must recognise 'loudly and clearly' the right of Israel to exist in peace and security. The PLO must commit itself to UN resolutions 242 and 338 as the basis for future negotiations. Mr Peres said Israel was not demanding that the PLO give up its demands for the repatriation and compensation of Palestinians displaced when Israel was founded in 1948. PLO rules require that the charter can only be amended with a two-thirds majority of the Palestine National Council - the Palestinian parliament-in-exile. But Mr Peres said Israel would be satisfied with an unambiguous document signed by the PLO.</p>

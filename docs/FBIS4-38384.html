			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by correspondents </F> Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] The ten-day term within which Russian and Ukrainian  experts must work out an agreement on the Black Sea Fleet, will  be counted from May 30 Monday and instead of May 25 Wednesday  when the talks between the Russian-Ukrainian premiers had been  completed, a Russian Foreign Ministry official, a participant in  the talks told Interfax.    Referring to an agreement with the Ukrainian party, he  refused to enumerate the issues on which the parties had failed  to agree. "We keep our word if we give it. Unfortunately, this  cannot be said about some members of the Ukrainian delegation,"  he remarked mentioning the leakage of information on unsettled  issues in Kiev.    Commenting on possible introduction of direct presidential  rule in Crimea, the diplomat suggested that the Crimean problem  could not be solved just by administrative measures.    "It is possible to dismiss the Crimean parliament unwilling  to cede to the pressure exercised by Kiev and thus to gain  political capital before the presidential elections. However,  this will not resolve the Crimean problems," the diplomat  underlined.    He said that the Russian Foreign Ministry and other Russian  organizations were receiving more and more letters from Russians  living in Ukraine. They were complaining about the arbitrary  rule exercised by the local authorities which were carrying out  forceful "Ukranization," the diplomat stressed. He said that  this was not in conformity with democratic principles and values  in fidelity to which Kiev had sworn.    In an interview with Interfax a former Soviet human rights'  activist, now the head of the department for international  humanitarian and cultural cooperation at the Russian Foreign  Ministry Vyacheslav Bakhmin has said that the introduction of  presidential rule in Crimea can freeze the situation at best,  even though that is hardly likely.    In his opinion extraordinary regulations will not resolve  the  problems of Crimea. They should be resolved at the political  level through a dialogue and mutual concessions. From a  diplomatic point of view Crimea constitutes an internal problem  of Ukraine and Russia's active interference would be  counter-productive, Bakhmin said.    The diplomat believes that the idea of holding a referendum  on separation from Ukraine in Crimea has not future. In  principle CSCE permits such a possibility, but the example of  Karabakh shows how the principle works in real life politics.  It works poorly causing much bloodshed.    In Bakhmin's opinion the introduction of dual citizenship  can  hardly resolve all Crimean problems. "Dual citizenship can  change the psychological condition of a man but it can hardly  influence his actual position, he said. An agreement on dual  citizenship implies the principle of effective citizenship, i.e.  the citizenship of the country in which the person lives at the  moment. The other citizenship "sleeps" meanwhile. It "wakes  up" when the person moves to the country of his second  citizenship."    The diplomat is convinced that problems similar to the  Crimean one and related to the rights of nations or big groups  of people can be resolved only on the basis of respect for human  rights not just the rights of nations. The rights of nations  are secondary compared to human rights, Bakhmin stressed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 2 Apr -- The fifth congress of the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], which opened in Moscow today,  has granted practically dictatorial internal party powers to its  chairman, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. At the leader's request, the  delegates unanimously voted to extend his powers in that post  (without reelection) "until 2 April 2004." They also adopted a  number of amendments to the rules, under which the LDPR chairman  has the opportunity to appoint personally the party's Supreme  Council and other leading bodies, and to change their  composition at any moment he sees fit. The delegates also  confirmed that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will remain the party's  candidate in the event of presidential elections being held in  Russia.    The fifth congress of the LDPR also adopted a resolution on  setting up the party's "Zhirinovskiy's Falcon" [Sokol  Zhirinovskogo] Television and Radio Company which is to  disseminate "the truth about the party" in conditions of "a  complete information blockade."    Asking the congress deputies to grant him additional powers,  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said that this was out of financial  considerations and "intrigues by the special services" that are  doing everything to destroy the party.    On the whole, the theme of Russian and foreign special  services ran throughout the entire one and a half hour speech by  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. According to him these "special  services" offered him 100 million dollars to "leave politics."  The LDPR leader is inclined to attribute their efforts to the  behavior of a number of recent comrades-in-arms and members of  the LDPR faction in the State Duma who recently announced their  decision to leave the faction. As is known, several party  members recently announced their differences with Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy. Viktor Kobelev, until recently head of the party  apparatus, was among such representatives of the LDPR. Judging  from Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's speech and by the decisions adopted  by the congress, it has been decided to put an end once and for  all to the internal party rebellion. Henceforth, to use the  words of the LDPR leader, "the rebels will not be able to carry  out hostile activities by playing their card of election by the  congress."    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, as always, did not mince his words.  He said that the LDPR's immediate task is to become the ruling  party, to form a single-party government, and to occupy the post  of head of state. "The political system of Russia will soon  receive first aid in the form of the LDPR," he told those  assembled. "The LDPR's slogan is 'The LDPR on the path to  power' and we will implement it without fail," he added. "The  mighty vessel of the LDPR has set sail on the expanses of the  oceans and all unseaworthy tubs have been left behind," is how  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy described the situation on the threshold  of the future presidential elections.    The LDPR leader unambiguously defined the position of his  party toward the authorities. "We are the main party in  opposition to the existing regime," he stated. The government,  in his opinion, "is incapable of doing anything" and the longer  it remains in power "the more votes we will receive in all the  subsequent elections," he stated. The LDPR leader advised the  president "to give up his advisers and crew who are always  putting him in an awkward situation."    National and state problems occupied quite a big place in  the  party leader's speech. As usual, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  expressed the readiness "to defend the interests of Russians on  the territory of the former USSR." He prudently refrained from  rash statements on "pushes to the south" this time, stating that  coming to power, the LDPR would act only legally. Nevertheless,  "the frontiers of the USSR as of 1975, recognized by the world  community, will be restored and Russian flags will fly over the  cities of Kazakhstan, Central Asia, and the Transcaucasus, etc,"  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy stated. Everybody has a hobby and the LDPR  leader's, to use his words, "only vice is a weakness for  frontier posts: For them being in place." "If some unclean  force" has moved them inside the Russian state, the task of  Zhirinovskiy's party is to return them to their place, but  within the framework of the law, he added.    Dwelling on the party's financial problems, Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy said that the pre-election campaign on the eve of  last year's parliamentary elections cost the LDPR 250 million  rubles and the party had just paid its debts, and in the four  years of its existence, the party has spent 1 billion rubles at  current prices.    At the congress, besides delegates, there are quite a few  people from abroad who share Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's views --  mainly representatives of various Serb organizations, and also  of Iraq's ruling Ba'th party, the German People's Union, and  others.</p>

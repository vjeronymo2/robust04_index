			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special news bulletin" by Juan Carlos Antollo] </F>   [Text] Today peace mediator Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San  Cristobal de las Casas, reacted to the latest events in Mexico.  He read a communique which states:    Regarding the assessment of the situation outlined in the  10-point communique issued by the EZLN (Zapatist National  Liberation Army] on 24 March 1994, I consider it appropriate to  present the mediator's views on the communique.    1. We understand the EZLN communique does not announce a  break in the peace talks or an end to the cease-fire. On the  contrary, the EZLN expressed its determination to maintain the  cease-fire in keeping with its communique dated 12 January 1994.    2. We do not view the contents of the EZLN communique as  a break in the dialogue but, rather, as a notification of an  interruption in the consultation process, the second stage of  which was to be held in the jungle. Regarding the text of the  government's commitments and the next step for the dialogue, a  path toward peace must be sought.    3. While denouncing hostile actions, which indeed could  become possible in the wake of the grave attack on Luis Donaldo  Colosio Murrieta, the EZLN made public its determination to  declare a state of maximum alert in light of a possible  confrontation.    [Begin Ruiz recording] After stating these points, we  believe  it is necessary to make a general appeal, considering the  gravity of the situation, in order not to block those avenues  leading toward peace. The exceptional circumstances we are  experiencing demand we all seek the truth to guide our freedom  [as heard].    False or distorted reports, ill-intentioned rumors, and  slanderous attacks weaken the foundations of an atmosphere of  understanding and good faith which is indispensable to  engendering the birth of the new country we all desire. [end  recording]    Bishop Samuel Ruiz made the aforementioned clarification  because here in San Cristobal there are rumors that attacks are  under way in various areas of Chiapas. These rumors were  immediately denied, particularly after confirmation was sought  in Ocosingo.    The San Cristobal bishop called on the media to act  responsibly, because some media sources have reported unfounded  rumors that have lead nowhere.    [Begin Ruiz recording] We all trust that the in-depth  investigation regarding the events leading to the assassination  of Luis Donaldo Colosio be objective, persuasive, and in  accordance with the law. We hope that this will not become a  pretext that might enable military thinking and its high social  and human costs to once again prevail over rational dialogue and  political negotiations. [end recording]    In the end, Samuel Ruiz said that at this time, society,  social organizations, and mediation efforts must serve the path  of peace and dialogue, adding that these efforts should again be  reaffirmed and redirected toward their proper ends. He  concluded that at this point in time, there is indeed a state of  alert, but that this could be terminated quickly if we can hold  a new dialogue to attain a long-awaited peace in Chiapas.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown supports 'green' accounts - News in Brief THE LIBERAL Democrats yes-terday highlighted their 'green' credentials by backing proposals, under consideration by the Department of the Environment, for an alternative system of national accounts, Ralph Atkins writes. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said the Treasury was blocking a change to gross national product statistics which took into account the environmental impact of economic growth. He endorsed a report by the Dutch central bureau of statistics showing how the alternative indicators could be compiled at little extra expense. The Environment Department and Central Statistical Office are thought to be interested in the project but are still calculating the costs. HEALTH: Tory backbenchers last night demanded the resignation of Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary, for using confidential information leaked by an official of the Department of Health to attack the government. VOTERS: About 1.4m people eligible to vote are missing from electoral registers, according to estimates produced yesterday by Mr Harry Barnes, Labour MP for North East Derbyshire. He blamed the poll tax for much of the shortfall he found by comparing electoral registers for last year with official estimates of those old enough to vote. UDR: Mr Archie Hamilton, armed forces minister, clashed with angry Ulster Unionist MPs in the Commons yesterday as he opened the second reading on the Army Bill. The measure paves the way for the merger of the Ulster Defence Regiment with the Royal Irish Rangers to form the Royal Irish Regiment. The government was accused of betraying the UDR's 6,000 members.</p>

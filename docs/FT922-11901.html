			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Substantial drop for Dencora Pre-tax profits at Dencora, the property and housebuilding group, slumped from Pounds 2.21m to Pounds 404,000 in 1991, but the dividend is held at 5.5p. Increased rental income, up from Pounds 7.04m to Pounds 8.81m, and profit on the sale of a Southend-on-Sea development were substantially offset by losses in housebuilding and further write-offs in commercial and housing land values. Earnings fell to 3.1p (7p). After the Southend sale and a disposal in Norwich, bank borrowings stood at Pounds 58m. On revaluation, the investment property portfolio was written down by Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 84.5m.</p>

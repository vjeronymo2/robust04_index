In a statement to  AL-HAYAH he demanded that "firm, strong, and clear measures" be  taken to protect Palestinians. [passage omitted]    Alain Juppe stressed the need to continue and speed up the  peace process "in order to restore the credibility of the  negotiations." In his view, this aim requires that "security be  guaranteed in the occupied territories. It is the  responsibility of the occupation authorities now. This  responsibility will be assumed by the Palestinian authority  after the Israeli withdrawal" in accordance with the agreement  between the Israeli Government and the PLO. France is urging  European Union countries to "take firm, strong, and clear  measures, and -- to that end -- supports an international  civilian presence in the occupied territories."    According to the French foreign minister, the second  condition for restoring credibility to the peace negotiations is  to speed up the implementation of the international aid program  in order to improve living conditions for the Palestinians, "as  this aid is still in the coffers of international  organizations."

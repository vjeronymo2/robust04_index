			<p>BFN     [Text] Bloemfontein May 5 SAPA -- The new leader of the  Northern Cape, Manne Emsley Dipico, is a dynamic young unionist  who faces a strong regional opposition and possible hung  parliament in South Africa's largest but most sparsely populated  area. The youngest regional premier, Dipico, 35, is described  by colleagues as an extremely vibrant and hardworking leader who  spends up to 7 days a week in the office.    He endorses Afrikaans as an official language for the  Northern Cape, and wants whites and their skills to play an  important role in its new government and mining- and  agriculture-based economy.    In a region with a 70 per cent illiteracy rate and years of  underdevelopment, Dipico faces massive challenges in education,  healthcare and unemployment. A decision also has to be taken on  whether to keep the capital in Kimberley or move it to Upington,  understood to be the preference of strong lobbies within the  National Party. Dipico is believed to favour Kimberley as the  capital.    Latest election results show the African National Congress  is  likely to win 15 seats, the NP [National Party] 12, Freedom  Front two and Democratic Party one, observers said.    Born the eldest of four children in Kimberley's Greenpoint  township on 21 April 1959, Dipico was raised by his domestic  servant mother and matriculated from the prestigious St Boniface  School in 1979. An early job on a diamond mine ended when he  was fired after a wage strike, and Dipico enrolled for a BA at  Fort Hare University where he became involved in the Azanian  Students Organisation [Azazo] and underground ANC structures.  By 1984 he was local Azazo treasurer and the organisation's  delegate to the border region United Democratic Front.    His detention that year for involvement in anti-Ciskei  activities saw him refused readmission to Fort Hare. He  returned to Kimberly to become full-time regional organiser of  the National Union of Mineworkers [NUM] and an integral figure  in the Northern Cape United Democratic Front. The 1986 state of  emergency saw him detained for five months, and in August 1987  he was jailed for five years for furthering the aims of the ANC.  Released from jail in June 1990, Dipico returned to the NUM  head office, later becoming head of the union's education  department, a post he still holds today. In May 1991 he was  elected secretary general of the Northern Cape ANC, becoming  chairman in June the next year.    A keen football administrator, Dipico enjoys table tennis  and  jogging. He plans to marry soon</p>

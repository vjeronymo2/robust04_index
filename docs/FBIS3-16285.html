			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Comment by Anatoliy Lysenko, general director of Russian </F> State Television and Radio Company, under general headline:  "Tales from the Vienna Woods" -- last paragraph is editorial  postscript]    [Text] We asked Anatoliy Lysenko, general director of the  Russian State Television and Radio Company, to comment on the  situation which has taken shape:    Last week the Ministry of Finance drew up another draft  state  budget. I do not know how good or bad it is in other spheres,  but as regards the state television and radio companies....  Under this draft, which has not yet been approved by the  government, it is proposed to allocate for the funding of the  television and radio company, on average, approximately  one-fourth of the amount that we need for a minimum normal  existence. This means that Russian radio, for example, will be  broadcasting for something like five hours a day, and Russian  television even less -- four hours and 20 minutes. So we will  have to distribute our air time roughly as follows: from 0730  through 0900 hours for those who are already awake. From 1600  through 1730 for children, so that they do not forget that the  television has been invented. In the evening it will be  possible to put out "Vesti," followed by a 10- or 15-minute  program with a topical account of the government's concern for  its people.    I certainly do not think that the quality of all our  programs  is on a high level. And yet an important question occurs to me  with regard to this draft budget: What does the Finance  Ministry expect those people who are accustomed to sitting on  the sofa in front of the television after work in the evening to  do with themselves if the television set is showing nothing? We  could think up a lot of answer to this question, but none of  them in society's favor. This is not to mention the fact that  we will have to dismiss three-fourths of our employees without a  leaving gratuity.... As is known, we were born to turn a  fairytale into a true story. Sometimes it is a very frightening  fairytale. Although I am a great fan of science fiction, I find  it hard to believe that, before approving the draft, the  government will review the question of television funding. But  there is still a glimmer of hope.    [Postcript] While this issue was being made up, the problem  of funding state television and radio companies has developed  further. The president has met with the heads of "Ostankino"  and the Russian State Television and Radio Company and promised  them support, saying that there must definitely be state  television in Russia. "Although the budget will be cut just the  same," Anatoliy Lysenko declared after meeting with the  president. "The question is: by how much? But the government  must decide this."</p>

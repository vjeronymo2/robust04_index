			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Economics: Index of spending confidence likely to rise again in US THE US is showing the world that its work ethic is intact by pumping out economic data in a week when most other countries are still taking an extended holiday between Christmas and New Year. Today's figures on consumer confidence from the Conference Board are expected to show a continued upward trend in December, following strong growth after president-elect Bill Clinton's victory in November. MMS International, the financial information company, reports that the analysts' consensus is for a 70.1 reading on the Conference Board index against 65.5 in November. However, J P Morgan, which expects an increase to 75, points out it is still a long way from the 100 to 120 range which prevailed for several years before the recession began in mid-1990. Other indicators meriting attention will be tomorrow's new home sales and the report of purchasing managers in Chicago, where a rise is expected in December. On Thursday, analysts will be looking at the figures for US factory orders in November. The November figures should give some insight into whether Mr Clinton's victory has been followed by any recovery in demand for capital goods. On balance, US economists expect a slight decline. The main economic events and figures published this week follow. The figures in brackets are the median of economists' forecasts provided by MMS International. Today: US, December Conference Board consumer confidence (70.1), November existing home sales. Tomorrow: US, November leading indicator (up 0.7 per cent), new home sales (625,000). Chicago purchasing managers index. France, November final consumer price index. Japan, last trading day of 1992 for the stock exchange. Thursday: US. November factory orders (down 0.7 per cent), factory shipments, initial jobless claims for week to December 19, money supply figures for week ending December 21. UK, October energy trends, October engineering sales and orders at constant prices. Friday: New Year's Day. All markets closed. Denmark assumes EC presidency. Start of European single market. Separation of Czech and Slovak republics. During the week: Italy, November M2 (up 7 per cent on year), cumulative PSBR including November (L140tr).</p>

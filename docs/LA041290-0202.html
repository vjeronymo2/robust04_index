			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ZONING REDUCTIONS TO BLOCK APARTMENTS  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council last week unanimously approved zoning reductions  to prevent apartment construction on portions of nine blocks in Atwater  Village.  </P> <P> In a single ordinance adopted Friday, the council changed the designation of  the nine areas from medium to low-medium density.  </P> <P> The new zone allows for the construction of single-family homes and duplexes.  </P> <P> The areas include portions of the five blocks northwest of Fletcher Drive  between Larga and Casitas avenues, the block southwest of Atwater Avenue  between Silver Lake Boulevard and Garcia Street, and the four blocks northwest  of Los Feliz Boulevard between Glenfeliz Boulevard and Boyce Avenue. Other  portions in those blocks retain their present zoning for either commercial or  single-family home construction.  </P> <P> Renee Weitzer, planning deputy for Councilman John Ferraro, said the downzoning  was initiated by residents to eliminate the possibility of apartment houses  being built in the area.  </P></p>

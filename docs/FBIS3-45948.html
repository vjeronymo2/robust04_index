			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New Delhi, January 14 (XINHUA) -- India's chief of  the Army Staff General B.C. Joshi said there were positive gains  for both India and China in implementing the historic border  agreement.    In an interview to inter-services newsletter "SAINIK  SAMACHAR" on the eve of the Army Day here today, General Joshi  said that though the Sino-Indian border agreement, signed last  September when Indian Prime Minister Rao visited Beijing, was  not fully implemented yet, the course that had been set was a  positive one.    Progress achieved in this path would indicate the thrusts  and  changes in the mission of the Indian Army, Joshi said.    The two dimensions for the Indian Army to defeat external  and  internal threats had tended to merge and peace with "our  neighbors" was a vital aspect in this battle.    In an apparent reference to large number of force levels  which would become available once the reduction in troop and  weaponry level went underway as stipulated in the agreement, the  general said the progress of implementation of the agreement  would indicate how best Army could use this manpower.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) On December 10, 1992, VF Insurance sold GTE Corporation commercial paper, in the principal amount of $11 million with a maturity date of January 13, 1993, to an independent broker-dealer for $10,959,275.56, and on the same date the Trust bought GTE Corporation commercial paper with the same maturity date and in the same principal amount from the same independent broker-dealer for $10,959,483.33.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Applicants represent that any violations of the Act attributable to the participation of CNA Companies in the CNA Transactions resulted inadvertently and unintentionally from actions customarily taken by the Traders in effecting commercial paper transactions. The Applicants represent that, except for three indirect Trust purchases of commercial paper through dealers, the CNA Transactions were effected to accomplish the necessary liquidation of Trust assets in order to satisfy the Trust's obligations arising from commitments to purchase U.S. Treasury securities or short-term commercial paper issued by U.S. corporations. The Applicants state that in all of the CNA Transactions, the commitments on behalf of the Trust to purchase the commercial paper or U.S. Treasury securities were made because the yields on the obligations to be purchased were higher than those on the commercial paper which was sold. The Applicants maintain that if the commercial paper in issue had not been sold by the Trust on the dates of the CNA Transactions, the Trust would have foregone the incremental return on the government obligations and commercial paper to which it was committed, and the Trust would have been required to reimburse its broker for any costs of carrying the obligations until settlement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Applicants represent that the three indirect Trust purchase transactions were mistakenly initiated by the Traders, who proceeded on erroneous assumptions about the Trust's ability to engage in the transactions with the CNA Companies. The Applicants state that the sellers in these transactions were under no obligation to sell the commercial paper to the Trust, nor was the Trust obligated to purchase the commercial paper from the sellers. The Applicants represent that the commercial paper involved in the Trust purchase transactions was readily tradable on the open market, and that sellers other than the CNA Companies could readily have been located.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Applicants represent that as a percentage of commercial paper transactions entered into during 1992 by the Trust, the CNA Transactions were minor. Specifically, the Applicants state that the total amount involved in the CNA Transactions constituted only 3.15 percent of all commercial paper transactions entered into by the Trust during 1992 and only 2.52 percent of all transactions entered into by the Trust during 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The Applicants represent that in each of the CNA Transactions, the Trust bought or sold commercial paper on terms which were as favorable or more favorable to the Trust as those which the Trust could have obtained in arm's-length transactions with unrelated parties on the open market. Specifically, the Applicants represent that in the purchase transactions, the Trust did not pay, and the CNA Companies did not receive, prices which were in excess of the fair market value of the commercial paper purchased. Similarly, with respect to the sale transactions, the Applicants represent that the Trust received purchase prices which were equal to or in excess of the fair market values of the commercial paper at the time of the transactions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  With respect to the Trust purchases, the Applicants also represent that the commercial paper issues involved in the CNA Transactions were highly liquid and involved highly liquid issuers, and that none of the parties to the transactions were under any compulsion or duress because the commercial paper involved could have been sold by and purchased by sellers and purchasers other than the Trust and the CNA Companies. The Applicants have obtained written determinations by independent commercial paper broker-dealers (the Independent Dealers), confirming the fair market value prices and liquidity of the commercial paper involved in the CNA Transactions. The representations of the Independent Dealers are summarized as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Applicants represent that a retrospective determination of whether a single trade of commercial paper was made for fair market value (defined as the price at which the commercial paper would trade between a willing buyer and willing seller, neither party being under a compulsion to buy or sell), is difficult, and includes comparisons of identical or similar transactions, taking into account differences between the transactions being compared. The Department expresses no opinion as to the Applicants' representations regarding the determination of fair market value of commercial paper, or whether the paper involved in the CNA Transactions was exchanged at its fair market value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

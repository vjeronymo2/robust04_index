			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Skis Rossignol in FFr35m loss SKIS ROSSIGNOL, the leading French producer of skis, tennis and golf equipment, estimated yesterday it suffered a FFr35m (Dollars 6m) to FFr40m loss in the year to the end of March, but predicted better times ahead. This is a disappointment after last September's announcement by Mr Laurent Boix-Vives, the chairman, that Rossignol would return to profit in 1991-1992. However, it marks a partial recovery from last year's record FFr140.8m loss, the effect of several years of poor snow and the recession in winter sports generally. This is the latest evidence of the start of a recovery for the ski industry, following optimistic forecasts from Salomon, the world's leading maker of bindings and number two in ski-boots. Mr Boix-Vives, speaking at a conference in Austria, forecast that Rossignol would make a FFr50m profit in the current year to March 1993, helped by the success of its equipment in the winter Olympics, when 18 medal winners used Rossignol skis. Sales rose by an estimated 10 per cent to FFr1.5bn last year and should reach FFr1.7bn in the current 12 months, he said. The group managed to sell 1.5m pairs of skis last year, up from 1.45m in the previous 12 months, in a stagnant market.</p>

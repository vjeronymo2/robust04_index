			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PLIGHT OF YOUNG BLACK MALES IN AMERICA  </P> <P> I read with anguish William Raspberry's commentary "When Manhood Is Taught on  the Streets" (Aug. 28). My initial reaction was simply, here we go again . .  "We have searched for the Enemy and have found . . . he is us."  </P> <P> Here is an African-American discussing the plight of young black males  negatively. Can it be that there are no positives to being African-American in  America or along the diaspora in the world today?  </P> <P> As one of the so-called "black boys" reared in a one-parent household, perhaps  it is irrelevant that I also hold a college degree, can do calculus (as if  calculus is the measure of a man or quality of one's education) and have read  Willie Shakespeare and Nate Hawthorne.  </P> <P> No one wishes to substitute the so-called classics for African-American  literature. It is not necessary to justify African-American literature by some  Eurocentric value statement that "White is right." What is important is that  African-Americans in America, of all ages and educational levels, learn that  Africans came before Columbus, that the destruction of black civilization is  not a myth.  </P> <P> Nowhere is Raspberry more off base than on the subject of African-American  family. Are "black boys" supposed to sit quietly and passively on the sidelines  as the world turns about them? I think not.  </P> <P> What is needed? African-Americans can learn whatever is taught. Education is a  self-serving process. One can only regurgitate what is taught, when tested.  </P> <P> There are positive role models for African-American males. We just need to  recognize them.  </P> <P> HENRY A. ALVAREZ III  </P> <P> Lemon Grove  </P></p>

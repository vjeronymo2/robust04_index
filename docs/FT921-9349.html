			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Observer: All-party gig An unlikely partnership, in the shapes of Labour MP Tom Pendry and Tory MP Bill Cash, has just got together to launch a no less unlikely project: the Houses of Parliament All-Party Jazz Group. So far the two co-chairmen have signed up 30 MPs - the membership card is embossed with a tenor sax - including Kenneth Clarke and John Prescott, both card-carrying supporters of Ronnie Scott, and Sir David Steel. The HoP cats aim to get the government dancing to a three-step programme. A  -liberalise licensing laws which currently restrict 'unlicensed' premises to performances by duos. B - get London's Jazz FM radio station to live up to its title in the music it plays. C - encourage the Arts Council to swing more money jazz's way. For the record, it seems that political affiliation has little to do with musical bent. Not all Conservatives are trad fans - Clarke is a bebopper, apparently - and Pendry says he was turned on to blue notes by Ted Heath (no, not that one) in a Ramsgate ballroom.</p>

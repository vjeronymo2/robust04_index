			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is proposing to amend its regulations governing standards of conduct and reporting requirements for transportation and affiliate transactions. The Commission is proposing to reduce the reporting requirements significantly based on changes in the way pipelines will be allocating capacity after implementation of Order No. 636 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and the Commission's experience with the reporting requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Pipeline Service Obligations and Revisions to Regulations Governing Self-Implementing Transportation; and Regulation of Natural Gas Pipelines After Partial Wellhead Decontrol, 57 FR 13,267 (Apr. 16, 1992), III FERC Stats. &amp; Regs.

Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission estimates the public reporting burden for this collection of information under the proposed rule to average 66.2 hours per respondent, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The information will be collected under FERC&hyph;592, Marketing Affiliates of Interstate Pipelines. In lieu of being physically filed with the Commission on a periodic basis as a ``response'' or ``filing'', the data will be updated continuously and made available to customers/shippers, the public, and the Commission by Electronic Bulletin Boards (EBBs) established and maintained by the pipeline respondents pursuant to Order No. 636. The annual reporting burden for some 61 respondents under the proposed rule is estimated to total 4,038.2 hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the proposed rule provides for fewer information items, the burden estimate for FERC&hyph;592 in the subject Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) represents a burden reduction of 63 hours per respondent_or a total reduction of 3,843 hours. The current annual reporting burden attributable to the FERC&hyph;592 information collection is 7,882 hours. A copy of this proposed rule is being provided to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons may send comments regarding the burden estimates or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for further reductions of this burden, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415, FAX (202) 208&hyph;2425]. Comments on the requirements of this proposed rule may also be sent to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Washington, DC 20503 [Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (202) 395&hyph;6880].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission, in Order No. 497, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  issued a rule intended to prevent pipelines from providing preferential treatment to their marketing or brokering affiliates. The rule adopted standards of conduct (codified at part 161 of the Commission's regulations) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and tariff and reporting requirements (codified in &sect;250.16). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The reporting requirements required the pipelines to file FERC Form No. 592, a log containing information relating to transportation for affiliated marketers, and to maintain the same information for nonaffiliated shippers. The Commission imposed a sunset provision requiring a reevaluation of the requirements of the rule within one year to determine whether increased competition in transportation had mitigated the concerns about affiliate abuse. The Commission has extended the sunset provision until December 31, 1993, and, contemporaneously with this NOPR, is issuing Order No. 497&hyph;E which extends the reporting requirements until June 30, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Inquiry Into Alleged Anticompetitive Practices Related to Marketing Affiliates of Interstate Pipelines, Order No. 497, 53 FR 22139 (June 14, 1988), FERC Stats. &amp; Regs.

One of the principal changes introduced by Order No. 636 was the initiation of capacity release mechanisms through which firm shippers can release their firm transportation capacity, including storage capacity, to others wanting to obtain the capacity. The Commission mandated that all allocations of firm capacity, both firm capacity available from the pipeline and released capacity, be implemented through Electronic Bulletin Boards (EBBs) operated by the pipelines (or operated on their behalf by third parties). The Commission also has begun the process, in Docket No. RM93&hyph;4&hyph;000, of standardizing the methods by which pipelines will provide information about available capacity through their EBBs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

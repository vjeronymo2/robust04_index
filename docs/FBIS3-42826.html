			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Seyfali Akhundov: "Andrey Dzhergenia: `The Visit </F> Will Exacerbate the Antagonism...'"]    [Text] Russian officials stated repeatedly that the signing  of an interstate agreement between Georgia and Russia was  possible only after a settlement of the Abkhaz-Georgian  conflict. It would seem Moscow has changed its attitude toward  this center of tension in the Caucasus.    The visit to Georgia by the president of Russia will  exacerbate the situation along the line of opposition of the  Abkhaz and Georgian forces. Despite the fact that combat  operations have not been conducted for quite some time now, the  signing of a Russian-Georgian treaty providing for military  assistance to the Shevardnadze government will initiate a new  twist of the spiral of the Abkhaz-Georgian conflict. This is  what Andrey Dzhergenia, personal representative of the chairman  of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Abkhazia, said on the  eve of Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi.    The events of recent years testify that, having obtained  weapons from Russia, Georgia will abandon a peaceful solution to  the conflict, Dzhergenia believes. This was the case in 1992,  when, in accordance with the Tashkent Agreement, the Republic of  Georgia was handed heavy weapons that had previously belonged to  the Soviet Army, and the troops of the State Council entered  Abkhaz territory shortly after. In an appeal of the Supreme  Soviet of this self-proclaimed republic to the Russian  Federation president, the chairman of the Council of Ministers,  and the speakers of the Federation Council and the State Duma  the Abkhaz side requested that the treaty not be signed.  Otherwise Russia could no longer play the part of objective  mediator in a settlement of the Abkhaz-Georgian conflict since  it and a subject of the protracted dispute would hence forward  be bound by allied relations. Having signed the treaty, Abkhazia  believes, the Russian leader will have deprived himself also of  important levers of pressure on Tbilisi in a solution to the  problems of South Ossetia.    The personal representative of the chairman of the Supreme  Soviet of Abkhazia refrained from comment on the changes in  Moscow's foreign policy course in the Caucasus, but acknowledged  that a rapprochement of Russia and Georgia was fraught with the  danger of an exacerbation of the situation in the region. The  heads of the North Caucasus republics held a joint meeting on 31  January at which they condemned the position occupied by Russia  in respect to Abkhazia and declared the need for retaliatory  measures.</p>

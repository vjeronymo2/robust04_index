			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuan Hong (7086 4767): "Communications Bank </F> Comprehensively Develops International Business--Accelerates  Pace of Getting on International Track"]    [Text] "The Communications Bank will make the promotion of  international financial business an important part of its  accelerated development, and in business administration and  management accelerate its pace of getting on the international  track; over a period of time it will make an effort to become a  transnational bank with a fairly high degree of international  capital and credit, and then ascend further to become an example  of a world-class bank." This was the clear demand put forward by  Wang Mingquan [3769 2494 2938], president of the Communications  Bank, at the bank's 1994 foreign exchange work conference.    The foreign exchange business of the Communications Bank is  now conducted in 50 branch banks in 22 provinces and cities  throughout China. The bank has set up branch banks and  representative offices in the main international financial  centers of Asia, North and South America, and Europe. Globally,  it has 808 agent banks and close to 100 overseas account banks.  The total number of its settled accounts has broken through the  $10 billion barrier, and on three occasions it has successfully  floated in Singapore the issuance of U.S. dollar bonds at a  floating interest rate. Faced with the daily intensifying  turbulent internatonal financial markets, this bank's foreign  exchange buying and selling, releasing of funds, bond  transactions, and other business with foreign exchange funds,  under the premise of ensuring the security of the funds, have  increased profits, thereby further improving the bank's  investment skills. At the same time, there has been a new  development of its foreign exchange business, in succession  pushing and spreading a series of loan types, including leases,  mixed loan credit transfers, and foreign exchange borrowings.    Following the establishment of the Commercial Bank's  position  in China's financial system, the development of the  Communications Bank faced a new "flight of steps." At the end of  last year, the reform and development plan proposed by this bank  was approved by the People's Bank of China; and for the  Communications Bank to vigorously develop its international  financial business and to be run as an export-oriented,  standardized commercial bank is an important strategic idea in  the plan. For this reason, starting this year, the bank will, in  accordance with the successful pattern and standard of  international practice and international commercial banks,  implement unified systems, unified technological processes,  unified operations, and unified certificates in its foreign  exchange business administration and management; and take the  lead in adopting current international methods in the aspects of  foreign exchange quoted prices and foreign exchange funds. The  bank is getting a tight grip on carrying out international  credit rating and is doing well the work of raising funds  overseas. This year it will set up two representative offices in  Singapore and Frankfurt.    To ensure the healthy development of its international  financial business, the Communications Bank has proposed a  series of measures for strengthening internal risk management  and for ensuring the quality of foreign exchange assets. At the  same time, it will put the cultivation of export-oriented  talented persons in an extremely important positon; cooperate  with colleges and universities in offering foreign language  courses and foreign exchange business courses; continue to study  and do fieldwork in overseas branch banks; and set up  competitive mechanisms and exciting mechanisms for foreign  exchange talents.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Economy: 'Lame-duck' chancellor's political capital running out - Many Tories hope the tenant of 11 Downing Street will soon be ejected DENIALS from Downing Street are no longer enough. The public support offered by Mr John Major yesterday did nothing to disguise the weakness of his chancellor. In the eyes of his colleagues on the Conservative benches at Westminster, Mr Norman Lamont is a lame duck. He has the office of chancellor but he lacks its political authority. That is not the assessment of political enemies but rather of a broad swathe of the Tory party - ministerial colleagues among them. It is impossible to find more than a handful who expect him to remain in No 11 after the summer. There is a chance they are wrong. The atmosphere which seeps from the lobbies, bars and corridors of Westminster is notoriously febrile. The mood of Tory MPs swings from euphoria to despair with alarming speed. It is hard to recall that Lord Lawson, blamed widely among Conservatives for the country's present economic mess, was not so long ago praised as the architect of an economic miracle. The Tory party is never slow to erect pedestals for its leaders. It is equally quick to demolish them. Mr Lamont has first-hand experience. He was attacked for his economic policy before last year's general election; praised for the same policy after it. In the wake of sterling's ignominious exit from the European exchange rate mechanism last September many thought he should resign. But the interest rate cuts which followed and the growth strategy in November's Autumn Statement brought a reprieve, even a brief moment of acclaim. By January Mr Major had rejected the advice of friends to switch the chancellor to the Home Office in a pre-Budget reshuffle. His decision reflected a combination of stubborn loyalty and his concern not to upset the political balance of his cabinet. Mr Lamont had skilfully aligned himself with the Euro-sceptics. His departure would have given dangerous ammunition to the opponents of the Maastricht treaty. But keeping him carried a price. The two most precious commodities for any chancellor are the confidence of the City and Westminster, and the instinctive trust of the prime minister. The uncomfortable truth is that the Tory party no longer has faith in Mr Lamont's ability to deliver the economic recovery he has promised so often. His political peers are quite happy to believe he is reading a script written in No 10. And in politics, perceptions often count for more than reality. A throwaway remark from a middle-ranking minister catches the general mood: 'I don't blame Norman but I don't know anyone in the party who thinks he is an asset as chancellor.' A backbench colleague is more blunt: 'He should be allowed to deliver the Budget and then packed off to the Home Office.' Cabinet colleagues are not briefing against the chancellor. But they make little pretence of expecting him to stay on for more than a few months. Instead they tend to shrug their shoulders, pause and then speculate about his successor. Other ministers suggest he plays a muted role in cabinet discussions which go beyond a narrow definition of Treasury interests. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, and Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, are established as front-runners for the succession. Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, and Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, are other possible 'compromise candidates'. There is some sympathy for Mr Lamont. The disintegration of the ERM strategy was a collective rather than an individual failure of government. Sympathy, however, does not easily translate into confidence. A graphic example of the chancellor's weakness came last week in the typical reaction on the Conservative benches to the latest cut in interest rates. Instead of the applause he might have expected, Mr Lamont instead found the move greeted with deep suspicion: had he been panicked into the move or had Mr Major demanded it? There is no evidence of personal animosity between the two Downing Street neighbours. Neither has yet formed a fixed view on the shape of the Budget. Their meetings are described by insiders as perfectly amicable. But that is only half of the story. Mr Major and Mr Lamont have never been close political friends. If there is little animosity between them, there is no instinctive rapport. As one insider puts it: 'They have to work at it.' The prime minister knows that his premiership hangs on securing economic recovery before the recession does irreparable damage to public finances. So it is hardly surprising that he is taking a keener than usual interest in the Budget and has taken the lead in promoting a new industrial strategy. But tacit acknowledgement by Mr Major's aides that he has been driving policy is hard to square with public pronouncements that Mr Lamont is in charge. Downing Street sees the risks on financial markets of a public rift. Mr Major has acted to bolster Mr Lamont's standing. But it may be too late. Public expressions of confidence in the chancellor serve only to underline his weakness. Too many at Westminster remember Mrs Margaret Thatcher's description of Mr Nigel Lawson as 'unassailable'.</p>

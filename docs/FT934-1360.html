			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Steelmakers under Brussels microscope After a year of acrimony, agreement last Friday set the seal on total aid of Ecu6.791bn (Pounds 5.17bn) for subsidised steel companies in Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal. But it heralded a period of tough monitoring by the European Commission. The subsidised companies will be cutting capacity of more than 5m tonnes, but virtually every step they take will be watched. If the Commission decides its conditions are not being respected, it could demand suspension or even reimbursement of subsidies. The four member states will have to send the Commission reports at least twice a year on the producers concerned, covering everything from production levels to financial performance. In particular, companies will have to prove that any investment which increases steel capacity is not being financed by state aid. Ministers agreed to write into each decision a clause stressing that if the company concerned does not return to profitability, further state subsidies will be turned down. Ministers also agreed to make a 'firm commitment to avoid any further Article 95 derogations in respect of aid for any individual companies'. Article 95 allows the European Union to exempt subsidy plans from the outright ban on subsidies contained in the Treaty of Paris, on which the European Coal and Steel Community is based. As Commission and national officials admitted on Friday, the political declaration limiting aid will not be legally binding. Until the Treaty of Paris expires in 2002, governments will still be able to demand exemption for state subsidies: the implication, however, is that the Commission will be tougher next time in enforcing the treaty's ban on state aids. Friday's meeting reached unanimous agreement on six separate proposals, making up the largest package of state aid for the steel industry since the crisis of the 1980s. These were the main conclusions: Ilva: the state-owned Italian producer will cut 1.2m tonnes of annual production at its Taranto plant, and the buyer of Ilva's flat products business will close a further 500,000 tonnes elsewhere - although the product area is not specified as the British industry has pointed out. No figure has been put on the capacity to be cut at Bagnoli, a dormant hot strip mill which will be shut down for good. In the Commission's original figures Bagnoli accounted for 300,000 tonnes, but Italy always argued it was worth more. Bagnoli must still be closed but in the final document the figure for capacity reduction has been left blank. Ekostahl: The UK and Denmark were worried about the restructuring of the east German producer and at one point it looked as though Denmark might block an overall deal, on the grounds that steel from Ekostahl would compete directly with a non-aided Danish plant. In the end the two countries won key amendments to the deal. Production at the company's new hot strip mill will be limited to 900,000 tonnes a year until 1999. For the five years after that, according to the Commission, it will be limited to 'significantly below 2m tonnes'. Mr Tim Sainsbury, the UK's industry minister, was more precise about the figure. On Friday he said he had won a commitment from the Germans that Riva  -the Italian company which is bidding to buy Ekostahl - would limit annual production to 1.65m tonnes up to 2004. Mr Melchior Wathelet, the Belgian industry minister who chaired the meeting, stressed that new production during the first five years would be used 'exclusively for further processing in Ekostahl's cold rolling facilities'. He also said that 1.65m tonnes represented the capacity of the cold rolling facilities at Ekostahl. CSI: The Spanish industry minister, Mr Jose Manuel Eguiagaray, managed to persuade his counterparts that the flat products plant at Ansio, near Bilbao, would close at the end of 1995, instead of the middle of 1995 as originally agreed with the Commission. However, he signed up to a text which said CSI would do its best to close the plant earlier. Deals involving Siderurgica Nacional in Portugal, Freital in Germany and Sidenor in Spain completed the package.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPEAN STEEL CAPACITY CUTS*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                       Country      Aid (m Ecu)       Reduction                                                          ('000 tonnes) SIDENOR                       Spain                515             439 CSI                           Spain              2,817           2,300 FREITAL                       Germany              140             160 EKOSTAHL                      Germany              428             462 ILVA                          Italy              2,585           2,000** SIDERURGICA NACIONAL          Portugal             306             140  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  * EU cuts agreed for state-aided sector ** Based on 1.2m tonnes of cuts at Ilva's Taranto plant, 500,000 tonnes    at plants owned by the eventual buyer of Taranto, and 300,000 tonnes    in the Commission's original figures for Ilva's dormant Bagnoli    plant.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source:- European Commission  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

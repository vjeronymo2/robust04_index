			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Burford pays Pounds 94m for the Trocadero - Nigel Wray acquires landmark property in London's West End The Trocadero, the landmark property in London's West End, has been sold to Burford Holdings for Pounds 94m in the largest property transaction in the City this year. It was sold by the receivers to the collapsed Power Corporation. The building is situated next to Piccadilly Circus on what is supposedly the busiest walkway in Europe. It has already been through three owners since its redevelopment in 1984, and at the peak of the property market was worth about Pounds 250m. KPMG Peat Marwick, the receiver, put the Trocadero on the market in October at a target price of Pounds 100m, and received 'half a dozen' firm offers - primarily from south-east Asian investors. Local interest was limited. The buyer, Burford, is the rapidly-growing property group which purchased a Pounds 103m property portfolio from Ladbroke in February. It is run by Mr Nigel Wray, an entrepreneur who has been involved in companies including Carlton Communications and The People's Phone, and Mr Nick Leslau, who has headed the company since its March 1987 flotation. Burford has considerable expertise in resuscitating distressed properties, such as Manchester's Piccadilly Plaza, but it has taken an enormous challenge in trying to convert the Trocadero's visitor throughput into hard cash. Success has eluded previous owners. Developed by the electricity industry's pension fund in 1984, the Trocadero was sold on to Brent Walker and Power Corporation. It financially crippled the two groups, and their bankers who lent about Pounds 170m against the development. Nor was it an easy property to sell. Mr John Stephen, investment partner at selling agents Jones Lang Wootton, said: 'It is as much an entertainment business as a real estate investment'. It therefore did not appeal to institutional investors. Yet its statistics are extraordinary. The Trocadero attracted about 14m people last year, of which close to half spent nothing and the average person just Pounds 5. It has a number of successful tenants. A 450 sq ft sweet shop is selling around 3 tons of confectionery a week, while Planet Hollywood is said to be pushing through 10 covers a day on its 350 tables. However, it also has 119,000 sq ft of vacant office and retail space, or 29 per cent of its total 411,000 sq ft of lettable space. Mr Nick Leslau, Burford's chief executive, said: 'We should be able to do better. We have a lot of experience with buildings that have been badly managed.' The Trocadero is generating Pounds 8.6m in rental income, representing a yield of around 9 per cent. Burford plans to invest around Pounds 7m on restructuring and refurbishing the property. It will convert the bulk of the building's 115,000 sq ft of office space into leisure, to emphasise its role as an entertainment centre. The existing leisure areas are 90 per cent let. The acquisition increases the value of Burford's gross assets to Pounds 417m. The purchase will be funded through cash and debt, and will increase Burford's gearing from 37 per cent to 75 per cent. That remains well within the management's self-imposed 100 per cent limit.</p>

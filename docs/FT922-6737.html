			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Pacemakers do the quickstep In a healthy person the heart responds to exercise and sustained physical activity by accelerating the heartbeat and pumping more oxygen-carrying blood around the body. But in diseased or damaged hearts pacemakers do the work. Conventional pacemakers work with a piezoelectric (activity) sensor which speeds up heart rate in response to physical activity. But doctors have found a way to sustain higher heartbeat rates and improve workload capacity by adding a minute ventilation sensor. Medtronic's new Legend Plus pacemaker, which was implanted for the first time in a 60-year-old patient in Munich last month, stimulates a diseased or damaged heart to pump more blood in response to the body's varying needs for oxygen. The new device weighs 40 grams and lasts for more than eight years. Medtronic Europe: Brussels, 32 2 676 0850.</p>

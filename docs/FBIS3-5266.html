The cache included 2,500 rounds for an M79  grenade-launcher and 20,080 rounds for an M60 medium machine  gun. The seizure happened at about 1 p.m. when 10 policemen were  patrolling near Ban Mae Suya. They spotted a convoy of 30  pack-horses being guarded by a group of armed men heading for  Burmese territory.    Because they were outnumbered, police decided to follow the  gang towards the border until they accidently found a gunny bag  believed to have fallen from a pack-horse that contained 2,580  rounds of M79 and M60 ammunition. Police decided to call in more  reinforcements and fired into the air to stop the convoy but  they sped away.    Police yesterday morning combed the area and found nine  horses including a dead one, abandoned in the jungle. Each of  them was found carrying over 2,000 rounds of ammunition.</p>

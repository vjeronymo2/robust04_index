			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: Counter voice - Making fun of fashion is no longer fun because everybody's doing it It should no longer surprise anyone that fashion can have its own way with history. Last month's Milan collections plundered the teenage innocence of 1950s Americana - pink satin preppy blouses, marabou powder puffs, rhinestones and sequins - and gleefully married it to a sleazy 1970s catwalk soundtrack (Barry White, Roxy Music and Gloria Gaynor) without so much as a second thought. It is not only textures and fabrics which today's designers feel able to mix and match, it is entire decades and sensibilities, all helping to give a 'feel' to a new collection; and in the Italy of the 1990s, crocked by corruption and cynicism, what better way of brightening the national mood than this panchronistic explosion of fun and glamour? Fashion is far from unique in this regard; the history of art in Western culture is a long, interminable cycle of stolen ideas, fads and hommages to distant cultures. Music and literature, too, frequently refer to their own histories. But fushion's recycling of past glories is distinguished by the sheer speed of reinvention. Technological innovation and the demands of the mass media enable a trend to bloom, wither and die in less than 12 months. Some, it might be said, do not even deserve to last that long. When designers first raided the 1970s, barely 20 years after the original version, many observers could hardly believe their eyes; this, after all, was the decade which taste forgot, the era of tragic haircuts, sprained-ankle footwear and flapping loons, its garish ghastliness captured exquisitely by Clodagh Rodgers and her hot pants strutting their sorry stuff at the Eurovision Song Contest. Surely they could not come back? The answer from the streets was: why ever not? For as the style nightmare has been enthusiastically relived over the past couple of years, it has become increasingly apparent that traditional notions of good and bad taste simply do not apply any longer; indeed, that the very notion of bringing aesthetic judgment to bear on how we look is being satirised by the new generation of plunderers. Looking good has taken a back seat to making fun. It seems that in fashion, as in so many other areas, the post-modern sensibility, revelling in the fragmented and the multi-focal, mocking seriousness with its unrelenting tone of playful irony, has taken over. Good taste is yesterday's phrase (prompting the thought that it may itself come back into vogue tomorrow); but for the moment, anything goes. No figure has better encapsulated the triumph of the post-modern, ironic outlook than Franco Moschino, the Italian designer who died in September. Where his contemporaries bedecked their garments with accessories or carefully modulated patterns, Moschino instead chose self-mocking slogans: 'Waist of Money' flouted one waistline; 'A Shirt For Fashion Victims Only' teased another. Needless to say, the joke comes expensive, but it is not clear who is its perpetrator and who is its victim. Those wearing the garments can reassure themselves that they are 'in' on the jest, but that is not how an outside observer might see it. Certainly the quest for beauty, the traditional aim of all who work in the visual and design arts, is being endlessly deferred in a bewildering, multi-layered comic conspiracy. Moschino's supporters have applauded his work on the grounds that it brought much-needed fun to a business which had become full of itself. In this respect, today's post-modern viewpoint mirrors the camp sensibility that exerted such an influence on earlier generations' tastes. In her powerful essay Notes on Camp, written 30 years ago, Susan Sontag spoke of the 'love of the exaggerated, the 'off', of things-being-what-they-are-not', which can also be seen in much of today's fashion. Sontag quoted approvingly Oscar Wilde's observation that a doorknob could be as admirable as a painting, as a shrewd anticipation of the 'democratic esprit' of camp. Both of them would surely have joined Moschino in poking fun at the po-faced, high-blown pretentions of haute couture. And yet, there are differences between the social context in which Sontag wrote her essay and that of today. In putting forward an intellectual justification for camp, Sontag emphasised its role as a counter-balance to the pervading mood of moral seriousness. 'Camp is a solvent of morality,' she wrote. 'It neutralises moral indignation, sponsors playfulness. 'Camp taste is, above all, a mode of enjoyment, of appreciation - not judgment. Camp is generous. It wants to enjoy.' In the US of the early 1960s, when Notes on Camp was written, one would surely have taken Sontag's point. Here was a society heaving with the strain of cold war politics, still grieving over the brutal assassination of its president, and forced to reassess its core values after the civil rights marches and the challenges they posed to the country's constitution. It was an intense time, and Sontag's celebration of Wilde, of witty hedonism, of Camp's 'comic vision of the world', were in sharp contrast and relief to the earnest mood of passionate debate which dominated the country (as was the growth of Pop Art and the sillier counter-cultural movements of the decade's later years). It is hard to detect any of that moral gravity in today's prevailing climate. In the US and Europe, post-modern politics, philosophy and art, basking in ambiguity and relativism, dancing on the graves of the century's dominant ideologies, have undermined the desire for morally committed debate. Camp, irony, playfulness have become the norm - no longer are they suspended in a balance against the more stolid virtues of moral certitude and argumentative rigour. Fun works best as an antidote to solemnity. The very last thing we need in 1994 is to chuckle knowingly at a funny frock on the catwalk. If society-at-large cannot be serious, perhaps we might look at the masterful cut of a sumptuous fabric to take the lead</p>

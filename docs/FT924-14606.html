			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Bank of Italy lowers short-term rate THE Bank of Italy yesterday announced it was lowering as of today its fixed short-term interest rate charged to banks by half a percentage point to 16 per cent. The basic discount rate remained unchanged at 15 per cent. But the move to lower the fixed short-term rate is in line with the bank's desire to reduce the spread between short-term rates and the base rate, provoked by recent turbulence in the currency markets. It also followed two days in which the lira has recovered against the D-Mark amid signs in the market that the parity had overshot too far against the German currency. On Monday the lira had moved close to 1,000 against the D-Mark; but by yesterday the lira was being quoted at 888. The parity is close to a rate which the Italian monetary authorities had previously regarded as reasonably stable. This represents a devaluation of nearly 17 per cent against its level of September 14. Over the past week dealings in the lira have been thin, about 20 per cent of the normal volume, mainly accounted for by importers and exporters obliged to operate with a floating rate, and this is believed to have caused the fluctuations rather than speculation. The rate cut came too late to affect the stock market, which had earlier been boosted by a vote by the senate finance committee to recommend a one-year suspension of Italy's complex and unpopular tax on capital gains on share dealings. News of the vote contributed to the sharp rise on the Milan stock exchange. The proposal to suspend the capital gains tax until September 30, 1993, has still to be passed by the full senate, where it will be considered next week. Approval is also required in the chamber of deputies, but stockbrokers are confident MPs will pass the measure. The suspension will exclude trading in blocks of shares representing more than 2 per cent of a company's capital. Stockbrokers have bitterly opposed the levy, which taxes capital gains at 15 per cent or 25 per cent depending on how taxpayers choose to pay. They blame it for eroding speculative sentiment and depressing share values. They add that the tax, introduced in February 1991, has also been disappointing for the Finance Ministry, as low trading volumes and depressed share values have kept receipts below expectations. The government has recognised the tax is unsatisfactory, but has so far been unwilling to suspend it, in part because such action might be seen as a sop to the rich.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Seoul's revival hindered by economic problems - A look at the ailing equity market The South Korean government's efforts to revive the ailing Seoul stock market are a study in frustration. The index has tumbled by more than 40 per cent in the past three years and on Monday sank to its lowest closing level in almost five years. Since the beginning of the year it has declined by 8.6 per cent, ending yesterday at 559. Indeed, the recent plunge would have been even steeper if the government's stock market stabilisation fund had not intervened. But the fund may prove less effective in breaking future falls since its reserves have dwindled to less than Won300bn (Dollars 380m) out of its original Won5,000bn budget. Some analysts are now forecasting that the index will decline a further 10 per cent in coming weeks to around the 500 mark. The chief economic adviser to President Roh Tae Woo is now recommending that the government abandons further efforts to boost the market, although the Ministry of Finance favours continued intervention. The issue is a sensitive one in an election year since the government worries about decreased support among middle-class voters if the market does not recover. The government had hoped that its Dollars 4.1bn rescue in late May of three troubled investment trust companies used by 1m small investors would encourage them to return to the market. Declining interest among individuals, who account for more than 50 per cent of share ownership, has caused trading volume to be halved in June. Moreover, foreign interest is on the wane. The opening of the market at the beginning of the year to direct foreign investment briefly led to an equity rally in January and February. After reaching a peak of 691 the index gradually receded and foreign buying now stands at only 30 per cent of the January level. One of the reasons has been the 10 per cent limit placed on foreign ownership of shares. The authorities have respon-ded by lifting the ceiling to 25 per cent from next week. In a further attempt to attract more foreign money, the government has also announced that foreigners will be able to acquire an 8 per cent holding in either Pohang Iron &amp; Steel or Korea Electric Power Corporation. Together the two companies account for almost 13 per cent of total market capitalisation. These actions, however, do not go to the heart of the problems: a declining confidence in the economy and the uncertain political situation. Economic growth is slowing, causing a spate of bankruptcies, including 15 listed concerns so far this year. Corporate earnings have fallen to a 10-year low, while inflation remains high. The political outlook is clouded with the possibility that as many as five candidates will stand in December's presidential election. The front-runner, Mr Kim Young Sam of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party, could face an unco-operative parliament if he is elected, further weakening the government's ability to solve the economic problems. With interest rates at 17 per cent, domestic investors prefer the better yields offered by the corporate bond market. Liquidity has also been squeezed by the fall in land prices. Most analysts believe that the market will not stage a recovery for another three to six months. Optimists argue, however, that the general share index, which is weighted towards large capitalised companies, does not tell the whole story of the market's performance this year. Equity prices for small and medium-sized companies have risen about 30 per cent, led by the foreigners' hunt for bargains. But there are signs that interest in these shares is also tapering off as their price/earnings ratios climb. Mr Duke Shin, an analyst with Baring Securities, says: 'The market could turn around with a perceived improvement in economic fundamentals.' There are signs that this is happening, with the likelihood that the economic slowdown and a tight monetary policy will lead to reduced interest rates by the year-end. Analysts, however, still worry that a rally could be cut short around the 800 level as institutional investors, including the stabilisation fund and the investment trusts, unload extensive share portfolios in an attempt to improve their financial position.</p>

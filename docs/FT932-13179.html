			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / UK Company News: Serco wins US naval base contract THE MANAGEMENT contract for Diego Garcia, the US Naval base in the Indian Ocean which was used during the Gulf war, has been awarded to a consortium including Serco, the British facilities and project management company. The seven-year contract, worth Dollars 160m (Pounds 103m), also covers support sites. The consortium is led by Burns and Roe Services of the US. But as Diego Garcia is British territory, at least 20 per cent of the contract has to be awarded to a British company. Mr David Perkins, Serco's finance director, said it had less than a third of the contract, worth only Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m a year in turnover, but it was Serco's first large contract with the US military. Its shares jumped 38p to 988p.</p>

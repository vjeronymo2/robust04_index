			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Our interview guest is Colonel Legrier, commander of  French forces in Bihac. Edouard Balladur has now arrived in  Bosnia after travelling from Zagreb. He is due to visit Bihac,  a Muslim enclave besieged by the Serbs, where a French UN  soldier was killed on Friday [11 March]. Systematically  targetted in the last few days, the UN soldiers on the ground  want stronger powers to hit back. Colonel Legrier:    [Begin recording] [Legrier] The visit by our prime minister  and our defense minister is very much appreciated, because we  have been in an extremely tense situation over the last two  weeks. Our men have been repeatedly targetted and have come  very close to death. They have behaved quite magnificently, and  the presence among us today of these two high-ranking officials  is very good for their morale.    [Unidentified correspondent] Do you expect something in  particular from this visit? We know that the French forces  deployed in Bihac have called for NATO air strikes.    [Legrier] That is quite true. On Thursday [10 March], I  asked for a NATO air strike, which could not be carried out. I  asked for one again last night [12 March]. I received  authorization for a strike, but unfortunately it came too late:  The target that had been attacking us had time to disappear  into the undergrowth, so we were unable to strike. What we need  is a great deal of determination on the part of the authorities  in order to raise the many constraints that are weighing down  the decisionmaking process, and which make our decisions very  difficult to carry out.    [Unidentified correspondent] Do you think that the political  authorities need to go further still?    [Legrier] I honestly think we have gone some way to solving  the problem in Sarajevo by showing a great deal of  determination. We need to show the same determination  everywhere. [end recording]</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: More changes proposed to FT-SE classifications The FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification Committee has published its second list of changes to the proposed new classification system which is due to come into effect on January 4 next year. The changes follow a second adjudication meeting of the committee which is part of the consultative process following the publication of initial proposals in October. A third adjudication meeting will be held next Monday. The committee has now completed its review of the sectors and sub-sectors, and has taken decisions on two thirds of the representations made about individual companies. It is taking the companies in sector order, so has not yet reached Inchcape, the international trading and motors group, which has made strong representations about its classification as a motor distributor. Yesterday's announce-ment included changes to the insurance sectors and a further 57 moves of companies to different sub-sectors. Mr Nick Fitzpatrick, chairman of the committee, said the committee recognised 'that some companies may be disappointed' but once in operation classifications would be reviewed quarterly. One company thought to be disappointed is Wickes, which wanted to move from builders' merchants to retailers but has stayed put. The originally proposed Insurance, Composite sector, which had only one sub-sector also called Insurance, Composite, is to be broadened and renamed Insurance. As well as the composite insurers, it will include Insurance, Brokers, formerly a sub-sector in the Other Financial sector, and a new sub-sector called Insurance, Lloyd's Funds, which will contain the new listed Lloyds corporate capital vehicles. The Insurance, Life sector and sub-sector, will be renamed Life Assurance. Among the company moves, Allied-Lyons is to switch from the Breweries sub-sector to Spirits, Wines &amp; Ciders. Siebe and Weir Group have both been reclassified in Engineering, Diversified from Engineering Contractors. Vickers, which makes tanks and Rolls-Royce cars, is moving from Engineering, Aerospace and Defence to Engineering, Diversified. A full list of the changes will be published in tomorrow's edition of the Financial Times.</p>

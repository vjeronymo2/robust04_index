			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 12, RIA -- Yuriy Chernichenko said that  his Peasant Party supported Russia's Democratic Choice Party  [RDCP].    Chernichenko who spoke at the founding congress of the RDCP  said that he would above all support its struggle against the  insatiable appetites of the military-industrial complex.  Pointing to the symbol of the RDCP - Falcone's famous monument  to Peter the Great called the bronze horseman, he compared the  military-industrial complex to the horseman, "who has grown so  fat that it has crushed his horse and stripped it of what was  left of its flesh." The state Duma "deceives itself and the  country by endorsing an impossibly high military budget which  make all reforms 'sluggish," he said.    Support for Russia's new political party has also been  expressed by representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party of  Japan and the Moderate Party of Sweden.</p>

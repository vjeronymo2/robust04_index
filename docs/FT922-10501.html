			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Greycoat loan lifts shares 13% THE SHARE price of Greycoat, the UK property group, leapt 13 per cent yesterday as it was confirmed that the Pounds 126m refinancing of Embankment Place, the group's 345,000 sq ft property in London, had finally been completed. Greycoat had attempted to refinance the development, which was started five years ago, at the beginning of this year. However, its attempts to interest investors in a deep-discounted bond issue at that time were unsuccessful. The company announced yesterday that it had now completed a Pounds 125.8m, seven-year syndicated loan involving a total of nine banks. The deal, which gives the company an option to extend the loan to 10 years in all, should carry the group over until London property prices are next on a rising trend, maintained Mr Richard Guignard, managing director of finance. Greycoat has swapped the floating rate money provided by the banks into fixed-rate finance, at a rate of 11.2 per cent. That implies a margin of about 1.5 per cent over the banks' cost of funds - about double the margin paid by Greycoat on the initial financing for the development, and a reflection of the bank's lack of appetite for greater exposure to the UK property sector. Mr Guignard said that the loan had been completed without Greycoat being forced to accept more onerous covenants than had existed on the previous financing, an important consideration for the equity market, which has taken fright at property companies. Greycoat's shares gained 7p to 61p yesterday, having risen from a floor of 33p as recently as April 13. 'The market was concerned about our ability to refinance and retain these major buildings,' said Mr Guignard. The company has no other sizeable refinancings to complete until 1995, when a Pounds 50m zero coupon bond issue matures, he said.</p>

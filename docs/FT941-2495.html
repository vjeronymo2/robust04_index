			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Setback for main German parties in local elections Both Germany's main political parties, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats and the opposition Social Democrats, suffered setbacks in yesterday's local elections in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein. Yet fears of voter apathy, and new gains for extreme right-wing parties, proved unfounded, with a 70 per cent turnout of the 2.1m voters in Germany's northernmost state. The main beneficiaries of the swing against the big parties were the environmentalist Greens, and a series of local interest electors' groups in the 1,100-odd council elections. The poll is the second of the 19 elections to be held in Germany this year, culminating in the general election on October 16. It provides the first sign that the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), as well as the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU), is facing a backlash among electors. On the other hand it suggests that dire predictions of a strong rise in the far right wing may have been exaggerated. Official results gave the SPD 39.5 per cent support, down 3.4 percentage points on its total of 42.9 per cent in the 1990 local elections. The CDU gained 37.5 per cent of the vote, down 3.8 percentage points from 1990. The Greens saw a clear pick-up in votes, from 6 per cent in 1990 to 10.3 per cent last night. The Free Democratic party (FDP), Chancellor Kohl's junior partner in the Bonn coalition, had another bad night, down from 6.1 per cent four years ago to 4.4 per cent yesterday. Far right parties like the Deutsche Volksunion (which gained entry to the Schleswig-Holstein state parliament with 6 per cent support in 1992) and the Republicans only contested a few towns and failed to make a significant showing.</p>

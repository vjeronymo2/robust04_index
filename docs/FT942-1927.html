			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Insurance prices fall as profits increase The price of motor and home insurance is beginning to fall as the industry returns to profitability, the Association of British Insurers said yesterday. 'Some policyholders have already benefited from rate reductions as competition within the industry remains strong,' said Mr Allan Bridgewater, chairman. Rates in the motor insurance market fell an average of 5 per cent during in the year to 1 April, according to the association. No comparable figures were available for home insurance, although some policyholders had benefited from premium cuts of up to 20 per cent. Rates increased sharply in 1991 and 1992 after insurers were hit by record losses from storms, subsidence and recession-related claims. Last year the industry returned to the black, achieving a profit of Pounds 1.9bn, equal to 5.4 per cent of its premium income compared with a loss of 2.7 per cent in 1992. An underwriting profit equal to 1 per cent of premiums was achieved in motor insurance. The turnaround has resulted from reduced operating costs, lower claims in some areas of business, and the impact of premium rate rises. Mr Bridgewater warned, however, that the industry needed to be more careful in placing too much importance on capital gains and investment income during a period of very low inflation and lower returns as a result of falling interest rates. Separately Mr Bridgewater said he was sure the insurance industry would 'do everything possible' to make a success of the Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog intended to protect the private investor. The formal recognition of the PIA by the Securities and Investments Board, the chief City regulator, is expected in the next few days, paving the way for the watchdog to become operational.</p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Letter: Support for continuity Sir, May I endorse Mr Baker's excellent letter (November 26) seeking support for the Securities and Futures Authority's continuing success in regulating retail stock exchange business. Your article, 'Back to the Drawing Board' (November 26) seems to indicate that Mr Mick Newmarch (of Prudential Corporation) and Lord Alexander (of National Westminster Bank) are influenced by the clear need for their own self-interest to salvage FIMBRA. In my own self-interest, and that of my clients, I urge Lord Alexander, Mr Newmarch and other financial services industry leaders to consider the undoubted success of the stock exchange over many years and its present successor, the SFA, and to build on it. Their proposals would surely unnecessarily sublimate a small and much needed service which is essential to private investors and to the government's declared aim to encourage wider share ownership. In any case, vast change will incur vast cost without ensuring a better end product. Will small- and medium-sized independent intermediaries survive a second onslaught of regulatory change and cost within a decade? Without intermediaries the public will have less independent advice. Is this what the Prudential and Natwest are seeking? Hugh Marsden, S P Angel, BIIBA House, 14 Bevis Marks, London EC3</p>

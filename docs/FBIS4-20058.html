			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gianfranco Miglio, Northern League </F> ideologue, by Daniele Vimercati; place and date not given:  "Miglio: `I Am Already Writing the Federal Constitution'" --  first paragraph is IL GIORNALE introduction]    [Text] The grand old man of federalism is not concerned  about the newspaper headlines. "I have read them, they say that  [Northern League secretary] Bossi is saying goodbye to  federalism...nonsense." Gianfranco Miglio is convinced that the  lastest remarks made by the secretary have not changed the  League's policy. Yet everybody heard those statements saying  that federalist reform will be postponed a little because the  first need is the people's "desire for government." The  professor [Miglio] replies: "What does that have to do with it;  Bossi's words were precise and measured; it takes a brazen face  to interpret them as renouncing and abandoning federalism." A  benevolent interpretation of Bossi's remarks? "Not at all," is  his prompt reply, "even [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi agrees  with what he says."    [Vimercati] Excuse me, but how do you know?    [Miglio] Because the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] called me  and told me what he thinks.    [Vimercati] Which is?    [Miglio] He listened to what Bossi said and took his words  for what they were: a go-ahead on moves to relaunch the  economy, a strong warning on the League's decision to put  federalism back in the center of the government's action.    [Vimercati] In the center, but tomorrow, as we say. That is  how problems are usually set aside.    [Miglio] By the old political system perhaps. But certainly  not by us. Berlusconi realizes this; he told me that he is  ready to accede to our demands and is enthusiastic that he found  us receptive to the problems of recovery. We will soon talk  about these problems. We must meet...    [Vimercati] Did you not fear, not even for a moment, that  your plan for a federal Italy would be submerged forever?    [Miglio] Never, absolutely not. It would be suicide for the  League. Even Bossi told me: "I would not be so stupid to commit  suicide in this way."    [Vimercati] But a certain delay, at least, is foreseeable?    [Miglio] I have always declared myself ready to write a  federal constitution in 90 days. I repeat this. I have already  started working.    [Vimercati] Do you also fear, as Bossi does, the great power  of Berlusconi?    [Miglio] Let us say that rules are needed to prevent him  from  getting government action mixed up with his own personal  business interests. First let us say that I do not agree with  the idea of assigning him the Interior Ministry pro tempore. I  will tell him this when I see him. A new man is needed there.    [Vimercati] For example?    [Miglio] The League has already decided: [League number two]  Roberto Maroni.    [Vimercati] Are you not afraid of ambushes in such a  delicate ministry?    [Miglio] There is that danger but I think that Roberto will  succeed in avoiding the pitfalls especially if our proposal is  accepted.    [Vimercati] Which is?    [Miglio] Removing the control of the secret service from the  ministry's jurisdiction.    [Vimercati] Let us get back to guarantees over Berlusconi's  role. What do you say about the idea of assigning the role of  guarantor to somebody like [Senator] Spadolini for example?    [Miglio] Heaven help us! What need is there to invent other  nonsense like this? Frankly, this idea seems quite odd. I have  not discussed this with anybody, but I ask myself where all this  frenzied activity to find a position for Spadolini comes from.    [Vimercati] Perhaps it is just to compensate him for the bad  joke you played on him in the Senate?    [Miglio] That was no joke, it was a solemn democratic  bashing. Look, with all the friendship I have for Spadolini, the  best I could wish for him would be a kind of hibernation. Yes,  he should be put away in the refrigerator as my wife recently  did with the kid meat.    [Vimercati] A life member of the Senate like kid meat?    [Miglio] What I mean is that this country can survive even  without Spadolioni. And anyway, I do not like this idea of  placing somebody above the prime minister. It means putting him  under guardianship, preventing him from carrrying out his job in  government. In short, castrating him.    [Vimercati] Then how will you pare the businessman-prime  minister's finger nails?    [Miglio] An advanced democracy must be able to achieve this  objective by laying down an institutional procedure, with  objective and general limits. No single man is needed: We have  already seen how the publishing guarantor failed.    [Vimercati] What about yourself, professor, what role do you  hope to cut out for yourself in the second republic?    [Miglio] There was talk of assigning me the Institutional  Reform Ministry, but I am not concerned about these matters. I  restrict my action to observing, studying, suggesting. There  will be a recovery, perhaps even a boom, under the Berlusconi  government because those wanting to make investments will find  fertile ground before them. However, this energy will be wasted  if there is no new state. That is why the issue of federalism  will reemerge very quickly.    [Vimercati] Let us keep to the present, today is 25 April:  Do you agree with the League's decision to be present?    [Miglio] I have three ideas regarding the Resistance  Movement: first, we have foreign armed forces to thank for the  final result, not the Italians, otherwise the neofascists would  have won; second, it was a batttle for individual liberty;  third, as with all civil wars, it brought with it a great deal  of personal revenge.    [Vimercati] But what does this day mean to you personally?    [Miglio] I was in the Resistance movement, but with the  Catholic groups. I do not like the Left's attempts to use this  anniversary as a means of political revenge. You can be  anti-Fascist without being a leftist.</p>

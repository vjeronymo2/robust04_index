			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Cuomo backs Murdoch bid to acquire NY Post THE BATTLE for the New York Post, the bankrupt tabloid newspaper, took a new twist yesterday as it emerged that Mr Rupert Murdoch had won the support of New York Governor Mario Cuomo and two US Senators in his bid to acquire The Post. Mr Murdoch, who owned The Post between 1976 and 1988, is seeking a waiver of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulation that bans anyone from owning both a newspaper and a television station in the same city. Mr Murdoch's Fox television network owns a New York station. Governor Cuomo, in a letter sent to Mr John Dingell, chairman of the Congressional committee with jurisdiction over the FCC, argued in favour of a waiver for Mr Murdoch, although he added: 'I anticipate that under the prospective ownership of Rupert Murdoch I will continue to find myself at odds with The Post's coverage.' Mr Murdoch has the 'right of first refusal' to buy The Post if its present owner - Mr Peter Kalikow, a bankrupt property developer - decides to sell. The Post saga became more muddled still yesterday when another bidder for the newspaper - Mr Steven Hoffenberg, the debt collector who is being sued for fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) - was told by a federal court judge to provide a full accounting of his personal and business assets within 10 days or face arrest. The unusual court order, which concerns Dollars 1.4m of cheques written by Mr Hoffenberg to The New York Post and to a company he controls, came as Mr Hoffenberg sought bankruptcy protection for five subsidiaries of his debt collection agency - Towers Financial. Mr Abe Hirschfeld, the car parks magnate who currently controls The Post and was until recently Mr Hoffenberg's main partner, was meanwhile enmeshed in yet another of what have become almost daily battles with Mr Pete Hamill, the mutinous and yet highly popular editor of the newspaper. The newspaper has been traumatised over the past fortnight by the arrival of the 73-year-old Mr Hirschfeld, an eccentric who has sacked and re-hired a number of staff, including Mr Hamill.</p>

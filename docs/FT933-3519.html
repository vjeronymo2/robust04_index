			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Mexico offers a soft target - Nafta critics accuse country of corruption PRESIDENT Bill Clinton today begins a formal campaign to win congressional approval for the North American Free Trade Agreement. But Mexico is a problem. The president has the backing of ex-US presidents and support from 280 US economists, including 12 US Nobel laureates. However, silencing critics of the pact, who say the US has no business integrating its market with a non-democratic country guilty of corruption and human rights abuses, is going to be difficult. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, Mr Robert Reich, labour secretary, and Ms Carol Browner, head of the environmental protection agency, will all bring their persuasive skills before the House ways and means committee to argue that the pact will create more jobs than it will cost. But the administration's efforts, now supported by pro-Nafta television commercials funded by private-sector backers, have yet to address increasing scrutiny of Mexico's political system. 'There is a lot of unease that the side agreements (on the environment and labour) don't address the corruption issue and the chronic abuse of labour rights and environmental standards,' said Mr John Cavanagh, a fellow with the anti-Nafta Institute for Policy Studies. 'In the end the side agreements have very weak enforcement powers.' Mr Ross Perot is also exploiting the administration's vulnerability on the corruption issue. The former presidential candidate has hit the air waves with a scathing attack on the multi-million-dollar pro-Nafta lobby and the 'hired guns' - former US officials - working for a foreign government. Mexico's one-party rule has been referred to on several occasions by Senator Pat Moynihan of New York, chairman of the key Senate finance committee who seems at best an unenthusiastic Nafta backer. Meanwhile, anti-Nafta forces, led by Senator Ernest Hollings, chairman of the Senate commerce committee, are proposing a Nafta alternative: a common market which would require Latin American countries to embrace democratic reforms before they could join. Congressman Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House banking committee, has not taken a public position on the pact, but last week he held hearings which featured testimony about drugs and corruption in the Mexican financial sector. Mr R Christopher Whalen, a former official in the New York Federal Reserve, warned of the lack of legal protection for private property and contracts in Mexico. The US unions are so hostile to the labour side agreement, which was meant to pacify them, that the administration fears resources they have reserved for healthcare reform will be diverted into the anti-Nafta cause. 'Mexican workers cannot defend their own economic interests,' says the labour-supported Economic Policy Institute. 'Trade unions independent of government control are discouraged. The Mexican government intimidates union leaders and workers who do not toe the government line.' Nafta opponents are also working closely with anti-government forces in Mexico. Mr Carlos Heredia, a visiting fellow at the Development Gap, a progressive policy group, is in Washington for a year because 'I want it to be known that a pro-democracy movement - opposed to Nafta - exists in Mexico'. He and others believe Nafta will reinforce the current political system. Pro-Nafta forces are left to link free trade, prosperity and democracy. Mr Harry Freeman, a business lobbyist, says: 'Isolation is not the way to prod Mexico into democracy and get rid of corruption. There is a higher probability things will improve with Nafta than without it.'</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC'S PICKS: "TRUE STORIES"  </P> <P> Joyous, daft and hauntingly original, this 1986 film from David Byrne  (pictured) is a magical mystery tour of Texas: an introduction to the imaginary  town of Virgil and its faintly surrealistic folks, who include, most memorably,  Swoosie Kurtz (as the Laziest Woman in the World) and John Goodman (as a lonely  hearts bachelor).  </P> <P> (Cinemax Monday at 6 p.m.) Sheila Benson  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan 22 (YONHAP) -- North Korea agreed, in  principle, to open its seven declared nuclear sites to full  international inspections in a meeting with the United States  late last year, but negotiations between North Korea and the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on these inspections  appear not to be proceeding as smoothly as was generally  expected.    In these negotiations, now under way between working-level  officials in Vienna, North Korea is seeking to impose  unacceptable limits on IAEA inspections of the nuclear sites in  the face of the IAEA's formal request for full inspections in  line with IAEA standards.    Among the seven sites are a radiochemical laboratory and a  5-megawatt reactor, and the IAEA wants to conduct full  inspections of these facilities under its nuclear safeguards  regime.    But North Korea has reportedly agreed to permit inspections  of the seven facilities within the limits of ensuring the  continuity of nuclear safeguards only, as it has suspended its  decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  (NPT). North Korea's reasoning is that it has no obligation to  meet full NPT requirements for inspections.    North Korea wants to limit IAEA inspections to replacement  of  films and batteries of cameras set in the seven facilities,  while denying IAEA inspectors access to fuel rods of the  five-megawatt reactor and substances used by the radiochemical  laboratory though the IAEA judges such access necessary for a  meaningful inspection.    This position of North Korea was manifested in an interview  by an unidentified spokesman of the North Korean Foreign  Ministry right after an agreement reached between North Korea  and the United States on full inspections of North Korea's seven  declared nuclear sites in New York late last year.    The spokesman said in the interview with Pyongyang's  official  Korean Central News Agency on Dec. 30, just a day after a  working-level meeting between North Korea and the United States  in New York where the agreement was reached, that the United  States had agreed to suspend the "Team Spirit" military exercise  with South Korea and North Korea had agreed to permit  international inspections of the declared nuclear sites not in  line with the nuclear safeguards treaty but in line with the  need to ensure the continuity of nuclear safeguards.    When the agreement was put into effect, he said, the two  countries would hold a third round of high-level talks to  discuss an end to Washington's hostile policy toward Pyongyang,  including a nuclear threat, for improved Pyongyang-Washington  relations and resumption of regular IAEA inspections of North  Korea's nuclear facilities for a complete settlement of the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.    Commenting on the working-level North Korea-U.S. meeting in  New York on Dec. 3, the same spokesman said in a statement that  North Korea had offered a plan to expand the scope of  inspections to the extent of ensuring the continuity of nuclear  safeguards, adding that this offer was a maximum concession.    This suggests that North Korea has no plan to permit full  IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities until relations with  the United States are improved.    It just wants to allow IAEA inspections of its declared  nuclear sites within the limit of ensuring the continuity of  safeguards until a third round of the high-level talks with the  United States is held to discuss resumption of regular IAEA  inspections and improved relations between Pyongyang and  Washington for a complete solution of the nuclear issue.    Despite the on-going negotiations with the IAEA, North Korea  is insisting on resumption of the talks with the United States,  saying direct talks with Washington are a shortcut for solution  of the nuclear issue. It appears to be paying little attention  to the IAEA.    A commentary in the Jan. 19 issue of the Workers'  (Communist) Party organ, the NODONG SINMUN, reiterated that the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must solved through direct  talks between North Korea and the United States, calling for  immediate holding of a third round of the high-level talks with  the United States.    "If the two sides hold a third round of the talks to discuss  a package deal with a sincere and fair attitude to the dialogue,  as agreed on in the Dec. 29 meeting in New York, the (nuclear)  problem will be completely solved," it said.</p>

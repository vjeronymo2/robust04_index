			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / International Company News: Banesto fights for Portuguese bank stake Banco Espanol de Credito's new board has begun a concerted effort to keep its controversial 50 per cent holding in Banco Totta e Acores, the big Portuguese bank, following warnings from Lisbon that half its stake may have been accumulated illegally. Mr Alfredo Saenz, acting president of Banesto, and Mr Miguel Martin, deputy governor of the Bank of Spain, met Mr Eduardo Catroga, the Portuguese finance minister, yesterday in the hope of defusing a growing row in Portugal. This is centred on the apparent infringement by the former Banesto management, which was dismissed by the Bank of Spain on December 28, of rules governing the stakes foreigners may hold in Portugal's privatised banks. This month Mr Mario Conde, Banesto's former president, announced that Banesto holds 25 per cent of BTA directly and a further 25 per cent indirectly. The size of the shareholding contravenes Portuguese legislation limiting foreign ownership of BTA to 25 per cent. The talks in Lisbon were expected to focus on a 'non-aggression pact' under which Portuguese authorities would not force Banesto to sell the 25 per cent of BTA it is believed to hold illegally. In return, Banesto would agree not to call in loans totalling an estimated Es50bn (Dollars 286m) it has extended to Portuguese shareholders of BTA. Mr Saenz, who believes Banesto's purchase of BTA was the soundest of all of the Portuguese acquisitions by Spanish banks in recent years, has been shaken by the possibility that Banesto may be forced to lose control of Totta. Banesto made loans to Portuguese companies in which the Spanish bank has a minority stake and the money was used to buy shares in BTA during the bank's privatisation. This enabled Banesto to increase its indirect holding in BTA above the 25 per cent it holds directly.</p>

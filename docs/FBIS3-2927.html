			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524) and Wen </F> Youcheng (5113 2589 2052)]    [Text] Beijing, 15 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Henan delegation to  the National People's Congress [NPC] session held small group  discussion on 13 March. Minister of Railways Han Zhubin,  together with the directors of the ministry's planning and  transport bureaus, visited the deputies, listened to their  views, and answered their questions.    The deputies affirmed the contributions of the railway  department to Henan's economic development. They also made  candid criticism and suggestions on issues concerning passenger  and cargo transport, capital construction, and work style of  railways. Han Zhubin listened attentively to their views, took  notes, and occasionally discussed things with the two bureau  directors in a whisper. Soon after the deputies finished  presenting their views, Han Zhubin said with a smile: Some of  your problems involve too many departments and I cannot make  decisions on them in a short time. I can give you clear and  definite replies on the problems which the Ministry of Railways  can solve right away:    -- No. 251 and No. 252 express trains between Zhengzhou and  Beijing will be changed to nonstop express trains as of the  middle of April this year;    -- No. 233 and No. 234 express trains running between  Xinyang  and Beijing on a temporary basis will become permanent service;    -- On the question of linking Henan's local rails with state  rails, we may in principle conduct an experiment at a selected  locality first;    -- The Ministry will readjust wagon dispatch and change the  practice of keeping southbound railway wagons in the south, and  will move a large number of railway wagons northward from  Guangdong and Shanghai; and    -- In wagon dispatch, the railway department will do all it  can to satisfy Henan's needs in shipping products with high  added value and export products produced by Henan enterprises.    The deputies affirmed the practice of the State Council in  having the responsible cadres of ministries and commissions  attend the meetings of NPC delegations and hear their views.  Han Zhubin's replies won applause from the audience.</p>

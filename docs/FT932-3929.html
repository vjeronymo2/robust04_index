			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Ex-chief quits Hartstone board HARTSTONE Group, the hosiery and leather goods company which recently issued two profits warnings within a week, said Mr Stephen Barker, its former chairman and chief executive, was resigning from the board. Mr Shaun Dowling, who last month took over as chairman, said Mr Barker 'was sick to death with the drama over the last few weeks.' Hartstone's latest warning said pre-tax profits were likely to be reduced by a further Pounds 260,000 after arrangements came to light involving payments over four years totalling Pounds 1m to employees of a subsidiary company. Mr Mike Small, the former company treasurer, also arranged for certain funds derived from a foreign exchange hedging contract to be paid to an account for his benefit. He has been replaced by Mr Martin Randle, controller of the group's US operations. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which has undertaken a thorough review of the current financial position ahead of any refinancing arrangement, yesterday reported to the group's banks. The full year results, which are due at the end of June, are likely to be delayed until July. Hartstone recently said it had breached at least one banking covenant calling for 2.5 times interest cover. Interest charges at the half-way stage had risen from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 3.3m. Mr Dowling said the breach of one covenant meant that all were being reviewed.</p>

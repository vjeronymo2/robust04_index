			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regarding issue two, neither trial court has issued a final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination, both deferring this issue to trial. However, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> his decision on manufacturers' motion for preliminary injunction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on this count, Judge Mazzone concluded that manufacturers had not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shown a likelihood of prevailing. In its  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> amicus curiae  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> brief to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the First Circuit, EPA argued that Massachusetts' failure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopt the clean fuels program did not violate the ``third car''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibition because (1) manufacturers could not show that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Massachusetts' LEV program compels any design change_manufacturers are free to sell cars in Massachusetts that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identical to California cars; (2) manufacturers' testing-based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns were not ripe for review; and (3) the term ``third  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle'' is applied only to design changes necessary to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification requirements, not minor changes unrelated to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting applicable emission standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On issue three, the Second Circuit found that New York's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgation of California's ZEV sales mandate did not violate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 177's requirement that States not limit, either directly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or indirectly, the sale of California cars. The court found that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ZEV mandate did not prevent manufacturers from selling any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California-certified vehicles as long as they also sold the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified percentage of ZEVs. ``Like the third vehicle rule, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sales-limitation rule is designed to reinforce the identicality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement. It would be incongruous for us to hold that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [State] wrongly mandated a ZEV sales percentage identical to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California's mandate.'' EPA had taken this position in its  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> amicus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On issue four, the Second Circuit ruled that New York's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adoption of the ZEV mandate does not violate the ``third car''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibition because New York is administering the mandate in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same manner as California and any changes manufacturers make in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their cars to sell them in New York are based on marketing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions by manufacturers, not a requirement of the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's amicus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> brief was consistent with this result.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Issues Implicated by the OTC Petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some of the section 177-related issues briefed in the New  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> York and Massachusetts cases are also implicated by the OTC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition. The OTC recommendation, like the New York and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Massachusetts regulations, does not include California's clean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel provisions. Moreover, the recommendation states: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> To the extent that a Zero Emission Vehicle sales  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement must be a component of a LEV program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted under Section 177, such a requirement shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply. Further, if such a Zero Emission Vehicle sales  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement is not a required component of programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted under Section 177, individual States within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OTC may at their option include such a requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or economic incentives designed to increase the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sales of ZEVs in the programs they adopt. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This provision relates to the same ZEV-related issues argued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the court cases and also produces several section 177-related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues not determined in the court cases. The issue of whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ZEV sales mandate is a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> required  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> component in any State LEV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program was not addressed by the courts. Section 177 allows a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State to adopt and enforce ``for any model year standards relating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to control of emissions from new motor vehicles and *&blank;*&blank;* engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  *&blank;*&blank;* if such standards are identical to the California standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for which a waiver has been granted for such model year.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first question presented by this issue is whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ZEV sales mandate is a ``standard relating to control of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions.'' In letters sent to New York and Virginia State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officials on January 7, 1993, EPA stated that it believed the ZEV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sales mandate ``in light of the existence of the NMOG [non-methane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic gases] fleet average requirement (which is a motor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle emission standard), the California ZEV sales requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not a motor vehicle emission standard. Thus, a State which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopts California motor vehicle emission standards is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to, but may, adopt this particular provision of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California's program. The ZEV sales mandate simply limits the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility otherwise accorded manufacturers to choose the mix of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles produced to meet the NMOG fleet average requirement.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Clive Smith associate being investigated - Insolvency accountant is on bail and faces professional ban from practising AN ACCOUNTANT acting for Mr Clive Smith, the British oil entrepreneur who will on Monday seek to avoid bankruptcy with debts exceeding Pounds 20m, was arrested last year on suspicion of defrauding creditors in an insolvency procedure and is on police bail awaiting possible charges. Mr Graham Wilson, a certified accountant with offices in London, has recently been disciplined by his professional association, which could ban him from insolvency and auditing work. The Department of Trade and Industry, which monitors insolvency practitioners, is also believed to be taking an interest in his affairs. Mr Wilson last night said his arrest was a 'storm in a tea-cup'. He added: 'I am a professional man and I operate in a professional manner. All I am doing in life is conducting my business.' He has recently arranged two creditors' meetings connected with Mr Smith. One is due to take place on Monday, when Mr Smith's creditors will vote on proposals designed to help him avoid bankruptcy through an individual voluntary arrangement. Mr Smith, who has interests in a number of offshore trusts, has had connections with several natural resource companies. Pre-1990 events at two of these, Butte Mining and Richmond Oil &amp; Gas, are being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office. Both are listed on the London Stock Exchange. Mr Smith faces claims of more than Pounds 20m from creditors including the Inland Revenue and Societe Bancaire de Paris. The largest creditor, claiming Pounds 12.3m, is Richard Pearce and Son, a Hong Kong-registered company which lists an Irish address, which is the same as that of Mr Kelvin Myles, who has administered some of Mr Smith's offshore trusts. Creditors will able to vote on Mr Smith's proposed voluntary arrangement in proportion to the debt they are owed. Mr Wilson has also arranged a meeting, due to take place on June 15, for the creditors of Alpine (Double Glazing), which ceased trading earlier this week. It has since emerged that the DTI was asked in February to investigate Alpine's activities. Employees have also expressed concerns about pension contributions deducted from their pay. Alpine has had a relationship with Mr Smith since he personally guaranteed the Pounds 900,000 purchase of Alpine from administrators in February 1992. One Alpine director, Mr James Berry, was a director at Corporate Broking Services, a London stockbroker which went into liquidation in 1991. Mr Smith held a substantial stake in CBS, which had sponsored Richmond's flotation. Police in Kingston upon Thames arrested Mr Wilson and two other men last August on suspicion of misrepresenting the financial circumstances surrounding a former client's petition for an individual voluntary arrangement. Inquiries are continuing, according to police. Mr Wilson said: 'Yes, we were arrested but no charges were preferred because we were totally innocent.' The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants last week rejected Mr Wilson's appeal against charges of misconduct, including professional incompetence, in a separate case. Its disciplinary committee upheld an order that he be 'severely reprimanded' and fined Pounds 1,000. He must also pay costs of Pounds 600 and appeal costs of Pounds 500. The disciplinary committee has also ordered the association to investigate 'all aspects of Mr Wilson's practice'. He faces the rare penalty of exclusion from auditing and insolvency work if the resulting reports are not 'satisfactory'. The ruling followed a complaint by a former client called Euroborus, which traded as Inside Art. The association found Mr Wilson had 'failed to deal expeditiously' with that company's affairs. It said he 'failed to honour a cheque' and 'performed his professional work inefficiently and/or incompetently to such an extent or on such a number of occasions as to bring discredit to himself, to the association or to the accountancy profession'. Mr Wilson has also supplied insolvency services to some companies which were liquidated owing substantial sums to London and Provincial Factors, the debt-trading company which collapsed into receivership in February owing creditors almost Pounds 7m.</p>

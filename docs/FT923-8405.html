			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: Ymos plans to restructure finances YMOS, the large German car components manufacturer which lost nearly DM200m (Dollars 136.9m) last year largely as a result of balance sheet fraud, yesterday announced a complex capital restructuring. The plan is to restore the group's equity capital to the DM140m level it was before it was wiped out by the combined effects of fraud and operating losses, the details of which were revealed to shareholders in June. In a two-stage restructuring, the company will cut its basic share capital from DM67.5m to DM6.75m. Capital will then be built up again through the issue of 2.025m new shares at DM95 per share. As a result, the company's capital will be restored to DM143m. Minority shareholders will have the chance to buy the new shares on the basis of 15 for every one already held. Ymos warned yesterday that despite profits during the first six months of the year, the result for the whole year would be 'clearly negative'. Mr Gerhard Krischer, chief executive, predicted that shareholders would be receiving dividends after the rationalisation phase, which he said would last another two years. Sales climbed 11 per cent in the first half. Last year, they amounted to DM660m.</p>

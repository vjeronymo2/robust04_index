			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Tapie wins 68% of vote Mr Bernard Tapie, Marseilles soccer boss who is under judicial investigation in three different cases, showed yesterday that judges had not dented his popularity, Reuter reports from Paris. He won 68 per cent of the vote in elections for department councils in Marseilles and said it was a clear call to run next year for mayor of the city. Mr Tapie is also running in European parliament elections in June for the Left Radicals Movement. A former cabinet minister, he had his parliamentary immunity removed in a current probe into suspicions of business fraud. He is also under judicial investigation for bribery and allegedly interfering with witnesses after players and officials accused his Marseilles football club of trying to rig a league game last year. But, as the man who rescued the Marseilles team from decline and took them to become France's first European champions, Mr Tapie has built a strong following in the city although the club was stripped of its French league title and banned from European soccer this season. Mr Tapie has denounced the allegations as a conspiracy to force him out of politics.</p>

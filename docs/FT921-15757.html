			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Major hits out at pessimism over economy RECENT PESSIMISM about the economy has been 'overdone', Mr John Major, the prime minister, said last night. 'If you listen to some of the dismal Johnnies you might never realise what has been achieved in the last year,' he told an audience of businessmen in Newcastle upon Tyne. There were many encouraging developments in the economy. He pointed to the fall in inflation, the reduction in the interest rate differential against the D-Mark, and the slowdown in the trend rate of increase in unemployment. Mr Major also highlighted the fact that people with annually adjusted mortgages would only now be seeing the benefit of the cuts in interest rates over the past year. Expressing confidence about the UK's prospects for the 1990s, he warned that this depended on people ignoring 'siren voices offering quack remedies' of higher taxation and re-regulation. There was no 'magic moment, no precise point when recession lies clearly in the past, while recovery stretches out into a better future'. Mr Major said economic data would show irregular patterns while the recession was ending and the recovery beginning. He emphasised that government could not and should not try to fine-tune the economy in response to the latest economic statistics. He acknowledged that the UK economy had not performed as well as had been hoped in the last year, and attributed this to difficulties in the world economy. Rejecting the accusation that the government had no industrial strategy, Mr Major said that its policies of privatisation, cutting taxes, freeing up the labour market and above all combating inflation, were based on creating the right framework for business. 'Our job is to provide a stable and predictable economic framework, with responsible monetary and budgetary policies, so that business and individuals can have the confidence to take the right decisions.' He contrasted this with Labour's policies of setting up a national investment bank, introducing a minimum wage and bringing in a payroll tax to finance a statutory training programme. Mr Major countered Labour's charge that the government's refusal to sign up to the social chapter at the EC summit in Maastricht was because they did not want British workers to benefit from higher working standards. The government had taken the stance because it believed such matters should be settled between management and employees.</p>

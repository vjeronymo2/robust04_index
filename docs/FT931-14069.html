			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Curtain lifts on Indonesian drama - Astra affair sheds light on local conglomerates THE ownership crisis at Astra International, the company which dominates Indonesia's motor trade, has been a uniquely public brawl in a country which prefers to conduct its corporate dramas behind closed doors. The resolution to the crisis, however, has been typically Indonesian, with the government forcing the Soeryadjaya family, the company's founders, to sell Rp1,000bn (Dollars 484m) of shares to a 19-member consortium of corporate and institutional investors. It has also given an insight into how Indonesian conglomerates work. In the past two months, Astra, Indonesia's second-largest company, has undergone a radical change in ownership. In November, the Soeryadjayas owned 178m of the company's 242m shares. The remainder was split between the related Suriadjaya family (6.5m), Mr Theodore Rachmat, Astra's president-director (4m), the International Finance Corporation (13m), the company's co-operatives (2m) and the investing public (38.5m). The failure of the Soeryadjayas' privately-owned Bank Summa, owing Rp1,600bn, forced the family to sell Astra shares to raise finance. Bank Summa's collapse resulted, say central bank officials, from excessive lending to other companies owned by the Soeryadjayas, which have been unable to service the loans. After selling Astra shares in three separate tranches, brokers estimate the Soeryadjayas now hold just 12.4m Astra shares, with a further 20m shares held in escrow while negotiations for their sale continue with Toyota, Astra's main joint-venture partner. State banks, trusts and pension funds have bought 66m shares from the Soeryadjayas, indicating the close relationship between the state and private business in Indonesia. However, the main interest of investors and bankers to Astra, which has foreign loans and facilities of more than Dollars 900m, has focused on the consortium of 16 businessmen, most from Indonesia's powerful Chinese community, which this week bought 75m shares from the Soeryadjayas. Three businessmen formed the heart of the consortium, buying 39m shares: Mr Prajogo Pangestu, who runs the Barito Pacific timber group; Mr Liem Sioe Liong, principal shareholder in the Salim Group, Indonesia's largest conglomerate; and Mr Henry Pribadi, head of the Napan Group. The three men's business interests, as with many of Indonesia's top conglomerates, often intertwine. Their decision to buy into Astra also provides a clue to a possible future investor in the company if, as government ministers insist, state-owned Bank Exim and Bapindo seek a buyer for their 20m shares. Bankers draw a parallel between Astra's problems and earlier occasions when major Indonesian businesses were on the point of collapse. In 1990, bankers say, Mr Pangestu and Mr Liong co-ordinated the rescue of Bank Duta, majority-owned by three charitable foundations chaired by President Suharto, after it suffered Dollars 419m in foreign exchange losses. More recently, the two businessmen and Mr Pribadi have played a key role in Indonesia's nascent petrochemicals and plastics industry. Mr Pangestu's Barito Pacific has been diversifying away from its core timber business, which includes more than 5m hectares of forestry concessions and plywood exports which in 1991 exceeded Dollars 600m. Two years ago, however, it formed a consortium with the Bimantara Citra, run by Mr Bambang Trihatmodjo, President Suharto's second son, and Mr Pribadi's Napan Group to invest in the Dollars 1.65bn Chandra Asri petrochemical plant in West Java. Barito, Napan and Bimantara are also joint-venture partners in PT Tri Polyta, which manufactures polymer resin in West Java. Tri Polyta's polymer resin is the main input for Argha Karya, a recently-listed company which produces plastic wrapping film, the main shareholders of which are Napan and Mr Liong's Salim group. The Salim group and Mr Henry Liem, nephew to Mr Liong, also hold a direct stake in the Napan group, whilst Mr Pribadi is on the board of Indocement. Brokers expressed surprise that, given mutual business interests, the Bimantara group was not in the consortium buying a stake in Astra. Bimantara and the Salim group are already joint-venture partners in Indomobil, Astra's main competitor, which assembles and distributes Volvo, Mazda and Nissan vehicles. Bimantara also has a stake in Star Motor, which holds the franchise for Mercedes cars. 'Don't be surprised if, when the state banks sell their shares, Bimantara steps in,' says one foreign broker. Brokers stress that, despite the companies' close connections, they are competitors. Joint ventures are favoured as a means of spreading risk and because they allow conglomerates to cross-lend through their subsidiary banks, brokers say. Cross-lending allows conglomerates to undertake capital intensive projects, while keeping within central bank limits on internal lending. It was just these limits which Bank Summa broke with such devastating consequences for the Soeryadjaya family.</p>

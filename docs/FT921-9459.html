			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Tarmac chairman gives up day-to-day control SIR ERIC Pountain, for more than a decade chairman and chief executive of Tarmac, is to give up the day-to-day running of Britain's biggest construction and building materials group. He is to remain as chairman but will be replaced as chief executive by Mr Neville Simms, chief executive of Tarmac's construction division. Mr Bryan Baker, group managing director, will become deputy chairman. Tarmac, which grew dramatically during the 1980s, has seen its profits fall sharply during the past two years as a result of recession in the UK housing market and a downturn in US construction markets. The share price, which has fallen by almost 60 per cent during the past 12 months, last night closed 1p down at 119p compared with a peak of 282p last March. Sir Eric, who will be 60 next year, denied that management changes had been prompted by dissatisfaction with the company's recent performance. He said: 'Both Bryan Baker and myself reach the company's official age for retirement next year. It was important that management succession was assured. We would have taken this decision irrespective of the position of the company. Mr Simms is 47 and is extremely able, having run a highly successful construction business.' Tarmac's pre-tax profits between 1978, Sir Eric's first year as chief executive, and 1988 rose from Pounds 26.5m to Pounds 393.1m. During that period the group became Britain's biggest housebuilder, constructing more than 11,000 homes a year. In 1990, pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 190.7m. Stockbrokers' recent forecasts suggest that pre-tax profits could have fallen to between Pounds 40m and Pounds 60m last year which could put the final dividend under threat. During the 1980s Tarmac developed a decentralised management system which gave divisional chief executives the freedom to develop their businesses during a period of high growth in construction demand. Mr Simms said that during the past 12 months Tarmac had been taking a greater degree of central control over divisional strategy, investment and performance. That had been in response to the harsher trading conditions in the 1990s. He said: 'I expect to continue this policy which is in line with the approach I have taken in the management of Tarmac's construction division.' See Observer</p>

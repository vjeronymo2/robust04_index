			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> COMPUTER FILE: HOME, WORK COMPUTERS CAN TALK WITH EASE  </P> <P> A lot of people who use a personal computer at the office have yet to buy one  for their homes. In many cases, they're looking for a machine that's compatible  with the office machine so that they can bring work home at night.  </P> <P> Fortunately, getting a home computer that's compatible with the one at the  office is not as difficult as it may seem. In today's computing environment,  there are ways for just about anything to share data with anything else.  </P> <P> A lot of businesses invest in expensive industrial strength computers with fast  central processing units, or CPUs, and high-capacity hard disks. In most cases,  businesses use machines that are IBM compatible, although a growing number of  companies are using at least some Apple Macintosh systems.  </P> <P> In either case, it's possible to get an inexpensive home system that can, at  the very least, use the same data files as the one at the office. It's even  possible to use IBM-compatible data disks with some models of the Apple  Macintosh and specially equipped versions of the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST and  Apple II.  </P> <P> You can now get fully equipped IBM compatible machines for under $1,000. Such  machines can, in most cases, run the same software and access the same data  disks as the more expensive PCs at the office. Yet there are a few programs  that require a system with an Intel 80286 or 80386 CPU and cannot be run on a  low-cost machine equipped with a less powerful CPU. Some programs require that  your machine be equipped with a hard disk. If you don't already have one, a  hard disk can be added for as little as $250.  </P> <P> It is important to be sure that both your home and office machines have the  same type of disk drives. Most machines use 5 1/4-inch disks, but some,  including laptops and IBM PS/2 models, use 3 1/2-inch disks. Whatever drive  your system has, you can add the other type. Desktop machines can be equipped  with a 3 1/2-inch drive for as little as $90 (plus labor for those who aren't  inclined to install it themselves).  </P> <P> Even if the machines don't have the same disk format, it's possible to transfer  data by connecting two machines with a cable. That's practical if one of the  machines is portable or if you're transferring lots of files between machines  at your office.  </P> <P> LapLink III, from Traveling Software, (800) 343-8080, and FastWire, from Rupp  Bros., (212) 517-7775, are software programs that come with cables that allow  you to connect just about any two IBM compatibles via their serial or parallel  ports. These programs can transfer one or many files with a single command.  </P> <P> With both of these programs you'll have to reach around the machines to plug in  your cables. Another option is to get File Shuttle from GetC Software, (800)  663-8066. The program comes with an ingenious little adapter, called the  "Rocket Socket," that connects your laptop directly to your parallel printer  cable. If the back of your printer is accessible, connecting the two machines  couldn't be easier. You just unplug the cable from the printer and connect it  to one side of the Rocket Socket. The socket's other side plugs directly into  the parallel port of your laptop. The software is very easy to use, and data is  transferred very quickly -- up to 3 megabytes a minute.  </P> <P> You don't have to run the same software at home and work just to use the same  data files. Most word processing programs can store and read data saved as  standard text files. Such files can be moved easily between programs. Even  spreadsheet and database management programs are able to exchange data via  various standard formats. If you do wind up with incompatible files, there are  a number of programs designed to make the translation.  </P> <P> Software Bridge, from Systems Compatibility Corp., (800) 333-1395, is a $149  program that translates files between a number of word processing programs. And  don't worry if your office uses Lotus 1-2-3 and you use VP Planner, Quattro,  Excel or some other spreadsheet program at home. Virtually all spreadsheet  programs can read and write files from 1-2-3.  </P> <P> Most people with IBM-compatible PCs at the office feel that they have to buy an  IBM compatible for the home. That does make it easier to move data back and  forth, but it isn't absolutely necessary.  </P> <P> Unless equipped with special hardware or software, the Apple Macintosh cannot  run the same programs as the IBM. However, it can exchange data files. All new  Macs come with Apple's "SuperDrive" that can read and write 3 1/2-inch IBM  diskettes. As it comes from Apple, it's necessary to use some cumbersome  software to access MS-DOS diskettes. If you're using MS-DOS disks on a regular  basis, it's worth an extra $89.95 (suggested retail) to purchase DOS Mounter  from Dayna Communications, (801) 531-0600. This handy program fools the Mac  into treating the MS-DOS disk exactly as though it were a Mac disk, making it a  lot easier to load and save data.  </P> <P> Most Mac spreadsheet programs can read Lotus 1-2-3 files, and all Mac word  processing programs can access standard IBM text files. MacLink Plus from  DataViz, (203) 268-0030, can translate files between popular IBM and Mac  programs. If you often switch between a Mac and a PC, you might consider using  programs (such as Microsoft Word, WordPerfect and Excel) that offer versions  for both machines and use data files from their counterparts on the other  machine.  </P> <P> The Atari ST, Apple II and Commodore Amiga can also be equipped to read IBM  data disks and to run IBM software. The Atari ST uses the same file format as  the IBM PC, so it's able to read and write 3 1/2-inch MS-DOS data disks.  </P> <P> It's also possible to run IBM software on any of these machines by purchasing  special hardware or software that allow them to emulate an IBM PC. However, if  your goal is to run IBM software, you're generally better off buying an IBM  compatible.  </P></p>

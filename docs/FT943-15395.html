			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: New owner for Gosforth Park Mr Stanley Clarke, the millionaire who hauled Uttoxeter racecourse out of the red, has galloped to the rescue of High Gosforth Park, the quoted company that owns and runs Newcastle racecourse. The course is to be acquired for Pounds 3.4m by Northern Racing, formed to make the acquisition and owned 65 per cent by Stanley Clarke Leisure, a private vehicle, and 35 per cent by St Modwen Properties, the development and investment company chaired by Mr Clarke. Northern is paying Pounds 37 a share and has irrevocable undertakings on 42.3 per cent of the issued share capital. This includes the 7.4 per cent owned by the board, which is recommending the deal. There is a loan note alternative. Last May, Gosforth lost a long-running battle to get the go-ahead to develop part of its 800-acre site. It had argued that it needed cash from the proposal to fund development of the course necessary to ensure its survival. Mr Clarke said that he hoped to apply the same techniques that had proved successful at Uttoxeter, which had moved from losses of Pounds 36,000 in 1989 to profits of Pounds 400,000 last year. Gosforth, which has net assets of Pounds 1.42m, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 49,675 last year. The offer, which represents a premium of 85 per cent to the last trade in the shares, closes on July 29.</p>

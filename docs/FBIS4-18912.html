			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Robert Verdussen: "The Choice for Democracy"] </F>   [Text] Belgium has been caught, not for the first time but  more seriously than ever before, in the Rwandan trap. A trap  from which it is proving very difficult to escape.    Although the anti-Belgian feelings aroused in the last few  days have not resulted in a "Belgian manhunt" such as some were  rather too quick to speak of, Belgium nevertheless finds itself  in a very unenviable position in Rwanda today. Is this the  thankless and inevitable role of any former colonial power? No  doubt. But the colonial past cannot explain everything.    The difficulties encountered by Belgian leaders in coming to  the assistance of expatriates threatened by further troubles  more certainly have their origins in a more recent past. The  past of a Rwanda which, like most African countries, has been  touched by the wave of democratization born at the end of the  Cold War. A wave resisted by the "strongarm" regime of  President Habyarimana but which also pushed the Tutsi minority  to "try its luck" in the only way possible, that of armed  rebellion.    Faced with this new situation, Belgium could have continued  to support a regime whose principal virtue was its strength or,  alternatively, it could have played the democratic card. It  chose the latter option. Was it right to do so? Or should it,  like France, have continued to side with an antiquated  single-party system?    Such a choice would have amounted to a pragmatism which  although not very honorable would probably have been more  effective, at least in the short term. Instead, it chose to  gamble in the longer term on improved human rights on a  continent where, sooner or later, they are confronted by the  compromises of leaders who are still too often encouraged by a  West which prefers trading security to the risks inherent in  introducing democracy.    Democratization has failed in Rwanda. And this failure has  caught Belgium in the trap. But does this mean that Belgium  should stand accused? Should it stand accused for having chosen  to take a chance rather than for the status quo, and for human  rights rather than oppression? Belgium has lost. For now.</p>

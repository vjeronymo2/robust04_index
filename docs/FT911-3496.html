			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Leading Article: Rebuilding South Africa THE LINK between South Africa's efforts to negotiate a post-apartheid constitution and the state of the country's economy is becoming increasingly important. The process of fundamental political reform is difficult enough at the best of times. It is especially hazardous when times are hard. Now that the irreversibility of change in South Africa is so clearly apparent, the least western governments can do to improve the economic climate is to hasten the end of remaining sanctions. And the African National Congress, still fighting a last-ditch battle against repeal, should instead acknowledge that sanctions have achieved their purpose, declare victory and withdraw. As President F. W. de Klerk has pointed out during his visit to London, the combination of population growth of 2.6 per cent a year, and an average annual growth rate over the last decade of 1.6 per cent, makes a grim backdrop to the constitutional process now under way in South Africa. There is a danger that this process can be derailed by the violence that wracks the country; and while political tensions are at the heart of the fighting, there is little doubt that these tensions are exacerbated by poverty and rising unemployment. Mr de Klerk is thus right to argue that economic growth and constitutional reform have to be mutually reinforcing. The lifting of sanctions combined with new investment is an essential condition to South Africa's economic recovery, which in turn is critical to growth in the whole region. Conflicting signals Unfortunately there continue to be conflicting signals from South Africa. Mr Nelson Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress, due in London today, can be expected to persist in the ANC's view that it is too soon to lift trade and other embargoes against Pretoria, arguing that continued outside pressure is needed if Mr de Klerk is to fulfil his pledge to create a non-racial South Africa. This argument held good until Mr de Klerk so convincingly demonstrated his commitment to reform. But by the end of June the last pillars of apartheid will have been repealed - the Group Areas Act, the Land Acts, and the racial provisions of the Population Registration Act. Even if the government wanted to, it could not now rebuild apartheid. The internal pressures that brought about the system's demise - demographic changes, the growth of black trade unions, the increasing importance of black consumers, shortages of white skilled manpower - are as powerful as ever. Meanwhile the new constitution for South Africa is slowly starting to take shape. The ANC's draft constitutional principles, published earlier this month, revealed encouraging common ground with Pretoria. Both parties propose a bill of rights, proportional representation, and a bi-cameral assembly. Sticking points On the face of it, the ANC demand that the constitution be drawn up by a constituent assembly, and its call for an interim government, are sticking points in the transition process. But there are signs that a compromise may be possible. Pretoria has indicated that once the multi-party conference, expected to convene later this year, has reached agreement on the principles of the new constitution, they could be placed before a multi-party conference instead of a constituent assembly. And yesterday in London Mr de Klerk went some way towards meeting the ANC's call for an interim government, offering all main political leaders 'a voice in the formulation of important policy decisions' during the period leading to a new constitution. These developments should encourage the business community whose support Mr de Klerk has been seeking during his visit to London. Of course, Mr de Klerk must convince would-be investors that the violence that continues to scar the country will soon be brought to an end. But they can play an important part in bringing this about by taking an important role in the building of a new South Africa.</p>

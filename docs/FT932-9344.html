			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / A day in the death of the north-east's last shipyard: Locked gates herald Swan Hunter's demise THE FIRST sign that May 13 1993 might go down in the history books as the day north-east England's last shipyard went under came soon after 7am. Subcontractors arriving at Swan Hunter's main Wallsend entrance to continue fitting out three Type-23 frigates, the last ships on the order book, found the main gate shutters locked. They were all turned away. By 9am union leaders were on emergency standby for a meeting with Swan Hunter's four directors, who led the management buy-out in 1986. 'We're sitting here waiting,' said shop steward Mr Davy Hanson. 'The lads are still on the ships. We're doing our best to keep the lads going but how do you keep up morale in this situation?' By 11am the media were clustered outside the main entrance. Technical staff had stopped work and were staring out of the windows. Someone suggested the last frigate should be called HMS Hardship. Nobody laughed. Management were cloistered in their offices preparing a statement. The union leaders stood outside the main office. At 11.50am they were called in. By 11.55am, as workers prepared for their usual dash to lunch, banging noises, then shouts, became audible behind the entrance shutter. The manual workforce was lining up. When the shutter rose at noon for lunch it was a shock  - instead of running up the bank as usual, they trudged out in the rain; most were laden with toolboxes; many carried plastic bags stuffed with the paraphernalia of a working life. Word had gone round that the receivers were coming in  - they were determined that the men in suits would not take their tools. At 12.10pm Mr Robin Ashby, company press spokesman, emerged on to the head-office steps to read the statement. Men returning to the yard, having discovered that the canteen  - run by subcontractors  - was closed, paused to listen. 'There's that many on the dole  - they're paying off all over,' said 39-year-old welder Mr Michael Scott, a Swan worker for 18 years. The directors declined to comment, but were occasionally visible inside the foyer. The unions called a 2pm mass meeting. Among the men drifting back was fitter Mr Clive Routledge bearing a handmade sign, Doom Army  - a reference to Newcastle United's Toon Army chant. The workforce assembled beside a massive fabrication shed, to hear their union leaders instruct them to resume work. They received copies of the company statement. There was no speech by management. Leaving to return to the Neptune yard, estimator Mr Paul Turner, whose entire 12-year working life has been at Swan, said the workforce would support the receivers. It would show them the commitment it had demonstrated to the privatised company. 'It's that which has really disappointed everybody,' he said. 'It's only a management buy-out, it's not a large multinational which has millions in the coffers.' In the offices, receivers Price Waterhouse were urgently assessing Swan's plight. The media drifted away. Mr Davey Hall, district organiser of the AEEU engineering and electricians union, emerged from a meeting with management. 'You try to think of one of the saddest days in a whole life of a community,' he said. 'I think we've reached the bottom today.'</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Vendome The fusion of the Dunhill and Cartier luxury goods businesses created one of the world's biggest purveyors of trinkets to the glittering classes. With a market value of more than Pounds 3bn, Vendome represents one of the most accessible means for exploiting the rich. Lingering recession in Europe and Japan may have hampered progress last year. But Vendome should rake in the money once recovery rages. Such thinking has helped the shares race ahead since last year's listing. Yet, on closer inspection, it is hard to justify Vendome's opulent rating. The internal workings of the Vendome empire remain opaque. The cost savings of combining the two businesses have been negligible. Nor, as yet, is there much evidence to suggest the merger has produced any incremental sales gains. Other luxury goods businesses, such as LVMH and Hermes, have been notably more upbeat about this year's prospects. That either reflects excessive caution on Vendome's part or a realisation that the merger's benefits will take time to realise. By then, however, Vendome's abnormally low tax charge will have unwound, gnawing away at earnings gains. Moreover, there is little attraction in the yield. The company may generate cash in profusion but that will not necessarily translate into generous dividends. Vendome's pay-out policy is likely to be dictated more by the cash-flow needs of the majority shareholder, Richemont, than the wishes of minority investors. Vendome's shares, like its products, are only for those with extravagant tastes.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Railroad cooperation is important to sort out valid reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from those that derive from misunderstanding of how devices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> function (as where a switching movement is occupying the fouling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circuit on an industrial siding) and to ensure prompt response to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valid reports. Clear identification of responsibility for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> posting and maintaining signage is also essential.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although this rulemaking is not the appropriate vehicle for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolving this issue, FRA will continue its examination of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue through the safety inquiry noted above, with the objective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of promoting the earliest feasible notification of warning device  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> malfunctions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definition of ``credible report of system malfunction''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is adopted as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ``Warning system malfunction'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As proposed ``warning system malfunction'' means an activation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure or a false activation of a highway-rail grade crossing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warning system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No opposition was expressed to this definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definition of ``warning system malfunction'' is adopted as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 234.6(a)&blank;Civil Penalties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As proposed, this section amends the present ``civil penalty''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision in effect for Part 234. The amendment brings this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section into conformity with 49 U.S.C. 21301 (formerly &sect;209(a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Safety Act as amended by section 9 of the Rail Safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Enforcement and Review Act). That section amended the definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of ``person.'' The clarified definition of ``person'' includes, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not limited to, such entities as manufacturers and lessors of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> railroad equipment and independent contractors. Congress'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose in amending the definition of ``person'' was to clarify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary's existing power over entities whose activities related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to rail safety by explicitly defining that authority. See 1992  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. Code Cong. and Adm. News, p. 879. Congress made it clear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the included list of ``persons'' subject to the Secretary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority was intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There were no comments pertaining to this proposed section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section is adopted as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 234.101&blank;Employee Notification Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As proposed, this section requires that each railroad issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules requiring employees to report to a designated railroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> official, by the quickest means available, any warning system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> malfunction. This provision is intended to ensure that all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees report instances of false activations and activation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failures (see definition of warning system malfunctions) and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such reports are made to the appropriate person. This section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not require that a railroad issue rules to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification of maintenance or operational problems which are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> false activations or activation failures. Examples of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situations not covered by this section would be dirty roundels,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one bulb burnt out, a broken reflector, or a gate arm tip broken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While employees should report such situations to the railroad,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those situations do not require a railroad response under Subpart  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The labor/management group recommended that this provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be modified in recognition that railroad employees frequently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report signal malfunctions to dispatchers, operators, and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> railroad personnel who would not be categorized as ``railroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officials.'' The labor/management group thus recommended that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision be revised to include other persons designated by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> railroad. We agree. Broadening those persons to whom  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification of malfunctions can be made will eliminate potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confusion in implementing the regulations. This section is being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section requires that each railroad issue rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring its employees to report to persons designated by that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> railroad, by the quickest means available, any warning system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> malfunction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MURRAY JOINS TEAM IN SECOND;  </P> <P> DODGERS: FIRST BASEMAN FINISHES WITH TWO HITS FOR .330 AVERAGE. L.A. GOES OVER  3 MILLION IN ATTENDANCE. PADRES HIT FOUR HOME RUNS OFF COOK IN 7-3 VICTORY.  </P> <P> The Dodgers finished the season the way it began, against the San Diego Padres  in Dodger Stadium. This time, though, there were several unfamiliar faces in  the lineup for both sides, and instead of anticipating another season, they  were shaking hands and saying their farewells.  </P> <P> The Dodgers punched out for 1990 with a 7-3 loss in front of 29,930. That  brought their season attendance total to 3,002,396 -- their highest since 1986  and best in the National League this season.  </P> <P> There were several memories on this final night:  </P> <P>  -- Eddie Murray said goodby with two hits in three at-bats, finishing the  season second in the league to Willie McGee (.335) with a .3297 batting  average. Entering the game, Murray was third in the NL at .327, but he  surpassed New York's Dave Magadan.  </P> <P> Murray left the game for a pinch-runner after his second hit, a looping,  run-scoring single to left in the fifth. Murray jogged off the field,  disappeared into the Dodger dugout to chants of "Ed-die!, Ed-die!" Alfredo  Griffin and Mike Sharperson darted out to take Murray's curtain calls.  </P> <P> "That was a great accomplishment for Eddie," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said.  "I'm really happy for him. He had a hell of a year for us. He's been a joy."  </P> <P>  -- Eric Show (6-8) earned his 100th victory as a Padre, becoming the first  pitcher in the organization to reach that level. Show pitched five innings and  gave up three runs and seven hits.  </P> <P>  -- The Padres tied a franchise record with four home runs -- all against  Dodger starter Dennis Cook (9-4). Darrin Jackson, Jerald Clark and Mike  Pagliarulo each hit a homer in the third to give the Padres a 3-0 lead, and  Mark Parent added another in the sixth. Cook was removed two batters into the  sixth and was charged with five runs and 10 hits.  </P> <P>  -- Dodger third baseman Dave Hansen got his first major league hit, a  run-scoring single to center in a two-run fifth.  </P> <P>  -- Jackson got a career-high four hits -- three singles and a homer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Relief pitcher Jay Howell will undergo arthroscopic surgery on his left knee  today. The surgery will be performed by Dr. Ralph Gambardella. . . .  Broadcaster Vin Scully became a grandfather for the first time when Brittany  Grace Schaefer was born early Tuesday morning at Cedar Sinai Hospital. . . .  The Dodgers announced before the game that Barry Stockhamer has been named vice  president of marketing, and Brent Shyer has been named director of broadcasting  and publications.  </P></p>

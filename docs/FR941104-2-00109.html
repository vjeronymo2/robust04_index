			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Tri-County is a member-owned rural electric cooperative incorporated under the Pennsylvania Electric Cooperative Corporation Act of 1937. Tri-County purchases electric energy at wholesale and distributes and sells it to approximately 16,400 customers in north-central Pennsylvania. Tri-County's service territory encircles WECo's service territory. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 1993, Tri-County's operating revenues, net margins and total assets were $14,726,428, $977,580 and $34,328,648, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wilderness is a business corporation incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Tri-County. Wilderness was incorporated specifically for the purpose of acquiring and holding shares of WECo. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 28, 1994, Wilderness, WECo, and Robert B. McCarthy and Nina M. McCarthy (the two McCarthys collectively, ``McCarthy'') entered into a share purchase agreement (``Agreement''). The Agreement provides for the sale by McCarthy and purchase by Wilderness of 986&hyph;3/4 shares (92.6%) of the Common Stock of WECo for a total consideration of $7,150,000 ($7,246 per share). Wilderness also agreed to purchase, under certain conditions, the remaining 78&hyph;3/4 shares (7.4%) of the Common Stock from the remaining shareholders. If any remaining shareholder offers, during the two-year period after the date of the closing on the proposed acquisition, to sell to Wilderness any or all of such shareholder's Common Stock, Wilderness is required to purchase such shares at a price not less than $7,246 per share. Following the proposed transaction, Tri-County will own 100% of Wilderness, which will own 92.6% of the Common Stock of WECo. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants state that there are three reasons for the proposed corporate structure (i.e., whereby Wilderness, instead of Tri-County, will acquire WECo). First, Applicants state that, under Pennsylvania law, Tri-County could not directly own and operate WECo because a cooperative can ``transmit, distribute, sell, furnish, and dispose of electric energy to its  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> members only. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  In addition, only ``persons in rural areas <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  *&blank;*&blank;* who are not receiving central station service'' <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  can be members. Many of WECo's customers are not located in rural areas; consequently, Tri-County is prohibited by law from directly supplying WECo's consumers. Therefore, under Pennsylvania law, Tri-County could not own and operate WECo; however, Tri-County can, through a subsidiary, serve WECo's consumers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Pennsylvania Electric Cooperative Law of 1990, at 15 P.S. Section 7321(a)(1) (emphasis supplied). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Rural areas'' is defined as areas not within boundaries of any incorporated city, town, village or borough, having a population in excess of 2,500 inhabitants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> . at 15 P.S.

This lien also applies to after-acquired assets. If Tri-County were to acquire the WECo Common Stock directly, it would automatically be subject to REA lien and would not be available to secure the acquisition financing. However, by interposing Wilderness, the WECo Common Stock is not directly owned by Tri-County and is, therefore, not included in the lien. Wilderness obtained the acquisition loan only by pledging the WECo Common Stock as security. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, the REA loan documents limit Tri-County's investments in certain assets without REA approval, including securities such as WECo Common Stock, to an aggregate of 15% of its total utility plant. Because Tri-County's total utility plant is approximately $37 million, Tri-County could not invest more than approximately $5.5 million in WECo Common Stock. This limitation could prevent Tri-County from directly purchasing the WECo Common Stock. However, Wilderness could make the acquisition without such limitation since it is a separate corporation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Southwestern Electric Power Company (70&hyph;8123) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Southwestern Electric Power Company (``SWEPCO''), 428 Travis Street, Shreveport, Louisiana 71101, a wholly owned electric utility subsidiary company of Central and South West Corporation (``CSW''), a registered holding company, has filed a post-effective amendment to its application-declaration filed under Sections 9(a) and 10 of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By order dated March 31, 1993 (HCAR No. 25776) (``March 1993 Order''), SWEPCO was authorized to sell environmental laboratory services, including analysis of water, oils, soil and waste characterization, to nonaffiliates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SWEPCO now requests an extension, through December 31, 1997, of the authority previously granted in the March 1993 Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

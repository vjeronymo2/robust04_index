			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Poll tax 'to rise 11.7%' THE AVERAGE poll tax for England next year will rise 11.7 per cent from Pounds 251 to Pounds 280, according to a survey today. The study, carried out for BBC radio by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, also found that the average bill in England and Wales would include Pounds 20 in 'other adjustments' arising largely from non-collection of the charge in 1991-92. Most district councils and about half the metropolitan authorities and London boroughs have set recommended poll tax levels, but not all of those recommended have been approved by councils. Labour said last night the Tories would pay a heavy price at the election for their poll tax 'incompetence', but the government said the average figure for England would exceed the target poll tax of Pounds 257 by only a small margin. The poll tax in Wales is due to increase by 24 per cent from Pounds 121 to Pounds 150.</p>

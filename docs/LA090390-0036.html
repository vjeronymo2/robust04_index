			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRIME RATE IS STEADY: 1 IN 4 HOMES HIT  </P> <P> Crime against person or property affected one in four American households last  year, a rate virtually the same as that of the past five years, a Justice  Department report said Sunday.  </P> <P> "In 1975, when this statistical series commenced, about one in three households  was struck by crime," said Steven Dillingham of the Bureau of Justice  Statistics.  </P> <P> The percentage of households that were scenes of violence or of burglary or  other property crime in 1989 was 24.9%, up slightly from 24.6% in 1988, the  report said. The figures include attempts as well as completed crimes.  </P> <P> In 23.5 million households, one of these crimes occurred: rape, assault,  robbery, personal theft, theft of household goods, burglary and auto theft.  </P> <P> The figures come from the National Crime Survey, which annually surveys members  of 49,000 households nationwide.  </P></p>

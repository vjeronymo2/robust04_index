			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 16 Mar (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AHRAM voices  astonishment at Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati's  remarks two days ago that Iran will not disagree with Syria if  it signs an agreement with Israel; rather, it will show  understanding of Syria's circumstances.    The newspaper says in its editorial today that the Iranian  statement, while worthy of welcome for indicating a positive  change in that country's attitude toward Middle East peace,  remains surprising and raises a question as to why Iran is using  a double standard in its attitude toward Egypt and Syria.    AL-AHRAM recalls Egypt's attempt, soon after President  Mubarak took power in 1981, to open a new chapter in relations  with Iran to promote inter-Islamic cooperation and regional  stability and security. It adds that the end of the Iraq-Iran  war was a strong reason for removing the tension between Egypt  and Iran and refers to a recent statement by President Mubarak  that an agreement to restore bilateral ties may have been  possible at one time but the Iranian leaders were divided among  themselves over whether to have it.    The paper notes that the reason given by the Iranian  hardliners for not restoring ties with Egypt was their  opposition to the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty and says that  these hardliners began encouraging deviant terrorists to  undermine stability inside Egypt and strongly opposed any  Egyptian role in the Gulf.    AL-AHRAM concludes its comment by expressing the hope that  the difference between Iran's attitude to Egypt and Syria will  not signify that it is using a double standard. It further  hopes that Velayati's recent remarks will spell a new  development in Iranian policy that will promote greater  understanding with the Arab countries, notably Egypt, for the  general Muslim good. The paper cites the example illustrated by  the unique understanding marking the Cairo-Damascus relationship.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Tussle in Arjo Wiggins A tussle developed over Arjo Wiggins Appleton's share price yesterday between two of the City's blue chip investment firms - SG Warburg and Cazenove. The struggle prompted unusually high turnover of 4.1m shares on an otherwise quiet day. In the pessimist's corner, Warburg was arguing that the recent rise in paper prices had been discounted in the share price of the paper manufacturer and distributor. The securities house told clients that on the basis of the Warburg current-year profits forecast of Pounds 170m, Arjo was on an expensive p/e ratio of 21 times earnings. For this reason, Warburg has turned seller. In the optimist's corner, Cazenove, which never comments on market reports, was believed to have raised its 1994 profits prediction by Pounds 10m to Pounds 175m. On balance, Warburg appeared to be victor in the market skirmish as Arjo Wiggins shares underperformed a falling market to end the session 6 cheaper at 258p.</p>

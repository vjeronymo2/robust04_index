			<p>BFN     [Text] Twenty-four hours ago the cabinet approved a law  setting out the military plans for the next six years. Defense  Minister Francois Leotard has now given more details on the  French Army's equipment. The priority will be the modernization  of weapons, nuclear and nonnuclear weapons. Francois Leotard  was interviewed by Frederique Barrere:    [Begin Leotard recording] Modernizing our forces means, of  course, keeping our nuclear dissuasion for ever. The law  provides 130 billion francs to preserve and renew our nuclear  capacity. So, we have decided to continue our efforts as far as  the M5 missile is concerned. It will start operation in the  year 2010, not in 2005. We will continue the program concerning  four SSBN's of the new generation. The basic weapons we need  are taken in due consideration: Leclerc tanks, the Tigre  helicopter, the nuclear aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle,  which will be operational by mid-1999 with its flotilla of the  naval version Rafale interceptor-planes. The Air Force will  also have the Mirage 2000D; as you know the first planes of this  kind are being used in Bosnia-Herzegovina now. Lastly, in line  with our crisis-management strategy, we will start a program for  long-range precision weapons which should be completed by 2001.  [end recording]</p>

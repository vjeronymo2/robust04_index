			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] One of the front men for the Peruvian Cachique  Rivera family, engaged in drug trafficking, was arrested on 2  April in the capital after the Antidrug Division (Dinandro)  exhaustively investigated an accounting office involved in  "laundering" money obtained from drug trafficking, according to  Peruvian National Police [PNP] sources.    As is known, the Cachique Rivera brothers belong to one of  the most important "firms" that supplies drugs to the Colombian  Cali cartel. According to information obtained by Dinandro,  they have become the drug trafficking leaders in Peru after the  arrest of Demetrio Limonier Chavez Penaherrera, aka Vaticano.    The alleged owner of the "enterprise," whose identity was  not  disclosed, was arrested when he was driving a luxurious metal  blue Toyota Tercel vehicle, license number DO-3801, in a capital  neighborhood. According to the source, Dinandro uncovered the  front man after exhaustively and patiently investigating an  accounting office in Lima.    Despite the secrecy in the case, it was leaked that  Dinandro's Finance Division, with the technical support of  auditors, established that the financial movements did not match  the activities carried out by this "front" enterprise.    The source added that after checking the relationship  between  the arrested individual and the Cachique Rivera drug trafficking  family, personnel from that "enterprise" were exhaustively  investigated.    Dinandro thus carried out the successful operation on 2  April  when it was proved that the Cachique Rivera's front man was  involved in "laundering: drug money.    It is known that Dinandro Chief General Walter Taboada Milla  has ordered that investigations into the case continue.    Taboada said the Cachique Rivera gang is formed by four  brothers from Tingo Maria -- Abelardo, aka Teniente; Adolfo, aka  Alferez; Segundo, aka Capitan; and Nicolas, aka Mayor.    According to the source, the Cachique Rivera family is  headed  by Abelardo, aka Teniente, the cruelest of the brothers, who --  according to the police -- heads the operations of the "firm"  from Colombia. Segundo, aka Capitan, is in charge of running  the "business" in the jungle. The other two, according to the  source, are in charge of collecting the money from drug  trafficking.    Taboada said the arrest of these criminals is a matter of  days. Peruvian and Colombian authorities are continuously  exchanging information to find the "narcos."    He ended by stating: "We are following them closely. They  are constantly going to Colombia. We hope to arrest them in a  few days."    The sister in the Cachique Rivera family, Margarita, 30, was  arrested on 20 March in Lima on an arrest warrant issued by the  Lima court on charges of drug trafficking. [passage omitted]</p>

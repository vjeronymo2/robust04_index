			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Airtours/Owners Abroad The battle for Owners Abroad may turn out to be close, despite the increased offer from Airtours. A company used to driving hard bargains with its suppliers was unlikely to be over-generous to Owners' shareholders. Still, an exit multiple of 11 looks thin. Airtours has a superior management record and its offer represents a large premium to Owners' pre-bid share price. But Owners has presented a good case for its proposed link-up with Thomas Cook. Airtours has failed to quantify equivalent benefits for Owners' investors, making the continued absence of a full cash alternative perplexing. The failure to deliver a knock-out blow raises the possibility of Owners coming under foreign parentage. Germany's WestLB bank, which controls Thomas Cook, may seek to secure its investment or even launch an outright bid. That would be a highly unusual move. But Owners' shareholders should not rush to respond to Airtours just yet.</p>

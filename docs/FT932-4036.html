			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Thatcher asked to show documents MR Mark Thatcher, son of the former British prime minister, is being asked to hand over to a US court any documents or information in his possession connecting him to international arms dealers. Lawyers acting for six defendants in a libel suit in Houston, Texas, have filed a subpoena against Mr Thatcher. If the subpoena is upheld by Judge Dan Downey sitting on the case, Mr Thatcher would have to reveal - probably in late July or early September - any involvement he or his company had with Middle Eastern arms deals. The six defendants are being accused of libel by the three sons of late businessman Ihsan Barbouti, an alleged arms dealer to Iraq and designer of a chemicals weapon plant at Rabta, Libya. The defendants believe Mr Thatcher may have information helpful to their case. The defendants, in turn, claim they were defrauded by Barbouti and unwittingly involved in an illegal export scheme. They are counter-suing the Barboutis, and have unsuccessfully tried to subpoena ex-President George Bush.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Articles by Yuriy Levada, leader of the All-Russia Center </F> for the Study of Public Opinion on Social and Economic  Questions, and Nuzgar Betaneli, director of the Institute of the  Sociology of Parliamentarianism, under general heading: "It Is  Difficult To Predict Situation in Federal Assembly but  Sociologists Do Not Fear Difficulties"]    [Text] Before the start of the work of the Federal  Assembly, the IZVESTIYA editorial office asked the leaders of  well known sociological services to describe their expectations  in connection with the start of the new parliament's work and to  predict the possible development of events.    [Levada] Will the new parliament reflect the spread of  opinions in society? How far will it be trusted? Today the  answers to these traditional questions are uncertain and vague  because the situation has ceased to be traditional. The type of  public life which used to exist before and after the frontier of  1985-1989 no longer exists. Neither in society nor in  parliament does there exist nor most likely will there ever  exist a "leading and guiding force" and a people obedient to it.  The forces seeking to fill the vacuum of trust and order are  well represented in the deputies' corps. For all the haste and  even random nature of its formation. How can we tell, perhaps  the very uncertainty of the boundaries and program aims of the  future factions will even benefit parliamentary activity: After  all trial by jury, for instance, presupposes the completely  random selection of jurors....    The accepted rules of the constitutional game do not promise  the parliament a long life. But apart from the functions  prescribed in the Constitution it has one more very important  function -- preparing elections of the president and the  permanent, "real," parliament. I have in mind not so much  legislative as social preparation, the formation of political  forces and their presentation to society, the definition of  leaders, authorities, and programs. Virtually all the declared  contenders for the supreme state post (and a similar number who  have yet to declare themselves) are now in parliament and they  will have to constantly assert themselves to deputies and public  opinion. And that means that the new parliament will have to be  a school of politics and political struggle. The country's  future depends to a considerable degree on what subjects are  learned in this school and by whom.    [Betaneli] It is already obvious that the Federal Assembly  threatens to become a source of at least two tough  confrontations: confrontation within the legislative organ  itself and "skirmishes" between the parliament and the president.    The institute's many years of study, first in the USSR  parliament, then in the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet and  also the all-Russia public opinion polls of voters before the  recent elections make it possible to understand the nature of  the future conflicts. They will be based on psychological,  political, and ideological incompatibility reinforced by the  traditional lack of parliamentary culture in society and the  customary orientation toward conflict and force.    As before the members of the new parliament are  distinguished  by the diversity of their views, positions, and value  orientations, the lack of an "overall picture of the world." To  all appearances many parliamentarians will not consider Ambrose  Bierce's joking warning: "Debate is the best way of confirming  an opponent in his misconceptions."    We may perfectly well expect that either parliament or its  individual factions will sharply oppose the Russian president.  The majority of political parties and blocs represented in the  federal Assembly are geared not so much toward lawmaking  activity as toward preparation for the presidential elections  and the creation of a situation which brings these elections  closer.    But perhaps the most dramatic of future events is the  "Zhirinovskiy effect": Since V. Zhirinovskiy's win at the  elections many representatives of other parties and blocs will  deliberately nor unwittingly copy the "winner's" style and his  arguments and, in borrowing the symbols, run the risk of  borrowing his orientation and values.</p>

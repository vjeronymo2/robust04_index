			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Behind the Scenes" program] </F>   [Excerpts] [Video shows reflection of cooling tower in pool  of water] [Reporter] The flagship of the Armenian power  generating industry -- a station which used to meet almost half  the demand for electricity -- has been standing idle for five  years now. [Video shows Suren Azatyan, director of the Armenian  Nuclear Power Station, identified by caption]    [Azatyan] I find it very hard to take when this superb  station suddenly finds itself a consumer of electricity. It  would be quite wrong to say it was shut down because of the  earthquake. I personally see no connection at all, no link  between the two. But the other aspect -- of improving safety --  is very topical and something that is indeed important.    [Reporter] Of course, the shutdown of the station isn't the  only reason for the very severe power crisis in Armenia.  Blockades, the increased cost of energy sources, and the  breakdown of normal economic ties have taken their toll too.  But the station used to generate 800 megawatts a day -- almost  three times more than all of Armenia's hydroelectric and heat  and electric power stations put together. And the loss of those  megawatts is keenly felt by industry and ordinary people.  [passage omitted] Nobody anywhere in the world has ever  mothballed a nuclear power station and then tried to restart it.  Under a program scheduled to take 18 months, it is planned  initially to restart just one of the two power units -- the  407-megawatt no. 2 unit. The work will be in three phases:  checks or inventory-taking; then precommissioning proper,  including the replacement of equipment; and finally startup.  Only phase one has so far been completed.</p>

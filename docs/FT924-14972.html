			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Shares in Citicorp slide after president resigns THE shares of Citicorp yesterday became the target of very heavy trading on Wall Street as the mystery deepened over the surprise resignation of Mr Richard Braddock, the Citicorp president who was the closest collaborator of Mr John Reed, the bank's embattled chairman. Yesterday morning, Citicorp's stock opened Dollars 1 lower, a drop of 6.5 per cent, before recovering slightly to close at Dollars 14 3/4 , a decline of Dollars  3/4 . Trading volume was an exceptionally high 2.6m shares. Both insiders at Citicorp and Wall Street analysts said yesterday they believed Mr Braddock had been ousted by Mr Reed, his long-time friend. Mr John Morris, Citicorp's spokesman, said: 'The bank's statement states that Mr Braddock chose to resign.' The news of Mr Braddock's departure came at an especially poor time for Citicorp since the bank this week had started to market a Dollars 650m offer of preferred stock. The stock issue is part of the bank's efforts to boost its below-average capital ratio, at the behest of government bank regulators. Wall Street analysts were also disappointed at the announcement by Citicorp that its third-quarter earnings would be less than 13 cents, or about half the level most analysts say they had been led to expect. The bank said yesterday that since Mr Braddock's job will not be filled, his responsibilities would be divided by the other five top Citicorp managers. They are Mr Reed, Mr Onno Ruding, the former Dutch politician named as a vice-chairman last January, Mr William Rhodes and Mr Paul Collins, both Citicorp veterans, and Mr Pei-yuan Chia, head of consumer operations.</p>

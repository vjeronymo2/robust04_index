The hearings were conducted on the initiative  of the parliamentary Defense Committee under the chairmanship of  Sergey Yushenkov.    The position of the Foreign Ministry and the Defense  Ministry  was unambiguous: Joining in the "Partnership for Peace" program  is in the interests of Russia and its security. For example,  Major General Pavel Zolotarev, representative of the Russian  Federation Defense Ministry, stressed that this option will lead  "from political containment by means of deterrence to political  containment by means of cooperation." The advantages are  obvious: It will enable Russia to demonstrate to the whole world  its political will for the active building of collective  security, the anti-Russian forces seeking to isolate our country  in the international arena will be neutralized, effective  mechanisms for the containment of troops will be created, a  single approach to the assessment of a threat to Russia's  security will be elaborated, full strategic partnership will be  established, the system of joint peacemaking operations will  become more effective, cooperation in the field of combatting  nuclear terrorism and industrial catastrophes can be rehearsed,  and so forth.    In any event, as the representatives of the Foreign Ministry  and Defense Ministry stressed, "to disregard" the "Partnership  for Peace" program would mean for Russia quite simply a  disastrous self-isolation from the processes of the pan-European  search for collective security. If we ignore the NATO  countries' initiative the result may be that our country will  eventually find itself isolated.    Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Duma International Relations  Committee, and Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the Committee on  CIS Affairs, expressed a critical view of the idea of Russia's  participation in the "partnership." They expressed the fear  that "one side may be able to impose its diktat" given the  conditions proposed by NATO. In Lukin's opinion, involvement in  the "partnership" would wreck "our strategic intentions to  create security structures within the CIS framework."    The overall course of the hearings showed that there are  major forces in the State Duma who are skeptical of Russia's  involvement in the "Partnership for Peace" program.</p>

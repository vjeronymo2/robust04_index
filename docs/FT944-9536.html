			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Viacom profits up seven-fold in third quarter Acquisitions helped Viacom, the fast-growing US entertainment and media group, to a seven-fold rise in earnings a share in the third quarter. The results included a first-time contribution from Paramount Communications, acquired for Dollars 9.6bn earlier this year. However, they have yet to reflect Viacom's Dollars 8.4bn acquisition of Blockbuster, the video and music retailer, or its Dollars 1.1bn sale of Madison Square Garden. Net earnings were Dollars 327.3m, compared with Dollars 30.9m, before extraordinary items, and earnings a share were Dollars 1.32 against 18 cents. Sales in the quarter were Dollars 2.1bn, up from Dollars 508m. Mr Frank Biondi, president, said the inclusion of Blockbuster would improve results further. 'Our prospects for the fully integrated company, when all our operations are reflected and we begin to benefit from the many cross-divisional activities now under way, are tremendously promising,' he said. Blockbuster's sales in the nine months to September were up 42 per cent to Dollars 2.1bn and net profits by 26 per cent to Dollars 360.2m. Earnings from Viacom's television networks were up strongly, largely because of higher advertising rates and subscription revenues. However, profits from cable TV fell by 33 per cent, after a 12 per cent fall in the previous year, as a result of government-imposed cuts in cable rates. Among the activities acquired with Paramount, feature films earned Dollars 86m on sales of Dollars 431m in the quarter (no comparable figures were given). Viacom said the quarter had been helped by such US releases as Naked Gun 33 1/3 and Forrest Gump. Television programming earned Dollars 18.7m, affected by lower syndication sales. Paramount Parks earned Dollars 30.3m, affected by lower attendances and higher costs. The publishing division, also acquired with Paramount, earned Dollars 175m on sales of Dollars 701m. Results were helped by Paramount's own Dollars 553m purchase of Macmillan, part of the bankrupt Maxwell empire, at the start of the year.</p>

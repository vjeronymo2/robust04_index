			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arkadiy Solovyev, secretary FITUR: "Minimum Wage </F> --40,000 Rubles"]    [Text] Fitur insists upon a minimum wage of 40,000 rubles  and the trade unions approached Chernomyrdin a third time in  this regard.    As is known, the last indexation of the minimum wage amount  (minimum wage) was carried out on 1 December 1993, at which time  it amounted to 14,620 rubles. We are coming to the end of the  sixth month and everything is just as in the past. It is as  though the cost of living is not rising. Officials of Minfin  [Ministry of Finance] officially stated, in behalf of the  government, that the minimum will best be reviewed during the  third quarter, when it will reach the level of the present  minimum pension. Thus, just as in the past, the authorities will  solve the budget problems by means of hired workers.    In this regard, it is worth citing several state statistical  figures. The average monthly wage during the first quarter of  1994 was 146,000 rubles and compared to the same period for last  year this represented an increase by a factor of 7.5, with  prices increasing by more than a factor of eight.    In December, the difference between the minimum wage and the  average national economic wage amounted to a factor of 9.5 and  in March -- 11. And the lag in the minimum wage compared to the  minimum living wage, during the same period, was 3.3 in December  and 4.8 in March respectively.    It is regrettable that low income workers are the group most  affected by the freezing of the minimum wage.    In this regard, FITUR was recently forced to turn to Premier  V. Chernomyrdin a third time, since the previous appeals (in  March and April) on indexation of the minimum wage were declined  by the Ministry of Finance. The arguments put forth by the  Russian Federation Ministry of Finance regarding reindexation  were in our opinion invalid: the proportion of the minimum wage  in the minimum living wage of an able-bodied citizen declined in  December 1993, compared to January of the same year, from 34.8  percent to 30.3, and continues to decline.    FITUR views the existing situation as a direct violation of  the Russian Federation law entitled "Minimum Wage Amount" and  also as non-fulfillment of the general agreement between the  all-Russian associations of trade unions, the all-Russian  associations of employers and the government of the Russian  Federation for 1994, in the section dealing with the "maximum  possible approach of the minimum wage amount to the actual value  for the minimum living wage." This increases social tension in  society and lowers the level of confidence in the government.    In behalf of member organizations, FITUR has proposed that  the government declare its readiness to monitor the signed  agreement regarding social accord and the general agreement for  1994 and to resolve the question regarding the establishment,  commencing 1 May 1994, of a minimum wage in the amount of 40,000  rubles and a wage rate of the first category ETS [Unified Wage  Rate] in the amount of 42,000 rubles.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Germany to buy Norwegian power A 25-YEAR contract for Norway to supply Germany with hydro-electric power has been signed by Statkraft, the Norwegian electricity utility, and PreussenElektra, one of the big three German power companies, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn. The deal, for an initial 2bn kW/hrs to be supplied to the German grid, will have to be approved by both the Norwegian government and German parliament. It is the first long-term foreign electricity supply contract to be signed by PreussenElektra, and suggests a departure by the company in turning to foreign sources for competitive power supplies. It also marks a further move away from dependence on nuclear and coal-fired power stations, which provide 95 per cent of the company's electricity supplies. The deal - welcomed by the Green party as 'a step towards abandoning nuclear energy,' although the company denied this was intended - also provides for a cable linking Norway and Germany, either direct or via Denmark. However, the power should initially be carried along existing power links via Denmark, and possibly Sweden. PreussenElektra is involved in laying a cable link to Sweden for a future exchange of power.</p>

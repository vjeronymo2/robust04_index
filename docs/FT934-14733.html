			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / EC to seek unity on social policy THE European Commission wants to do all it can to end Britain's isolation from the rest of the EC on social policy. That was the message from Mr Padraig Flynn, EC social affairs commissioner, to a Confederation of British Industry conference in London yesterday. 'I believe we must continue to seek to progress social policy measures among the 12 together,' he told his business audience. 'The social protocol of the Maastricht treaty will be for the commission an instrument of last resort.' Under the deal negotiated by Mr John Major, the prime minister, Britain can opt out of social regulations that the other 11 Community states may introduce in the future. But Mr Flynn warned the British government that the EC would go ahead with its proposed works council directive without Britain's involvement if European employers and trade union organisations failed to reach agreement within nine months on alternative non-legal information and consultation procedures for workers in European trans-national companies. In contrast, Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, told the CBI that it was 'quite wrong for the Community to go ahead with a directive on which there was total dis-agreement between Europe's employers and unions'.</p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEEING REDS DOESN'T PAY FOR DODGERS;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: WITH A WEEKEND SERIES AT CINCINNATI AHEAD, LOS ANGELES OVERLOOKS THE  PADRES AND LOSES, 5-2.  </P> <P> There were only 11,729 in the stands Monday night, their opponents were the  fourth-place San Diego Padres, there was no pennant-race atmosphere and there  were no red uniforms for miles.  </P> <P> Ever the proper guests, the Dodgers fell to the occasion.  </P> <P> Missing a chance to gain ground on the idle Cincinnati Reds, the Dodgers blew a  2-1 lead with a horrid seventh inning en route to a 5-2 loss to the Padres in  San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> Thanks to a poor performance by reliever Tim Crews, mixed with a shaky defense,  the Dodgers fell to six games behind the National League West-leading Reds with  21 remaining. They still have three games at Cincinnati this weekend, but if  they aren't more careful these next two nights in San Diego, those games could  come too late.  </P> <P> "We have to think about the actual game we are playing and not think about the  scoreboard or the games remaining or anything like that," said Juan Samuel,  whose first two-homer game in more than three years provided all of the  Dodgers' offense. "Time is the main thing right now."  </P> <P> Samuel's bat was needed considering the Dodgers played without Kirk Gibson and  Kal Daniels. Gibson was nursing a bruised right forearm and Daniels was  suffering from a sore lower back.  </P> <P> In committing three errors, giving them 14 in the last eight games, the Dodgers  were shaky even before the Padres' winning seventh inning. Mike Morgan allowed  no earned runs in six innings, but the Padres had scored once on third baseman  Mike Sharperson's throwing error and Morgan had walked four and hit a batter.  </P> <P> Entering the seventh, the Padres had stranded 11 batters and were frustrated.  Then Tim Crews replaced Morgan, and that frustration ended.  </P> <P> Against Crews, who entered with a 13 2/3-inning scoreless streak, Jack Clark  began the inning with a walk. Joe Carter's grounder forced Clark at second, but  Carter wound up on third base a couple of pitches later after he stole second  and kept running when catcher Rick Dempsey threw the ball into center field.  </P> <P> Benito Santiago walked, then Lynn singled to center to score Carter and move  Santiago to second. Garry Templeton singled to left to load the bases for  pitcher Dennis Rasmussen.  </P> <P> Phil Stephenson batted for Rasmussen and could only manage a grounder to second  baseman Samuel. But Samuel and shortstop Alfredo Griffin could not turn the  double play. Stephenson was safe and Santiago had scored with the eventual  winning run.  </P> <P> The Padres added two in the eighth against rookie Darren Holmes, who kept up  the bullpen's bad streak by allowed first hitter Paul Faries to reach first on  a strikeout, because of a wild pitch. Gwynn doubled to right and Faries scored  on Hubie Brooks' throwing error.  </P> <P> A grounder and an intentional walk later, Santiago's fly ball scored the final  run.  </P> <P> "We had them beat," Manager Tom Lasorda said. "When two runs is all you get,  you have to make the pitches."  </P> <P> Somebody asked if the Dodgers also needed a tighter defense.  </P> <P> "You saw what happened out there," he said.  </P> <P> The Dodgers had taken a 2-0 lead after four innings on two big swings from  Samuel -- each resulting in a home runs.  </P> <P> Samuel had not hit a homer since July 24. During that time, before Monday,  Samuel had 18 hits in 89 at-bats for a .202 average that lowered his overall  average to .213.  </P> <P> He had only eight homers and 36 runs batted, and only two two-homer games in  his eight-year career, the most recent on July 1, 1987.  </P> <P> Samuel also entered the night with a .154 career average against Rasmussen, who  gave up two runs on six hits in seven innings to improve to 10-13. Crews fell  to 2-5. Morgan has won once since July 30, a span of nine starts.  </P> <P> "But they don't mean anything," Samuel said of the homers. "You don't win, they  mean nothing."  </P> <P> The Padres actually didn't deserve this much more than the Dodgers. They  stranded 11 baserunners in the first six innings with abysmal at-bats. While  much of the credit must go to Morgan, some of the blame belongs to a sluggish  offense.  </P> <P> In the first inning, with runners on second and third and one out, Clark popped  to third base and Carter grounded to shortstop.  </P> <P> In the second inning, with runners on second and third and two out, Bip Roberts  struck out.  </P> <P> In the fourth, with runners on first and second and two out, Rasmussen, batting  .288, struck out.  </P> <P> The fifth inning was the worst Padre inning, as five men reached base but only  one scored. The inning featured Roberts, who led off with a double, being  thrown out attempting to steal third after he stopped running on a hit-and-run  before continuing to third base after batter Clark missed the pitch.  </P> <P> The Padres scored their first run in that inning, after the bases were loaded  on two walks by Morgan and a throwing error by Sharperson. Santiago hit a  grounder in the hole that glanced off Griffin's glove as he attempted a  backhand stab. The grounder was ruled a hit, and Gwynn scored from third to  make the score 2-1.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> X-rays of Kirk Gibson's lower right arm showed no break. The deep bruise will  be evaluated daily. Gibson was injured Sunday when he was hit by a pitch from  Cincinnati's Danny Jackson in the fifth inning. . . . Kal Daniels told trainers  he probably aggravated his lower back while attempting a diving catch in the  fifth inning Sunday. He went five for 22 during the home stand to lower his  average to .283, although he has five home runs in his last 25 at-bats.  </P> <P> When Jose Gonzalez was told he was making only his 13th start of the year in  place of Daniels, he was reminded of Manager Tom Lasorda's comments that he  started Juan Samuel last weekend because Lasorda had a dream. "To start me,  Tommy must have had a bad dream," Gonzalez said. . . . Orel Hershiser had his  best rehabilitation day, making 75 tosses at up to 100 feet. Hershiser repeated  that he would not throw batting practice before the end of the season, but said  there was a chance he would throw off a mound. "Everything keeps going good, no  setbacks yet," Hershiser said.  </P></p>

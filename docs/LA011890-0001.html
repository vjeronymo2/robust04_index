			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> QUE PASA?: PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> The allure of public service is something that Ed Avila, a member of the Los  Angeles Board of Public Works for the past five years, can't resist. "I never  seem to have a choice about it," joked Avila, 46, who relishes his government  career that started 20 years ago with Rep. Edward Roybal (D-Los Angeles).  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley has named Avila a deputy mayor, succeeding Grace Montanez  Davis. Bradley wants Avila to advise him on Latinos, homelessness, public  improvements and other issues. Avila has run unsuccessfully for L.A. City  Council, helped found the National Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed  Officials and served in the Carter Administration.  </P> <P> * First, it was "from the classroom and the newsroom to the conference room"  for Felix Gutierrez. "Now, it's to the board room," said the Eastside native.  Six months after he was appointed the first dean of academic services at USC's  College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, Gutierrez has been named a vice  president for the Gannett Foundation, one of the nation's largest philanthropic  entities. Although Gutierrez, 46, is moving to Arlington, Va., the journalism  professor will still be focusing on journalism education and  professionalization.  </P> <P> * "I was interested to see what medicine was all about" is how Diana Larralde  describes her love affair with health-care issues in East Los Angeles. From a  1979 fund-raising dinner, Larralde got hooked on La Clinica Familiar del  Barrio. Working her way through a variety of volunteer jobs, and titles, the  35-year-old attorney now chairs the clinic's governing board, currently known  as the AltaMed Health Service Corp. She said the $5-million operation, which is  building a new senior citizens center, is important because so few are designed  to serve Latinos. GEORGE RAMOS  </P></p>

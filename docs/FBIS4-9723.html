			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rosie Awatsin from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Today, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, PRI  [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate,  carried out only one official engagement and met with leaders of  the Confederation of Mexican Workers [CTM].    CTM Secretary General Fidel Velasquez Sanchez said it is  time  to recuperate the time lost from the election campaign. The CTM  leader indicated that Luis Donaldo Colosio's death was  unquestionably a wily crime, but we must all forge ahead and  redouble our efforts in order to emerge triumphant. The workers  leader was clear when he stated: We are not here to merely  congratulate you, but also to wish you success. We are going to  work in the campaign to ensure the party's victory.    [Begin Velasquez recording] We do not expect to merely  congratulate you on your designation. We want to wish you  success. For our part, we would like to promise you that through  our unity and discipline, which have always been main traits of  this organization, we expect to carry out all sorts of endeavors  to.... [end recording, in progress]    Fidel Velasquez Sanchez also referred to the position the  workers union plans to adopt with respect to workers union  representatives being nominated as candidates to federal  deputies and senators. He indicated: We only aspire to  maintain the number of representatives we currently have and to  reclaim those positions we negotiated six years ago with other  political parties.    The CTM leader also complained to the PRI candidate that the  governors intend to impose the names of those candidates running  for deputies and senators. In this respect, he said: They are  our friends, but they do not represent us.    In replying to the workers demands, PRI candidate Enrique  Zedillo Ponce de Leon was clear when he said that Luis Donaldo  Colosio was emphatic in his political offer when he referred to  his eagerness to ensure material and social progress for Mexico.  Zedillo stressed that he expects to honor Colosio's commitments.    [Begin Zedillo recording, in progress] ...members of your  organizations. During these assemblies, meetings, Luis Donaldo  Colosio adopted some very concrete commitments. I would like to  clearly reassure you, Mr. Fidel Velasquez, that I will fully  respect Luis Donaldo Colosio's commitments to the CTM and all  its affiliates. [end recording]    Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon also indicated the need to  translate economic progress into greater possibilities of  employment, wages, and, of course, a better social security  system for the workers.</p>

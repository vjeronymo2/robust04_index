			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN RALLIES IN 9TH INNING TO STAY ALIVE IN CCAA RACE  </P> <P> It does not take a rocket scientist to pick the Cal State Northridge baseball  fans out of a group.  </P> <P> The Matador fans are the ones with their fingernails bitten to the quick and  pacemakers under their shirts.  </P> <P> Those cardiac kids of the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. had their  faithful on pins and needles again Saturday before pulling out a 5-4 conference  victory over Chapman with a two-run rally in the ninth inning at Northridge.  </P> <P> The victory kept Northridge (28-17-1, 14-11-1 in conference play) in the CCAA  title chase. But the Matadors must their remaining five conference games, and  CCAA-leading Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (19-10) must lose its remaining game --  against Northridge on Tuesday -- if the Matadors are to tie for the title.  </P> <P> Only three teams will go to the NCAA Division II Western regionals. The CCAA  champion automatically earns a berth. Northridge Coach Bill Kernen concedes  that his team's chances of making the regionals are slim if the Matadors don't  win the conference title.  </P> <P> "It's a long shot," Kernen said. "We're going to have to charge down the  stretch."  </P> <P> Northridge charged down the stretch Saturday to defeat Chapman for the second  time in three days.  </P> <P> The Matadors, who have won 11 one-run decisions and five two-run decisions this  season, handed Chapman (23-26, 11-16) its eighth one-run conference loss.  </P> <P> Northridge was sailing along with a comfortable 3-0 lead after seven innings  before senior left-hander Fili Martinez (7-4) gave up a two-run homer to Chris  Cutliff in the eighth, sending Matador fans to their cuticles.  </P> <P> Martinez seemed to recover in the ninth, striking out the first two batters,  but Jason Rolish singled to left and Ken Briggs smashed a towering home run to  left-center to give Chapman a 4-3 lead heading into the bottom of the inning.  </P> <P> But as Matador fans have learned, it's never over until it's over.  </P> <P> Freshman Mike Solar led off the bottom of the ninth by lining his first  collegiate home run over the left-field wall to tie the score.  </P> <P> Chapman freshman Pete Coleman (1-3), who had not allowed a hit in 4 1/3 innings  of relief until Solar's homer, seemed to unravel at that point, giving up a  double to Greg Shockey and an infield single to Randy Thompson, putting runners  on first and second with nobody out.  </P> <P> Matt Patuano, a submarining senior right-hander, relieved Coleman and got Craig  Clayton on a fly to deep center, but Shockey, representing the winning run,  tagged and went to third on the play.  </P> <P> That brought Ted Weisfuss to the plate, and he fisted a 1-0 pitch down the  right-field line for a single, scoring Shockey to end the game. It was  Weisfuss' fourth game-winning hit this year.  </P> <P> "Our games have been close all year, and we always find a way to win," Weisfuss  said.  </P> <P> Martinez, who had a two-hit shutout after six innings, settled for an  eight-hitter, striking out eight and giving the Matador staff its 31st complete  game of the season.  </P> <P> "I should have been able to close the door," Martinez said. "I choked is what I  did. I hung the breaking ball and they hit it. I'm just glad the team came back  to win it."  </P></p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Labour sees threat to hospital jobs JOB LOSSES among health service workers in London resulting from hospital closures could reach unacceptable levels, Mr David Blunkett, Labour's shadow health secretary, warned yesterday. He called on Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, to produce a coherent strategy for all sectors of healthcare in the capital before the implementation of any closures arising from the Tomlinson report. The report on health provision in London, by Sir Bernard Tomlinson, former chairman of the Northern Regional Health Authority, is expected shortly. Mr Blunkett said: 'In essence, we are trying to avoid happening to London healthcare and London health workers what is happening this week to the mining industry and the miners.' He insisted that Labour's support for any closures was conditional on remedies for the 'scandal' of current inadequacies in community and primary care. 'Tomlinson must not be used to bring about cuts in funding and the switch of resources to meet the government's pledges for the coming year in other parts of the country,' Mr Blunkett said. Conditions in the 'agenda for change' which the government would have to fulfil to secure Labour support for any closures included: No changes before the pressure on acute services and the action needed to cut London's waiting lists is assessed. An agreed strategy for replacement facilities. A London regional health authority to be established. All decisions on individual hospitals to be based on health needs rather than site value.</p>

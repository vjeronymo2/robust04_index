			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian bureau forecasts 7% increase for commodity basket World commodity prices are expected to rise by 7 per cent overall in 1994-5, although the picture for individual commodities is extremely mixed, according to latest forecasts from the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics. The predicted overall rise is attributed to the steady pick-up in economies worldwide, and would compare with a fall of 3 per cent in Abare's total commodity index in 1993-94, despite the fact that commodity prices generally bottomed out in the September and December quarters of that year. In 1992-93 the index fell by 8 per cent. The government-owned forecasting unit said that prices of wool, aluminium and base metals were all expected to be higher in year-average terms but that 'given the rapidity with which these prices rose in the June quarter 1994, some downward corrections may occur in early 1994-95'. The wool market indicator price is forecast to average 585 cents a kilogram in 1994-95, compared with 508 cents in the current year; prices for primary aluminium are predicted to rise by one-fifth to average USDollars 1,430 a tonne; gold prices are forecast to average USDollars 383 a troy ounce in 1994, and USDollars 390 in 1995. Meanwhile, sugar and cotton should also 'remain buoyant' in year-average terms, but prices could begin to fall in the latter half of 1994-95 as world production recovers strongly. Australian beef prices are also set for a 'substantial' rise, says Abare, predicting that the sale yard indicator price for cattle will increase by over 19 per cent, to 280 cents a kilogram in 1994-95. The darker spots are the Australian dairy industry, affected by adverse trade developments (including a suspension of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade minimum price for butter), and the coal and iron ore sectors. The annual round of negotiations with the Japanese steel-mills and power industry buyers have already ensured that prices of coking and thermal coal and iron ore will fall in the current year.</p>

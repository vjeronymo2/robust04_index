			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Kosovo elections raise risk of conflict ETHNIC Albanian leaders of the southern Serbian province of Kosovo were forming a breakaway parliament yesterday following weekend elections, branded illegal by Belgrade. Mr Ibrahim Rugova, the newly-elected president, who was also the only candidate, said the polls were a 'chance to create democratic institutions which have legitimacy in Kosovo and on an international level'. The elections have raised the spectre of war in the province. Any violence there is likely to spill over into Moslem areas of southern Serbia, independence-seeking Macedonia, inhabited by some 700,000 Albanians, and into neighbouring Albania. Kosovo's 1.9m Albanians fear sharing the fate of Croatia and Bosnia, where armed struggles with the Serb-led army have left thousands dead and 1m people displaced. They appear to be heeding the call of Mr Rugova to seek independence through non-violent means. Serbia flatly rejects any discussion of independence for Kosovo. Serbs see the province, which is the seat of the Orthodox church, as the cradle of their civilisation. Mr Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia, stripped Kosovo of its autonomy in 1989 and used the 'plight' of the province's Serbs, outnumbered 10 to one, to ride to power on a nationalist wave. Scores of Albanians were killed three years ago when Serbian police crushed rallies protesting against direct rule by Belgrade. Since 1990 Serbia has dissolved the province's parliament and sacked more than 85,000 doctors, teachers and workers for refusing to sign a loyalty oath. Serbs now control Kosovo's police, media, hospitals and hotels. Schools have been segregated. Human rights officials say some 250,000 Albanian pupils did not attend school this year.</p>

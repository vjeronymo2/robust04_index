			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Leading Article: A long road to Whitehall reform MR JOHN Major's government should be judged by its success in raising the quality of public services to the highest possible standard, according to Mr William Waldegrave, the newly-appointed minister of public service. In a speech on Monday, he reaffirmed the government's commitment to the Citizen's Charter, Mr Major's programme for making public services more responsive to their customers. And he promised radical steps to modernise further the civil service, which continues to play a significant role in the provision of public services. This renewed priority for civil service reform is both welcome and necessary. Welcome because the government has often seemed less concerned with efficiency in the civil service than in local government and the health service which are not under its direct control. Necessary because changing the culture of the civil service requires permanent revolution to overcome the inertia inherent in an organisation of such a scale. Much has already been achieved, though the effects can often take years to be felt. The Financial Management Initiative, for example, was launched in 1982 to delegate control of departmental budgets to line managers who were given responsibility for cost centres. Its progress was judged disappointing at the time, but the initiative planted the seeds of an idea which has begun to flower. Departments have now developed internal trading accounts to allocate costs and allow more rigorous financial management. One consequence of this improvement in internal accounting has been a renewed wave of civil service relocation away from central London. Departments have - often for the first time - become strikingly aware of the real costs of their establishments in London and acted accordingly. Competitive tendering A second consequence is the greater transparency of costs which now makes possible the extension of contracting-out to central government departments. This move is long overdue - even Labour council leaders such as Newcastle's Mr Jeremy Beecham now affirm the virtues of compulsory competitive tendering in local government. Mr Waldegrave must show that the government means business on contracting-out with early tendering for a substantial slice of civil service tasks. The creation of executive agencies to deliver government services such as benefits payments and vehicle licensing has also been slow to realise its potential. More than 70 agencies have been set up, employing over half of all civil servants. This has broken the civil service into more manageable units organised around discrete tasks and headed by an accountable chief executive. Greater efficiency But there has been too little progress in exploiting the scope for greater efficiency which is now possible. For example, a report last year by Sir Angus Fraser, then efficiency adviser to the government, criticised excessive interference in agencies by departments and the Treasury. He recommended cuts of at least 25 per cent in the Whitehall staff overseeing agencies - no doubt one reason why the report appears to have been buried. And only one agency, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, has broken away from nationally determined civil service pay and grading. The pay of property valuers in Liverpool and vehicle testers in Leeds are determined by annual negotiations in London. Mr Waldegrave last week urged agency chiefs to make more local pay deals - rightly, since it is clearly more cost-effective for pay to reflect the labour markets in which agencies operate. Finally, the Citizen's Charter will need much more muscle if consumers are to be given real power to demand better public services and to enforce standards. Some charters have offered more impressive performance targets than others. And the remedies for disgruntled consumers are often far from the simple and effective means of redress promised by the prime minister. Mr Waldegrave has, therefore, much to do to achieve his aim of standards of excellence in public services equal to those of the best private companies. He will need to turn a sceptical ear towards some of the reservations so skilfully expressed in Whitehall.</p>

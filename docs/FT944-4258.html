			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Germans may rethink Thorp deal German electricity companies were yesterday considering formal proposals from BNFL, the UK reprocessing company, which will give them the option of taking back up to 1,400 tonnes of spent nuclear fuel they are due to start sending to the UK next year. Under the terms of a Pounds 900m contract BNFL is not due to start reprocessing the fuel until 2005. The contract, drawn up in 1989, makes no mention of what would happen if the Germans wanted the fuel back unprocessed before then. Although the German companies intend to go ahead with reprocessing, they are concerned that political pressures will force a rethink. Environmentalists - a strong political lobby in Germany - are concerned about reprocessing in the UK since the terms of the contract require the German companies to take back the plutonium and waste material after reprocessing. The issue has been under discussion between BNFL and the utilities since October. The Germans have been engaged in similar discussions with Cogema, the French reprocessing company which has a contract to take other spent fuel. BNFL was yesterday unable to disclose the details of its proposals, which it sent to Germany earlier this week. It is thought, however, that it will agree to sending back spent fuel unreprocessed if requested, providing the Germans agree a substantial cancellation fee. BNFL will want compensation for the costs of transporting the spent fuel to the UK, of storing it and of conditioning it for transportation back to Germany. The contract is the second negotiated between BNFL and the German utilities. Spent fuel in the first contract is already being reprocessed. It forms part of the 'base load' of fuel which is being reprocessed in the first 10 years of Thorp's existence. BNFL says the base load, which includes spent fuel from Japan and the UK, will pay for the building and decommissioning of the Pounds 2.8bn plant and provide a Pounds 500m profit. This is disputed by environmentalists. Thorp has been the subject of considerable con-troversy for more than a decade.</p>

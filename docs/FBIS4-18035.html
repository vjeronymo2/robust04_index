			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Seleznev: "Frontier Posts; Cossacks </F> Appeal to the Russian President for Help"]    [Text] According to the Russian Federation Presidential  Administration's Operational Information Center, a conference  has been held on Staraya Ploshchad with the leaders of Cossack  formations stationed in the territory of the Russian Federation.  The conference was attended by representatives of the Union of  Cossacks and the Union of Cossack Troops of Russia and Abroad.  There was a detailed discussion on the Cossacks' problems and on  the need to give Cossack formations independent state-legal  status.    An appeal to Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin was  adopted as a result of the discussion, in which the leaders of  Cossack formations offered their own proposals to take the  Cossacks to a new level of cultural, economic, and military  development. The text of the document and the circumstances  which made its appearance necessary were commented on by Comrade  Ataman Vladimir Naumov from the Union of Cossacks, who took part  in the conference:    "No legislative act concerning a state formation of the  Cossacks has been properly implemented so far. The greatest  concern is caused by time wasted developing the entire state  service system, despite the fact that Cossack regions ensured  the latest draft into the Russian Army. Cossack posts are being  brought up to strength at the most dangerous points along the  Russian border. Cossack communes have received their first few  thousand hectares of land and have become a force capable of  protecting Russia's borders. The Cossacks need state status in  Russia, because their present status as a social organization  has exhausted its possibilities.    "Meanwhile, some rather dubious organizations are operating  on the land markets of the Don and the Kuban; they have already  bought up considerable areas of land, while the Land Bank of  Russia, which once backed Stolypin's agrarian reforms, does  nothing. But the Cossacks will not serve without land. That is  why it is necessary to finally adopt normative documents on a  special procedure for Cossack land use, following on from the  presidential edict `On the Regulation of Land Relations.' What  is happening in the Don region and the Kuban could lead to  social uproar.    "The situation is critical: There has now formed a potent  mix of several former representatives of state services and  criminal `authorities,' who have begun to pin all kinds of  general's shoulder straps, sabers, and orders on one another.    "There are certain forces trying to set the Cossacks in  opposition to the Russian state. Imposters are appearing:  Laughable figures in Cossack uniform with a rich criminal past,  promising everyone everything immediately in their quest for  Cossack chieftainship. But, as historical experience shows,  those who swear loyalty with excessive fervor are the first to  betray you.    "Of course, many want power and the benefits that go with  it,  but giving power over paramilitary organizations to all and  sundry is unwise, to say the least. This was clearly  demonstrated by the scandalous meeting in Omsk in January.    "The president of Russia has clearly said that Russia is a  great country, and the Union of Cossacks is prepared to do state  service for the good of a great Russia.    "With the power of the center weakened, only the full  development of state service will make it possible to end the  oppression of the Cossacks in the North Caucasus, Tataria,  Khakasia, and the former Soviet republics. Unfortunately, the  State Duma's draft laws have yet to note the special status of  Russia's border regions and the stabilizing role which the  Cossacks could play. Very many new faces have recently appeared  in the parliamentary arena, but will state wisdom finally appear  in the State Duma? The Cossack villages of Taldy Kurgan have  been blockaded for more than a week now, and there are other  deplorable examples. Every opportunity must be taken to protect  the Russian population. It is dangerous to delay. In our view,  the first step must be to set up a state committee for Cossack  affairs under the government."</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Lord McKay accused of 'gross unfairness' LORD Mackay, the lord chancellor, was accused in the High Court yesterday of 'gross unfairness' in his conduct of competitive tendering for contracts for shorthand writing services in courts. Hibbit and Sanders, one of the oldest firms of official shorthand writers, is challenging Lord Mackay's decision to award another firm the contract for the Chelmsford group of Crown Courts. Mr David Pannick QC, for Hibbit and Sanders, said a secret policy was unfairly adopted of eliminating all tenderers whose bids, over the contract period, were at least Pounds 250,000 above the lowest price offered by a firm meeting other stated criteria. The lord chancellor's department had given some bidders for the group - including Crown Courts at Cambridge, Ipswich, Luton, Norwich and St Albans - the chance to reduce their offers, in breach of contract conditions which allowed clarification of bids but not negotiation. Mr Pannick said the department had ''irrationally'' failed to give the same opportunity to Hibbit and Sanders of Wadhurst, East Sussex, even though it accepted that its bid was rejected only on the grounds of price. The department had also decided, without telling anyone, to disregard conditions it had laid down on staffing. Mr Stephen Richards, for the lord chancellor, said that tendering procedures had been carried out 'conscientiously and fairly' and Hibbit and Sanders had suffered no prejudice. The hearing is expected to last two days.</p>

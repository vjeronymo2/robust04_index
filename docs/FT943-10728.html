			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Wateraccepts price set by Ofwat Yorkshire Water yesterday became the eighth water and sewerage company to accept the new price limits set by the industry regulator last week. Mr Trevor Newton, managing director, said the decisions were 'acceptable, and give us the headroom we were looking for to handle some of the risks'. 'We can now forget about managing the regulators and get on with managing the business.' Mr Newton said the company was already on track to beat the cost-cutting targets set by the Office of Water Services. Yorkshire's management layers had been reduced from seven to four, with a further two to be stripped out. A further 400 jobs will go this year and the 10-strong board of the utility division will be reduced by about half. Yorkshire's acceptance leaves only Southern Water's position unclear, although it is expected to accept the price limits. South West Water intends to appeal against the regulator's decision. Yorkshire will be allowed to increase prices annually by 2.5 per cent above inflation between 1995 and 2000 - a formula known as the K factor. The regulator has authorised capital spending to meet obligations of Pounds 1.5bn. Sir Gordon Jones, Yorkshire's chairman, has repeated the board's opposition to the appointment of Mrs Diana Scott, a former regulator, to the board of the parent company. 'If she wants to look after the interests of the customers the board of the plc is not the place to do it,' he said.</p>

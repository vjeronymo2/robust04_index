			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> UNEASY DOW DROPS 16.18 AS REPORTS WORRY TRADERS  </P> <P> Stock prices retreated broadly today, with blue chip issues leading the way.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 16.18 to 2,610.25.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock  Exchange, with 622 up, 818 down and 513 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 143.17 million shares, against 140.75 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index closed at 187.51, with a loss of 0.71.  </P> <P> At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index finished 0.18 lower at  371.52.  </P> <P> Uncertainty about the outlook for lower interest rates and uneasiness about the  economy's condition discouraged buyers.  </P> <P> Several reports released before trading began confirmed economic weakness,  particularly in the manufacturing sector.  </P> <P> Retail sales fell a full percentage point in October, and the Commerce  Department cited a slumping automobile market. The Federal Reserve reported  that industrial production dropped 0.7% in October.  </P> <P> But the statistics didn't paint a completely clear picture because they were  influenced by special circumstances, analysts said.

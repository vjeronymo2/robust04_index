			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social </F> Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), by Soichiro Tahara,  commentator and television producer; place and date not given]    Inside Story of the SDPJ's Withdrawal from the  Coalition Government    [Tahara] First, I want to ask you about the Hata coalition  government. The Hata administration has become a minority  ruling government. It has become impossible to know whether the  political world is making progress toward the coming political  realignment or is possibly taking a step backward, losing its  way. What do you think?    [Kubo] It is still less than a year since the coalition  government came into being; therefore it is inevitable that  there should be trials and errors. However, I think the current  government will make progress toward a stable coalition era,  even though it is going through such a process at present.    [Tahara] I think the greatest cause of the Hata  administration's confusion is the withdrawal of the SDPJ from  the coalition government. The media reported various reasons  for the withdrawal, but what is the direct motive that made you  think "there is no alternative but to withdraw from the  coalition government"?    [Kobu] In the nomination of the prime minister on 25 April,  the SDPJ voted for Hata in a body; therefore we had no doubts up  to that stage. However, although there was a mutual  understanding that immediately after the nomination there would  be a party chairmen's meeting concerning plans for the formation  of a cabinet, as well as a secretaries' general meeting  concerning procedures for the formation of a cabinet, we were  not informed of anything and the night fell. Before long, it  was reported on television that the ruling parties, except the  SDPJ, had formed a parliamentary group "Kaishin" [Renovation].  Although Komeito (Clean Government Party] knew of the fact, the  party did not participate in the formation of "Kaishin."    For the coalition government to keep its stability and to  perform its role in response to the expectations of the public,  I think there must be mutual trust as a primary condition.  There is no coalition without faithfulness. If a parliamentary  group comprising 130 seats was to be formed without notifying  the SDPJ and before the formation of a cabinet, and if the  parliamentary group "Kaishin" was to take the absolute  leadership in the formation of a cabinet as well as in the  reigns of government, it was inevitable that a serious question  had been raised as to the significance of the SDPJ's  participation in the coalition government.    [Tahwara] In that process, did you not have a talk, for  example, with Ozawa about "Kaishin?"    [Kubo] There was none.    [Tahara] Were you not informed of the matter by the  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]?    [Kubo] I was not informed of anything. On that day,  Chairman Keigo Ouchi of the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP],  who had advocated "Kaishin," visited SDPJ Chairman Murayama.  When the Japan New Party [JNP], in the days of the Hosokawa  administration, suggested the formation of a parliamentary group  "Kaikaku" [Reform], Ouchi opposed that together with Murayama.  This time, however, Ouchi said, "There has been a change in the  situation within the DSP since then, and it has become  impossible to oppose the formation of a parliamentary group any  longer. I cannot remain isolated in the party any longer, so I  want you to understand my position." Chairman Murayama did not  take Ouchi's visit seriously, thinking, "After formation of the  cabinet, Ouchi will take a position approving the formation of a  parliamentary group. That is the reason he took the trouble to  come and tell me about it."    [Tahara] You did not think that a parliamentary group  would be formed on that day?    [Kubo] Ouchi seems to have thought that he had done his duty  by the SDPJ.    At about 2000 that day, we were informed of the holding of a  secretaries' general meeting. At the meeting Ozawa said, "A  parliamentary group called 'Kaishin' has been registered. In  forming the next cabinet, the allotment of the position of  ministers will be made on the basis of the numerical strength of  each party -- 'Kaishin' -- 130 seats; the SDPJ -- 74 seats;  Komeito -- 52 seats." I said in reply, "The problem is why the  parliamentary group "Kaishin" has come into being. Telling us  such a story at this stage makes us lose our interest in  discussing the formation of a cabinet. The SDPJ itself has to  make its position clear."    [Tahara] How did Ozawa respond to that?    [Kubo] Ozawa said, "That's too bad. There is no time for  that, because we must form a cabinet some time today." Then, I  replied, "Such an important change in the situation has to do  with faithfulness among the ruling coalition parties. I will  talk to you some other time after the SDPJ's position has been  decided." Then, we parted.    At 2000 that day, a parliamentary group of 130 members,  including Toshio Yamaguchi, was registered and accepted by the  Secretariat of the House of Representatives. The fact that the  parliamentary group was accepted at the same time as the opening  of the secretaries' general meeting shows that there was an  intent to form a parliamentary group before the formation of a  cabinet. An important question the SDPJ has is what was its  aim. I do not mind very much about the formation of the  parliamentary group itself.    [Tahara] The parliamentary group was formed so that it could  take the leadership in forming a cabinet, was it not?    [Kubo] I cannot help thinking that the matter was being  conducted without the SDPJ's knowledge.    [Tahara] Was Ozawa too sure that the SDPJ would not withdraw  from the coalition government?    [Kubo] Ozawa said to me directly afterward, "When Ouchi told  me about 'Kaishin,' I thought that he had already told the SDPJ  about it. The truth is that I agreed to the idea because I had  always been in favor of it."    [Tahara] Is Ozawa the kind of man who did not inquire of you  to ascertain the matter when he heard the story from Ouchi?    [Kubo] It may be that from his long experience in the ruling  party, Ozawa thought that those who once took part in the reigns  of government would not leave power easily unless unusual  circumstances compel it.    [Tahara] To Ozawa, the withdrawal of the SDPJ was beyond his  imagination.    [Kubo] To the SDPJ, political power and ministerial posts  are the targets to which it should devote itself intensely for  the realization of its aims, not the targets to which it should  cling.    [Tahara] I see. The SDPJ devotes itself to the targets, but  does not cling to them. That is where Ozawa made a mistake.    [Kubo] That is a natural thing to do from the viewpoint of  the conservative party.  <H5>  What Is the Condition for Returning to the Coalition </H5> Government?    [Tahara] By the way, when you visited Dairen, China, on 21  May, you held a press conference and caused a sensation by  saying, "The Hata administration should resign en masse and  establish a new, stable coalition government. If the Hata  administration resigns en masse, is the SDPJ ready to join a new  coalition government?." What is your real intention?    [Kubo] I had been thinking that this was the only way for  the coalition government to gain the firm support of the public,  so I conveyed my intention frankly. I never thought that would  become such big news.    [Tahara] However, according to the opinion polls, the  majority of the public thinks that the SDPJ will remain an  opposition party for the time being, while SDPJ members seem to  be relieved to be an opposition party. Therefore, your remarks  have "betrayed" their expectations in a sense. You think the  SDPJ should not remain an opposition party, do you not?    [Kubo] Taking the helm of state affairs is the broad policy  of the SDPJ.    [Tahara] For this purpose, you can either join with the  current coalition government or join with the LDP. Are you not  taking the latter policy?    [Kubo] That is unthinkable. And we have no intention to  join with the current administration, either. However, we have  to make every effort to make the coalition government stable.    Hata's minority government will have no alternative but to  resign after early passage of the budget, which has luckily  gained mutual consent. Then political parties with will and  zeal should get together, have a frank discussion, and establish  "a third-term coalition government." Whether this third-term  coalition government can be a stable, majority government is the  crucial point of whether a future coalition era can be  successful. Every ruling coalition party chairman can be a  candidate for the head of the third-term coalition government.  Hata can be the head. Even if Hata is elected, a new  administration headed by Hata is not Hata's reorganized cabinet,  but a completely new administration. That is why the SDPJ can  join with it.    [Tahara] What is the SDPJ's condition for joining with the  government after Hata reigns? Akira Yamagishi, chairman of the  Japanese Trade Union Confederation [Rengo] proposes three  conditions: (1) disband "Kaishsin"; (2) call the responsible  person to account; (3) establish a new decision-making system in  place of the former secretaries' general meetings.    [Kubo] I am in favor of the third condition. It is  important that party chairmen's meetings should be clearly  defined as a decision-making system.    [Tahara] Both Murayama and Ouchi expressed their  dissatisfaction that a party chairmen's meeting had never been  held since the establishment of the coalition government.    [Kobo] That is saying a little too much, because it was  Yamahana who was the chairman of the SDPJ when the Hata  coalition government was established. At that time, all the  chairmen of the ruling parties were cabinet members, so a  Cabinet meeting played the role of a party chairmen's meeting.  However, along the way the chairmanship changed from Yamahana  to Murayama. Murayama could not attend government ruling party  chairmen's meetings because he was not a cabinet minister  although he was the chairman of the party. It is a little  unreasonable to say that there have never been party chairmen's  meetings.    [Tahara] What about the first condition, the dissolution of  "Kaishin?"    [Kubo] I do not interfere in the formation of a  parliamentary group by like-minded persons, but on condition  that the method of forming the group does not go against the  faithfulness to be observed among the ruling coalition parties.  In that sense also, "Kaishin" should be dissolved once.    [Tahara] What do you mean once?    [Kubo] If they stick to "Kaishin" at any cost, a conference  among the ruling coalition parties must be a tripartite  conference -- three persons representing "Kaishin," the SDPJ,  and Komeito [Clean Government Party], respectively. Actually,  however, the representatives of all the parties that compose  "Kaishin" attend the conference for discussion. That makes one  wonder what is the raison d'etre for a parliamentary group.    [Tahara] You mean to say that one representative from  "Kaishin" is enough?    [Kubo] That is right. They talk with the backing of 130  members when that is to their advantage. When numerical  superiority makes things easier, the parties that comprise  "Kaishin" send their own representatives. That is too selfish.    [Tahara] What about the responsibility for forming  "Kaishin?"    [Kubo] I expect each party will take proper measures  concerning the responsibility for having formed "Kaishin." And,  if Prime Minister Hata has decided to resign en masse to  dissolve the unstable minority government, the responsibility  for "Kaishin" will be considered to have been determined.    [Tahara] You mean to say that a resignation en masse will  exonerate them from their responsibility?    [Kubo] We donot insist forever that they punish someone or  another. If we stick to that kind of thing, a coalition  government will not be realized.  <H5>  Is Ichiro Ozawa a Reliable Politician? </H5>   [Tahara] An issue always raised by the media is the  so-called "Ichi-Ichi [Ozawa and Ichikawa] team running out of  control." You have actually attended secretaries' general  meetings and talked to them in person. Does "running alone by  Ichi-Ichi" really exist?    [Kubo] It is true that Ozawa and Ichikawa agree with each  other on various problems. However, the rumor that the two men  have taken leadership not only at secretaries' general meetings,  but also in the decision-making process among the ruling  coalition parties is not correct in my opinion.    [Tahara] So far, have you experienced a kind of surprise  attack like the formation of "Kaishin," for example?    [Kubo] I cannot say positively that there has never been  such an atmosphere. When the two men and I disagreed with one  other, I stubbornly held out, reaching a conclusion through  mutual concessions in the end.    For example, there was the problem of the national welfare  tax. Ozawa and Ichikawa were in a position to encourage Hosokawa  to implement it, but the SDPJ strongly opposed it. We even told  Hosokawa that "we would have to consider bolting from the  government," which brought about its withdrawal.    [Tahara] Before Hosokawa announced the introduction of the  national welfare tax, was there not a general agreement on it at  the secretaries' general meeting?    [Kubo] No, there was none.    [Tahara] What I heard from Shinseito and Komeito members is  that the SDPJ must have known about it, however vaguely.    [Kubo] When Hosokawa said, "I will implement it on the basis  of my judgment," I said in reply, "I have nothing to say if you  assume full responsibility. But the SDPJ will not agree to it.  I want to make that clear." And Chairman Murayama also said,  "If you enforce it, we will have to consider bolting from the  government." Then came a pre-dawn press conference.    [Tahara] Now this is important. As far as I know from my  news gathering, the SDPJ had taken a rather vague attitude  before the announcement, so Hosokawa and Ozawa judged that "they  could carry it through." However, when Hosokawa announced it,  the SDPJ's opposition was surprisingly enough stronger than  expected. This is similar to the problem of "Kaishin."    [Kubo] At about 1900 before the announcement, a secretaries'  general meeting was held in the Prime Minister's Office. At the  meeting, too, I said, "The SDPJ cannot agree to it." Then we  decided to meet again after each party had another discussion  about the matter.    Afterward Chairman Murayama and I went to see Hosokawa and  told him that "we could not agree to it," we had a dispute with  Ozawa and Ichikawa when they said, "Why did the chairman show up  here?" We said, "It is right that the ruling parties should  work out a tax reform policy for which they can take  responsibility. We are proposing establishing a deliberative  body to have full discussions about the matter among the ruling  parties. We cannot give our consent to the way decisions are  made without regard to our proposal." Ozawa became angry and  even said, "Then, shall we stop holding a secretaries' general  meeting?"    [Tahara] I think that the withdrawal of the national  welfare tax and the "Kaishin" turmoil were probably decided by  Ozawa. Even if the SDPJ returns to the coalition government,  can the party trust a man like Ozawa?    [Kubo] I have no intention of giving my advice to a  politician who takes the leadership in a party. However, Ozawa  and I have wide differences of opinion about the world and the  way of conducting politics. However, we can take the helm of  state affairs together concerning the problem of what to do with  Japan for the present.    [Tahara] Why can you work together?    [Kubo] Because I think that our fighting in the same  government helps to make the government sound.    [Tahara] You mean that your ideas are different from  Ozawa's, but that you can work together because you have trust  in him as a man and as a politician?    [Kubo] That is right. He is a very influential politician.  It is amazing to see him go head on with his strategy with  tremendous force. That is why we must be in the government and  play the role of a powerful brake.    [Tahara] Ozawa plays the role of a powerful accelerator.    [Kubo] There are times when he plays the opposite role.  There are times when Ozawa, on the basis of his world view,  puts the brake on what the SDPJ is trying to do.    [Tahara] What do you think are the strong and weak points of  Ozawa as a man?    [Kubo] Since Ozawa and I are incumbent Diet members, I had  better not evaluate him a man. Anyway, he has thought-out  strategies, pushes toward his goal, and fells the other man with  force if necessary. These are his strong points. However,  these are also his weak points, which can be the enemies of  democracy.    [Tahara] A reckless man?    [Kubo] Probably, he does not think of himself as a reckless  man.    [Tahara] Concerning the problem of "Kaishin," the media  widely reported that Ozawa had launched a "surprise attack." Is  he a man who uses such a trick?    [Kubo] I do not think he uses many tricks.    [Tahara] Now, this is a very important point. Ichiro Ozawa  is said to be a man who plays tricks and streamrolls with force  and numerical strength, and a politician who is capable of doing  anything to achieve his end. He is not necessarily such a  person?    [Kubo] His speech and behavior make me feel that he has a  tendency to brush aside and ignore those who oppose his ideas.    [Tahara] Have you ever been tricked or ignored by Ozawa?    [Kubo] I do not think there were many cases like that  between Ozawa and me. Since Ichiro Ozawa and Wataru Kubo were  the farthest apart in the ruling coalition parties, we had been  wary of each other. On the other hand, however, we had a sense  of solidarity in that we were the support and driving force of  the common government, so I do not feel I was betrayed or  deceived.    [Tahara] You did not think you were deceived by Ozawa and  the others in the "Kaishin" turmoil?    [Kubo] In the end, I think the SDPJ suffered what is  commonly called a "surprise attack." If Ozawa participated in  the "surprise attack," I will have to amend the image of Ichiro  Ozawa that I had. However, judging from what I heard from Ozawa,  he seems to have had no intention of "launching a surprise  attack."    [Tahara] If Ozawa had launched a surprise attack, the SDPJ  would not join with a new coalition government, would it?    [Kubo] A coalition government cannot be realized unless it  is based on mutual respect and trust. In that sense, I have  neither the feeling that I was deceived by Ozawa nor the feeling  that I deceived him, although there were many times when we  opposed each other, having different opinions.  <H5>  The SDPJ, Too, Must Change </H5>   [Tahara] You said before that there would be no coalition  between the LDP and the SDPJ, but Chairman Murayama said, "If  the LDP changes greatly, there can be a coalition with it."  What do you think about this?    [Kubo] To my mind, a coalition between the LDP, with more  than 200 seats, and the SDPJ, with 70 seats, is meaningless and  impossible if their policies remain greatly unchanged. By "a  great change in the LDP," Chairman Murayama meant a breakup of  the LDP. I think that a coalition is possible if the extent of  the difference is such that they can hold political power  jointly with regard to their ideas and policies.    [Tahara] Then, if the SDPJ is to join with a new coalition  government, what are the future plans of the SDPJ? Yamagishi  and others propose "a union of liberal forces."    [Kubo] When the coalition government was established last  year, I talked with Ozawa about the reigns of government for the  first time. He said, "I will accomplish political reform  through the coalition government and create an era of two  conservative parties." I refuted him by saying, "You have  bolted from the LDP because you thought that the current LDP  cannot shoulder Japan's politics and that new conservatism must  be formed. What is the meaning of a new conservative party  competing with the old LDP for political power?"    The SDPJ must also change in the same way as the LDP. It  would be ideal if a new-born SDPJ and like-minded people got  together and formed a new reformist force, and if such a new  reformist party and a new conservative party compete for  political power. However, that will take considerable time  under the current political situation. In that sense, I think a  tripolar era will come: (1) an LDP which tries to transform  itself into a new conservative party; (2) another conservative  party centering around Shinseito; (3) a newly mustered  reformist political force -- a force which is not particular  about the history of the SDPJ or about the name of the party.  It would be desirable for political power to be established  through the union of either of the conservative parties on the  basis of respective policies, with a new reformist party as the  axis.    [Tahara] In that case, what would be the slogans of the new  reformist party?    [Kubo] They would be "peace and justice," although they  sound abstract. Thorough implementation of democracy and  respect for self-government are the political methods to realize  these slogans. The pillars of political measures to be promoted  are disarmament, human rights, the environment, and welfare. It  would be good if a wide circle of people who can agree on these  matters got together. I do not think ideological problems are of  great importance.    [Tahara] Then, that is not very different from conservatism.  The other day I said to LDP President Yohei Kono, "What is the  difference between the LDP's flag and Ozawa's flag?" Kono said,  "Ozawa seems to think that the state comes before its people.  But we want to built a nation for its people and for the  benefit of its people." Fundamentally, there seems to be no  difference between your thinking and that of Kono's LDP.    [Kubo] When Miyazawa became prime minister, I read his books  or listened to his general policy speech, which made me feel  that we had much in common. Kono may be the same. However, our  political footings are different. Miyazawa changed when he  became prime minister; probably he had to change. I once  severely criticized Miyazawa saying, "There is a difference  between what you have been saying and what the LDP is going to  do."    [Tahara] I want to ask you about "peace" in your "peace  and justice." In referring to peace, Ozawa says, "Japan must  make a contribution to world peace. The United Nations must  restore peace and order when they are disturbed. Japan should  participate with the United Nations."    [Kubo] I also think that human cooperation should not be  spared. However, it is clear that military cooperation is  impossible under the current Constitution, and the United  Nations has approved Japan's membership in it with the  understanding of that fact. For this reason, Japan cannot be  forced to make a military contribution under "the collective  actions" listed in Article 1 of the United Nations Charter, nor  should we choose that road. There should be other roles that  Japan can play, excluding a military contribution, such as  economic cooperation, medical services, natural disaster relief,  and dealing with the aftermath of regional conflicts. To carry  out such cooperation, I think it is better to raise forces  equipped and trained in addition to the Self-Defense Forces.    In connection with this, there was an issue on which Ozawa  and I had divided opinions to the last in the policy talks  immediately before the establishment of the Hata administration.    [Tahara] That is the issue of collective actions and  universal security, is it not?    [Kubo] Ozawa ventured to take up only collective actions  provided for in Article 1 of the United Nations Charter.  However, collective actions and peaceful means are written side  by side in Article 1. Therefore I insisted: "Under the current  Constitution, it is impossible for Japan to make a contribution  to collective actions; therefore that should be deleted from the  policy agreement." As far as peaceful means are concerned, that  is, in my opinion, what Japan should do in response to the  request of the United Nations, and there are ways of cooperation  which can gain the respect of the world.    [Tahara] I want to ask you about universal security. If  United Nations forces are dispatched somewhere, can Japan render  rear assistance for the forces?    [Kubo] In my opinion, that is impossible. However, as for  cooperation at military bases stipulated by the Japan-U.S.  agreement, the extent of cooperation must be examined, to my  mind.    [Tahara] Another word I want to ask you about is "justice,"  which seems intelligible but is actually unintelligible. What  does it mean concretely?    [Kubo] Now all countries, including socialist countries,  practice a market economy, and economic vitality cannot be  produced unless the principle of competition is followed. And  if the economy is activated, profit will become larger.  Politics plays an important role in impartially distributing  the profit among every citizen and every country. Concretely,  "justice" has to do with the problems of tax systems and budgets.    [Tahara] What Ozawa is always saying is  "self-responsibility" and "self-reliance." In short, an  underlying principle is "free competition," from which the idea  of "deregulation" is derived. "Justice" is a little different  from "free competition," is it not?    [Kubo] That is right. I am opposed to the view that "every  regulation should be abolished." To ensure social justice, the  government must bear the responsibility for carrying out  necessary regulations. The abolition of all regulations will  bring serious consequences.    [Tahara] Do you mean that regulations are necessary for the  protection of the weak and that the strong must be restrained?    [Kubo] That is right.    [Tahara] If free competition is carried to the extreme, the  weak becomes the victim of the strong. This is where you differ  greatly from Ozawa.    [Kubo] It is important to mind one's own business. However,  as long as there is social inequality because of the existence  of people who cannot mind their own business, the government  must not forget to level off the inequality or to give political  assistance; otherwise its reason for being is meaningless.  <H5>  Why Is the Amendment of the Constitution Through </H5> Interpretation Dangerous? [Tahara] In dealing with the problem  of the Constitution, the SDPJ had once used the words "creation  of the Constitution," which are a little unclear. What do you  think about the Constitution now?    [Kubo] There is a question about the Constitution:  "Germany has already amended its Constitution dozens of times  since the end of World War II. Why is the Constitution of Japan  a code of laws that will be in effect forever?" The German  Constitution is an organic law, which is different from that of  Japan which is an idealistic law. Therefore, I think it  important to institute concrete organic laws under the idea of  the Constitution of Japan. The problem of the environment as  well as the problem of security was nonexistent when the  Constitution was established. Concerning the idea of the  Constitution, I think that we should not interpret it  differently with the change of circumstances. As you know,  procedures for the amendment of the Constitution are stipulated  in it. We think highly of the Constitution, including the  procedures.    [Tahara] In short, all we have to do is to amend the  Constitution according to the procedures if necessary.    [Kubo] That is right. In other words, nothing is more  dangerous than to promote policies, taking "amendment of the  Constitution through interpretation" for granted.    [Tahara] Do you think that "amendment of the Constitution  through interpretation" is in progress at present?    [Kubo] Yes, I do.    Ozawa's way of thinking is: We had better amend the  Constitution through interpretation. It is a tremendous job to  amend the clauses of the Constitution through those procedures;  therefore the interpretation of the Constitution had better be  done by the then incumbent government. I think this is a  dangerous idea.    [Tahara] However, if "amendment of the Constitution through  interpretation" is already in progress, there is no alternative  but to amend the Constitution or to restore the interpretation.    [Kubo] "Amendment of the Constitution through  interpretation" appears to be a concrete policy and is realized  through its implementation. Therefore our duty is to change  that in conformity with the idea of the Constitution.    [Tahara] To put it concretely, do you think that the Self-  Defense Forces and peacekeeping operations of today go beyond  the idea of the Constitution?    [Kubo] Yes, I do. Unless one recognizes the actual  situation of Japan's society established through the procedures  of parliamentary democracy under "the Constitution of Japan,"  one cannot join with the government. Therefore I am not of the  opinion that unless a decision is reached as to whether the  Self-Defense Forces are constitutional or not, one cannot join  with the government.    [Tahara] This is an important point, so I want to repeat it.  The Self-Defense Forces of today and peacekeeping operations go  beyond the idea of the Constitution. However, their deviation  is not an unlawful deviation in the light of the procedures of  today's democratic society; therefore you approve of the present  situation. The SDPJ wants to restore that to an ideal condition  in the future by joining with the government.    [Kubo] That is right. To put it concretely, we promote  disarmament, which has become the trend of the world. Although  we do not know whether it will take 50 or 100 years, we should  push disarmament while recognizing the existing circumstances.  If we reach the ultimate in disarmament, there will be no  disputes about constitutionality or unconstitutionality, which  is the ideal of the Constitution.    [Tahara] Your ideas may conflict with the ideas of Ozawa and  others. Your idea is that conflicts make things better and that  things are kept stable through the relationship between the  accelerator and the brake.    [Kuho] That is right. The characteristic of the coalition  era is for people with different ideas to form a government.  Basically, the Diet is exactly like that, is it not? If one  says that people with different ideas cannot work together, one  has to disband the Diet. The Diet is the place where people  with different ideas have discussions and reach a conclusion.    [Tahara] A place where there is no accelerator or no brake  is dangerous. At present the bureaucrats have only an  accelerator and do not have a brake, which makes the situation  all the more dangerous.</p>

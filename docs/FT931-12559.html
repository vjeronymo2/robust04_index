			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / NZ eases monetary policy THE NEW Zealand Reserve Bank yesterday said it was relaxing its monetary policy after actively intervening earlier this month to support the New Zealand dollar in defence of its anti-inflation targets. The bank's governor, Dr Don Brash, said he was satisfied at 'the continued consolidation' of the New Zealand exchange rate at current levels. Yesterday, the dollar was trading at 53.8 NZ cents against a trade-weighted index of main currencies, having traded at 53.5-53.8 recently. When the bank intervened earlier this month it had fallen to 52.4. The bank has been given total independence from the Finance Ministry in handling monetary policy with the single objective of achieving 0-2 per cent inflation. The bank acted when it believed the drop in the value of the dollar endangered its inflation goal. Yesterday the bank said it was cutting the discount margin at which it will buy eligible Reserve Bank bills from 150 to 120 basis points. It said it was increasing the settlement cash target from NZDollars 10m (Pounds 3.3m) to NZDollars 15m. This is the first movement in the discount margin since the cental bank first intervened.</p>

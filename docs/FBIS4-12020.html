			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lissy Schmidt] </F>   [Text] Irbil, Iraq, April 1 (AFP) -- At least 2,000 Kurds  have trekked across the mountains from Turkey to  Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq in the past month, reporting  widespread repression by Turkish security forces, officials said.    Kurdish customs officers and military personnel said Friday  the Kurdish authorities registered more than 1,000 refugees in  the border town of Zakho on March 11, but 1,000 more arrived  later in the month. They were staying in tents and ruined Iraqi  Kurdish villages.    Muhammed Mikho, a Kurd from the village of Gevere in  southern  Turkey, told AFP the Turkish authorities prevented cars from  entering or leaving the village and the Kurds could not take  sick people to hospital.    "No food reached our village. We could not provide our  children with fruit or vegetables throughout the winter," he  said.    He was staying in a tent near the Turkish border with his  wife and eight children.    Just before Sunday's Turkish municipal elections "soldiers  came into the village, hit us, tortured our women and threatened  to kill all of us," Mikho said. The soldiers' actions prompted  Kurdish families to leave Gevere.    The Kurdish authorities, who have controlled the Iraqi side  of the border since March 1991, said they had not decided how to  handle the new influx.    The refugees insisted on international protection and  rejected plans to move them into a camp, saying they were  "afraid of the Turkish secret services," Kurdish officials in  Zakho said.    Turkish representatives maintain a contact office in Zakho.    A refugee from Sibeli village said the Turkish Kurds feared  cross-border raids by Turkish helicopters, and wanted to keep  their places of refuge secret.    Other refugees said the Turkish military did not let them  take any property with them and they had not yet received any  aid.    As discussions continued in Zakho over the establishment of  a  refugee camp, Kurdish police who refused to be named said they  were not sure whether they would be able to protect refugees in  a camp against "attacks from the Turkish secret services."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Small- and medium-sized  companies in Japan should drastically reform their business  structure in order to survive intensifying competition arising  from rapid changes in their business environments, according to  a government white paper released Thursday [28 April].    The white paper prepared by the small and medium enterprise  agency, which is affiliated with the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry, described the environment changes facing  smaller companies -- those capitalized at 10 million yen or less  -- as unprecedented in terms of scale, diversity and seriousness.    "Decisive" reform efforts that may lead to a "fundamental"  review of traditional business practices and structure need to  be made in line with these environment changes, the white paper  said.    The paper emphasized the need for creation of new business  and services by ailing small enterprises. Such business chances  are possible through diversification efforts and conversion to  new areas, the paper said.    The document also proposed reforms to revitalize smaller  firms on the labor and organizational fronts, including  investment in young and promising human resources, a practice  rarely seen among smaller firms in the past, and formation of  business ties beyond traditional boundaries.    Summing up business activity in the past year, the white  paper for fiscal 1993 said small- and medium-sized companies are  struggling in almost all sectors because of the long-standing  slump amid slack personal spending. Fiscal 1993 ended March 31.    In fiscal 1993, the number of bankruptcies among smaller  companies increased 3.5 percent from the preceding year, the  paper said.    The paper cited a significant deterioration in earnings,  excessive manpower supply, a deepening cash shortage and a sharp  drop in capital spending as the main elements affecting smaller  businesses and which are a legacy of the lingering recession.    The yen's sharp appreciation against the dollar since  February 1993 dealt a severer blow on smaller companies than  when the group of seven economic powers tried to drive down the  dollar's value against other major currencies with the 1985  Plaza Accord.    Other adverse environment changes for small companies cited  by the white paper included increased competitiveness of  products manufactured by Southeast Asian countries and newly  emerging Asian economies.    The trend has prompted many small companies in Japan to move  production facilities overseas, the paper said.    It said the economic doldrums in Japan are bringing about  drastic industrial restructuring for small companies by forcing  big changes in their relations with major corporations.    Under the cloud of recession, the white paper said major  automakers, for example, have been forced to extend the duration  of model changeover cycles, simplify product lineups, unify  component use for different models and shift to overseas  operations, all eroding businesses previously assigned to  subcontractors.    "The situation is especially severer for third, fourth and  fifth subcontractors of major corporations than those directly  working with them," the white paper said. In order for these  subcontractors to tide themselves over in the present economic  climate, the white paper proposed they diversify client  companies and develop their own brand products.    There are chances for new business emerging for small firms,  the paper said. It cited housing-related sectors,  information-telecommunications fields, environments and services  needs stemming from the aging society, the paper said.</p>

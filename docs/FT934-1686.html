			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: A moving conversion Sir, I was more than moved by Michael Grade's piece (Personal View, December 14) advocating more competition in commercial television when, as head of Channel 4, he is confronted with the proposed mergers in Channel 3. Mr Grade is, of course, a hereditary placeman of the British television establishment, which has fought tooth and nail against enhanced competition and choice for the last 25 years. Does Michael Grade's belated and self-serving conversion now mean that he will unequivocally support and press for the Independent Television Commission to advertise Channel 5, which would be a competitor to Channel 4?

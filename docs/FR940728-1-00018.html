That action would have required removal of certain second stage turbine vanes repaired by Turbine Components Corporation (TCC), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Repair Station No. 119&hyph;20, of Branford, Connecticut. Since the issuance of the NPRM, the FAA has determined through test, analysis, and review of data from operator experience over the past four years that the unsafe condition described in the NPRM is not likely to exist or develop in other engines of the same type design. Accordingly, the proposed rule is withdrawn.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Mark A. Rumizen, Aerospace Engineer, Engine Certification Office, FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299; telephone (617) 238&hyph;7137, fax (617) 238&hyph;7199.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to add a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Pratt &amp; Whitney (PW) JT8D&hyph;1, &hyph;1A, &hyph;1B, &hyph;7, &hyph;7A, &hyph;7B, &hyph;9, &hyph;9A, &hyph;11, &hyph;15, &hyph;15A, &hyph;17, &hyph;17A, &hyph;17R, and &hyph;17AR turbofan engines, incorporating second stage turbine vanes repaired by Turbine Components Corporatration (TCC), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Repair Station No. 119&hyph;20, of Branford, Connecticut, was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 26, 1989 (54 FR 43586). The proposed rule would have required removal of certain second stage turbine vanes that contain repairs using trailing edge and airfoil midsection (``H'' dimension) dimension puddle welds that may not possess adequate structural integrity and may fail during engine operation of the vane airfoil. Puddle welding can produce a number of welding abnormalities including a significant amount of heat affected zone (HAZ) cracking. The FAA believed that the HAZ cracking coupled with the aerodynamic loading and thermal cycling of the airfoil can lead to further crack propagation and eventual airfoil fracture. The subsequent damage created by a second stage turbine vane airfoil fracture can cause downstream turbine blade and vane fractures, resulting in a possible fire, inflight engine shutdown, uncontained engine failure, and damage to the aircraft.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the issuance of that NPRM approximately four years ago, the FAA and PW have conducted laboratory analyses, analytical studies, in-service engine inspections, and monitoring of the operating experience of the stage 2 turbine vanes. Based on data collected, the FAA has concluded that the unsafe condition described in the NPRM is not likely to exist or develop in other engines of the same type design. Therefore, requiring removal from service of the turbine vanes repaired by TCC is not warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon further consideration, several operators commented that since the vanes are not serialized and records were not kept on the parts, a shop visit and engine disassembly would, therefore, be the only means to locate the TCC-repaired second stage turbine vanes. The resulting forced engine removals, based on the proposed NPRM compliance schedule, would cost the operators an estimated $124,000,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, operators reported no technical concerns with the TCC-repaired second stage turbine vanes, that they were experiencing excellent durability with these parts, and that they have determined that the TCC-repaired stage 2 turbine vanes should be permitted to continue in service without additional inspection requirements beyond normal maintenance practices. Accordingly. the proposed rule is hereby withdrawn. Withdrawal of this notice of proposed rulemaking constitutes only such action, and does not preclude the agency from issuing another notice in the future, nor does it commit the agency to any course of action in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since this action only withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking, it is neither a proposed nor a final rule and therefore, is not covered under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Withdrawal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the notice of proposed rulemaking, Docket 89&hyph;ANE&hyph;26, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 26, 1989, (54 FR 43586), is withdrawn.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Burlington, Massachusetts, on July 21, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jay J.

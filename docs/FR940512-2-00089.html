			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SMATV is essentially a private cable system, typically used in apartment buildings or other high-density housing. SMATV is estimated to have fewer than 1 million subscribers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Home satellite dishes are used to receive programming from communications satellites. More than two and one-half million satellite dishes have been sold in the United States. C-band satellite service, which is provided by low-power satellites, requires consumers to install satellite receiving dishes eight to twelve feet in diameter at an installed cost of $1,500 or more. Because of its high installed cost and the size of the receiving dish required, C-band satellite is a poor alternative to cable television service for most current or potential cable subscribers. Medium-power Ku-band satellite service, provided by TCI and its partners in a joint venture called Primestar Partners, L.P., uses dishes three feet in diameter and has approximately 70,000 subscribers. High-power DBS is expected to become operational and available within a few months using a dish 18 inches in diameter, and may by virtue of its smaller dish size be more attractive to consumers so that it ultimately may offer greater competition to cable service than the other satellite services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Video dialtone is a multichannel subscription television service recently authorized by Federal Communications Commission regulation and being developed by common carrier telephone companies. Using the telephone network, telephone companies plan to offer distribution of programming provided by third parties. As the telephone companies improve the capabilities and capacity of their networks, they are expected to be able to offer greatly expanded channel capacity and services such as ``video-on-demand.'' At present, there are a small number of pilot projects demonstrating the service. Widespread development of video dialtone services in the future may present a substantial competitor to cable systems. Common carrier telephone companies also have announced their interest in providing cable service directly to subscribers in the event that legal restrictions on their offering such services within their operating regions are removed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, both TCI and Liberty, in addition to operating cable systems, each have substantial financial interests in video programming services provided to cable systems and other MSTDs. The merger of TCI and Liberty creates a vertically integrated firm with substantial power both as a MSTD and as a video programming provider. TCI and Liberty together will effectively control access to about one-fourth of cable subscribers and will be affiliated with eight of the twenty most widely distributed cable programming services. This substantial integration is likely to increase abilities and incentives to restrain competition in two ways. First, the merged firm could discriminate against competitive video programmers in favor of its affiliated programmers by refusing to carry programs or by denying similar terms or conditions thereby making it significantly more difficult for such competitive programmers to operate profitably or to compete effectively against the merged firm's programming services. Second, the merged firm could deny access to or discriminate in terms of access to its programming to competing MSTDs, making it more difficult for competitive distribution systems to obtain programming necessary to compete effectively against the merged firm's MSTDs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> III <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The United States and the defendants have stipulated that the Court may enter the proposed Final Judgment after compliance with the APPA. The stipulation provides that entry of the Final Judgment does not constitute any evidence or admission by any party with respect to any issue of fact or law. Under the provisions of the APPA, the proposed Final Judgment may not be entered unless the Court finds that entry is in the public interest. The Department believes that the proposed Final Judgment provides an adequate remedy for the alleged violation and is in the public interest. The term of the proposed Final Judgment is five (5) years. The length of this term reflects the Department's recognition that this industry is one that has experienced major changes in MSTD technologies that are on-going, and the effects of the 1992 Cable Act and its implementing FCC regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV(A) of the proposed Final Judgment enjoins Defendants' cable systems and other MSTDs from discriminating against non-affiliated video programmers in the selection, terms, or conditions, where the effect of such conduct is unreasonably to restrain competition. This provision does not create an automatic right of access for any individual video programmer to any of Defendants' individual MSTDs, nor is it intended to inhibit good faith negotiations between Defendants and unaffiliated programmers regarding the terms and conditions of carriage. However, where the effect of discrimination by Defendants is to restrain competition, such conduct is prohibited. Discriminatory conduct can take a variety of forms depending on individual circumstances, and may include, but is not limited to, discrimination in: (i) Pricing; (ii) channel assignment; (iii) tiering or packaging of programming services; (iv) promotional activities; and (v) signal quality. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By section IV(B), Defendants are enjoined from refusing to sell or license, or from selling or licensing only on a discriminatory basis, video programming in which they have an interest to any competing MSTD, where the effect of such conduct is unreasonably to restrain competition. Differences in price or terms that are reasonably based on ordinary commercial factors, including but not limited to the factors currently set forth in 47 CFR 76.1002(b), will not constitute prohibited discrimination. This section therefore does not prevent defendants from engaging in good faith business negotiations or from imposing reasonable requirements for the creditworthiness or service quality of a distributor, or from establishing prices, terms, and conditions that reasonably reflect actual differences in the distributor's costs of providing such video programming or economies of scale or other economic benefits reasonably attributable to the number of subscribers served by such distributor. This provision does assure that Defendants may not refuse to license their video programming to competing MSTDs where the effect would be to inhibit the ability of such MSTDs to compete against Defendants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV(C) extends the prohibitions set forth in sections IV (A) and (B) to prevent Defendants from seeking or supporting, with respect to any MSTD or video programming provider in which Defendants have any financial interest but do not control, conduct that would violate sections IV (A) or (B) if engaged in by Defendants. For example, should Defendants urge Turner Broadcasting, Inc. to deny programming to a competing MSTD under circumstances that would result in an unreasonable restraint on competition, such conduct by Defendants would violate this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By prohibiting conduct by Defendants that might restrain competition in the provision of video programming or multichannel subscription television distribution, the Department believes that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed merger alleged in the Complaint will be fully remedied. In addition, by expressly including common carrier telephone companies and their video dialtone customers in the definition of MSTDs, the proposed Final Judgment will make clear the defendants' obligation to refrain from anticompetitive discrimination against these potential competitors. The Department's view as to the sufficiency of this relief also rests on the existence of sections 12 and 19 of the 1992 Cable Act, and their implementing FCC regulations, as well as the judgments recently entered in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Primestar Partners, L.P., et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> State of New York, et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Primestar Partners, L.P., et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  (``Primestar cases''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> No. 93 Civ. 3913 (S.D.N.Y.

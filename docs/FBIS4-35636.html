			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, "leader of the Sons </F> of Yemen League and vice president of the Democratic Republic of  Yemen," by Lutfi Shatarah in London; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Shatarah] Some observers believe that the  declaration of the secession of the south was perhaps meant to  pressure Sanaa into a cease-fire and into accepting a federation  or confederation.    [Al-Jifri] The secession was declared not by us but by 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih. What we did was announce the result which  Salih caused, because we had agreed with him before the war that  a declaration of secession would mean a declaration of war by  either side and that a declaration of war would mean secession.  So he declared war knowing that that would mean secession.    Secondly, they (the northerners) say that they have occupied  one area or another which means that they are advocates not of  unity but of occupation, and that their view of unity is that  they should occupy and control others.    Thirdly, we are not playing games to set up a state as a  means of pressure for a cease-fire but we cannot accept unity on  the old foundations and we cannot place the lives and future of  the public in the hands of people obsessed with domination and  hegemony.    We, however, advocate unity based on law and order,  equality,  democracy, and respect for human rights. When there is a regime  in Sanaa which believes in what we believe in, then we will  discuss unity with it. Also, if 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih observes a  cease-fire and withdraws his forces then we would be willing to  build special and cordial relations with our brothers in the  north and later develop these relations into anything. [passage  omitted]    [Shatarah] It has been rumored that there is U.S. pressure  on you to revoke the secession decision in return for which  Sanaa would be forced to stop the war and agree on a new form of  unity. What, in your view, would that form be, after missiles  have hit Sanaa as well as Aden?    [Al-Jifri] There is no U.S. pressure on us in that  direction. We know that our American friends are indeed against  infighting in our country and against the imposition of unity by  force, and that they are in favor of unity on new and sound  foundations. We never called for anything else before. We  believe that a cease-fire and withdrawal of forces to their  pre-22 May 1990 positions would pave the way for calm and  sensible negotiations that would maintain some kind of link  between the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] and the Yemeni  Arab Republic [YAR]. That way we would achieve the stability  sought by everyone at home and abroad. [passage omitted]    [Shatarah] There are conflicting reports about the results  of the battles, sometimes exaggerated. What is the true  military situation on the various fronts?    [Al-Jifri] In such battles on such a long front there is  bound to be advance and retreat and confused and exaggerated  reports, but what we want to fully emphasize is that Aden is  protected, firstly by God and then by our people in the  battlefields led by Defense Minister Brigadier General Haytham  Qasim Tahir, his aides, the chief of staff, the air eagles, and  the naval forces.    'Ali 'Abdallah Salih will not be able to conquer Aden. That  we categorically affirm. His plan was to occupy Aden within 48  hours or five days at the most. We are now in the fourth week.  Even in four months his position would be worse and ours would  be better. We are defending a cause and our territory and he is  an aggressor without a cause. [passage omitted]    [Shatarah] Has there been any confirmation of Iraqi or  Sudanese involvement in the current war in Yemen?    [Al-Jifri] We have definite indications or information about  involvement of quarters from outside the DRY and YAR in this  sedition triggered by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. At present at  al-Hudaydah air base there are experts, training instructors,  and pilots from abroad. As regards those who claim to be  fighting in the name of Islamic Jihad, God knows that we know  Islam better than them and are more committed to it than them,  otherwise they would not have destroyed entire villages,  including women and children, in the holy months and during 'Id  al-Adha. [passage omitted]    [Shatarah] It has been claimed that al-Bid has moved his  headquarters to Hadhramaut and that he is running his affairs  from there. What are the justifications for such a move in the  circumstances?    [Al-Jifri] President 'Ali Salim al-Bid went to Hadhramaut to  to carry out extremely important tasks and to deal with various  matters at local, Arab, or international levels. Wherever there  are duties for the brother president or any of the officials in  the south to perform, they would go to perform these duties.    [Shatarah] Could it be that he moved there because Aden  became unsafe?    [Al-Jifri] That is not true at all. [passage omitted]</p>

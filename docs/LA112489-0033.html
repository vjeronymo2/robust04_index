			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> A VERSION OF OLD MEXICO IN PASADENA  </P> <P> Odd. This isn't the front door. It's a door, and it's on the front, but it  doesn't open. It's a false door, apparently required by some Pasadena  historical-appearances law.  </P> <P> Let's not leap to a metaphor. Let's just go in by way of the non-historical  side door. We've got to know what's going on here, because Catavinos Cafe, a  pleasantly austere little place ornamented with Southwestern genre paintings,  is jumping with Pasadenans.  </P> <P> The word catavino means wine connoisseur or perhaps wine scrutinizer, and the  wine list is definitely a cut above the usual thing at a Mexican restaurant.  Perhaps the food is conceived to be eaten with wine.  </P> <P> Maybe. Remembering to avoid that false-door metaphor, we can certainly see that  it's an odd menu. On one hand, that nearly extinct L.A. tradition, albondigas  soup (meatballs in cumin-flavored broth), an OK ceviche, a puzzling dish of  peppers sauteed with cheese, and some simple tacos.  </P> <P> But then there are mini-chimichangas that seem to be egg rolls stuffed with  turkey. And a chicken salad with tortilla strips, suggestively named Keiko  salad, has an Oriental sesame oil dressing. The shrimp cocktail is simply  shrimp in salsa cruda, and one of our friends is rudely suggesting he could  walk down to Trader Joe's and put together the same thing out of cans.  </P> <P> There are also the oddest sort of pancakes. First, the crab and corn cakes  taste like ordinary pancakes, with scarcely a hint of crab flavor, and they  come with a sweet orange sauce. Then there are actual pancakes, tiny pancakes  with a black bean filling and the same orange sauce. That's right: pancakes,  black beans, orange sauce. The idea that this might be Mexican food for wine  lovers is starting to sound unconvincing.  </P> <P> Some of the entrees are like good Mexican home cooking. On a combination plate  you can get tamales with a generous filling of well-browned pork, or a chile  relleno that, for once, seems to have been fried to order rather than sitting  around since early evening. It's a medium-hot chile and the cheese filling is  more flavorful than most.  </P> <P> And if the carnitas are not a large portion, they are the real thing, tender  browned chunks of pork. The misleadingly named corn ravioli, on the other hand,  are actually turnovers made of corn meal and filled with chicken, but a bit of  black-bean sauce makes them perfectly enjoyable.  </P> <P> The best thing on the menu, to me, is the calamari steak, basically calamari  treated like scampi, floured and fried and served with a strong garlic and  lemon flavoring. The worst, by far, is the steak picado, tough chunks of stewed  steak with tomatoes and onions.  </P> <P> After this, there are some simple dishes like fish tacos and perhaps a special  of sauteed sea bass with garlic, chopped raw tomatoes and cilantro. A slightly  mushy roast chicken has a good flavor, but for some reason more of that orange  sauce. Maybe Pasadena has gone orange-goofy.  </P> <P> The desserts are to Pasadena's sweet tooth. A key lime cheesecake, a standard  walnut pie, a fruit chimichanga, meaning a flaky roll of fried pastry filled  with banana. And then a dessert from Mars, a lime-pistachio sorbet: lime ice,  that is, streaked with chopped pistachio. I actually liked it.  </P> <P> This is one of the oddest Mexican restaurants I've ever eaten in. Pasadena  loves it, though, as I suppose it loves that absurd front door. Uh-oh, I went  for the metaphor after all.  </P> <P>  Catavinos Cafe, 119 W. Green St., Pasadena. (818) 578-1764. Open for breakfast  Monday through Friday, for lunch and dinner seven days. Full bar. Street  parking. American Express, MasterCard and Visa accepted. Dinner for two, food  only, $23-$44.  </P> <P> </P></p>

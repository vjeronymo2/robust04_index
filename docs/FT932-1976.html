			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Rights congress split on Bosnia AGREEMENT on a final statement from the World Conference on Human Rights, being held in Vienna, was in jeopardy yesterday after an attempt led by Islamic countries to have a resolution adopted urging an end to the arms embargo on the Moslem-led government in Bosnia, AP reports from Vienna. The move has support from Austria, which borders on former Yugoslavia, and other countries outside the Islamic group, which has threatened to boycott the signing of the final document if the resolution is not approved. Austrian officials are concerned that Bosnia will be remembered as an international failure to stand up to a bully, much as the world gave in to Hitler when he took over part of Czechoslovakia before the second world war. Several western countries, including the US, sympathise with the effort to help the Bosnians, but officials in their delegations said they feared the resolution would open 'a Pandora's box' of attempts to pass resolutions for other causes. This would overwhelm the conference. Indeed, a resolution is ready which expresses 'deep concern over the continued policy of Israel of grave violations of human rights against the Palestinian people'. A draft obtained by AP calls for Israeli withdrawal from 'occupied Palestinian territories' and international protection for Palestinians there. A UN spokeswoman played down suggestions that the dispute over the Bosnian resolution could break up the conference. 'The general committee will deal with this early this week,' Ms Therese Gastaut said. 'At this time this fear doesn't exist.' But another official described the issue as 'a Damocles sword' hanging over the conference. Among the achievements of the drafting committee so far has been agreement on language reaffirming the universality of human rights, which US and other officials said stopped a Chinese-led effort that would have watered down human rights by making them dependent on cultural values. Conference organisers had hoped that the document would be finished by Wednesday so it could be approved formally before the conference adjourns on Friday.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OF SOUTHLAND COUNTIES, THOSE INLAND ARE LIKELY TO WEATHER STORM BEST  </P> <P> As the economic thumbscrews begin to turn in Southern California, some counties  will feel the pain more than others.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County will probably get the worst of it, primarily because of the  downturn in the aerospace sector, said Jack Kyser, economist for the Los  Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. And although no county will escape the  recession's wrath completely, Riverside and San Bernardino likely will fare the  best.  </P> <P> Look to Burbank and you will see contrasts that mark the current economic  health of Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> In one corner you will find Lockheed, which this year laid off nearly 2,000  workers from its Burbank-based aeronautical group. In another, Disney Studios  whistles while it works; the company has no plans to alter film production  schedules because of the looming recession.  </P> <P> The problems of Lockheed and other aerospace companies clearly will be the key  factor depressing the county's economy. Generally, the county's manufacturing  sector, which includes aerospace, has lost jobs so so far this year, according  to Kyser.  </P> <P> Overall, jobs have actually been added during 1990, thanks largely to the  service sector. But the county's unemployment rate is up as well, indicating a  mismatch between jobs and job seekers' skills.  </P> <P> The construction industry is well into a slump, with new building permit values  declining since the beginning of the year. The once-overheated real estate  market, Kyser says, "is going to slog along for a while." And tourism, another  big industry, did not enjoy a summer to brag about.  </P> <P> The good news for Los Angeles County is that some sectors continue to be  strong, including the entertainment industry, Pacific Rim trade and investment  and parts of the high-tech industry.  </P> <P> Plus, there is some hidden vigor not measured by government data.  </P> <P> "Many in the motion picture and high-tech industries are independent  contractors who aren't tracked by anyone, and you just know there there's a  major underground industry in Southern California that's hidden from us" and  operates strictly on cash, Kyser said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Orange County  </P> <P> At first glance, there is little wrong with the economy in Orange County. But  beneath the shiny veneer of low unemployment and high personal income is the  same general unease that is affecting the rest of the Southland.  </P> <P> Consumers aren't jamming the malls. Manufacturers aren't stocking up on raw  materials. The construction and auto retailing industries -- major bellwethers  of Orange County's financial direction -- are in turmoil.  </P> <P> At a recent economic outlook conference sponsored by the Orange County Chamber  of Commerce, a panel of economists predicted a national recession by year-end.  That was no surprise. But they also warned that upscale Orange County would be  hit harder than most places because of its heavy dependence on construction and  consumer spending.  </P> <P> Gene Silva, who has operated a commercial collection agency for more than two  decades, says the hit is already being taken.  </P> <P> "I'm getting accounts from people whose customers normally don't get behind,  (such as) car dealers and real estate agents," Silva said. "And when you get a  run against real estate agents, like you did in the early '80s, that's an  indication that something's wrong out there."  </P> <P> James Doti, an economist at Chapman College in Orange who analyzes the Orange  County economy, agrees that the first signs of trouble are appearing. Figures,  he says, show that builders have all but stopped undertaking new projects as  the market for housing and commercial construction dries up.  </P> <P> And although Orange County still posts the Southland's lowest jobless rate --  3.8% in September -- lines at the state Employment Development Department  offices have been lengthening.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inland Empire  </P> <P> Businesses in the Inland Empire have heard about this thing called recession.  But they haven't been formally introduced.  </P> <P> Indeed, the factors that made San Bernardino and Riverside counties among the  fastest growing in the nation in the 1980s -- cheap and plentiful land,  affordable housing and a pleasant living environment -- remain a powerful  magnet. They may well insulate the area from the harshest effects of the  economic slowdown.  </P> <P> "The concept of a recession suggests a sliding backwards, and that term is just  not appropriate for the Inland Empire for the foreseeable future," said Steve  PonTell, president of the Inland Empire Economic Council, a nonprofit  organization in Ontario. "There will be ripples and adjustments by companies,  but we're still a vibrant, growing region."  </P> <P> One recent ripple: A major materials-handling company that once was interested  in building a 250,000-square-foot plant employing 600 people shelved its plans  indefinitely earlier this month, according to David McElroy, managing director  of the Riverside County Economic Development Agency.  </P> <P> A big challenge facing the Inland Empire is creating jobs for the swarms of  people moving in to enjoy relatively cheap housing costs. An estimated 300,000  residents commute each day to jobs in Los Angeles and Orange counties, creating  not only traffic and smog problems but a heavy dependence on the rest of the  Southland.  </P> <P> "We like to think of ourselves as this independent, mature region, but we're  not quite there yet," PonTell said. Consequently, "if L.A. has a crunch, we'll  feel the repercussions of that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ventura County  </P> <P> Ventura County's diversified economy -- a busy mix of retailing, service  industries, government, agriculture and light manufacturing -- has strengths  that will help it resist a recession longer than many parts of the country,  business leaders say.  </P> <P> But the county's economy nonetheless is slowing under the weight of a sluggish  real estate market and a slumping construction industry. Other frailties show  up in the oil industry and among defense contractors.  </P> <P> The sluggishness was evident in Ventura County National Bank's semiannual  survey of county business. Three years ago, 78% of the 500 businesses surveyed  reported an increase in sales. That figure dropped to 55% for the first six  months of this year.  </P> <P> "We are slowing down because of a lack of consumer confidence," said William E.  McAleer, the bank's chairman. "But we are not seeing homes being foreclosed and  cars turn(ed) back in as you would see in a recession."  </P> <P> McAleer points to his own Oxnard-based bank as an indication of the area's  strong economic base. The Ventura County National Bank has its lowest level of  defaulted loans in years. The same holds true for the Bank of A. Levy, based in  Ventura, which has posted record earnings for the last six quarters.  </P> <P> Agriculture, one of the county's strongest industries, shows no sign of  weakening. Although city dwellers are suffering from the drought, longstanding  agreements have kept water flowing to farmers, albeit at slightly higher  prices.  </P> <P> And tourist dollars continue to bolster the economy, as Ventura and Ojai draw  increasing numbers of weekend refugees from the Los Angeles Basin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> San Diego County  </P> <P> Conventional wisdom suggests that San Diego's three-legged economy will stand  firm against all but the strongest financial winds.  </P> <P> But civic boosters acknowledge that tourism has stalled, military spending is  flat and construction levels are lagging the blistering pace set during the  late 1980s.  </P> <P> "This is a delicate period," said Dan Pegg, president of San Diego's Economic  Development Corp.  </P> <P> In its favor, San Diego has weaned itself from a near-total dependence upon  military dollars and successfully exploited its reputation as a tourist mecca  and an attractive place to live.  </P> <P> But even San Diego's diversified economy probably is not strong enough to  withstand a severe national downturn, said Rayford Boddy, an economics  professor at San Diego State University. "San Diego is looking more like  California, and California is looking more like the rest of the United States,"  he said.  </P> <P> San Diego's economic future will be determined largely by its ability to  continue attracting free-spending tourists and well-heeled newcomers who can  afford to live in one of the nation's least-affordable counties.  </P> <P> During the past year, most of the county's major attractions have reported  attendance that is flat or down. Robert Galt, president of Sea World of San  Diego, blamed disappointing attendance at his park on a "national malaise" in  travel and tourism.  </P> <P> The construction industry is balanced just as precariously.  </P> <P> Although new construction remains relatively strong compared to the rest of the  country, cracks have appeared. Housing permits have failed to keep pace with  the late 1980s, and in recent months, an estimated 9,000 construction employees  have lost jobs.  </P> <P> "People in the industry are scared," said Julie Dillon, a builder who serves as  president of the local Building Industry Assn.  </P> <P> Contributing to this report were Times staff writers John O'Dell in Orange  County, Greg Johnson in San Diego, Jenifer Warren in Riverside and Kenneth R.  Weiss in Ventura.  </P></p>

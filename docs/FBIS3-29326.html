While the income tax cut is  included, in all other aspects, there is no clear manifestation  of the Hosokawa administration's policy direction. As always,  the draft budget is a duplicate of last year's.    The present budget should have been a crucial one both from  the short-term and the mid- and long-term point of view. It  should have been designed to achieve: first, a breakaway from  the three-year-old recession, the most serious in the postwar  period, led by domestic demand; second, a transition from the  consistently producer-oriented economy since the end of World  War II to a consumer-oriented one; and third, laying the  groundwork for dealing with the aging society.    These are policy goals the Hosokawa administration has been  upholding. Yet, how come there is no trace of them in the  government's draft budget?    Aside from the income tax cut, a major increase in public  investment is important to boost the economy. While  appropriations for public works projects are indeed being  increased by 4 percent compared to the original allocation in  fiscal 1993, compared to the actual amount expended at the end  of fiscal 1993, this, in fact, represents a considerable  decrease.    For sure, finances will be in bad shape in the short-term  because of the issuance of special government bonds for the  first time in five years. However, we have pointed out time and  again that an early economic recovery will be indispensable for  resolving mid- and long-term issues.    From the lack of enthusiastic reactions from the economic  circles to the long-awaited income tax cut and the comprehensive  economic package, and the present appreciation of the yen,  another supplementary budget may become necessary fairly soon.  Moreover, since a provisional budget for more than one month is  now believed to be inevitable, it is more than clear that the  budget should have been formulated more meticulously from the  very beginning. In addition, there is the need to deal with the  ongoing rapid appreciation of the yen.    Even from the point of view of a consumer-oriented economy,  and preparing for the aging society, the draft budget is a  failure. The pattern of allocation of funds for public works,  contrary to the prime minister's campaign promises, has remained  totally unchanged. The budget is simply a result of all-out  efforts by Diet members from both the ruling coalition parties  and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] to grab  appropriations in the time-honored "zoku-giin" [Diet members  having special interests in certain policy areas] style, and  desperate efforts on the part of all ministries and agencies to  maintain their previous appropriation level. We cannot help  wondering what happened to the "end of the 1955 System [the LDP  regime]"?    In short, the Hosokawa administration's policy ideals are  not  reflected in the budget at all. To say the least, this budget  has nothing to do with the future of the Japanese economy as  envisioned by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Has the prime  minister exercised his leadership at all in the process of  drawing up the budget? The only bright spot is that the income  tax cut somehow was included. Yet, even this becomes almost  meaningless if not followed by a radical reform of the taxation  system.    These issues should be discussed thoroughly in the Diet.    At the same time, the government should start taking  concrete  steps now to effect a radical reform in the budget formulation  process for fiscal 1995 and beyond. It is impossible to grow  out of old habits in a short time.</p>

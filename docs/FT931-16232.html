			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Suharto budget makes hefty cut in fuel subsidies PRESIDENT Suharto of Indonesia yesterday unveiled a budget for 1993-94 which allowed a marginal increase in government expenditure but included the removal of Rp3,000bn (Pounds 950m) in domestic fuel oil subsidies. Mr Suharto said Indonesia, Asia's largest oil and gas exporter, should prepare for a 'fundamental change' in its economy. By the end of the century it would become a net importer of oil, he said. The scale of the fuel price increases for the home market were not specified, but donors such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank have argued for the abolition of fuel subsidies. 'The price increase in fuel oils will be followed by similar increases in electricity tariffs and transport costs,' he said. To cushion the blow for public sector employees, Mr Suharto announced a rise in civil service and Armed Forces wages of 12-18 per cent. Mr Suharto forecast state revenue in 1993-94 would grow 11.1 per cent to Rp62,322bn, more than the rate of inflation currently running at about 6 per cent a year. Higher revenue is forecast from oil exports, accounting for 29 per cent of total revenue, with a budgeted price of Dollars 18 per barrel. Income tax receipts are expected to rise 36 per cent to Rp14,848bn. Economists warn both targets may be optimistic. The budget forecasts aid from foreign donors in 1993-94 of Rp9,553bn and puts the cost of servicing the Dollars 50bn public foreign debt at Rp16,425bn. By law, government expenditure must not exceed revenue. The President Suharto announced over Rp3,000bn for road construction and power sector, education and agriculture schemes. A budget of Rp660bn was also announced for science and technology, although donors say actual funding for state-owned industries involved in aircraft, shipping, telecommunication and munitions manufacturing is much higher. Mr Suharto said the current account deficit in the fiscal year beginning in April would be Dollars 3.2bn, down from a forecast Dollars 3.8bn in fiscal 1992. He said 1992 had been a year of mixed fortunes with 'strong inflationary pressures, a substantial current account deficit and a flow of commercial offshore loans which has almost exceeded the safe limit'. On the positive side non-oil/gas exports rose by nearly 25 per cent to over Dollars 14bn in the first 10 months of last year. This had 'strengthened our confidence' in deregulation which would be expanded to other sectors such as agriculture, he said.</p>

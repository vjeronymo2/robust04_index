			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lyudmila Feliksova: "Moldova: Postelection </F> Gossip"]    [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] -- The final results of the  elections in Moldova have still not been finalized, but the time  for conflicting assessments has come. In an interview for a  WASHINGTON POST correspondent, Moldovan President Mircea Snegur  expressed satisfaction with the elections. In his opinion, they  were democratic in character. He cited foreign observers in  this assessment. Snegur called the Agrarian Democratic Party,  which polled the majority of the votes, a centrist party. Its  opponents, he believes, have no evidence to suggest that the  agrarians' success will lead to a change of political course.    As for the bloc formed by the Socialist Path and the "Unity"  movement, which came second to the Agrarians, Snegur noted that  such is the reality and that deputies of this political  orientation can conduct reforms.    The president hopes that the emergence of a parliamentary  majority will make it possible to resolve the problems of  Moldova's eastern regions. The CSCE mission under Russian  mediation will help to achieve that goal, he believes. However,  Snegur explained that he has in mind a democratic Russia headed  by President Yeltsin. If the nationalists try to encroach on  Moldova's independence and sovereignty, he noted, the country  will not be alone because it is a member of many international  organizations, which will come to its aid. The president of  Moldova firmly advocated the withdrawal of Russia's 14th Army.    In these first few days after the elections, Snegur has  stated that within a month Moldova will join NATO's "Partnership  for Peace" program, which in his opinion, offers real solutions  to avert the conflicts that threaten Europe.    The losers in the elections are less optimistic in their  assessment. For example, A. Arseni, chairman of the Democratic  Labor Party, believes that the influence of state organs was  evident during the elections and their results showed that the  voters depend to a large extent on the leadership in the local  organs. Furthermore, he believes, the population was  disoriented by the idea of reunification with Romania.    V. Puskasu, leader of the Republican Party and vice chairman  of the former parliament, said that he does not regard the  elections as a tragedy. In his opinion, it is bewildering that  the majority of electors voted for the Agrarian Democratic Party  while only 1 percent voted for the Republican Party, even though  the two parties' have similar aims and programs.    Puskasu believes it quite possible that the new parliament,  like its predecessor, will be forced to resign before its term  has expired. In view of this, the Republican Party intends to  work for the future in the belief that the new election cycle  has already begun.    But V. Cheshuyev, representative of the defeated Social  Democratic Party and director of the privatization department,  who, during the election campaign, entered into a polemic with  Premier A. Sangheli, his immediate superior, has resigned  because he considers that he cannot remain in his post any  longer.    The final results are still not available, but there has  been  another statement from the Central Electoral Commission, which  is protesting against the mass media, which are using the  preliminary figures without citing specific sources. The  Central Electoral Commission is critical of the Mayak Radio  station and Ostankino TV company in particular, but a date for  publishing the final results has still not been announced.</p>

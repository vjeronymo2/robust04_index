			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAFE FACES LOSS OF LICENSE;  </P> <P> INVESTIGATION: RESTAURANT SPLASH IN MALIBU, A TARGET OF POLICE, IS ON LOSING  END OF LIQUOR PERMIT FINDING.  </P> <P> Splash, the tony Malibu restaurant that Los Angeles police investigators  charged was an organized-crime front, should have its liquor license revoked  because of a cover-up of its true ownership, according to a proposed decision  by an administrative law judge.  </P> <P> "It is still not clear just who owns how much of the business," Administrative  Law Judge W.F. Byrnes said in a three-page proposed ruling, dated Oct. 12 and  made public Thursday by the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control.  "The only thing that is certain is that the true ownership is not as it has  been reported to the (ABC)."  </P> <P> As a result of a September hearing, Byrnes proposed that Splash's liquor  license be revoked, but that the revocation be stayed for six months to give  the restaurant's management time to sell the license to someone "acceptable" to  the ABC.  </P> <P> Such action usually means the sale of the restaurant too, said David B.  Wainstein, an ABC attorney who prosecuted Splash. Historically, he said,  revocation of a liquor license translates into a big business loss. The license  alone has a value in excess of $30,000, he added.  </P> <P> But the ABC may not be satisfied with Byrnes' proposal.  </P> <P> ABC Deputy Director Manuel Espinoza said the agency may reject the decision and  instead call for immediate revocation of Splash's liquor license when it  reviews the case later this year.  </P> <P> "It was our understanding that the evidence was far more than sufficient to  warrant outright revocation," Espinoza said in a telephone interview from  Sacramento. "We want to see if the judge's decision is consistent with the  evidence."  </P> <P> Immediate revocation of the license would reduce the restaurant's market value  and could prevent the current owners from realizing a substantial profit from  any future sale, ABC attorneys said.  </P> <P> Ronnie Lorenzo, 43, of Malibu, who has said that he owns the restaurant, has 40  days to appeal the decision. The restaurant can continue serving liquor during  the appeal.  </P> <P> Splash's attorney, Rick A. Blake, did not return a reporter's telephone calls.  Lorenzo said he would appeal any adverse ABC decision.  </P> <P> The ABC inquiry into Splash, a restaurant frequented by film and television  celebrities, was connected with a federal and local investigation into Barry  Minkow, the San Fernando Valley whiz kid whose ZZZZ Best carpet-cleaning  company made him a millionaire and a darling of Wall Street.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates charged at a July 7, 1987, news  conference that organized-crime investigators had uncovered a massive network  of narcotics trafficking and money laundering involving Minkow and others.  </P> <P> Gates called Splash one of the "fronts for laundering large organized-crime  profits from narcotic trafficking."  </P> <P> He also named Minkow and Lorenzo as "persons involved in the conspiracy."  </P> <P> Minkow was convicted in federal court last December on 57 fraud counts for  masterminding a complex securities swindle involving ZZZZ Best. Lorenzo has not  been accused of any wrongdoing.  </P> <P> The ABC alleged that Splash's real owners were Maurice Rind, 50, of Tarzana and  Richard Schulman, 55, of Encino. Gates accused them of using Splash as a  money-laundering conduit through their company, Richman Financial Services.  </P> <P> Lorenzo said Thursday that he could not understand how the ABC could say he was  not Splash's owner.  </P> <P> "I was approved by the ABC from Day 1," he said.  </P> <P> Byrnes, the administrative law judge, said in his proposed decision that "it  was not established" by the ABC that Rind and Schulman secretly controlled  Splash.  </P> <P> Rind and Schulman, according to the ABC complaint and FBI records, had criminal  convictions -- Rind for stock fraud, Schulman for a number of felonies.  </P></p>

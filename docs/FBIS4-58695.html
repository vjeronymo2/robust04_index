			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "'Ali Nasir Tells AL-HAYAH: Two </F> 'Ali's Should Go If They Fail To Solve Problems"]    [Text] Damascus -- Former Yemeni President 'Ali Nasir  Muhammad has urged President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice  President 'Ali Salim al-Bid to "leave" power "if they fail to  solve the problems." He pointed out that the solution to the  problem lies in the implementation of the Pledge and Accord  Document signed in Amman, which "stipulated the establishment of  a federation between the two parts of Yemen." He also warned of  the possible partition of Yemen into "regions, not just two  parts."    In a statement to AL-HAYAH 'Ali Nasir said that yesterday he  phoned a number of Arab leaders and Yemenis "to contain the  crisis and halt the political and military collapse taking  place, and to return to the negotiating table and dialogue,  because the alternative to dialogue is collapse and ruin." He  denied he had made direct contacts with foreign leaders. "The  contacts were made via Arab channels." However, he did not name  the Arab or foreign leaders with whom he made contacts.    He said: "I cannot say that the fighting will lead to the  collapse of unity. It is a wound in the body of national and  Yemeni unity. It will take a long time for this wound to heal."  He added: "If current developments turn into civil war, Yemen  could turn into more than one state or an entity divided into  regions." He stressed that he personally is "against infighting  and separation. There is no future for Yemen except under  unity. The leadership is the problem. Everyone is blaming unity  for the problems, when unity has nothing to do with them. They  talk in the name of the (Pledge and Accord) Document, unity, and  the revolution, but their practices have nothing to do with  these things or with democracy. Their actions are based on  their narrow personal interests."    Concerning a way out of the current crisis, the former South  Yemen president said: "I stress the need to conduct a dialogue  and merge institutions. If they (Yemeni leaders) fail to solve  the problem and extricate Yemen from the current crisis, it is  better for them to depart and safeguard their history and the  achievement they have made."    He noted that he contacted President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  the  day before yesterday evening, but he could not speak to 'Ali  Salim al-Bid because telephone lines to Aden are cut off. He  also contacted Yasin Nu'man, chairman of the Socialist Party  secretariat, and Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad, Abyan governor and member  of the Socialist Party Political Bureau, two days ago.    'Ali Nasir commended the U.S. position on the current  crisis,  saying the Americans "are for safeguarding unity and democracy.  They urge modernizing the building of the state and stability in  Yemen and the region, and I support this. If unity is in their  interests, it is in our interests too."    He stressed the need to implement the Pledge and Accord  Document. He said that "many of its stipulations still have not  been implemented, even though it enjoyed a national, Arab,  popular, and international consensus." On his opinion of the  federation question as a solution and a way out of the current  crisis, he said that the document stipulates "the establishment  of a federation. But regrettably, it has not been implemented.  Nor has the Constitution been applied or the document  implemented. Its essence should be implemented. What I am  interested in is to safeguard unity; the other things are  details."    On the possibility of his return to Yemen he said that, "if  this question is raised, I am willing to play any role to  contribute to finding a way out of the crisis, but not for the  sake of power or a post." He avoided "holding anyone  responsible. Everyone is responsible. The issue is not who  started it all, but, rather, the devastating effects we are  experiencing."</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JEWISH PROTESTERS AT AUSCHWITZ ATTACKED  </P> <P> Workers at a Roman Catholic convent on the edge of the Auschwitz concentration  camp punched, kicked and dragged out an American rabbi and six students who  occupied the grounds Friday and demanded that the nuns leave.  </P> <P> About 20 people, including uniformed and plainclothes police, watched as the  workers ripped up the demonstrators' signs and assaulted them.  </P> <P> Rabbi Avraham Weiss of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, located in the Bronx  section of New York, said members of his group suffered bruises, scrapes,  bleeding noses and lips. Their clothes were torn and they were forced to leave  the convent grounds.  </P> <P> Weiss said that the nuns watched from a window and did not try to stop the  workers. Reporters could see women inside watching, but they were not dressed  in habits and appeared not to be nuns.  </P> <P> "It's extraordinary that in Auschwitz 50 years later, something like this could  happen," said Weiss. "I demand an apology from these nuns."  </P> <P> The incident occurred five hours after the protesters climbed a 7-foot  wrought-iron fence and occupied a porch of the convent, located in a former  Nazi warehouse on the perimeter of the camp where 4 million people died from  1940 to 1945, an estimated 2.5 million of them Jews. Many of the others killed  at the camp were Christians.  </P> <P> Weiss' group called the convent a "desecration" of the Jews' memory and  protested the failure of Catholic authorities to meet a February deadline to  relocate it.  </P> <P> The group went to Krakow, about 30 miles to the east, but said they would  return Sunday.  </P> <P> "What occurred today is going to strengthen our resolve all the more now," said  Weiss. "People should understand what peaceful nonviolent protest is all about.  I cannot accept that the nuns would be looking through the window and not help  us."  </P> <P> Under a 1987 Geneva accord, signed by 18 Roman Catholic and Jewish leaders, the  cardinal was to transfer the 14 Carmelite nuns to an interfaith prayer and  education center to be built farther from the camp.  </P> <P> The controversy surrounding the convent has become more emotional since the  deadline for moving the nuns passed on Feb. 22.  </P> <P> The cloister is a few feet from the barbed wire fence and guard towers of the  death camp. The convent lawn is a former gravel pit where political prisoners  were gunned down by Nazi executioners in 1940 and 1941.  </P></p>

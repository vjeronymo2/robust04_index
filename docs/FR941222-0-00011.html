			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of comments were related to the disposal of high-level waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the use of dry cask storage technology in general, rather than to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptability of this particular cask. Examples of these comments include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _The Federal Government's failure to resolve questions about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permanent storage of nuclear waste leaves both the plant and public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with limited options: additional storage in pools, additional storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in dry casks, or plant shutdown. The Federal Government has an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligation to resolve the issue of permanent or interim storage. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be difficult to overstate the need for dispatch in doing so, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hundreds of American communities will eventually face this problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _It is not fair to the public of Ohio to link Toledo Edison Company's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attempts to continue the safe storage of its nuclear fuel with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insistence by others that the NRC shut down Davis-Besse and every other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nuclear plant in the country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Only dry storage casks that are compatible with future DOE interim or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permanent storage operation, including transportation, should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved for use under the general license and listed in 10 CFR 72.214.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These comments deal with broad policy and program issues relating to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage and disposal of high-level radioactive waste, including the DOE's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repository program and as such are beyond the scope of this rule. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is a summary of relevant information on many of these broad issues in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Group G. Many comments were directed at the Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;24P with only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a few comments being specific to the Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;52B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters discussed topics that were not the subject of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking and thus were not specifically addressed by the NRC staff as a part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this final rule action. These comments express opposition to the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dry cask storage and included the following suggestions and topics:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Nuclear plants generating radioactive waste should be shut down.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The production of radioactive waste should be stopped when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing spent fuel pool (and off-load-reactor capacity) is full.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A formal hearing should be required at each site using dry storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> casks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The Davis-Besse plant should be shut down.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The use of nuclear power should be stopped and existing sites  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleaned up.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Palisades experienced problems in using the VSC&hyph;24 cask.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Alternative forms of power should be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, many commenters expressed concern over the ability of dry cask  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage designs, presumably including the Standardized NUHOMS, to store spent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel safely. The following responses to these comments reflect a small but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important portion of the NRC's review of health, safety, and environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aspects of the Standardized NUHOMS to ensure that the cask is designed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide protection of the public health and safety and environment under both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> normal conditions and severe, unlikely but credible, accident conditions. Dry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cask storage systems are massive devices, designed and analyzed to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shielding from direct exposure to radiation, to confine the spent fuel in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safe storage condition, and to prevent releases of radiation to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment. They are designed to perform these tasks by relying on passive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heat removal and confinement systems without moving parts and with minimal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reliance on human intervention to safely fulfill their function for the term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of storage. The NRC staff has concluded that the methods of analysis are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservative and assure that the design has appropriate margins of safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under both normal and accident conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

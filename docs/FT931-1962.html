			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Murdoch considers NY Post bid MR RUPERT MURDOCH, chairman of News Corporation, is considering the possibility of entering the battle to determine the future of The New York Post, the troubled tabloid newspaper he once owned. The newspaper has been traumatised over the past 10 days by the arrival of Mr Abe Hirschfeld, an eccentric New York car parks magnate who has sacked and re-hired a number of staff, including Mr Pete Hamill, the paper's editor. Last week, a New York bankruptcy court approved Mr Hirschfeld's plan to take control of the paper, even though a rival bid is being offered by Mr Steven Hoffenberg, a debt collector who is being sued for fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Mr Murdoch, who was forced to sell the paper in 1988 as a result of federal legislation, is understood to be watching developments at The Post very closely. He has put senior executives on standby in case he becomes actively involved in a formal rescue of the newspaper. Given the unprecedented venom being directed at Mr Hirschfeld by the paper's editorial staff - a headline last week about Mr Hirschfeld read 'Who is this Nut?' - the future of the newspaper is by no means certain. Mr Murdoch could only intervene if the paper were in danger of foundering once again. He would need a government waiver allowing him to own both The Post and his local Fox television station in New York. The 73-year-old Mr Hirschfeld, when informed of Mr Murdoch's possible interest, said: 'Every Tom, Dick and Harry wants to get on the news because of me, Mr Hirschfeld. There are homeless people who want to buy The Post. 'If Mr Rupert Murdoch wants to come to me I would be happy to talk to him,' he added. Although Mr Murdoch's US interests are predominantly in film and television, he has told friends there are times when it is 'difficult to resist the temptation' of buying newspapers when the right opportunity presents itself. Mr Hirschfeld, meanwhile, yesterday barred four senior New York Post staffers from entering the building. The four were among 20 employees who were sacked last week.</p>

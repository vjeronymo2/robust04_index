			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: FIDs given guarded welcome - Advance corporation tax The chancellor is pressing ahead with the foreign income dividend scheme (FIDs) outlined in the March Budget, designed to help companies save surplus advance corporation tax (ACT). But he surprised some by allowing the continuance of enhanced scrip dividends, a device where companies pay dividends in shares rather than cash thereby avoiding paying ACT in the first place. Companies could continue to use enhanced scrip dividends rather than opt for FIDs. The new FID scheme will take effect for dividends paid on or after July 1, 1994. Companies gave a guarded welcome to the scheme, saying it was a step in the right direction, but still contained imperfections. They intend to keep up the pressure for more to be done to reduce the surplus ACT mountain. Surplus ACT has become a sizeable problem, with the Inland Revenue estimating it now totals Pounds 5.5bn and is rising by Pounds 700m a year. Companies complain that this is in effect an interest-free loan to the government. Companies pay ACT on their dividends, and later offset it against their mainstream corporation tax bill. But if their tax liability is insufficient to offset the ACT paid, the surplus ACT remains in the hands of the exchequer. The FID scheme will help companies which earn a high proportion of profits overseas, which do not create a large enough UK corporation tax liability. In March, the Inland Revenue issued a consultative document about the scheme. Some changes have been made following representations. Under the scheme, companies can opt to pay a FID out of foreign source profits. Originally companies were required to match the dividend in an accounting period to the foreign profit in the same or immediately succeeding accounting period. That has now been changed to include the current and previous year, and, if those provide insufficient foreign profits, subsequent years. Although grateful for this change, companies yesterday pointed out that this would still not allow them to use up the backlog of surplus ACT. Many companies had suggested they should be allowed to 'stream' dividends, directing FIDs - which do not carry a tax credit for tax-exempt investors - towards tax-paying shareholders while continuing to pay normal dividends to tax-free investors such as pension funds. This has not been allowed. Tax-free investors, which often make up a sizeable part of a company's shareholder register, face losing 20 per cent of their dividend income if they receive FIDs, because of the absence of a tax credit, and may put pressure on companies to increase the dividend to offset that loss. The scheme has also been slightly loosened with regard to international headquarter companies, in an effort to increase the attractiveness of the UK as a base for companies, for instance the European headquarters of a US multinational. These will not have to pay ACT on dividends at all, if they have no more than 20 shareholders, and at least 80 per cent of the shares are held outside the UK. The Inland Revenue estimates it will gain Pounds 30m from the FID scheme in 1994-95, as the reductions in tax credits paid come before any repayment of ACT; it will break even in the following year; and the scheme will cost Pounds 100m in 1996-97, with the figure rising thereafter. The earlier estimate of a Pounds 200m-cost a year has been reduced as corporate profitability is expected to rise, so reducing surplus ACT.</p>

The head of  state later received the International Monitoring Committee on  the Ouagadougou Accords led by its chairman, Herman Yameogo. He  spoke to newsmen after the meeting.    [Begin Yameogo recording] Some time ago, the opposition  issued a number of demands, and the one that kept coming up  again and again was the election problem. We were able to  settle quite a number of these issues thanks to the goodwill  shown by both the presidential group and the opposition. The  only issue left was the election problem. The International  Monitoring Committee held a meeting with the head of state  today, and the solution we came up with was to initiate  preliminary reconciliation at the National Electoral Commission  level to try and solve the differences that might arise after  the election. If no solution is found after that, the matter  will then be transferred to the Supreme Court, in line with  established laws.    We also wish to stress that these measures are valid only  for  the parliamentary elections, they do not affect past or future  elections. That is essentially what we decided upon. We have  noticed that both sides have shown goodwill. The International  Monitoring Committee is always at their disposal to assist them  in finding solutions any time there are problems. We would like  to call on everyone to help in making things go smoothly so that  there will be peace and we can move toward a suitable solution  for Togo. Thank you. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: LPGA IS HOPING OC TURNS OUT OK  </P> <P> It's official: Orange County is now the proud owner of the initial-heavy LPGA  NTA/MBS Classic, which has an ETA of Sept. 21 at LCCC, a first tee-off time of  8 a.m. (PST), a Pro-Am that might feature a CEO or two and a field that likely  will include M.J. Smith.  </P> <P> Alphabet lessons aside, this means the Ladies Professional Golf Assn. Nippon  Travel Agency/Mainichi Broadcasting System Classic (a moment, please, to catch  my breath) begins Sept. 21 at Los Coyotes Country Club. It also means that if  you're a golf fan, you applaud the news. The tournament name (the worst title  since the Jamie Farr Toledo Classic), however, will take some getting used to.  </P> <P> The LPGA has wanted -- needed -- a tournament in Orange County ever since the  dearly departed Uniden Invitational died a hero's death at Mesa Verde Country  Club in 1986. Think about the possibilities: populous area, lots of golfers,  agreeable weather, major market, growing market. And no tournament . . . until  now.  </P> <P> After a two-year absence, the LPGA returns, apparently wiser and more organized  than during its stay at Mesa Verde. To hear new commissioner William Blue tell  it, the LPGA intends on making The LPGA NTA, etc. Classic an annual affair, a  tournament that will stand the test of time and rocky starts.  </P> <P> How serious is Blue? Well, serious enough to endure a strange, almost comical  news conference this week that featured two interpreters, Zsa Zsa Gabor jokes,  Japanese television crews and one reporter who kept asking if the tournament  would run 54 or 72 holes (for the final time -- 72!). When it was over, the  LPGA got what it wanted (two rich sponsors), the sponsors got what they wanted  (exposure) and Orange County got what it deserved (a tournament).  </P> <P> This was some scene, this news conference. Japanese dignitaries outnumbered  local reporters. Japanese television crews and reporters outnumbered local  reporters. Long, monotonic speeches by several of the sponsor representatives  somehow became two-sentence utterances, all courtesy of the interpreters. And  every few minutes, you could count on a certain person to ask if the Classic  was a 54-hole event.  </P> <P> But the most interesting part of the proceedings was Blue's impromptu speech.  Turns out it was a mini-State of the LPGA Address. Lucky for you, I was able to  understand most of what the interpreter was telling the assembled Japanese  sponsors and Japanese media about Blue's oration.  </P> <P> Here goes:  </P> <P> Blue: "Trying to talk more and give better superlatives about Orange County and  golf makes me feel like Zsa Zsa Gabor's fifth husband on their wedding night. I  know what's expected of me -- I'd just like to make it interesting."  </P> <P> Interpreter (in Japanese): "Distinguished corporate members of NTA and MBS, as  well as Far East media: That was such a bad joke, I will not waste your time  retelling it. Let's hope this guy can run the LPGA better than he can give a  speech. Thank you."  </P> <P> Blue: "One month ago, I had the pleasure of visiting Japan . . . to announce a  multiyear, multimillion dollar program that will provide both live and  rebroadcast of LPGA events in Japan. We are very pleased to welcome the Nippon  Travel Group to our LPGA family and we thank them very much for their interest.  We know it will be a very long and profitable relationship."  </P> <P> Interpreter: "Mr. Funny says thanks for bankrolling another LPGA event. He says  you'll turn a profit on your investment. Of course, didn't the LPGA tell the  Uniden event the same thing?"  </P> <P> Blue: "We recognize the enthusiasm and the potential of Orange County -- not  just for the next two or three years -- but in the 1990s, leading to the 21st  century. The growth of amateur women, especially in Orange County, says that  there is a wonderful long-term opportunity for the LPGA."  </P> <P> Interpreter: "He says that Orange County women are large. Wait -- that's not  right. He says that the number of women amateur golfers in Orange County is  growing and because of that, he likes your chances for a successful tournament  this year and for years to come. At about $600,000 a pop to sponsor a  tournament, he'd better be right."  </P> <P> Blue: "The relationships of the community, LPGA, country club, charities, all  form a perfect combination to bring great golf, great contributions and  community involvement that we feel is healthy, necessary and very important for  the future of golf."  </P> <P> Interpreter: "He said -- I have no idea what he just said. What I'll do is talk  a little longer so he'll think I'm telling you what he just said. Actually, I  think the Zsa Zsa Gabor joke made more sense than what he just said."  </P> <P> Blue: "Therefore, in summary, I am very pleased with the addition of Orange  County, not only for 1989, but for many, many years to come as one of the  foundation tournaments for the future of the LPGA."  </P> <P> Interpreter: "He says Orange County is a great place to have a tournament. But  what I really think he's saying is that he needs some deep-pocketed sponsors,  like you fellas, to foot the tab."  </P> <P> Blue: "And positioned in the lovely fall season, and the second tournament  before the end of our official money program, the field that the LPGA will  deliver will be one of the best of the year."  </P> <P> Interpreter: "He says he'll deliver the goods as long as you keep writing the  checks. If you ask my opinion, it sounds like a pretty good deal for everyone:  NTA, MBS, the LPGA and Orange County. Just work on shortening the name of this  thing and you might have something. Thank you."  </P></p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Palestinians set out plan THE Palestinians yesterday submitted to Israel and the US what it described as a comprehensive and detailed plan for an interim self-governing authority on the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman, said it was an historic document of great significance: 'If the Israelis reject this then they will be rejecting the whole basis of the peace process.' The proposals which provide for elections to a Palestinian authority that would take broad responsibility for for governing the occupied territories are certain to be turned down by Israel. The outline of the plan was put forward by the Palestinian delegation in January. Israel complained then that it opened the door to a Palestinian state, something which it has always opposed. Mrs Ashrawi added yesterday that she hoped for an initial Israeli response to the 16-page detailed plan at today's negotiating session which is scheduled to be the final meeting of the present series.</p>

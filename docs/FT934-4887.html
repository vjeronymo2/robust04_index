			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Maastrichtrebel urges EU overhaul Mr Philippe Seguin, president of the French national assembly, last night called for radical changes in the European Union to widen its membership to Russia, to create a European Security Council, and to relaunch the European economy with interest rate cuts and massive public borrowing. Mr Seguin, who led the French anti-Maastricht campaign, shares much of the Euroscepticism prevalent in London. But, in his speech last night to a Paris university audience, he pushed the thesis of a wider-rather-than-deeper European integration further than any British conservative minister would dare or probably want. He called for the EU to consolidate peace in Europe by extending membership to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Capping his 'Grand Europe' vision would be a European Security Council, modelled on the UN with four or five main European powers able to send peace-keeping forces throughout the continent. He proposed a downgrading in most EU institutions, with the Commission losing its right to make proposals and the European Parliament confined to ratifying legislation elaborated by national parliaments.</p>

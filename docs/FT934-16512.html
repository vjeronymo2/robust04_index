			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Poor basic skills 'cost Pounds 10.2bn each year' POOR BASIC skills, part-icularly illiteracy, are costing the UK Pounds 10.2bn each year, according to a report by management consultants Ernst &amp; Young. The report says industry could save up to Pounds 8.4bn if basic skills were improved. Ernst &amp; Young's estimates are based on a Gallup poll of 400 large companies conducted earlier this year for the Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit and grossed up to take account of companies of all sizes. The total annual cost of rectifying customer orders despatched incorrectly estimated at Pounds 4.3bn, while the cost of cancelled orders was put at Pounds 1.6bn and the cost of customers lost through errors Pounds 1.5bn. Poor basic skills also affect recruitment. According to Ernst &amp; Young, companies could save Pounds 300m a year by shedding staff if basic skills were better, while the cost of recruiting employees whose problems with literacy and numeracy limit their chances of promotion is estimated at Pounds 600m. Ernst &amp; Young say areas of savings for the public purse would include the penal system, because 45 per cent of those under 30 in prison have no educational qualifications, more than double the figure for the population as a whole. Mr David Rees, of Ernst &amp; Young, added that the lack of skilled staff in the UK was a 'major concern of potential investors'.</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Foreign Affairs: Bosnia's tragic example - Security arrangements in Europe underpin renewed international interest in Yugoslavia's civil war You might think, from public statements made in the past two days by American and European statesmen, that their top priority was doing something effective to halt the fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Speaking in Lisbon on Sunday, Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, was eloquent on the subject: 'There are 35,000 diabetics now who have no insulin. There are 6,000 women and babies who have no medicine, baby formula or milk . . . Anyone who is looking for a reason not to act, or arguing somehow that action in the face of this kind of nightmare is not warranted at this time . . . is on the wrong wavelength.' This from a man who stalwartly refused to contemplate any kind of sanctions against Iraq before August 2 1990, in spite of evidence that Saddam Hussein was guilty of chemical warfare and other gross violations of human rights; a man famous for staying all of seven minutes in south-eastern Turkey in April 1991, when it was flooded with Kurdish refugees. By Monday, Mr John Major had taken up the theme, calling on the EC to take measures against Serbia well beyond a token protest. Meanwhile, the Portuguese foreign minister had promised that the EC would 'not allow those responsible for the bloodshed to go unpunished', and Mr Klaus Kinkel, the new German foreign minister, dotted the i: 'It must be said clearly who is responsible. The Serbians are responsible.' No doubt that is true. Reporters on the spot are certain that Serbian militias in Bosnia are working in tight collusion both with Serbia itself and with the Yugoslav army, to achieve exclusive Serb control of about two-thirds of the republic's territory and expel the other ethnic communities. 'Ethnic cleansing' is the euphemism for this procedure, which has been applied also in the Serb-controlled areas of Croatia, and to a smaller extent by the Croats in areas that they control. But of course it was not invented by either Serbs or Croats. The Armenians are doing the same in Nagorno-Karabakh. The Turks did it in northern Cyprus. The Israelis did it in parts of Palestine in 1948, and again on a smaller scale in 1967. The Czechs did it in the Sudetenland, the Poles in Silesia, Pomerania and East Prussia, after 1945. Greeks and Turks did it to each other in 1922-3. Ever since ethnicity began to be invoked as a basis of statehood, people trying to build or preserve states in disputed areas have been tempted, as a last resort, to clear those areas by force of people whose ethnic identity renders their loyalty suspect. Mr Baker and his European 'allies' are right to be horrified, but it is doubtful whether any of them really believe they can stop it. 'We are really talking about the need - maybe - to do something next time,' says an unnamed US official quoted in the international press. 'Everyone in the loop concedes that Yugoslavia is a past case already.' It is an unworthy thought, but difficult to resist once it has occurred to you, that the argument is not really about what should be done in the former Yugoslavia but about future security arrangements in Europe. It was perhaps no coincidence that this heightened awareness of the horrors of war in Yugoslavia hit the headlines on the very day that France and Germany agreed to push ahead with their proposal for a 35,000-man joint army corps, intended to be the nucleus of a future European army. It was last Friday, remember, that President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl made their announcement in La Rochelle, and it was that very night that Mr Baker, after conferring with Mr Major, suddenly called on 'the civilised world' to start thinking about political, diplomatic and economic action against Serbia, and then added: 'If measures in those fields should fail, then and only then it would be my view to take a look at questions involving military matters.' The beauty of this formulation is that it raises the possibility of military action only when other measures have been tried and failed. By then, of course, the Serbs would have more or less completed their 'ethnic cleansing', and might even value the arrival of a 'peacekeeping force' which would make it more difficult for armed Croats or Moslems to infiltrate the 'cleansed' area. The Turks have found a UN force very useful for that purpose in Cyprus, and it was clearly in that spirit that the Serbs agreed to have one in Croatia - although they are now in trouble with the UN for trying to finish off the 'cleansing' operation after the UN troops arrived. To be really cynical, one could argue that the prevention of ethnic cleansing is a task unachievable by any military intervention short of a full-scale occupation and administration, but that ethnic cleansing itself is a useful, perhaps even essential, precondition for a successful 'peacekeeping' operation, which classically involves the interposition of a neutral force along a clear line of demarcation between two sides. Now think back to last summer, when the fighting in Yugoslavia started. Victory in the Gulf War had reasserted the US's military supremacy and indispensability, but the Europeans, aided by US public opinion, had bounced President Bush into intervening in Kurdistan, from which he was trying to extricate his troops as fast as possible. Meanwhile the Europeans were wrangling among themselves and with their Nato allies about the institutional framework for closer European defence cooperation: should it come under Nato or should it be an aspect of the new European Union? In other words, should America have a say in it or not? Yugoslavia was no longer a stake in the cold war, and the US concluded it was an area of limited strategic interest, where involvement carried significant risks but offered few worthwhile benefits. The Europeans were proclaiming a new 'common foreign and security policy'. Let them try their luck. The Europeans tried, with the results we now see. Meanwhile a compromise was reached, at the Nato summit in Rome last November and then at Maastricht in December, on European defence: it would be done through the Western European Union (WEU), which was to be both 'an integral part of the development of the European Union', and 'a means to strengthen the European pillar of the Atlantic Alliance' - the latter remaining 'the essential forum for consultation among its members'. Although the French and German governments insist that their joint corps, which other WEU members are invited to join, will 'contribute to the reinforcement of the Atlantic alliance,' it is clearly regarded by the US, and by the British and Dutch, as a breach of the spirit of last year's compromise. That is why it is such a good moment for the US to rub Europe's nose in the reality of its political incompetence and military irrelevance, by drawing attention to a crisis it has conspicuously failed to solve, and by hinting at a military intervention which, without Nato's help, it would be quite unable to organize. Yet I wonder if it is a wise thing to do. When Europeans have had time to think about it, they may decide to take the task of building a force which would be less dependent on the US more seriously.</p>

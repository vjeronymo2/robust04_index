			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READYING FOR FEST OPENING;  </P> <P> L.A. FESTIVAL: NEW BUS LINES, PARK-AND-RIDE FACILITIES ARE PLANNED TO HANDLE  100,000 PEOPLE OVER THREE DAYS.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Festival and Dept. of Transportation officials are planning  park-and-ride facilities, shuttles and buses to handle the more than 100,000  people predicted to flock to San Pedro's Point Fermin/Angel's Gate Park this  weekend over three days of opening activities for the $5-million, 230-event  gala.  </P> <P> To handle the crowds, the Dept. of Transportation is pumping more than $60,000  into the park-and-ride sites; and more than 175 signs, 40 Explorer Scouts, 25  traffic officers and 10 Transportation Dept. engineers will direct drivers.  </P> <P> Police and residents of the district are concerned that the area -- which has  only two access roads and severe parking problems as it is -- won't be able to  handle the influx.  </P> <P> "I don't know how they'll squeeze that many people in there. It's going to be a  madhouse to say the least," said Jeff Hamilton, LAPD's senior lead officer for  the Angel's Gate area. "I don't understand where they're going to park those  cars. These neighborhoods are going to be inundated."  </P> <P> "Where they're going to put that many people is beyond me," said Joseph  Drabinski, a park ranger who regularly patrols the area. "The Fourth of July  was the most crowded we've ever had -- and there was, I'd say, 350 people in  the area. And they were triple-parked then."  </P> <P> But festival officials said they will be ready. Drivers entering the area will  be directed to three park-and-ride sites -- one at White Point Park (where the  city is grading about 15 acres to create room for 2,000 vehicles), and the  others four miles away at Terminal Island's Berth 87 and Todd Shipyard. Between  them, nearly 8,000 vehicles can be parked at one time, according to festival  consultant Warren Christensen.  </P> <P> "The flow of traffic down Gaffey Street (the main road into Angel's Gate) is  really going to be directed toward the park-and-ride lots," said Christensen,  noting that only residents, handicap-permitted vehicles and those with special  festival passes would be allowed into the Angel's Gate area. When exiting off  the Harbor Freeway, all vehicles will go through two checkpoints leading them  to the Terminal Island sites. Those that continue past those points will be  directed from Gaffey onto westbound 25th Street toward the White Point Park  park-and-ride area.  </P> <P> But despite 16 RTD buses scheduled to shuttle festivalgoers to performance  sites every three minutes, Hamilton doubted the festival could accommodate  8,000 cars. He said the Terminal Island spots are normally taken up by vehicles  parked for weekend cruise ships.  </P> <P> Hamilton expects drivers will still attempt to park in the beach lots and  residential neighborhoods -- which, he said, are jam-packed by 9 a.m. on normal  holiday weekends -- closer to the venue.  </P> <P> That expectation has left some area residents worried.  </P> <P> "The neighbors here are very concerned about this," said Irene Goldstone, who  heads the Point Fermin Residents Festival Committee and chairs the San Pedro  Neighborhood Committee, both of which were formed in response to the event.  </P> <P> "We're concerned about parking and traffic, we're concerned what people will do  for restroom facilities, we're concerned about vandalism . . . and we're  concerned about emergency response teams being able to get to us if we need  them," said Goldstone. In June she circulated an unsuccessful petition --  signed by 25 area homeowners -- to have the event moved.  </P> <P> "The program they're putting on is marvelous," she said. "But why have it here,  where there's no access and no parking? To sacrifice the whole neighborhood for  one event isn't worth it."  </P> <P> Goldstone said residents are dreading a repeat of problems encountered during  the 1986 L.A. Beach Scene. That event, featuring two days of rock concerts at  nearby Cabrillo Beach, drew 200,000 people and scores of complaints from angry  neighbors who said attendees urinated on their lawns, threw beer bottles on the  street, vandalized the area and caused traffic to back up for miles.  </P> <P> Hamilton said, however, that police expected no such problems at the L.A.  Festival because alcohol will not be sold and the arts crowd is not expected to  be "of the type that will cause problems."  </P> <P> Still, the Harbor Division police are planning "maximum deployment" for a  holiday weekend in the area -- nine patrol cars and 10 additional officers. At  least two park rangers and a few reserve officers will also be on hand.  </P> <P> While some doubt that the opening events of the festival, which has suffered  from low public awareness, will bring a large crowd, Christensen said his  estimate of 33,000 per day is based on his experience with more than 40 arts  festivals in Los Angeles. He added that he expects every festival staff member  and volunteer to bring about 10 friends -- thus accounting for a readymade  crowd of 20,000 to 30,000 attendees in addition to those who learned of the  festival through ads, newspaper accounts and word of mouth.  </P> <P> A total of 40 artist groups are scheduled to perform during the three-day  opening weekend on six stages constructed throughout the 33-acre Point Fermin  Park, the 110-acre Angel's Gate Park and the 15-acre Wilder Park. Connecting  the three will be a Festival Village with 50 vendor booths.  </P> <P> Information: (800) LA-RIDE.  </P></p>

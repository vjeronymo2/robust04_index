			<p>BFN     [Text] The statement made yesterday by the UN Protection  Forces [UNPROFOR] commander [General Rose] that the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army did not have the strength to retake the  lost territories met with widespread, mostly negative,  reactions. That is why we were informed by the Office of the  President of the Presidency that during last night's talks [with  General Rose], President Izetbegovic asked General Michael Rose  to explain his statement.    The British general supplemented his earlier remark by  saying  that he had also told the Serbs they could not win under any  conditions. Their infantry is irreparably wounded, said General  Rose, and in the long run, they would [word indistinct] lose the  war in Bosnia. The UNPROFOR commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina  believes that, at the moment, the Serbs cannot defeat the  Bosniaks, while the Bosniaks do not have the strength to expel  the occupiers. A firm stalemate has been created in Bosnia,  which, according to General Rose, is forcing both sides to look  for a compromise to end the conflict. This is stated in the  communique issued by the Office of the President of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency.</p>

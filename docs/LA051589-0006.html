			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A British-backed consortium is planning to build the largest toxic waste plant  in the world in Morocco's section of the Sahara, the Guardian newspaper  reported. The British newspaper said the consortium's plan is to export 2,000  tons of toxic waste a day to Morocco from Europe and North America and burn it  to produce electricity. This plan has been presented to King Hassan, Morocco's  ruler, as a way of bringing industrialization to his country. However, the  newspaper said, only waste oil products were mentioned in the plan presented to  Hassan. The newspaper said a copy of the plan was passed on to it because of  fears the operation will not be properly controlled.  </P></p>

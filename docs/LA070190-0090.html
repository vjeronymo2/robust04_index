			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BALANCING THE 'FAST-FORWARD CHILD'  </P> <P> I'm glad The Times is allowing mental health professionals to express  themselves in Commentary. Amy Stark's piece ("Bringing Balance Into the Life of  Your 'Fast-Forward' Child" June 24) describes a problem that drives many  children over the edge and into drugs and premature death.  </P> <P> Typical, however, of the traditional mental health community, Stark limits her  scope to the personal and interpersonal aspects of this problem, touches only  briefly on the social aspect and ignores altogether the socioeconomic and  geopolitical aspects that create the "fast-forward" adult.  </P> <P> Children learn from and are overpowered by the behavior of their parents and  authorities. Stark asks us to make our children slow down and smell the roses,  but she doesn't tell us that they can't unless we adults begin to do the same  in our own lives. We may tell our children one thing, but our hypocritical  behavior speaks so loudly our kids can't hear a word we say.  </P> <P> CHIP STINNETT  </P> <P> Fountain Valley  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> TV'S 'NEW' REVIEWS OF MACDONALD;  </P> <P> THE CELEBRATED 'FATAL VISION' MURDER CASE IS REHASHED BY ABC AND NBC. HARVARD  LAW PROFESSOR ALAN DERSHOWITZ HAS MUCH TO DO WITH THE RENEWAL OF INTEREST.  </P> <P> The case of Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald continues to exert a tenacious hold on the  American media, particularly television. When Barbara Walters observed recently  on ABC's "20/20" that the Green Beret, convicted of the 1970 bludgeoning deaths  of his pregnant wife and two small children, "has fascinated us for years and  years," she was not exaggerating.  </P> <P> MacDonald, a former Huntington Beach resident now serving three consecutive  life sentences at Terminal Island federal penitentiary, was the subject of  another report -- this one on NBC's Nightly News -- earlier the same night, as  well as a localized rehash of the lengthy "20/20" report on KABC later. The  case was profiled on CBS's "60 Minutes," on a syndicated documentary and in a  top-rated and rebroadcast NBC miniseries based on Joe McGinniss' bestseller,  "Fatal Vision."  </P> <P> An independent production company, Paragon, has announced plans for yet another  miniseries, this one to raise questions about MacDonald's guilt, using some of  the same material presented by "20/20" and NBC.  </P> <P> A motion for a new trial was filed in North Carolina on the day of the ABC and  NBC reports, citing notes from a federal investigator that synthetic blond  hairs were found at the murder scene in Ft. Bragg, N.C., information that the  defense says was not made available at the trial.  </P> <P> But what is really "new" about the MacDonald case is not the evidence. Much of  what this is about, I suspect, is a recent entry from yet another medium.  Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, riding a crest of celluloid celebrity  resulting from his portrayal in "Reversal of Fortune," is now representing  MacDonald.  </P> <P> Defending another haughty, arrogant husband, this one convicted of killing his  wife, may seem like a tempting challenge after his success with Claus von  Bulow. With his customary hyperbole, Dershowitz said on the ABC report that  MacDonald may be "one of the most victimized men in American legal history."  </P> <P> Alan Dershowitz is a very good lawyer and "Reversal of Fortune" is a very good  movie, albeit one that borders on hagiography. But don't count on any reversal  -- in court or on the screen -- in this case.  </P> <P> The McGinniss book, written with MacDonald's cooperation, led to an infamous,  on-camera juxtaposition on "60 Minutes," wherein a stunned MacDonald first  learned of McGinniss' conclusion: that he was guilty of killing his family,  most likely as a result of a sleep-deprived, drug-induced psychotic episode.  </P> <P> Highly publicized civil litigation followed in Los Angeles between the two men  -- settled out of court -- which in turn led to a series of articles in the New  Yorker magazine by Janet Malcolm. Malcolm, who is involved in unrelated  litigation regarding her own reporting, spun the denunciation of McGinniss into  a blanket indictment of the journalistic profession, alleging that McGinniss  seduced and abandoned MacDonald, whom she described favorably. McGinniss  replied to Malcolm's series in an epilogue to a new edition of "Fatal Vision"  and in a cover story in the Columbia Journalism Review.  </P> <P> I've been following and covering the MacDonald case for nearly 20 years. I  lived in North Carolina at the time of the killings and covered the 1979 murder  trial in Raleigh -- and subsequent appeals -- for publications including the  New York Times and the Boston Globe. A curious thing I have noticed is the  difference in coastal perspectives: In general, people on the East Coast seem  to have accepted the jury's findings, while many on the West Coast have not.  </P> <P> Reporters in the West first came to know MacDonald in his pre-conviction  incarnation as a charming, dedicated emergency room surgeon at St. Mary Medical  Center in Long Beach and friend of local police in Huntington Beach, where he  moved to a waterside condo after the Army initially decided not to try him. The  reason it may have been so difficult for them to accept Jeffrey MacDonald as a  killer is simple: He is a handsome, white, middle-class doctor and Princeton  graduate, not the sort of person we customarily associate with homicide.  </P> <P> It was during this period that McGinniss, an Easterner working as a guest  columnist for the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, met MacDonald and came to  question his guilt. This doubt, voiced in a column, led to a meeting with  MacDonald and the book deal.  </P> <P> In his opening remarks to the jury, Assistant U.S. Atty. James Blackburn  addressed the difficult point of reconciling the image of Jeffrey MacDonald,  and his otherwise-clean record, with the horrific act he was accused of  committing, a dilemma that reverberates today.  </P> <P> Subsequently, though, under cross-examination, those in the courtroom saw a  very different Jeffrey MacDonald, a cold, sinister, almost menacing presence.  What became clear during the courtroom questioning was that he was a braggart,  a liar and a womanizer, a classic Nietzschean tough guy. None of these is an  indictable offense, certainly, but they did provide the jury with insight into  MacDonald's character and credibility.  </P> <P> This was difficult to report in a daily newspaper -- because some of it is  subjective observation and the rest appeared in bits and pieces of testimony --  and almost impossible to convey on television at the time. The single exception  was Gary Cole's chilling portrayal of the doctor in "Fatal Vision."  </P> <P> MacDonald, who still offers a telegenic presence and continues to cut a  sympathetic figure, shrewdly zeroed in on the miniseries (and the novelistic  but well-documented book) as his greatest enemy. "I am not that monster" on the  screen, he told "20/20" correspondent Stone Phillips. "I can never overcome  'Fatal Vision.' "  </P> <P> But maybe he can. MacDonald's accusers and prosecutors decided not to help  retry the case on television for NBC and ABC and refused to appear, leaving him  pretty much of a clear field. For those of you who came in late and are left  wondering by these new reports, however, let me offer some perspective.  </P> <P> The material presented last week, purporting to offer "new evidence" favorable  to MacDonald, was very little of the sort. Both broadcasts focused on the  testimony of a now-dead witness who had confessed, altered and retracted  versions of her involvement before the trial.  </P> <P> After listening to her testimony with the jury out of the room, U.S. District  Judge Franklin Dupree found that since no evidence connected her with the  murder scene, the jury would not hear what she had to say. But it was clear to  most in the courtroom that she was so addled by drugs and inconsistent that she  was barely coherent, much less credible -- something not at all clear from the  edited interviews aired on the two networks. Most of the other living witnesses  featured on the television reports testified during the trial, and the jury was  evidently not persuaded.  </P> <P> The jury, the trial judge and appellate judges who sifted through the  overwhelming mass of physical evidence knew what they were doing when they  found Jeffrey MacDonald guilty of murder. And if they were right, he is also  guilty of concocting a story that pandered to prejudices rampant in North  Carolina. At the time of the slayings, MacDonald was a clean-cut, gung-ho young  soldier who strongly supported the Vietnam War. Ever the law-and-order  advocate, he cynically alleged that the brutal killings were the work of a  drug-using, longhaired, multiracial band -- touching all the hot buttons. As a  result, in the days after the killings, many crash pads and "hippie houses"  around the state were rousted by law enforcement officials.  </P> <P> Despite Dershowitz's protests about "Reversal of Fortune," that he is not a  "hired gun" -- and his ongoing concern with two poor, black clients on Death  Row -- that is essentially what he is. With Jeffrey MacDonald, he is faced with  a situation similar to that of Claus von Bulow, and he must take the same  approach he outlines to his skeptical law students in the film. That is, in  order to safeguard his image as a defender of civil liberties, he not only  needs to prove some technical or procedural flaws to an appellate court, he  must demonstrate to the public at large -- now convinced that his client is  guilty -- that his client is innocent.  </P> <P> Even as skilled and convincing an advocate (and as tireless a self-promoter) as  Dershowitz will have a tough time with MacDonald on this score.  </P></p>

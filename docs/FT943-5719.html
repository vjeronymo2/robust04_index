			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Weakness of European defence industry Sir, Lex is right to argue that the consolidation of the US defence industry sets a challenge to Europe's defence industry ('Allied forces', August 31). Yet this trend has been ongoing for a number of years, and the European defence industry's reply has been less than wholehearted. The fact is that it remains hopelessly fragmented, largely for political reasons. European companies which have undertaken cross-border mergers (Matra Marconi Space, Eurocopter) have been slow to implement unified management structures while others continue to engage in endless negotiations before embarking upon them (British Aerospace Dynamics and Matra Defence). This compares unfavourably to US deals which are clinched in months not years. Furthermore, the Groupement d'Interet Economique, which is so prevalent in the European defence industry, tends to perpetuate national reporting systems and duplication of effort. While second and third-tier suppliers have fared somewhat better, the picture in European defence R&amp;D is equally incoherent, being dominated by a host of bilateral treaties and ad hoc collaborative projects with little or no co-ordination among them. Previous attempts to provide a blueprint for a competitive European defence equipment market, such as the Independent European Programme Group's 1988 Action Plan, have lacked any credibility since they did not include a supranational executive agency which could force national governments to act. Yet deregulation and rationalisation of the European defence agency are desperately needed. If European governments do not wish to abolish article 223 of the Treaty of Rome and thereby give the European Commission oversight over the defence industry, it is at least incumbent upon them to find an alternative organisation which could fulfil this role. The western European Armaments Group seems the only credible candidate, and steps in this direction need to be urgently revitalised.

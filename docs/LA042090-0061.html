			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH / VIDEO . . . WHAT'S NEW : 'CHRISTINA' (WITH GARBO) RELEASED  </P> <P> THIS WEEK'S MOVIES  </P> <P> Greta Garbo, who died Sunday at the age of 84, had one of her most remarkable  roles in "Queen Christina," which MGM/UA coincidentally released on  videocassette Tuesday.  </P> <P> In this beautifully directed (by Rouben Mamoulian) historical drama from 1933,  Garbo was perfectly cast as the 17th-Century Swedish queen, who rebelled  against what was expected of her in terms of both her royal and her marital  duties. Don't miss it -- especially the exquisite, daring scene set in the  bedroom of an inn.  </P> <P> (One interesting note: Garbo insisted that her former lover, John Gilbert, be  given the important part of the Spanish ambassador, even though his career was  on the skids.)  </P> <P> "Queen Christina" is one of eight vintage films that MGM/UA released this week  under the blanket title "Leading Ladies Volume II." Priced at $29.95, these  include one other Garbo picture -- the one in which she was most miscast,  "Two-Faced Woman" (1941), a weak screwball comedy that sadly proved to be the  actress' last cinematic appearance.  </P> <P> The rest of the "Leading Ladies" package consists of top-notch comedies, dramas  and musicals from the golden age of Hollywood -- "Marie Antoinette" (1938)  starring Norma Shearer, "Libeled Lady" (1936) with Spencer Tracy, Myrna Loy,  Jean Harlow and William Powell, "Show Boat" (1936) with Irene Dunne, Helen  Morgan and Paul Robeson, and "Strange Cargo" (1940) with Clark Gable and Joan  Crawford -- plus, from later decades, "A Child Is Waiting" (1962) starring Judy  Garland, and "Torch Song" (1953) with Joan Crawford.  </P> <P> Turning to films that had 1989 theatrical runs:  </P> <P> "Sea of Love" (MCA, priced for rental, R) gave Al Pacino his first hit film in  years. He's a New York City cop who gets involved with a serial-killing suspect  (Ellen Barkin).  </P> <P> "Black Rain" (Paramount, priced for rental, R) follows two more U.S. policemen  (Michael Douglas, Andy Garcia) to Japan, where they take an accused assassin.  When he escapes, they're drawn into the dark world of Japanese gangs.  </P> <P> On a lighter (and more obscure) note, "Trust Me" (MCEG, $79.95, R) is a brash  satire on the art world, starring singer Adam Ant as an opportunistic dealer.  Ant is strong and sassy in the role, and the film is fun for a while, but  eventually gets lost and silly. It's worth checking out, though.  </P> <P> OTHER NEW VIDEOS  </P> <P> Ready to learn the latest dance craze? "How to Lambada" (RCA/Columbia, $9.95)  shows you how to perform those sexy gyrations.

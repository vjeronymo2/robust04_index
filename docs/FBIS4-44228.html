			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lena Hennel: "Membership Does Not Threaten Aid"] </F>   [Text] Swedish membership in the European Union [EU] does  not mean that Sweden would isolate itself from the rest of the  world.    This was strongly stressed yesterday when Finance Minister  Anne Wibble hosted a miniseminar on Sweden's relations with the  Third World and East Europe.    "The EU is not a fortress and Sweden, together with other  like-minded countries, will see to it that it does not become  one."    Anne Wibble even said that it is possible to strengthen  global cooperation at the same time as Sweden is working for  European integration.    If Sweden and Norway join the EU they will be able --  together with Denmark and the Netherlands -- to work to improve  the EU's aid policy, Anne Wibble said, at the same time as the  EU's protectionism in the fields of agriculture and textiles  must combated.    Others present at the seminar were representatives of  Latvia,  Estonia, and Uganda, and Danish Development Aid Minister Helle  Degn.    Degn said that she has very positive experience of EU  cooperation in the development aid field and said that Denmark  has won a sympathetic hearing among the other countries of the  Union for its strategy vis-a-vis the developing countries.    And she said several times that Swedish membership would  make  this even easier.    The critics of the EU's aid policy say among other things  that the EU's former great powers give priority to aid to their  former colonies. The northern African countries, for example,  are said to be receiving a disproportionately high level of  support compared with the poorer countries in southern Africa.    But Edith Ssempala, Ugandan ambassador to Sweden, did not  express any concern that EU membership would have a negative  effect on Swedish aid.    Instead she voiced hopes of a greater Nordic influence on  the  EU's aid policy.</p>

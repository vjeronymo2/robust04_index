			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH  </P> <P> Despite rising interest rates and fears of increased inflation, the market  continues to move ahead, according to Irving Katz, director of research for  Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. "Since the first of the year, the market has  gained about 8% as it continues to defy the pessimistic short sellers and  traders who have been waiting for a fall," Katz said.  </P> <P> Eight San Diego stocks reached new highs this past week. Home Federal Savings  &amp; Loan, which sells at 80% of tangible book value -- and about six times  earnings -- received a favorable mention in Barron's magazine. Merrill Lynch  recently upgraded its estimate of Home Federal's 1989 earnings to $5.45 a  share.  </P> <P> DH Technology continued to record new highs as it gained $1.125 to $8.75. The  manufacturer of printer heads is showing improved earnings after digesting an  acquisition that will double this year's revenue.  </P> <P> Humphrey continued to rally on excellent 1988 earnings. The company gained  $.875 to hit a new 52-week high of $4.875. Humphrey expects 1989 revenue to  increase by 30% in 1989.  </P> <P> Molecular Biosystems reached a new high as it gained $1.375 to $17.625. The  company signed a $31-million marketing pact with Shionogi &amp; Co. of Japan  for the development and marketing of its Albunex ultrasound contrast agent.  </P> <P> Rohr Industries made a new high of $37.875 on recurring takeover rumors but  closed the week up $2.25 to $34.75.  </P> <P> Monitor Technologies reached a new high of $5.875 on no evident news but closed  the week up $1.125 to $5.375.  </P> <P> Pancretec, which continued to hit new highs on excellent earnings prospects,  gained $2.125 to $11.75.  </P> <P> Intermark reached a new high Monday -- if one includes the recently announced  10% stock dividend, Katz said.  </P> <P> Other good gainers this week were Mycogen, up $.50 on news of a $1.8-million  equity investment by a U. S. subsidiary of Japan Tobacco. The unit would also  pay Mycogen $7.7 million over the next three years.  </P> <P> Despite all the good news, some San Diego stocks recorded new lows. Sym-Tek  Systems fell to $6.625 as traders were reluctant to purchase a 20,000-share  block that became available. After finding a buyer, the stock moved back to $9,  where it closed down $.50 for the week.  </P> <P> Synbiotics hit a new low of $5 in continued reaction to its poor third-quarter  earnings. Syntro matched its low of $1 as Upjohn filed a patent infringement  suit over Syntro's pseudorabies vaccine for swine.  </P></p>

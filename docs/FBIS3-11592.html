			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Radical Civic Union leader Leopoldo Moreau] </F>   [Text] Buenos Aires, 17 Mar (NA) -- In some sectors the  belief exists that the new Constitution favors Menem alone.  This idea is shared both by the anti-Menem group -- who are  emotionally against the constitutional reform -- and by  government supporters, who enthusiastically believe that the  reform will assure Menem a new presidential term.    Neither side is right. It is true that Menem could possibly  run again in 1995. Yet it is also true that the hegemonic  scheme of the Menem sector was left without reelection, and that  thanks to the opportune and intelligent intervention of the  Radical Civic Union [UCR], the dreams of the Menem sector to  perpetuate arbitrariness, injustice, and corruption in power  will collapse with the approval of the new Constitution.    Let us see why:    -- In the reform, the UCR managed to impose a strong  restriction on Menem's reelection possibilities by introducing  the indirect election of the president and the vice president  (the electoral colleges will disappear) through the runoff  system. This system, which will be established by the  Constitution, may not be modified by a law. It definitively  eliminates the danger of tricks to which the government might  resort if it realizes it could lose an election. One of those  tricks is the multiple ticket law.    The runoff election system will force Menem to obtain -- in  order to avoid a runoff -- more than 45 percent of the votes in  the first electoral round. It should be recalled that in its  best electoral moment -- on 3 October 1993 -- the Menem sector  barely received 42 percent of the votes. Furthermore, the  runoff system favors the creation of two major electoral blocs:  a pro-government bloc and an opposition bloc. So far there has  been only one electoral front, the one formed by the Menem  sector. With the traditional votes of the Justicialist Party,  the UCEDE [Democratic Center Union], and other rightist sectors,  this bloc was an apparently invincible electoral front. From  now on this situation will change, and progressive and popular  sectors will have a chance to create a strongly competitive  electoral group.    -- The direct election of national senators, the reduction  of  their terms, and the designation of a third minority senator  have destroyed the pro-Menem dream of controlling the Senate  until the year 2003.    As a matter of fact, if everything had remained unchanged,  or  -- and this would have been even worse -- if the Constitution  advocated by the government had been approved, instead of the  one negotiated with the UCR, the pro-Menem sector, even in  losing the elections, would have maintained control (by  approximately two-thirds) over the Senate until the beginning of  the next century. This circumstance has made people wonder:  How will the opposition govern, if it wins the election, when  the Menem sector has control over the Senate and a majority in  the Supreme Court?    -- Millions of Argentines are right to wonder: How will it  be possible to eradicate corruption without independent courts?  Fighting corruption is not only an ethical obligation -- it is  also a political duty. If the democratic system can find no  efficient action to properly fight corruption, this will end up  undermining the credibility of democracy.    The new Constitution negotiated by the UCR leadership, which  is headed by Raul Alfonsin, has an answer for this dilemma. The  system for designating and dismissing judges was totally  modified. From now on, judges will no longer be designated by  the president of the nation with Senate approval. The Senate  has so far designated who would administer justice in secret  sessions, and by majority vote.    With the new Constitution, judges will be nominated by the  so-called Council for Magistrates (an organ made up of judges,  delegates from bar associations and academic institutions, and  lawmakers) which, after a qualification contest, will propose  two- or three-name lists on which the Senate will have to debate  in public sessions.    This system is operating in Italy, and based on its results  in the fight against corruption within the government and in  economic sectors, the system apparently works better than the  one we have been using under the current Constitution.    Perhaps even more important is the modification of the  system  for dismissing corrupt judges. Under the current Constitution,  the system for replacing judges has been highly inefficient. In  50 years of institutional life -- before the Nicosia case --  only one judge has been dismissed through the impeachment system.    The Chamber of Deputies now needs a two-thirds majority to  press charges against a judge, and the Senate needs a two-thirds  vote to dismiss him. It is clear that with this method it is  almost impossible to dismiss a judge. As an example, Dr.  Servini de Cubria is still at her post.    The new Constitution drawn up by the UCR provides that  suspected corrupt or unfit judges will be tried by a tribunal  that will be similar to the Council for Magistrates, that is,  its members will be judges, bar association representatives,  academic institution representatives, and lawmakers. Some  people will claim that it remains to be seen whether this system  will work. Yet it is obvious that the current system does not  work.    In addition to these rules, which the UCR introduced into  the Constitution to assure a really independent judicial branch,  there are other initiatives on which no consensus was reached  but which were included at our request. If the UCR has the  larger number of convention delegates it will be possible to  approve such initiatives, which deal with the creation of the  position of ombudsman and the subordination of the attorneys  general to a sector outside the three branches of government.    The first initiative means that constitutional status will  be  given to an organ that will register reports and claims by any  citizen of government or economic power abuse. Under the second  initiative, the attorneys general (that is, the prosecutors)  will no longer be subordinated to the executive branch (that is,  to the government) or, as they are now, to the attorney general  of the nation. This absurd situation has hindered many  investigations into the work of public officials, causing honest  judges to leave.    Finally, in order to improve control mechanisms -- to avoid  corruption from grabbing people's money -- we have managed to  make the new Constitution put the Office of the Comptroller  General, which is the main control organ, in the hands of the  main opposition party. This regulation will be definitively  incorporated into our Constitution.    Another major conquest is the direct election -- that is, by  voters -- of the mayor of the federal capital. There will be no  more cases of designated mayors like former Buenos Aires Mayor  Carlos Grosso.    Finally, UCR members will strive to make the new  Constitution  establish rules for a new type of relation between the nation  and the provinces -- an issue that is being widely debated --  and rules to protect defenseless consumers from arbitrary  actions of those who render privatized public services, or from  unscrupulous people who at times even risk people's lives.  These initiatives will certainly produce stronger rejection in  the government, because they are against the philosophy of  Menem's and Cavallo's economic concentration model.    We are then, beyond all doubt, facing a constitutional  reform  which even though giving Menem the possibility of running again,  has managed to break his aspirations -- and the aspirations of  the few economic power groups -- to perpetuate a model based on  injustice, marginalization, and backwardness.    Despite all this, some fellow countrymen may still think  that  Menem should not have a chance of being reelected. We thought  that Menemism is what should not be reelected. If it had not  been Menem, we would have had to defeat Eduardo Duhalde or  Domingo Cavallo. The difference is that the presidential term  would have continued to be for six years, that there would have  been a pro-Menem majority until the year 2003, that courts would  not have changed, and that the people would have been unable to  control the government.    In light of all this we say that Menemism, as a hegemonic  model, has been left without reelection. Now Menem has to be  defeated in the election. The people will make the decision.  As we did more than 100 years ago, we have confidence in the  people.</p>

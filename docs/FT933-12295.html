			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Special Report on Second Cars: Putting safety first - Four-wheel drives DO YOU worry about your wife driving the children to school during a wintry spell? Will your second car be used to take the family to the ski slopes? If so, you are a prospective buyer of a four-wheel drive. It need not be one of those rugged, on/off-road machines with high clearance and knobbly tyres (although, human nature being what it is, it probably will be). No, what I mean are normal-looking cars meant to be driven on roads, not across virgin country. The only thing special about them is that their engine's power is put on the road through four wheels, not two. Four-wheel drive is all to do with maximising grip. The more slippery the surface, the less power a tyre can handle before losing grip and allowing the wheel to spin. Family cars do not spin their drive wheels on dry roads but may on wet ones. On snow, sheer lack of grip can bring any two-wheel driven car to a stop. Four-wheel drive keeps a car going on low-grip surfaces by halving the amount of power each drive wheel tyre has to transmit. In turn, this halves the chance of the tyre losing grip and spinning. As a rough rule of thumb, a car with four driven wheels is four times more likely to keep moving - or behave itself when driven hard on slippery surfaces - than one with front or rear drive only. High-performing cars like the Audi quattro or Mitsubishi 3000GT have permanent four-wheel drive. Their more elaborate transmissions have a central differential or viscous coupling to allow the front wheels to revolve at different speeds from the back ones when the car is going round a corner. The whole point of giving such cars four-wheel drive is not to let them be driven fast on dangerously slippery roads but to make them safer at normal speeds. Road-going cars with four-wheel drive can cost as little as Pounds 6,697. This buys a pint-sized but very practical Subaru Vivio five-door. A 4WD Subaru Justy three-door is a little bigger but not much dearer at Pounds 7,799. Both have four-wheel drive selected at the touch of a button in the gear lever knob. At the other extreme, you can pay Pounds 45,894 for an automatic Audi V8 quattro or Pounds 58,960 for a Porsche 911 Carrera 4. In the middle ground are cars like the BMW 525i X (Pounds 26,700), Subaru Legacy (from Pounds 13,149) and Vauxhall Cavalier 2.0 Turbo 4x4 6sp (Pounds 19,705). Mention four-wheel drive to most car-buyers, though, and they think automatically of butch-looking on/off-roaders - even though they intend to take them off the tarmac rarely, if ever. Dominating the market are the Land Rover Defender and Discovery and their posh cousin, the Range Rover. Snapping at their heels for years have been the Mitsubishi Shogun, Nissan Patrol, Toyota Land Cruiser, Isuzu Trooper, Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen, Daihatsu Fourtrak and Sportrak, and Suzuki's Samurai and Vitara. Recent arrivals on the British market have been the Jeep Cherokee station wagons and the rough, tough Jeep Wrangler. All are of basically similar layout to the immortal Jeep of the second world war. Some (for example, all Land Rover products and the G-Wagen) have permanent all-wheel drive. Shogun and Jeep Cherokee users can pick four-wheel or two-wheel drive on hard, dry roads. The others - including the new Nissan Terrano II and Ford Maverick - normally are rear-driven on tarmac, all-wheel driven off-road. Why have an on/off-roader to drive only on the road? There is no sensible answer. Owners say they like the high driving position that lets them look over hedges. And the rugged construction of their vehicles makes them feel safe. In truth, buying an on/off-road 4 x 4 as a car alternative has more to do with life style (real or assumed) than logic. People who have never ridden a horse or raised a 12-bore to their shoulder like to wear jodhpurs or waxed jackets with game pockets. So, if that is what you fancy, why not drive a 4 x 4 that can carry you across ploughed fields as easily as it goes to the supermarket? This kind of vehicle used to be either spartan (the old Land Rover) or very expensive (Range Rover). Now, recreational all-wheel drives feel more like high-slung Volvo estate cars than distant relatives of wartime Jeeps. Their weight and bluff shape make them fairly heavy on fuel, though, which is why most buyers go for the diesel-engined versions - where they exist. Among the best buys for mainly on-road use are the Vauxhall Frontera (from Pounds 12,920), Jeep Cherokee (from Pounds 15,995, equipped like a posh executive saloon), and Isuzu Trooper (from Pounds 16,849). The new, Spanish-built Nissan Terrano II and Ford Maverick offer car-type, on-road refinement from about Pounds 14,000, plus more off-road capability than a typical owner will ever exploit. Paradoxically, a problem many 4 x 4 owners face is finding rough country where they may play legally with their vehicles. So, most of the makers now offer to show buyers how to drive their new 4 x 4 off-road. It is worth taking up, if only to prove just what a safe, versatile, go-almost-anywhere package you have bought.</p>

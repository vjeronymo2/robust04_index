			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Dispatch" by staff reporter Liu Yung-pi (0491 3057 4310) </F> and special reporter Lin Kang-hai (3651 0474) from Haikou, 9  June: "Hainan Province Decides To Inject Fresh Motive Power to  Its Economic Construction"]    [Text] Ruan Chongwu, chief administrative executive of  China's youngest province and biggest special economic zone,  concurrently secretary of the provincial party committee, gave a  special interview to these reporters here a few days ago. He  pointed out: This year, while development and reform are in a  crucial stage, the provincial government will pay close  attention to the consolidation and implementation of the series  of reform measures which the central and Hainan provincial  authorities have promulgated. Great efforts will be made to  organize the implementation of those moves by proceeding in an  orderly manner, and step by step, and motive power will be  injected continuously to ensure the sustained, rapid, and  healthy development of Hainan's economy.    Governor Ruan said: Various major reforms centering on the  establishment of a socialist market economic structure have been  introduced. Moreover, Hainan has its own concrete reform  measures, such as the establishment of a company system in  state-owned enterprises, opening of the property rights trading  market, the introduction of a modern tax collection and  management system, and improvement of the open foreign economic  structure. These measures involve an extremely wide range of  endeavor and their implementation is a task of primary  importance. When answering the question of how to absorb  foreign capital more vigorously as macroregulation and control  are applied, the Governor said: "Hainan has its unique strong  point, which no other cities in the country have. We are  pursuing the practice of issuing visas at the airport to provide  the greatest convenience to foreign businessmen and ensure that  they can leave the country from other ports. Our preferential  policies on investment and taxation will remain unchanged, as  will our relaxed investment environment. If there is any change  it will be to make it even more appealing. We will also  transform our government functions, reduce the number of  `keepers [ba men di 2116 7024 4104],' and we will not set up any  customs barriers, namely, we will reduce examination and  approval procedures and increase the number of people `engaging  in hygiene [gao wei sheng di 2269 5898 3932 4104].' To put it  another way, while acting in accordance with the laws governing  the market economy, we will practice standardized management and  supervision." This outstanding student, who graduated from the  Automotive Machinery College in Moscow, displayed his ability to  skillfully summarize things. This simple and vivid analogy was  an embodiment of the Hainan Government's general line of  thinking on reform and has attracted the attention of economic  theorists and journalists and has received the approval of  governments at all levels and the relevant departments in the  province.    Full of confidence, Governor Ruan said: "Hainan encourages a  free flow of personnel, funds, and commodities. In Hainan,  there are many opportunities to make money and reap quick  profits, with the average rate of returns amounting to 20 to 30  percent. I believe that so long as `there are people making  money here, others will follow suit.' More and more foreign  businessmen have set foot on the soil of Hainan and increased  amounts of funds have flowed into Hainan. This is the best  proof of my argument. Last year, Hainan signed 316 new  contracts on foreign capital utilization, an increase of nearly  83 percent over the previous year."    When talking about this year's tasks, this No. 1 man in  Hainan said: "This year we will continue to uphold the  principle of infrastructures going first and strengthen the  construction of infrastructures. We will transform ports,  construct railways and expressways, build Haikou's Meilan  Airport, and develop the electric power, post and  telecommunications, oil refining, construction materials,  steelmaking, and food processing industries as well as  tourism.... There are too many things for us to do."    With a feeling of joy and a proper sense of pride, Governor  Ruan informed these reporters: "In the last two or three years,  Hainan's gross domestic output value has increased at an average  annual rate of close to 23 percent, more than 10 percentage  points over the nation's average growth rate. This is a world  record. This year we will maintain a growth rate of 18 percent  so that Hainan's economy forges ahead in a sustained, rapid, and  healthy way."    When asked about his feelings regarding his management of  Hainan affairs, this current magistrate of Hainan Island, who  has previously been China's labor and public security ministers,  said: "I have a deep love for Hainan, which is an island  clinging to the Chinese land and to which the central  authorities have attached ever greater importance. It is a  treasure island which finds favor in the eyes of more and more  farsighted people. With its abundant natural resources,  tropical beauty, and relaxed investment environment, Hainan has  become an ideal place, attractive to both investors and  tourists. I am fully hopeful about Hainan."</p>

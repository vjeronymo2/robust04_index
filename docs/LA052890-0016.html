			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAT ROBERTSON  </P> <P> Thanks for spoiling my breakfast as I read the article about televangelist Pat  Robertson forming a political coalition (Part A, May 15). The American voters  resoundingly rejected his right-wing agenda when he ran for president and he's  going to attempt to shove it down our throats again.  </P> <P> Perhaps someone should tell Robertson that this is a pluralistic nation and we  don't need him trying to dictate what we can read, watch on television or how  we conduct our spiritual lives.  </P> <P> His attempts to "see a country governed by Christians" is frightening. I'm  quite sure it's from Robertson's point of view. Thanks, but I prefer the  vitality and strength that comes with diversity and the contributions of all  religions.  </P> <P> JIM SCRUGGS  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: SmithKline to merge international divisions SmithKline Beecham is to merge its three international divisions into one called SB Healthcare International. The reorganisation covers all operations outside Europe and north America with total sales of about Pounds 1.3bn, 20 per cent of the whole business. It combines the resources of SmithKline's consumer healthcare and pharmaceuticals divisions with the Sterling Health over-the-counter medicines unit acquired in August. SmithKline will cut duplication of resources, especially in Asia and Latin America, but no figures were available yesterday. The company used external consultants to evaluate which parts of each division would survive. Mr Jan Leschly, SmithKline's chief executive, said that this was to ensure fairness. 'We treated all three divisions equally. Sterling was not a second class citizen.' He acknowledged that this was 'a surprise' for some people. The reorganisation comes as the company completes a Dollars 7.7bn (Pounds 4.7bn) series of acquisitions and disposals culminating yesterday in the Dollars 1.45bn sale of its animal health business to Pfizer of the US. Mr Leschly said that the reorganisation was a signal that the main management effort would now be on extracting the most from Sterling Health and Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, a US drug distributor, which have been acquired over the past six months.</p>

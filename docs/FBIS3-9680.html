			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Banja Luka, March 29 (TANJUG) -- Forces of the  Bosnian Moslems and of the army of Bosnian Croats (HVO) have  intensified their attacks on Serb positions and settlements in  the central, northern and western parts of the ex-Yugoslav  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serb military sources announced  on Tuesday.    The announcement said Moslem troops intensified mortar fire  in the region of the central Bosnian town of Srbobran (formerly  Donji Vakuf). It added that Moslems continued using infantry  arms, anti-aircraft guns and rifle-launched rockets in their  fierce attacks on Serb positions on the western Bosnian  battlefronts of Bihac and Novi Grad (formerly Bosanski Novi).    In the Moslem attacks on Bihac, one Serb defender was killed  and the Serb side was forced to fire back, but it did not  respond to the attacks on Novi Grad where there were no  casualties, the announcement said. It added that on Monday,  after 13 days of fighting, the army of Bosnian Serbs stopped an  offensive launched by Moslems on March 16 and aimed at capturing  the central Bosnian heights of Kupres. Bosnian Serb troops  pushed the Moslems back towards the nearby town of Bugojno up  north.    The Moslem attack on the Kupres heights, as the Bosnian Serb  military sources said, was planned as part of the offensive  launched to seize the town of Srbobran and later the town of  Jajce.    The sources cautioned against fresh fierce attacks by Moslem  forces which were redeploying themselves towards Srbobran and  Kupres, moving in there their men and materiel from Travnik and  Gornji Vakuf, the central Bosnian towns where they had fought  Bosnian Croats.    The sources said the army of Bosnian Croats overnight  fiercely attacked the positions of Serb defenders in the  northern Bosnian stretch of the Sava valley, especially those  outside the Serb villages of Jenjic and Lepnica, but there were  no casualties and the defenders had not responded.</p>

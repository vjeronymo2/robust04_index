			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NORVILLE AFFAIR  </P> <P> You need not worry about Deborah Norville. She may be beautiful, but her voice  is strong and no-nonsense, unlike 13 years of Jane Pauley's pleasant  soft-headedness.  </P> <P> In the take-no-prisoners world of television, Ms. Norville can hold her own  with anyone, as witness her early-morning news before the "Today" show.  </P> <P> The only problem I foresee is Bryant Gumbel's massive ego running rampant.  </P> <P> DONALD SOMMERFIELD  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

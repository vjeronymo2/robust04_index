However, Taiwan will be at an increased risk of attack  during  the years 2001 to 2010, Niu Hsien-chung, a military strategist  and author of several war game books told legislators at a  public hearing on security issues.    Beijing will be preoccupied with resolving thorny problems  related to the retrocession of Hong Kong and Macao until the  turn of the century, ruling out the possibility of any attack on  Taiwan, Niu said.    Niu was at the Legislative Yuan to comment on the recently  published Ministry of National Defense White Paper.    Niu said that the white paper lists six reasons and ways for  a communist offensive against Taiwan, but did not discuss when  such attacks would take place.    "Timing is vitally important," he said.    On the ministry's plan to size down the armed forces to  about  400,000 in 10 years, Niu said if the plan is a must, it should  be carried out in five years rather than 10.    He added that the White Paper only dealt with military  maneuvers against Taiwan. "As a matter of fact," he said,  "non-military attacks would be even more deadly."    The white paper claims that the foremost event which might  trigger a military attack from Beijing would be a declaration of  independence by Taiwan.    Other major events include internal large-scale chaos or  riots within Taiwan, foreign intervention in the internal  affairs of Taiwan, refusal to hold reunification talks with the  mainland, the development of nuclear arms on the island, and  political instability in the post-Deng Xiaoping era, which might  lead to a communist attack on the island.    According to the white paper, some of the six ways the  mainland could possibly attack Taiwan include a sudden missile  offensive against targets on Taiwan's western coast or seizing  upon fishing disputes to trick Taiwan's Navy into a maritime  confrontation.    The communists may lure Taiwan air and naval forces into  battle after first attacking Taiwan-held offshore islands.  Mainland forces could also launch a rapid-fire invasion and  take over Taiwan-held islands, the white paper said.</p>

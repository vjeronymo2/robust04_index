			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report from the "This is the News" roundup: </F> "Optimism Against Gloomy Background"]    [Text] "On the whole, the necessary conditions for  advancing along the path of reforms have been created in  society," Russian Federation First Deputy Minister for the  Economy Yakov Urinson declared yesterday at a government  sitting, summing up the preliminary results of the first six  months of 1994.    By his assertion, the government program adopted earlier to  stabilize the situation in the economy is beginning to show  "tangible, positive results, and talk about the collapse and  fatal line of the economy are unsubstantiated."    As for specific figures, however, according to data from the  Ministry for the Economy the GDP (in fixed prices) fell by  almost 18 percent compared to the same period last year.  Overall, the volume of industrial output went down by 27  percent, falling by almost half in the machine building and  metalworking sectors.    According to expert evaluations, money supply will increase  by roughly 60 percent (8 percent per month). Inflation, by  comparison with December of last year, will comprise around 90  percent. Industrial producers' wholesale prices will double.</p>

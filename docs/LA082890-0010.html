			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> UNIVERSITY PROGRAM TO USE LOCAL SITE  </P> <P> Students working toward master's degrees through UC Santa Barbara's off-campus  studies department will no longer go to the Point Mugu Navy base for classes  but will use the school's Ventura Center beginning in the fall.  </P> <P> Graduate programs have been offered at Point Magu in computer science and  electrical and computer engineering. Space became available in the Ventura  Center at 3585 Maple St. about two years ago, when classes from Cal State  Northridge were moved to their own facility.  </P> <P> The graduate program could not move earlier because it had a yearlong contract  with the Navy, student affairs officer Judy Cotton said.  </P> <P> The program is geared toward re-entry students with an average age of about 35,  Cotton said.

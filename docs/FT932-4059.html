			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Slow recovery forecast for Swedish economy SWEDEN'S economy has reached the bottom of the country's deepest recession since the second world war, but recovery will be slow with unemployment continuing to rise next year before falling slightly in 1995, according to a three-year forecast by Handelsbanken. The bank, one of the top two in Sweden, predicts that gross national product will shrink for a third year this year, contracting by 1.4 per cent, slightly less than the government estimates. But it says the GNP quarterly average turned around in the first quarter and there will be a return to overall growth next year of 1.2 per cent, rising to 2.3 per cent in 1995. The improvement is largely attributed to exports, fuelled by the heavy devaluation of the Swedish kroner last autumn, but expected to be sustained over the next two years by underlying increases in competitiveness from a decline in real wages - falling this year for the third year running - and rising productivity. Despite weakening markets in Europe, Handelsbanken expects Swedish companies to expand market share and produce export growth of 23 per cent over the three-year period. However, the outlook for the domestic economy, where investment and public and private consumption are set to remain weak, is much gloomier. Real disposable income is seen as falling by 7 per cent this year, with no rise anticipated in 1994 and 1995. Unemployment is expected to grow to 7.8 per cent of the workforce this year and peak at 8 per cent in 1994 before falling back to 7.2 per in 1995. These figures, like official government figures, are reckoned to understate the real jobless total by more than one third because of the large numbers in training schemes. Better news for Prime Minister Mr Carl Bildt's conservative-led coalition, which faces a general election in late 1994, lies in the inflation forecast. Handelsbanken predicts a drop in inflation to 2.6 per cent in 1994 after 4.8 per cent this year.</p>

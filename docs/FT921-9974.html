			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Books: One Palestine - complete with pitfalls HERBERT SAMUEL: A POLITICAL LIFE by Bernard Wasserstein Clarendon Press, Oxford Pounds 45, 427 pages ON JUNE 30 1920 Herbert Samuel arrived in Jaffa aboard a British warship to take up his post as the first British High Commissioner in Palestine. Dressed in the white uniform of the British proconsul, complete with plumes and sword, Samuel was given a royal welcome. The Jews of Palestine, overcoming earlier misgivings about Samuel's appointment, enthused with their customary hyperbole. Max Nurock, an Irish-born Zionist who was to be Samuel's private secretary, noted that the occasion took on a 'messianic and a vice-regal character'. The Mayor of Jaffa - an Arab - greeted the High Commissioner in English. But the controversial Meir Dizengoff, Mayor of the neighbouring all-Jewish Tel Aviv, departed from agreed procedures to address Samuel in Hebrew, thus pointing undiplomatically to the fact that the High Commissioner was a Jew. The hyper-sensitive local political barometer gave a nervous kick. Accompanied by the Military Governor of Jerusalem, Sir Ronald Storrs Samuel journeyed by train to Jerusalem. At the official residence on the 'Mount of Olives' the transfer of authority was affected. Jokingly, the outgoing Chief Administrator handed Samuel a typed form: 'Received from Major General Sir Louis Bols, one Palestine, complete.' Which Samuel obligingly signed, adding the commercial escape clause 'E. &amp; OE' (errors and omissions excepted). Then as now, 'one complete Palestine' contained more pitfalls and contradictions than even the swell of optimism that attended Samuel's first steps could suppress. It was not long before these surfaced to frustrate his efforts. By the time Samuel had left Palestine five years later he had achieved a great deal in the areas at which he was good: he laid the foundation for a sound civil administration, and generally improved conditions in the country. To the consternation of Whitehall, he also went beyond his brief to extend British authority to Transjordan - a small expression of his robust imperialist instincts. Yet before the end of his term, he came to be resented by the Jews, distrusted by the Arabs and, as far as British aims in the region went, he seemed to have achieved little, if anything. To accept such a judgment, however, is unfair for it disregards the region's quirky, meandering political evolution. As Professor Wasserstein wisely suggests - albeit with the benefit of hindsight - Samuel's steady dispassionate competence, his impeccable application of fair play, and perhaps even his unimaginativeness in the search for a commonly acceptable solution which anyway seemed unattainable, may well have saved the Zionist enterprise from crashing by giving it a much-needed breathing space. If this did not much help the Arab cause, it did not retard it either. Sir Ronald Storrs, hardly noted for his Zionist sympathies, wrote this of Samuel's tenure in his autobiography Orientation: 'I do not believe that any previous five years in the history of Palestine - certainly none subsequent - can show a legacy of accomplishment comparable with that of his orderly, creative and passionless intelligence. And I firmly believe, if a Gentile may express an opinion on Jewish affairs (Jews express themselves freely enough on ours) that the names of the Big Four who will go down to history in the rebuilding of Zion will be Theodor Herzl, who saw the vision; Chaim Weizmann, who grasped the occasion; Arthur Balfour, who caused the world to renew the ancient Promise in a modern Covenant; and Herbert Samuel, who turned principle into practice, word into fact.' Even for the well-ordered and ethically unfettered Roman Empire, Palestine was a troublesome province. Samuel may have reflected on this as he contemplated the appointment with considerable reluctance. He realised that being Jewish would be disadvantageous to the task at hand, and to British interests. Samuel was perhaps naive in believing that his own overruling sense of justice and abilities could relegate his Jewishness to irrelevance in Palestine. What about the Prime Minister David Lloyd George, who could not be accused of naivety in any sense? Lloyd George loathed Samuel, who returned the sentiment priggishly, moralistically. Is it conceivable that in dispatching Samuel to Palestine Lloyd George malevolently invited a disastrous failure both on Samuel personally and on the Zionist cause, which was averted by luck no less than by Samuel's probity and skills? I should have liked Wasserstein to consider this possibility and its implications. Zionists too, were apprehensive about Samuel's Palestine appointment, despite his having been a force behind the scenes in the genesis of the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which committed the British Government to the creation of national home for the Jews in Palestine. Wasserstein recounts how Chaim Weizmann responded to CP Scott, editor of the Manchester Guardian who had offered to put him in touch with Lloyd George. Scott said: ''You know, you have a Jew in the Government, Mr Herbert Samuel.' Whereupon Weizmann responded: 'For God's sake, Mr Scott, let's have nothing to do with this man''. A typical Zionist gut-reflex to influential Jews, derived from the fear that such Jews, wanting to dispel imputations of double loyalty, tended to bend backwards to show their impartiality in a way which was detrimental to the Zionist cause. In the case of Samuel, Weizmann's apprehension was unfounded. Samuel's commitment to Zionism was deep and unwavering. Curiously, it was also consistent with his extreme Englishness. Never brilliant, Samuel was, nevertheless, sublimely competent and endowed with a well-ordered mind and invaluable administrative skills. His peers considered him incorruptible, priggish and passionless which, in the cut and thrust world of politics, amounted to being safe, dependable, but boring. Such indeed was the nature of his career: replete with unspectacular achievements, but lacklustre. Palestine was undoubtedly the high-point of Samuel's immensely long public career. Indeed, everything which followed - he died aged 93 in 1963 - was something of an anticlimax. Yet he became the Liberal MP for Cleveland in 1902, and went on to hold various governmental posts including Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (1909), Postmaster General (1910 and 1915), and Home Secretary, twice, during the First World War and after. For a while he was leader of the Liberal Party. His loyalty to Asquith was as enduring as was his aversion to Lloyd George. Much to Professor Wasserstein's credit, his book, like its subject, is admirably well-organised, and competent in every respect. Unlike Samuel himself, however, it is far from boring.</p>

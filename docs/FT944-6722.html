			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (18): Luck is a place at school - Life in Qillah village Mohammed Maqbool does not enjoy the rice harvest. By the time he starts work in the fields, he will have been up since 5 in the morning and he will not rest until sunset. Gathering crops is hard work for a nine-year-old boy, especially after a morning of chores and schoolwork. Wiping the dust from his face, Mohammed says he would rather be a policeman. Life in uniform is an alluring prospect for boys brought up in the fields and alleys of Qillah, a ramshackle collection of mud and brick huts in the heart of Punjab. The landlord of the village is unimpressed. 'You want to take bribes and beat people up,' he jokes. 'What kind of life is that?' The sarcasm hides a deeper concern - that today's children will leave the village for the bright lights of Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city, less than 40 miles away. Mohammed has never travelled beyond the nearby market town of Mandi Faizabad but he has glimpsed the outside world on one of the 17 television sets in the village - home to some 80 households. 'What will they make of MTV?' asks the landlord, whose family has owned the surrounding 550 acres for more than 40 years. 'My great worry is that the next generation will want nothing to do with the land.' His pessimism is probably exaggerated. Fears that today's children will abandon farming underestimate the grip of agriculture on the rural workforce. For all its drawbacks, most labourers prefer village life to the unplanned urban development of Mandi Faizabad. The congested market town is littered with abandoned vehicles, broken-down shops and the skeletons of tractors stripped for spares. Food stalls cast a pall of smoke across the area, and residents defecate in the road. It is not surprising villagers stay on the land, which at least promises fresh produce and modest profits. Qillah may be under-developed, but it is relatively prosperous compared with settlements in poorer provinces such as Sindh or Baluchistan. 'About 10 per cent of the villagers can read and write,' says the landlord. 'But that's better than in the more backward areas.' More than 100 children are officially enrolled in the two-room school, although their numbers are depleted by chronic absenteeism. It is a problem throughout the Punjab, where only a third of children attend primary school. Nevertheless, the prospects are brighter in this village than others. If children complete full-time education, the landlord promises to pay for a college place and the first villager has just received a degree. 'We respect him, but it has not made anyone else want to do it,' says Mohammed Rafiq, the head farmer. Instead, Mr Rafiq encourages young men to concentrate on crops: rice, potatoes, guava and citrus. In a good year they can grow 12,000kg of potatoes and sell enough rice to pay for new amenities, although there is still no telephone. Their prosperity depends on one essential resource - water. The Qadirabad to Baloki canal runs through the village, giving it a high water table. That in turn produces a soil capable of sustaining a variety of produce. The village also rears buffalo and goats for slaughter - a rare source of income in a country where most livestock is used for motive power. 'This is one of the most progressive villages in the area,' says the landlord, who visits once a week to check the ledgers. 'We don't prevent them from improving their situation. Not everyone is so lucky.' Luck for the people of Qillah is the right to an education of sorts; the right to leave for the city and to sell their own produce. Mohammed Maqbool, whose family relies on dried dung for fuel and canal water for washing, hopes his luck will change.</p>

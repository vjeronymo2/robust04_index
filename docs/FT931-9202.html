			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / UN attempt to persuade Bosnian Serb commanders to allow relief convoy through UN officials yesterday tried to persuade Bosnian Serb commanders to allow a relief convoy to reach a besieged Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia, Laura Silber writes from Belgrade. The 10 trucks were held up by Serb commanders, who ignored an agreement between the Moslem-led Bosnian government and Serb leaders to let the vehicles through to the Cerska area, where the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates as many as 25,000 Moslems are trapped.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The following is a report on the attack and  complete destruction of the first major military campaign  launched by the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed  government on the Anlung Veng battlefield.    I. The Anlung Veng battlefield command and the National Army  of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] General Command wish to announce  that the first major military campaign launched by the  Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government on Anlung  Veng Battlefield was attacked and smashed to pieces at 1330 on  24 February 1994, repeat, at 1330 on 24 February 1994.    II. The attack and destruction of the offensive constitutes  destruction of the first major military campaign conducted by  the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government.    III. It is worth recalling that the campaign aimed at  destroying the liberated area of Anlung Veng was launched in  September 1993 while the two-headed government leaders went to  the UN Headquarters in New York.    After a battle of over one month, the troops of the  Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government were  routed completely. Many of them were killed or wounded, but they  all were privates because their commanders were staying away in  Siem Reap or on Route 68 in Samraong. This first major military  campaign considered by the Vietnamese communist puppets and  two-headed government to be a final battle was planned for  November 1993, but it was repeatedly postponed because there  were not enough troops. It was only at the end of December 1993  that a second major dry-season offensive on the Anlung Veng  battlefield began. After six or seven days of fighting, the  so-called second major offensive was completely defeated.    IV. Since then, especially in January 1994, a final major  military campaign was planned to destroy the Anlung Veng area  from all directions; that is, two directions from Route 68  [words indistinct], one direction from Sre Noy, one direction  from Rum Chek, and one direction from Kulen. The plan was  repeatedly revised by the Vietnamese communists, Vietnamese  communist puppets, the alliance, and the two-headed government.  They were busy purchasing ammunition; mustering troops from all  provinces and districts; gathering all available armaments,  tanks, armored carriers, trucks, multiple rocket launchers, and  cannons [words indistinct], mobilizing their troops, and so on.  The plan was to destroy or force Democratic Kampuchea to  surrender and accept their three conditions by ignoring the five  points of the king; it constituted the most serious crime and  was aimed at doing away with the Cambodian nation and people in  accordance with the strategy of swallowing Cambodia via the  Vietnamese communists' military and human war.    The plan can be summarized as follows:    1. 70 or 80 percent of important troops nationwide were  mobilized;    2. 70 or 80 percent of assorted light and heavy armaments  nationwide were deployed;    3. 90 percent of commanders -- most of them are generals  -- nationwide were gathered on the battlefield [words  indistinct];    4. The alliance exerted its all-out effort in maneuvering  according to its ability and the situation.    5. The alleged major campaign of the Vietnamese communist  puppets, two-headed government, and the alliance began at the  beginning of January 1994. After nearly 30 days of fighting, it  was, however, destroyed for the third time. On 9 February, they  marshaled all their troops to launch a fourth assault. The  battle was hardfought, and it was only on 18 February that the  invaders were surrounded by the NADK and people near Anlung  Veng. Their troops have remained in the death square as the  nearly 400,000 troops of Marshal [name indistinct] were routed  [words indistinct] in a manner recalling Stalingrad in World War  II and the fate of the more than 80,000 French troops of Gen.  [Ducas] destroyed at Dien Bien Phu. After six and a half days  of fighting, the invaders were destroyed.    6. This is the greatest defeat of the Vietnamese  communists, the Vietnamese communist puppets, the two-headed  government, and the alliance, which continue the strategy of  destroying Democratic Kampuchea [DK] and national  reconciliation, opposing the king, and promoting war with the  aim of swallowing Cambodia once and for all. It constitutes a  defeat for the clique and a victory for our entire nation and  people and the peace-loving countries of the world. It also  represents a success for the five-point national reconciliation  force of the king.    7. Nevertheless, our nation and people's enemies have  never renounced their strategy. Therefore, we should heighten  and reinforce our vigilance to decimate their criminal stratagy  for the sake of our nation's reconciliation and genuine peace.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM hints at move to allow Thorp THE prime minister yesterday strengthened expectations that the Pounds 2.8bn Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield will be allowed to commence commercial operations, Ivor Owen writes. While declining to prejudge the decision of the environment secretary, Mr Major underlined the plant's value in providing employment and earning foreign currency. Thorp would support about 3,000 jobs, and had contracts worth Pounds 9bn, he said. But Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader,described Thorp as a 'dubious project'. Since the decision to build the plant, he said, the economic prospects had collapsed, the risk of nuclear proliferation had increased, international opposition had hardened and the threshold of safe nuclear emissions had been substantially reduced.</p>

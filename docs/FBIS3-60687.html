North Korea's atomic  power plants, for example, are known to be equipped with old  nuclear reactors, and, accordingly, the danger of accidents is  very high. As such an accident will also affect us, special  measures need to be taken. Yim Yong-kyu, director of the ROK  Technological Institute for Atomic Power Safety, emphasized this  at the workshop on ``North Korea's Science and Technology and  Prospects for North-South Exchange in Science and Technology''  held on 8 December at the Tower Hotel in Seoul under the  auspices of the General Union of ROK Scientific and  Technological Organizations.    At the workshop, Director Yim stressed ``it is very  important  and urgent for us to diagnose the level of North Korea's atomic  power technology and its safety,'' and added ``however, it is  very difficult to grasp the whole picture of North Korea's  atomic power as it was hidden for a long time.''    According to Director Yim's research published during the  workshop, North Korea initiated its research on atomic power in  1956. After concluding an agreement on atomic power research  with the former Soviet Union, North Korea established the atomic  power engineering department at Kim Il-song University and Kim  Chaek Engineering University and the atomic power research  center at Yongbyon. With this as an occasion, North Korea began  full-scale research activity on atomic power.    North Korea introduced a research reactor from the former  Soviet Union in 1965. In the latter part of the sixties, North  Korea began developing its atomic power industry, by exploring  uranium, mining and smelting ore, processing nuclear fuel, and  constructing power plants.    At present, North Korea has about 20 atomic power  facilities,  including a 200 megawatt [MW] atomic power plant now under  construction in Taechon, the radiochemical laboratory in  Yongbyon suspected of being reprocessing facilities, and uranium  mines.    Director Yim said: North Korea asserts that it is developing  atomic power to meet its rapidly increasing demands for  electricity. However, considering the fact that it has no  commercial-purpose atomic power plants, its refusal to accept  nuclear inspections, and its development of missiles, this  assertion by North Korea lacks credibility.    On the other hand, Director Yim expressed deep concern about  the safety of North Korean atomic power plants by saying ``North  Korea's atomic reactors are old type, graphite-moderated,  gas-cooled reactors from the fifties. Fuel rods of such old  reactors can be broken easily, and energy accumulated in  graphite can be emitted in one shot. This may result in an  accident.''    He added: ``If North Korea has pushed ahead with the  development of nuclear weapons secretly, the safety issue would  not have surfaced due to the peculiar nature of North Korean  society.''    Director Yim guessed that ``The reason why North Korea has  adhered to using graphite reactors, the safety of which is very  low, is because graphite reactors can increase the yield of  plutonium and can easily extract plutonium by using the natural  uranium they exploit as fuel.''    The status of North Korea's atomic energy-related facilities  is as follows:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Facilities               |Location                 |Size/Remarks             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Generator No. 1 at Yongb-|Yongbyon                 |5 MW.

			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> YEAR-ROUND PLAN DELAYED FOR SCHOOL IN VALENCIA  </P> <P> Bowing to pressure from angry parents, the Newhall School Board voted Monday  night to delay for at least two years the start of year-round schooling at one  elementary school in the fast-growing district.  </P> <P> The trustees originally voted May 8 to start year-round schooling at Meadows  Elementary School in Valencia in June, 1990. At the time, district officials  said other schools would be switched to a year-round schedule as necessary to  accommodate growing enrollments.  </P> <P> But Monday night the trustees voted 3 to 2 to delay the change at least until  July, 1992, to study other ways to cope with added enrollment.  </P> <P> About 100 parents attended the meeting. Several speakers said year-round  schedules would disrupt children's friendships and make family vacations  impossible.  </P> <P> Under year-round scheduling, traditional summer vacations are eliminated and  vacation periods occur throughout the year. Students often are divided into  three or four "tracks" that attend class on a rotating basis, with one group on  vacation while the others are in school.  </P> <P> Several parents said the school district did not adequately inform parents  about the impact of year-round schools or the process by which the year-round  plan was developed.  </P> <P> "Parents very strongly feel they were not involved in the process," said Brian  Drygas of Valencia.  </P> <P> School Supt. Mike McGrath said the decision to delay year-round schooling in  the district will hurt its chance of obtaining construction funds from the  state for new schools. School districts using year-round schedules are given a  high priority in financing formulas used by state officials to dole out  construction funds. Only districts with schools damaged in fires, earthquakes  or other disasters receive a higher priority, McGrath said.  </P> <P> The district has 31 temporary classrooms -- structures similar to large  trailers -- on its six campuses. Without year-round schedules, the district  will have to install 16 more, McGrath said. He added that many parents also  complain about the temporary classrooms.  </P></p>

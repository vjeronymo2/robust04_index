			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik was to  leave for a working visit to Myjava and Senica today. However,  there was a change in his program, caused by the situation in  the Slovak National Council, where 35 deputies submitted a  proposal to express a vote of no confidence in Deputy Prime  Minister Roman Kovac.    Because the discussion of this point was expected today, as  had been announced in the morning by Government Office Spokesman  Lubomir Lintner, the presence in Bratislava of both these  representatives of the Cabinet is necessary.    Editor Zuzana Stukovska interviewed Prime Minister Jozef  Moravcik on this topic last night. She was interested, in  connection with the discussion about Roman Kovac in the  parliament, in whether the prime minister was concerned about  the image of the government he is heading.    [Begin recording] [Moravcik] I know Mr. Roman Kovac. I do  not think that fabrications--because I think they are only  fabrications--could jeopardize his position. I do not  underestimate our citizens in this regard, either, because they  will be able to make up their own minds about the matter.    [Stukovska] Tibor Cabaj, chairman of the HZDS [Movement for  a  Democratic Slovakia] Deputies' Club, confirmed to TASR [News  Agency of the Slovak Republic] that the Movement has at its  disposal actual evidence linking Roman Kovac to corruption.  Prime minister, if these findings are serious, will you ask the  deputy prime minister to resign?    [Moravcik] So far, I have not had the opportunity to  familiarize myself with these documents, and I do not think they  exist.    [Stukovska] In connection with your new post, you have  replied several times this week to the question whether or not,  by virtue of being elected chairman of the Democratic Union, you  were going against the philosophy on the basis of which the  current coalition government was formed--that is, the idea that  it would be a government without top party political leaders.  It appears, however, that your replies have not been altogether  convincing because Peter Weiss, chairman of the SDL [Party of  Democratic Left], said very clearly--I quote--I do not want to  dramatize this, but it means advantages to DEUS [Democratic  Union of Slovakia] in contrast to other partners in the  elections--end of quote. Prime minister, do you think that  this, on the surface, minor reproach means the beginning of  various coalition disagreements?    [Moravcik] Immediately after this, I contacted Mr. Weiss and  we discussed this topic. We arrived at the conclusion that this  fact cannot harm our mutual relations. This means that we know  how to deal with the new situation, and I firmly believe that  this assessment of the situation will last also in the future.  [passage omitted]    [Stukovska] So, you assume that you will not have to prove  that your new post will not make your party the favorite in the  early parliamentary elections?    [Moravcik] It should not. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

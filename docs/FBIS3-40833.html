Noting similarities in their  perceptions of global developments, India and Italy today agreed  to intensify contacts at the highest level of their foreign  offices. Views were also exchanged on ways to step up economic  cooperation--now that Italy is to participate in the Indian  Engineering Trade air in 1995 as a partner country, for the  second time in ten years.    The Foreign Ministers of both the countries, Mr. Dinesh  Singh  and Prof. Beniamino Andreatta, now here, held wide-ranging  discussions, covering bilateral and global issues, apart from  the developments in their respective regions. Prof. Andreatta  called on the President, Dr. S.D. Sharma, and met the Finance  Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh for talks on the specifics of  economic cooperation. Prof. Andreatta had earlier held economic  portfolios, as the Minister of Budget and Economic Planning and  the Minister of Treasury. His visit now is looked upon for a  deepening of economic relations. In June last year, the first  Indo-Italian Industrial Forum, held in Venice and inaugurated by  Dr. Manmohan Singh, was regarded a major success.    Measures to solve problems: According to an  official spokesman, Mr. Dinesh Singh briefed Prof. Andreatta on  steps taken by India to seek a peaceful solution of its problems  with Pakistan as also on the outlook of cooperation in South  Asia within the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional  Cooperation) framework. They also exchanged views on the  situation in the Central Asian republics, with Prof. Andreatta  welcoming India's growing cooperation with these countries as a  factor of stability.    The two Ministers welcomed the recent cooperation agreement  and the Joint Political statement between Indian and the  European Union, underlining the desire of the two sides to  intensify relations in economic and political fields. Also, they  exchanged views on the reform of the U.N., specially the  expansion of the Security Council, and the U.N. peace-keeping  operations, with particular reference to Somalia.    India's economic reforms were one of the subjects of  discussions with Dr. Manmohan Singh who expressed the hope for  the increased involvement of Italian business and industry in  the Indian market, taking full advantage of the new  opportunities for investment and joint ventures. They agreed  that steps needed to be taken to intensify contacts between  businessmen and to disseminate information regarding the  opportunities that had opened up.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: Italian government bonds lead market performance table Italy topped the government bond market performance league table in December, showing a gain of 5.3 per cent, and was the best performing market for the whole of 1993, with a return of 31.89 per cent in local currency terms, according to J. P. Morgan Securities. 'Italian government bonds rallied in December as local election results led to a lessening of political uncertainty, parliament passed an austere budget package for 1994, inflation continued to subside and further progress was made on establishing procedures for withholding tax refunds,' says J. P. Morgan Securities in its monthly report. Italy was also the top-performing bond market in US dollar terms last month, posting a gain of 4.95 per cent, although in dollar terms, the return was only 14.04 per cent for the year. The UK was the second-best performing government bond market in December, with a return of 3.59 per cent in local currency terms, helped by the better-than-expected November inflation figures and the November 30 budget announcements. Sweden ranked third with a gain of 2.82 per cent in local currency terms. Many of the other European government bond markets also showed healthy advances on the back of interest rate cuts, or expectations of lower interest rates, and lower inflation. Both Belgium and Denmark were able to cut official interest rates as their respective currencies strengthened against the D-Mark. The worst-performing bond markets in local currency terms were the US, with a gain of just 0.43 per cent, and Australia, with a rise of 1.31 per cent.</p>

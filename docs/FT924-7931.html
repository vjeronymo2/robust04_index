			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Shell Transport up 58% to Pounds 824m - Sterling devaluation bolsters Anglo/Dutch oil group's third quarter performance LARGE CURRENCY gains after the devaluation of sterling helped Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the Anglo-Dutch oil group, increase its third quarter profits by 58 per cent to Pounds 824m. The profits increase on a replacement cost basis, which strips out the effect of stockholding gains and losses, was higher than analysts' forecasts and the share price rose 12p to 549p. However, net income on a historic cost basis showed a slightly smaller increase of 38 per cent to Pounds 783m. Despite the strong third quarter, replacement cost profits for the first nine months of 1992 were down slightly at Pounds 2.26bn (Pounds 2.4bn). Sir Peter Holmes, chairman, said fourth quarter earnings were expected to benefit from a seasonal increase in natural gas sales, and higher oil production after the completion of North Sea maintenance programmes. He admitted that foreign currency earnings were higher than expected at Pounds 196m compared with Pounds 67m currency losses in the third quarter of 1991 when sterling appreciated against the dollar. Tax benefits and related interest contributed a further Pounds 80m. 'The figures are littered with exceptional items, both credits and debits, but the underlying performance was pretty much as we expected,' said Mr Nick Clayton, analyst at Smith New Court. Mr Clayton said an 18 per cent reduction in capital expenditure might be evidence of strict discipline on spending, but did not reflect any reduction in Shell's ability to spend. Surplus cashflow allowed the company to pay off Pounds 750m during the third quarter and reduce gearing to 5 per cent. Third quarter turnover was down slightly from Pounds 18.94bn to Pounds 17.72bn, but earnings from exploration and production beat expectations at Pounds 389m (Pounds 316m). Results were boosted by higher crude oil and natural gas prices, and production was slightly higher at 2.11m barrels a day. However, the refining and marketing division suffered a Pounds 65m fall in earnings to Pounds 303m. Analysts said the decline was not as large as had been feared, with continued pressures on refining margins offset by a better performance from marketing. Further deterioration in the petrochemicals market thanks to weak economic conditions was blamed for the chemical division's slide into a Pounds 40m loss (profit Pounds 12m). The coal and metals divisions also recorded losses compared with small profits last year. Earnings per share rose to 8.1p from a restated 5.9p. COMMENT Even without the currency gains and other credits, these results underline Shell's strength. Fourth quarter earnings should benefit from higher natural gas sales and a higher sterling oil price, with the dollar's strength against the pound more than offsetting the recent slide in dollar crude prices. But the downturn in refining, marketing and chemicals is likely to continue, and Shell is expected to make a provision of Pounds 400m-Pounds 450m to comply with the US Financial Accounting Standards Board's statement 106, which requires companies to show their future healthcare obligations to retirees, rather than what they are actually paying out in any given year. However, Shell should still outperform the market on earnings and dividend growth over the medium term, and is seen as a good devaluation hedge as the link with Royal Dutch means that as sterling weakens against the guilder, the dividend rises to compensate.</p>

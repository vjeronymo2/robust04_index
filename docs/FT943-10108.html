			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Books: Male torso appeal FLESH AND THE IDEAL: WINCKELMANN AND THE ORIGINS OF ART HISTORY by Alex Potts Yale University Press Pounds 29.95, 294 pages Johann Joachim Winckelmann became immensely famous in the late 18th century as a result of his writings on Greek and Roman sculpture - above all, his History of the Art of Antiquity (1764). A striking feature of these writings is his rapturous enthusiasm for the smooth-limbed, boyish, naked male body, as exemplified by the sinuous torso of the Belvedere Antinous in the Vatican, illustrated on the cover of Flesh and the Ideal. Winckelmann is well-known, too, for his declaration that his life only began when he left behind a gloomy existence in Saxony and devoted himself to hedonism and self-realisation in Rome; he described his dalliances with young Italian boys as research into 'living beauty' that supplemented his work as an antiquarian scholar. Unsurprisingly, then, cultural historians have often emphasised his role in consolidating a tradition of homoerotic fantasy that centres on visions of untrammelled desire in the warm south. In this book, Alex Potts approaches such themes obliquely and cautiously. Eighteenth-century accounts of the classical ideal are, he observes, more often concerned with the female nude, which 'is constituted almost exclusively as an object of delectation for the male viewer'. For Winckelmann, in contrast, the male nude supplies a more complex and enthralling focus of erotic fantasy: not merely 'a thing to be gazed at' for gratification, but also 'a mythic image of perfectly integrated manhood', with which the viewer can identify. Elaborating on this image of manhood, Winckelmann devotes much of his attention to figures such as the Antinous, which appear calmly self-absorbed, lost in an 'enjoyment of self in which the senses are gathered inwards and withdrawn from any external object'. In identifying with such figures, the spectator identifies with their state of narcissistic self-contentment, in which all potentially disruptive desires and passions are suspended. The wish to regress to such a state, Potts cogently points out, is 'hardly distinctively homosexual'. He makes a similar point in discussing Winckelmann's presentation of the great ideal nudes - not only the self-absorbed Antinous but also, for example, the more active Apollo Belvedere - as figures that seem 'to require no female other'. This 'blanking out of the feminine' is, he argues, given its 'charge and necessity' not by the critic's homosexuality, but by a more general 'male disavowal of femininity, or a fear of castration as Freud would have it, operating in the dominantly heterosexual culture of his period'. In setting Winckelmann within this wider context of 18th-century masculinity, Flesh and the Ideal is unapologetically concerned with male rather than female desire. And throughout the book, Potts is at pains to emphasise the fascination with violence lurking within the ideal of classical calm: he notes Winckelmann's dramatic elaboration of a response to the Apollo Belvedere that entails not only identifying with the power of the god but also experiencing a frisson of masochistic subjection to him. Flesh and the Ideal faces a major problem of presentation: the classical sculptures that Winckelmann so rapturously describes have, since the late 18th century, come to be seen by many as dry and insipid. Artists of the 1960s, far from happily 'imagining being seduced, even violated, by the Apollo Belvedere', in the manner of the 18th-century man of taste, rudely dislodged plaster casts of them from their established place in art schools. Potts makes vigorous attempts to seize the imagination of contemporary readers, and offers a wide array of interesting starting-points and helpful pieces of analysis. Often, however, the book resembles a fragmented series of essays: the reader waits in vain for a moment when the full excitement of the project as a whole will become apparent. The author makes his task yet more difficult by saying very little about the literary qualities of Winckelmann's writings - the language of erotic longing and febrile speculation in which his vision is traced out. This lack of interest is not, perhaps, a mere coincidence: for all his emphasis on the darker, more disturbing side of the classical ideal, Potts is himself, in his prose style, surprisingly unimpassioned.</p>

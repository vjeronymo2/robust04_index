			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Tokyo shares fall 3.6% amid coalition fears The surfacing of policy differences in Japan's seven-party coalition government and rumours of a snap election were blamed for a 3.6 per cent dip in Tokyo stock prices yesterday, the largest fall in the Nikkei average this year. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has delayed the compilation of the budget for the next fiscal year, as the Social Democratic party, the largest group in the coalition, opposed changes to the taxation system proposed by Mr Hosokawa and other members of the coalition. Confidence was also shaken by the absence yesterday of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the power broker behind the coalition. Mr Ozawa, who is said to be suffering from influenza, has been in poor health in the past year and there were fears that a prolonged illness would lead to the collapse of the coalition. After an hour's trading today the Nikkei average was only slightly down on last night's close of 17,404.24. Yesterday's fall came amid relatively thin trading and followed weeks of jumpiness. This, in part, has reflected the moods of the coalition partners, whose differences over political reform, trade and taxation policy are becoming more obvious. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the chief cabinet secretary, said the government was watching the stock market closely and regarded the Nikkei average as an important indicator of the economy's health. He suggested that Mr Hosokawa would announce fresh policies later this week in an attempt to stimulate growth. The government is considering a cut in income taxes, though Mr Hosokawa is in favour of an increase in the country's 3 per cent value-added tax to compensate for the reduction. However, the SDP insists that it will oppose an increase from 3 per cent, and could withdraw from the coalition over the issue. It is feared that unless the government cuts income taxes, personal consumption will fall sharply over the next couple of months. The Ministry of Labour said yesterday that employees in large companies received a 0.3 per cent cut in their winter bonuses this year, the first fall since 1975. The trimming of the winter bonus follows a 0.9 per cent decrease in the summer bonus, the first fall in both payments since the ministry began conducting its survey in 1965.</p>

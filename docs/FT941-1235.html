			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (10): Well-spent money beats the recession - New tools for cutting sheet metal have kept a 40 year-old company perennially young / Profile: LVD of Belgium The best way to come out of a recession is to innovate,' says Mr Jean-Pierre Lefebvre, president of LVD, Belgium's biggest machine tool producer and a manufacturer of machines that cut, bend and punch holes in sheet metal. Most machine tool builders agree, but not all have been able to achieve that in the past two years of virtually worldwide gloom in the capital equipment industry. Throughout this period LVD has continued investing in more new products than ever. But LVD, founded in the early 1950s and based at Gullegem, is not the average machine tool builder. With turnover of about Pounds 60m and 900 employees worldwide, it is significantly bigger than the norm in the industry. Yet it remains in the control of the three founding families - Mr Lefebvre is son of one of the founders. LVD's location in what was predominantly an agricultural area has created a sense of independence, preferring to make components rather than buy in. With no outside shareholders to worry about, LVD has been able to take a very long-term view of its future needs, says Mr Lefebvre. But he is not dogmatic about keeping the company privately-held. So far, LVD has managed an almost unblemished record of year-on-year growth in turnover, which peaked in 1989. However, the downturn since then has been relatively mild by machine tool industry standards. Sales in 1992, when the company made its first ever loss, were down 4.5 per cent on 1990 levels. The company failed to return to profit last year when sales fell a further 12-13 per cent to about BFr2.6bn. But that was still about 25 per cent higher than in 1987. The company has built its success on a policy of product and geographical diversification in sheet-metal machinery, to protect itself from overdependence on any one sector. It has also been careful to control its worldwide distribution channels with sales and service sites in all major markets, rather than having too many agents. The relatively wide product range for a company making metal-forming machines means that LVD cannot throw as much money on individual product areas as some of its larger competitors, notably Trumpf of Germany and Amada of Japan. It also has to fund the relatively costly systems for its machines, which it has been using for the past 20 years to differentiate its products from its rivals'. The development of new products or entry into new markets, therefore, is an area where LVD has little margin for error. It regularly spends 7-8 per cent of sales on research and development, and always likes to have new products ready for when a recession ends. It has consequently looked to acquisitions and technical co-operation to help develop its range rather than concentrate totally on internal R&amp;D. Another development has been a shift in manufacturing strategy. Employment at Gullegem has fallen from 670 to 600 since 1990 because of the recession and the need to raise productivity.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Phnom Penh REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA in  Cambodian on 11 June carries a 650-word item saying that  "according to a report, a government for national salvation will  be set up to replace the current royal government." The report  quotes a "high-ranking official in the royal government" as  saying that "Samdech Sihanouk will become head of state with  power and the throne left to his son" and that "this new  government, called the national salvation government, will be  led by a prime minister who is a neutral personality." The  paper adds that there is as yet no clear indication as to who  would be the candidate for the post of prime minister. The  paper goes on to say that analysts consider this plan a ploy to  create further confusion and an attempt to revive the almost  doomed roundtable talks.    The paper concludes by saying: "Although there is no  official reaction yet from the two Samdech Prime Ministers, it  is believed that the sole reason for this plan is to bring the  Khmer Rouge into this new government! And it is certain that  the royal government will not accept this plan. It is still  remembered that students and the association of monks from  Kampuchea Kraom [former Cambodian territory now part of southern  Vietnam] recently demanded to stage a demonstration to hand over  power to the king; however, this demand was thwarted."</p>

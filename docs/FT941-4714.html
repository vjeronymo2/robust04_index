			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / MPs may question Thatcher over Pergau MPs investigating Britain's offer of Pounds 234m of aid for Malaysia's Pergau dam have not ruled out the prospect of summoning Baroness Thatcher before them in the next few weeks to answer questions on the affair. Members of the Commons foreign affairs committee, which is investigating the aid deal, discussed the possibility of summoning the former prime minister at a private meeting yesterday. The committee confirmed that Lord Howe, foreign secretary when an offer of aid to Malaysia was first discussed, had agreed to give evidence to the committee in the next two weeks. It agreed that a final decision on whether to ask Lady Thatcher to give testimony would be taken after his appearance. One committee member said yesterday: 'We discussed Lady Thatcher, but we decided it would be premature to make a decision at this stage. We want to see how we progress.' The committee has interviewed the main participants in the decision to go ahead with the aid deal, including Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and Lord Younger, who as defence secretary signed a Pounds 1bn arms deal which was 'briely entangled' with the aid package in March 1988. The committee's report should be finished in May or June. Some committee members believe that more evidence is needed to shed light on decision-making on the aid offer, which was described by a senior Foreign Office official as an 'abuse' of the aid system. The committee also agreed yesterday to call officials from Balfour Beatty and Cementation, the construction companies that were contracted to help build the dam. It will also take evidence from pressure groups including Friends of the Earth and the World Development Movement. A spokeswoman for Lady Thatcher said yesterday that she was 'not saying anything on this subject whatsoever' and she did not comment on invitations until they had been received. Meanwhile, BICC, the British cables and construction group which owns Balfour Beatty, said it had received assurances that a Pounds 70m civil engineering contract for work on the new Pounds 3bn Kuala Lumpur airport would not be affected by Malaysia's ban on UK companies participating in new government contracts. Balfour Beatty said it had a letter of intent covering earthworks at the airport site before the ban was imposed. Sir Robin Biggam, BICC's chairman, said Mr Peter Mason, Balfour Beatty's chief executive, had visited Malaysia last week and was told by the government it wanted Balfour to go ahead with the project. On prospects for further contracts Sir Robin said: 'The future is uncertain but we are hoping for the best.' Alexander Nicoll writes: British exports to Asia rose 29 per cent last year to about Pounds 13bn from Pounds 10bn in 1992, and the region is receiving higher priority in the commercial efforts of the Foreign Office, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said yesterday.

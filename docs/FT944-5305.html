			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Bosnia group's peace efforts falter Foreign ministers from the US, its European allies and Russia called last night for a ceasefire throughout Bosnia but failed to come up with any new ideas for promoting peace. The failure came in the wake of another ill-tempered row between Nato and the UN over Bosnia with the UN unsuccessfully pressing the alliance to scale down its air activity. After a longer-than-expected meeting the so-called contact group on Bosnia - comprising the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany - reaffirmed their existing peace plan which would divide Bosnia 51-49 between a Croat-Moslem federation and a Serb zone. They also confirmed the idea that Bosnia must at least continue to exist as a state within its current borders. However, ministers failed to bridge the group's internal differences on some central questions, and failed to spell out any new threats or incentives to the warring parties. Mr Andre Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, said: 'Of course not as much was achieved as would have been desirable.' But he welcomed the fact that the US had joined its partners in ruling out military solutions and supporting the continued presence of UN forces in Bosnia. The five ministers failed to bridge their differences on how Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic should be rewarded if he makes further concessions to the peace process. The lack of new ideas came as Nato pledged to continue military flights over Bosnia, in spite of a request from the UN to scale them down, in the latest in a series of rows between the two international organisations. The Nato flights, designed to police the skies over Bosnia, highlight the military alliance's intention to remain active in the region. However, UN officials have accused Nato of 'cowboy tactics' in the air which have complicated negotiations with the Bosnian Serbs. In a bid to salvage the UN mission in Bosnia and secure the release of some 500 detained peacekeepers, Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy, met Bosnian Serb leaders in Pale, their stronghold above Sarajevo. He said last night they had agreed to release the peacekeepers detained after Nato air strikes two weeks ago. Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, was concerned earlier yesterday about the impact of upgraded Serb anti-aircraft missiles on the policing flights. He said there could be some 'operational changes'.</p>

This interim rule also updates information on the laboratories qualified to perform aflatoxin testing of shelled peanuts. Allowing peanut handlers to commingle certain seed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> peanut lots reduces the space and costs needed to store seed peanuts. Updating laboratory information should assist handlers in moving peanuts to market. These changes are intended to bring the non-signatory handling requirements into conformity with those specified in the Agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This interim final rule is effective August 30, 1994.

This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. This action is not intended to have retroactive effect. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 45 handlers of peanuts who have not signed the Agreement who are subject to the regulations contained herein. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. It is estimated that most of the handlers are small entities. Most producers doing business with these handlers are also small entities. Small agricultural producers have been defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1993, the reported U.S. production, mostly covered under the Agreement, was approximately 3.33 billion pounds of peanuts, a 22 percent decrease from 1992 and the lowest level since 1983. The preliminary 1993 peanut crop value is $991.65 million, 77 percent of the 1992 crop value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After aflatoxin was found in peanuts in the mid-1960's, the domestic peanut industry has sought to minimize aflatoxin contamination in peanuts and peanut products. Under authority of the Act, Peanut Marketing Agreement No. 146 and the Peanut Administrative Committee (Committee) were established by the Secretary in 1965. The Agreement was signed by a majority of domestic peanut handlers. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

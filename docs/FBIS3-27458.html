As long ago as 1986, a large number of labourers from 25  provinces and cities in China began pouring into the capital in  search of work in such industries as construction, environmental  work and coal. Of the 1.5 million [figure as received]  labourers coming from elsewhere, nearly one million of them live  in the capital on a more or less permanent basis. Some 800,000  of them are engaged in various kinds of economic activities with  300,000 of them working in construction on such projects as the  construction of buildings, 81 flyovers and 3,000 kilometres of  roads. Such labourers from outside the capital are also engaged  in production, processing and repair services.    Apart from those engaged in the urban area, there are yet  another 200,000 of them in the suburban areas engaged in  agriculture, hand-finished products and domestic service.</p>

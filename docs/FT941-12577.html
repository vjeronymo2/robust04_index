			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Boost in exports narrows non-EU trade deficit Rising exports helped the UK narrow its visible trade deficit with countries outside the European Union in December. The seasonally adjusted deficit of Pounds 675m, compared with Pounds 773m in November, was slightly better than analysts' expectations. Exports to non-EU countries were Pounds 5.01bn in December, up from Pounds 4.78bn in November, while imports were Pounds 5.69bn (Pounds 5.55bn), according to figures published by the Central Statistical Office yesterday. The total deficit for non-EU visible trade last year was Pounds 9.54bn, compared with Pounds 9.75bn in 1992. If oil and erratic items such as precious stones are excluded, December's deficit was Pounds 450m, down from Pounds 689m in November. The annual deficit excluding oil and erratics rose slightly to Pounds 7.62bn, compared with Pounds 7.47bn in 1992. Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley, yesterday pointed out that the value figures for UK exports have continued to grow at a faster rate than the volume statistics, indicating that UK companies have taken the opportunity of a lower pound to improve their margins. In volume terms exports (excluding oil and erratics) were 12 per cent higher in the last three months of 1993 than they were in the fourth quarter of 1992 while imports were 10 per cent ahead. In value terms, non-oil and erratic exports were 27 per cent higher in the fourth quarter of last year than in the same period in 1992 and imports were 12 per cent higher. The figures back up the export confidence displayed in the Confederation of British Industry's quarterly survey of industrial trends, published earlier this week. In the three months to December, exports of finished manufactures were 28 per cent higher, in value terms, than in the fourth quarter of 1992.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NON-EU TRADE BEATS EXPECTATIONS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Balance of payments basis, seasonally adjusted (Pounds m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                Ex oil and erratics*              Exports   Imports   Balance   Exports   Imports   Balance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992          46,682    56,431    -9,749    40,624    48,097    -7,473 1993          57,232    66,771    -9,539    49,815    57,432    -7,617 1993 Q1       13,600    16,730    -3,130    11,749    14,018    -2,269      Q2       14,141    16,297    -2,156    12,036    14,025    -1,989      Q3       14,526    16,953    -2,427    12,604    14,451    -1,847      Q4       14,965    16,791    -1,826    13,426    14,938    -1,512 July           4,828     5,582      -754     4,176     4,840      -664 August         4,884     5,620      -736     4,209     4,735      -526 September      4,814     5,751      -937     4,219     4,876      -657 October        5,174     5,552      -378     4,610     4,983      -373 November       4,781     5,554      -773     4,280     4,969      -689 December       5,010     5,685      -675     4,536     4,986      -450  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Defined as ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver.

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Philippines, Westinghouse talks fail Philippine negotiations with Westinghouse Electric of the US to settle court cases in the US and Switzerland over construction of a nuclear power plant have collapsed, according to Mr Delfin Lazaro, energy secretary. The negotiators described Westinghouse's position in the talks as 'contrary to the country's dignity, interests and laws'. The Philippines will now pursue claims filed against Westinghouse before the International Arbitration Court in Geneva. It will also appeal a case it had filed in a US court against Westinghouse alleging the US company had used bribery to win the contract. The New Jersey federal district court last May cleared Westinghouse of the charge. The appeal will be filed on December 20.</p>

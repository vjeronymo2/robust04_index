			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 15 (TANJUG) -- The Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia Prime Minister, Radoje Kontic, has called for the  extension of the mandate of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  in the U.N. protected areas (UNPAs) (Krajina), which expires on  March 31, 1994, and set out that the "UNPROFOR presence in the  UNPAs is necessary until a political settlement is reached."    The Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) was proclaimed a U.N.  protected area under the plan of special U.N. envoy for the  former Yugoslavia Cyrus Vance in March 1992, after the  Krajina-Croatia conflict broke out in 1991 because of Croatia's  forcible secession from the former Yugoslavia.    The RSK, which comprises predominantly Serb-populated areas  within the administrative borders of the former Yugoslav  republic of Croatia, was proclaimed in response to Croatia's  forcible secession and the attempt of its authorities to reduce  the Serb people to a national minority.    Kontic said in a letter sent to U.N. Secretary-General  Butrus  Butrus-Ghali that U.N. resolution 871 of October 4, 1993, under  which the UNPROFOR's mandate was extended until March 31, 1994,  envisaged that the U.N. peace-keepers "remain in the UNPAs until  a comprehensive political settlement of the Yugoslav crisis is  found."    In the letter, a copy of which was sent to TANJUG on  Tuesday,  Kontic said that resolution 871 also envisaged that the  "UNPROFOR mandate is to be renewed if such a solution is not  achieved through negotiations."    "It is not necessary to make special mention of the  importance of the UNPROFOR presence in the past, since it was  precisely UNPROFOR that has ensured the consistent  implementation of the Vance plan, enabled the maintenance of  fragile peace and prevented further confrontation of the parties  in conflict," Kontic said in the letter.    The Yugoslav prime minister set out that the "F.R. of  Yugoslavia considers that conditions have not yet been created  for terminating the UNPROFOR peace mission and that the UNPROFOR  presence in the UNPAs is necessary until a political settlement  is reached."    The letter said that if new U.N. troops were to be engaged  or  regularly replaced, it would, "for historical reasons, be  inappropriate to engage troops" from neighbouring countries or  former occupying forces.    The Yugoslav prime minister said that the "F.R.Y. supports  the Vance plan and is interested" that it be fully respected and  implemented by all parties. Kontic said that Yugoslavia would  "strive to facilitate the UNPROFOR peace mission in the former  Yugoslavia and contribute, within the limits of its  possibilities, to reducing the costs of the peace mission."</p>

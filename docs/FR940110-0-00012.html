			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second change that the committees recommended concerns Form 3 (Daily Manifest Report of Oranges Subject to Allotment). Currently, sections 907.71 and 908.71 of the orange orders provide that handlers furnish to the committees information regarding cartons of oranges handled, segregated by size, within 24 hours of shipment. Handlers must also indicate whether the shipments were destined to points in the U.S. and Alaska or Canada. Sections 907.141 and 908.141 of the orders' rules and regulations require handlers to submit this information for rail car shipments on Form 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information collected on Form 3 is similar to the information collected on Form 8 described earlier, but pertains to rail car shipments rather than truck shipments. Again, this information has historically been utilized primarily for tracking and verifying shipments of oranges that were subject to volume regulation. However, with the volume regulation features of the orders suspended, the committees believe that continued submission of Form 3, like Form 8, creates an additional burden on handlers that is unnecessary. Handlers are also required to submit similar information on rail car shipments on the weekly Form 4. As with size information pertaining to truck shipments, the committees plan on requesting size information from handlers for rail car shipments on a voluntary basis until the weekly Form 4 is appropriately revised.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Like Form 8, the committees believe that continued submission of Form 3, particularly during periods of no volume regulation, is not necessary. Accordingly, the committees have recommended suspending &sect;&sect;907.71 and 908.71 of the orders and &sect;&sect;907.141 and 908.141 of the orders' rules and regulations so that Form 3 will be discontinued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB numbers 0581&hyph;0116 for navel oranges and 0581&hyph;0121 for Valencia oranges. This rule will reduce the reporting burden on approximately 265 handlers of navel and Valencia oranges who have been completing Form 8, taking about .40 hour to complete each report. This rule will also reduce the reporting burden on about 80 orange handlers who ship by rail at some point during a season and utilize Form 3, taking about 0.20 hours to complete each report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the committee's recommendation, and other available information, it is found that the provisions detailed below, at this time, do not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this action into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  because: (1) Handlers are currently shipping navel oranges and these actions will reduce the burden of information collection placed on such handlers; (2) the committees unanimously recommended these actions at public meetings and all interested persons had an opportunity to provide input; (3) these actions relax reporting requirements; (4) California-Arizona orange handlers are aware of this action and need no additional time to comply with the relaxed requirements; and (5) this action provides a 30-day comment period and any comments received will be considered prior to finalization of this action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Parts 907 and 908  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Marketing agreements, Oranges, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR parts 907 and 908 are amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 907_NAVEL ORANGES GROWN IN ARIZONA AND DESIGNATED  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PARTS OF CALIFORNIA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

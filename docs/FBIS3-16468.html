Arguing with advocates of a state of economic emergency in  Russia, Professor Aleksandr Livshits, head of the Russian  president's expert group, writes in the TRUD newspaper that 'the  country needs, among other things, an appropriate law to impose  a state of economic emergency in the country.    'The law would lay down under what conditions the state of  emergency is imposed, for what period, what measures are being  enacted and who takes the decision.' Livshits pointed out the  absence of such a law at present.    Therefore, he claims, 'the imposition of a state of economic  emergency in our country is out of the question.' Noting that  the Russian parliament should decide what laws should be drafted  and adopted, the expert stressed the priority need for creating  a legal basis for reforms.    Livshits expressed opinion that 'talks about emergency  measures are groundless and even undesirable, since they can  promote destabilization in society.' Describing the present  situation in the Russian economy as 'difficult', the expert  stressed that 'the government should keep the situation under  control, implement the present programs thoughtfully, including  work on structural reorganization.    'On the other hand, a return to administrative mechanisms of  government and a freeze on prices and wages would lead the  country to a quick collapse'.    Commenting on the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan,  Nikolay Medvedev, head of the president's office division on  work with territories, says in an interview with NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA that the treaty is really a qualitatively new basid  document recording both the delimitation of subjects of  authority as well as mutual delegation of powers between the  federation and its member republic.    He expressed opinion that the treaty with Tatarstan 'will be  both a stabilising factor and work done for the country's  future.' 'We have shown an ability to find the way out of  really deadlocked situations and what's the main thing -- a  desire to come to agreement,' Medvedev stressed.    In the opinion of the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper, ' the  countryside should not be fenced off with a bureaucratic wall  from the market. At the same time, peasants should not be  herded, in 'the bright past'.    The newspaper expresses regret in a report from a meeting of  the government commission on urgent matters that the favorable  period for the state's timely aid to the countryside has passed.    'The state in the person of the finance ministry has turned  to be unable to return debts in time,' ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI writes,  noting that the state now owes 1,300 billion rubles to the  countryside 'for already consumed produce.'    Writing in the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper, Margarita  Maximova,  senior researcher of the institute of world economics and  international relations, claims that only economically strong  and politically stable Russia can become a driving force for the  integration of former Soviet republics.    Examining versions for cooperation within the Commonwealth,  the scholar draws the conclusion that discrepancy between the  interests of Russia and other CIS countries is no barrier to the  rapprochement.    'World experience shows that any interstate alliance was and  is based, above all, on the balance on interests of its  participants,' Maximova stresses.    Reporting the publication of the book 'The Last Soviet  Government', the PRAVDA newspaper writes that 'the last the  ministers of the Soviet Union are convinced that they stepped  down unvanquished and unhumiliated'.    The newspaper features opinions of nine former ministers  Nikolay Ryzhkov, Leonid Abalkin, Vadim Bakatin and others on  events in Russia.    Under the headline 'Interview with a woman called Soviet  Jeanne d'Arc', PRAVDA outlines views of former Soviet legislator  Sazhi Umalatova on the situaion in Russia. 'The people will  learn to protect their rights later of sooner,' she stresses.    Expressing joy over the recent release of inmates for the  Lefortovo and Matrosskaya Tishina prisons as a result of the  amnesty proclaimed by parliament, Umalatova stated that  'Hysteria concerning unpredictable consequences to be caused by  the amnesty of opposition politicians is not accidental.'    'The same 'scenario writers' stir up trouble, trying to  split  society and to provoke opposition for drastic actions in order  to bring tanks back,' she claims.    Under the title 'In the Footsteps of Terminator', the  SOVETYSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper describes particulars of a  massacre at a Russian border post on Tanfilev Island (Russian  Far East), including a commentary by Colonel-General Nikolayev,  commander-in-chief of Russian Border troops, on this deplorable  event.</p>

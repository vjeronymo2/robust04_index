The IAEA team had studied the possibility of leaving some  inspectors behind to handle the transport of equipment and  samples weighing about 300 kilograms, but decided against it,  the officials said.    An IAEA official stressed that the idea of leaving some  members behind had been contemplated purely because of equipment  shipping problems. He said he understood that the inspection  work had proceeded without a hitch so far.    The official added, however, that he did not know whether  the  team had carried out all of its inspection plans.    One of the inspectors has already gone to Vienna and the  remaining six are scheduled to return on Thursday via Beijing.    The IAEA's nuclear safeguards bureau will receive a report  from the team before submitting its own report to  Director-General Hans Blix on whether there was any change in  the North Korean situation. The report will help determine the  need for convening a special Board of Governors meeting, they  said.    At the regular Board of Governors meeting in February, the  IAEA agreed to call a special meeting if the inspection team's  activities were restricted or if it determined that continuity  in nuclear safeguards had been disrupted in North Korea.</p>

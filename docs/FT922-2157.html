			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (25): Orders at the press of a button - Trading data with business partners EDI (electronic data interchange) systems, which rely on telecommunications, can create information networks between retailers and manufacturers, allowing both to align their operations more closely to sales patterns. These networks replace laborious paperwork by transferring orders and invoices between computers in the retailer's depot and those in their supplier's warehouse - all at the press of a button. Users of these systems range from high street food retailers to air-cargo operators, as applications have developed rapidly over the past two years, according to Ovum, a consultancy specialising in telecommunications market and policy work. In its latest EDI market forecasts for Europe, Ovum suggests that growth is close to 45 per cent a year. Although the UK has led the way in EDI applications, the rest of Europe is catching up fast. Two years ago, Britain accounted for 60 per cent of European EDI-users. Now, the proportion is down to 40 per cent. This trend is expected to accelerate sharply with the wider European market as companies, large and small, realise the benefits of using EDI technology. The number of users in the UK was 12,000 in 1991 and is expected to reach 65,000 by 1995 according to both Ovum and BIS Strategic Decisions. The latter further projects that the number of European users will have reached 110,000 by 1996. Only about two per cent of European EDI traffic is international - both within and outside of Europe - according to industry analysts. Nevertheless, international traffic is likely to grow faster in Europe than elsewhere due to the progress of European trade initiatives. The EC's Trade Electronic Data Interchange systems programme, TEDIS (launched in 1987) was instrumental during its three-year span to 1990 in creating the infrastructure for the launch of the EDI concept in Europe. The second phase, lasting until 1995, is supported by an EC budget of Ecu 25m and will consolidate the advances made in the fields of standardisation, telecommunications, law, security and services in general. Ovum, in conjunction with Belgium consultancy, XCOMS International, has been awarded the TEDIS European EDI Inventory Project. This will gather data from a number of organisations, both national and international, currently engaged in EDI activities. The information will be computerised and updated during the 3 1/2 years of the TEDIS II programme. The outcome should be be the most up-to-date and reliable source of EDI information: this database is designed to become a standard reference point for EDI developers, service providers, public bodies and private companies throughout Europe. Information from this project could well be of immense value to potential users and thus boost EDI usage. In the UK, INS and AT&amp;T Istel, dominate specific sectors - the former being the key player in retail and distribution; the latter in manufacturing. The INS 'EDI Community' has a membership of 3,252. Its list of members is classified into 'trading clusters,' ie organisations using INS' EDI Services to exchange commercial documents. However, one of the problems in this apparently neat and tidy classification is that many companies on the list actually use its services to trade electronically with several trading clusters. Thus, INS recognises that industry-by-industry vertical demarcations are breaking down even though there is no universal inter-connectivity. The challenge, according to Michael Naughton, chairman of Applied Network Research, is 'the 80/20 rule of EDI - 80 per cent of your transactions are with 20 per cent of your suppliers. But, what about the remaining 20 per cent - do they stay manual?' The trading partnership between MD Foods and Tesco is a good example of the up-side of that rule. One of the world's top dairy producers - the Danish company, MD Foods - was the first of Tesco's overseas suppliers to join the growing EDI community by taking advantage of INS-Tradanet's international facility. It is owned by the 14,000 diary farmers who annually supply it with 70,000 tonnes of butter (its Lurpak butter accounts for nearly 20 per cent of the UK market), as well as more than 200,000 tonnes of cheese. Though electronic trading is not new to MD Foods, the company's marketing systems manager Aksel Poulstrup points out: 'Electronic data interchange is very important to us. Tesco is the first of our international customers to trade electronically with us, but we're keen to extend the use of EDI to other retailers in the UK and Europe. 'In doing so, we can capitalise on the substantial technical benefits that we have already seen on a domestic scale.' Even though it is relatively easy to extend its utility by adding additional users and services, the down-side of the rule, is the cost of entry for newcomers - especially in management time. As Digital points out: 'The key to successful EDI implementation is careful planning. Technology alone is not enough. 'EDI implementations require 80 per cent management focus and only 20 per cent technology focus. Without the right approach, the process can be slow and adversely effect your business efficiency.' Thus, as with computers systems in the past, the blind adoption of technology will not always guarantee the benefits needed to compete in the marketplace.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Feb 10, BNS -- The Estonian parliament  today with 69 votes for adopted a statement to protest against  the "deepening imperialistic tendencies" in Russian foreign  policy, which place the Baltic states in Russia's sphere of  influence.    "Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has systematically  been justifying the continued presence of Russian troops on  Estonian territory against the will of the Estonian people and  in violation of norms of international law," the lawmakers said  in the statement.    The statement maintains that Russian government members'  anti- Estonian statements are inconsistent with the U.N. Charter  and the CSCE final acts, which Russia must observe in its  foreign policy.    The parliament draws the attention of all states'  legislatures to the fact that Russia assumed at the CSCE  Helsinki summit in 1992 the obligation to withdraw its troops  from the Baltic states "in an orderly manner, speedily and  completely" without additional conditions. Since the obligation  vis-a-vis Estonia and Latvia hasn't been fulfilled, the  development of Estonian-Russian relations has come to a stop,  the statement notes.</p>

It must  strengthen ties with Deutsche Telekom. The strategy: new  commercial and tariff policies, and diversification into  computer services.    Is France Telecom doomed to suffer the fate of the  dinosaurs?  Will the telecommunications operator be able to evolve enough to  survive in an environment of turbulent competition? Everywhere  in the telecommunications industry, rumors are flying of  colossal alliances between public operators, cable operators,  and computer builders. Last June, Brussels gave a further push  to change in the European communications landscape. Beginning in  1998, all telecommunications services will be open to  competition from companies anywhere in the Community. Still  basking in the comfort of its virtually untouched monopoly of  the domestic market, France Telecom has a big job ahead of it.  It must throw off the yoke of its status as a  government-controlled corporation, which is a handicap in  concluding international alliances and adapting to changing  markets. It must also improve responsiveness to demands of a  clientele that recognizes its technical prowess but grumbles  about its tariffs and marketing approach. Finally, it has yet to  prove its strategy of investing in computer services is  pertinent and profitable. The challenges are tremendous --but so  is the explosive expansion of the market.  <H5>  Open to Competition </H5>   "It is always more difficult to try to change when all the  indicators are positive." Charles Rozmaryn, general manager of  France Telecom, points out that the French operator is in fact  doing very well just now. In 1992, the French telecommunications  market was 180 billion French francs [Fr], plus more than Fr40  billion in investments. France Telecom was responsible for more  than 98.5 percent of turnover in services, according to Marc  Dandelot, consultant to the government and author of a report on  the sector prepared for the minister of industry. But this  position of strength in the domestic market is changing. Several  years ago, the French mobile telephone market was opened up with  the entry of SFR, a subsidiary of Generale des Eaux [General  Water Company].    In the local area network [LAN] market, competitors such as  BT [British Telecoms], Unisource, Cable &amp; Wireless, and IBM  are  trying to carve out positions.    France Telecom also has a long way to go at the  international  level. Overseas sales accounted for 15 percent of turnover in  1992 (total turnover was Fr121.5 billion, with 168,000 employees  and net profits of Fr3 billion). The approximately Fr5 billion  invested outside of France was devoted mostly to purchase of  market shares in foreign countries, often in conjunction with  privatization processes. Narrowly focused partnerships have also  been concluded with the Americans. For example, the French  operator is collaborating with US West in promoting Minitel  [home terminal of the French telecommunications system], and  with Bell South in France's cellular market. But major accords  remain to be concluded. In coping with tumultuous change, its  first challenge is to revamp its own charter. An initial step  was taken in July 1990 with legislation that gave it  administrative autonomy vis-a-vis the state. But the degree of  autonomy it currently enjoys is sometimes very problematic, as  demonstrated by the amount of money it was obliged to inject  into the capital of CEA-Industrie and Bull, in which it now  holds a 17.7 percent share. The pace of change was accelerated  last June when the European Community fixed 1 January 1998 as  the date for inaugurating free competition on the voice  telephony market, which is responsible for 80 percent of France  Telecom's turnover. This is why the government plans next spring  to submit legislation to Parliament revising the operator's  charter, turning it into a limited-liability company with the  state as majority shareholder. Changing the status of employees  will be an especially sensitive affair. The sizable mobilization  in connection with the 12 October strike was a powerful reminder  of that.    At the same time as France Telecom is reforming its charter  and implementing the necessary rate restructuring, it must also  find supports and the partners needed for growth in overseas  markets. Deutsche Telekom is currently the keystone of this  international push. "Since the creation of Eucom in 1987 as a  vehicle for providing value-added services, the presidents of  our two enterprises, Marcel Roulet and Helmut Ricke, have met  together periodically. Their frequent meetings have generated a  feeling of real confidence," says Udo Huck, president of the  French subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom. In addition to Eucom, the  two operators in late 1991 launched Eunetcom (which specializes  in LAN outsourcing). A joint subsidiary, Eunetcom has just  recently begun to take shape with the naming in September of  Claude Olier as general manager. According to Huck, the two  parent companies have several good reasons for pursuing their  collaboration. First of all, BT, Europe's other major operator,  has found an important partner in MCI (United States). Second,  AT&amp;T -- by reason of its ambitions and its dual hats, as both  operator and integrator --looms as a "dangerous partner."  Finally, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom are about the same  size, though the German firm is slightly larger. "This means our  strategic partnership doesn't run the risk that one partner or  the other will become dominant," notes the head of Deutsche  Telekom in France, adding that their respective spheres of  expertise and the distribution of their physical assets on the  ground are fairly complementary. This proximity of perspectives  gives the two partners grounds for cherishing high hopes for  their Eunetcom subsidiary. In the field of outsourcing  enterprise networks, a market estimated at between US$3-4  billion, "we are getting in on the ground floor of a field where  competition for contracts is very fierce," explains general  manager Claude Olier. The company hopes ultimately to carve out  a 10 to 15 percent market share, concentrating initially on  France and Germany, its natural markets. A contract with IBM was  inked in October, and a second big international client is  expected to sign with Eunetcom in the near future. In addition  to Eunetcom, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are discussing  a strengthening of their alliance in the context of the charter  restructurings to which both are committed. Marc Dandelot is an  enthusiastic advocate of these closer ties. "Interlocked  shareholding between the operators is necessary, both to cement  their strategic alliance over the longer term and to augment its  credibility at the international level -- not only in the eyes  of clients, but also with other partners whose cooperation  doubtless will be indispensable if we're to achieve the status  of a full-service, Europe-wide operator," concludes Michel  Hirsch, director of France Telecom's international division.    France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are thus counting on  each  other to make their transformations successful. But given the  obstacles at the legislative level, problems connected with  employee status, and a speeded-up calendar for market  deregulation, they cannot afford to slacken in their efforts.  <H3>  Interview with Charles Rozmaryn, general manager of France  Telecom, by B. d'Armagnac. </H3> <H5>  "Strengthen Strategic Alliance with Deutsche Telekom" </H5>   [d'Armagnac] With the market increasingly open, who are your  main rivals?    [Rozmaryn] When a big call for bids goes out, the contest is  between BT-MCI, AT&amp;T, Sita, Deutsche Telekom, and us.  International presence is a decisive factor. France Telecom's  European implantation, including Transpac, makes us a credible  contender. The contracts won by France Telecom group with  Europcar and IBM prove that.    [d'Armagnac] In France, how will the new entrants change the  market?    [Rozmaryn] At both the domestic and international level,  there are going to be new players in the market. Inevitably,  these will be large companies, because large investments are  required, and clients need to be dealing with credible  interlocutors.    [d'Armagnac] How important are your ties with Deutsche  Telekom?    [Rozmaryn] They are the keystone of our international growth  strategy. When we created Eunetcom, that was the only sector  where the regulations governing competition permitted us to  collaborate. The subsidiary was created in late 1991, in  response to a situation which has changed a great deal since  then with the decision in Brussels last June to move ahead with  European liberalization. The competitive landscape is different  now. Thus we and our German colleagues are in the process of  re-evaluating the situation as a whole, to strengthen our  strategic alliance and broaden considerably the range of  activities we will pursue jointly.    [d'Armagnac] What is France Telecom's strategy in computer  services?    [Rozmaryn] France Telecom must be active in this sector,  because clients increasingly are demanding full-service  providers. So we must be able to work with clients at the level  of enterprise applications, and this explains our need for  link-ups with service companies. The SSIIs [computer systems and  services firms] have access to loci of decision-making and  specification-setting that are useful to us. Especially  overseas, which is France Telecom's principal target. This for  example is what's behind the idea of the partnership with Sema  Group. Finally, we have our own computer services company,  Telesystemes. FTLIS, our services division, needs to grow,  especially in overseas markets. Sema Group's takeover of SKD,  the Swedish SSII, is a typical example of the kind of  partnership we are seeking.    [d'Armagnac] What kind of synergies can there be with Bull,  particularly in services?    [Rozmaryn] We have acquired an ownership interest in Bull  for  both historical and financial reasons; our participation is not  that of a shareholder truly integrated into the enterprise's  overall strategy.

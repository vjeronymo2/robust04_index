			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market stands up well to bad news A SERIES of hammer blows from leading UK companies failed to depress London equities yesterday, and an erratic performance left share prices little changed across the broad range of the market. Share trading remained very selective, although trading volume was boosted by heavy turnover in BP and Hanson after their respective quarterly results. Equities opened in good form, with the new record on the Dow Average overnight helping to offset continuing nervousness over the valuation of the US equity markets. The FT-SE Index gained 8.5 points in spite of news of a sharp increase in UK unemployment last month, a development seen as likely to hinder the re-election chances of Mr Major's Conservative government. However, the market was abruptly turned back by BP's announcement of a heavy fall in income and an unchanged dividend for the fourth quarter. Market analysts had taken divided views on BP, and the trading statement from the global oil company brought some turmoil on the dealing screens. No sooner had the market settled down again than Lord Hanson disclosed his group's first recorded fall in quarterly profits, adding that he saw 'no signs of recovery in the market'. The Footsie was soon down by nearly 10 points, although the activity was largely focused around Hanson and BP. Some other leading internationals, including ICI, replaced gains with losses, but trading died down as Wall Street opened the new session 13 Dow points off. The absence of selling pressure across the full range of equities enabled share prices to rally successfully, and the final quotation on the FT-SE Index of 2,522.6 showed a net decline of only 1.1 points. This fall reflected little more than the setback in both Hanson and BP shares, leaving the rest of the UK stock market effectively firmer on the day. Market turnover was also distorted by heavy trade in the two blue chip stocks, which between them were responsible for nearly 12 per cent of the day's Seaq volume total of 527.7m shares. On Wednesday, 448.1m shares through the Seaq network were worth only Pounds 811.9m in terms of genuine retail business in equities. Traders pointed to the low volume figure as the reason behind the market's apparently calm reception of yesterday's flow of bad news, as well as the persistent worries over the outlook for equities both in Tokyo and New York. The London market appears to have set into a pre-election mode, and traders do not expect much significant development on the UK side. Signs this week of renewed political scandals in Tokyo are now casting shadows in the UK market, and the successive peak performances on Wall Street have not removed deep-seated worries among some UK analysts that the US market may be seriously over-valued in terms of underlying corporate earnings prospects. However, London remains under the spell of the daily performances of the Dow and Nikkei indices. This uncertain backcloth has caused UK investors to remain highly selective and often willing to respond to somewhat long-whiskered takeover stories. Both Fisons and Cadbury Schweppes were active on such tales yesterday, although neither stock attracted any convincing level of genuine investment business.</p>

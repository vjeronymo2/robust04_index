			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Zhudro] </F>   [Text] Tel Aviv 5 April, TASS -- Prime Minister of Israel  Yitzhaq Rabin received Russian presidents' special envoy on  Middle East settlement Viktor Posuvalyuk in Jerusalem on Monday.  The Russian envoy arrived in Israel from Jordan, where he had a  meeting with King Husayn. Prior to this, Posuvalyuk had  participated in talks with President of Syria Hafiz al-Asad.    Posuvalyuk said that his mission is aimed at providing the  maximum possible assistance to move ahead the Middle East peace  process, help renew and complete talks between participants in  this process within the framework of the active line followed by  Russia. According to him, using its confidential ties with  states and also with political leaders of the region, "Russia  induces interested sides to implement all that has been  contemplated at Madrid and what was agreed at Oslo, Washington  and Cairo, without wasting any time."    "The tragedy at Hebron has laid bare the absolute truth that  opponents of the negotiations are trying to take advantage of  falling out of step and pauses in the negotiation process. This  threatens a roll back and poses danger to all achievements of  the peace process," the Russian envoy said.    "Main political forces, society and public as a whole in  Russia are in favour of such an active and single-minded stand  on the Middle East problem, the neighbourhood region for us,  where today there exist and will exist in the future great  interests of our state," Posuvalyuk concluded.    According to diplomatic sources, a meeting between the  Russian representative and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres is to be held on Tuesday morning.</p>

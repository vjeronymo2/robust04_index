The Chinese Government,  in this way, responded sharply to reports from officials in  Washington who link trade between the two countries to the  internal situation of the PRC. The United States has reduced to  35 percent its imports of textiles from China, and now there is  talk at the White House of withdrawing China's trade status as a  Most Favored Nation, according to a report from PRENSA LATINA.    Business is business, stressed the Foreign Ministry  spokesman, recalling that the PRC has achieved remarkable  successes since it was founded in 1949, especially with the  reforms put into practice in the past 15 years -- which has been  acknowledged internationally.</p>

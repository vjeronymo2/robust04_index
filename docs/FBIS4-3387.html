			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Analysis" by political editor Chip Tsao: "Party Merger Is </F> a Pragmatic Move"]    [Text] The merger of the United Democrats and Meeting  Point to form the new Democratic Party, announced yesterday by  Martin Lee and Anthony Cheung, is a blow to China's "united  front" ploy to divide and conquer Hong Kong's democratic forces.  Hong Kong's political battlefield provides fertile ground for  China to employ this powerful political weapon in place of more  violent means to impose its will on the political system.    Hong Kong entered a new era of political pluralism after the  signing of the Joint Declaration. But the concept of pluralism  was carried too far as democratic parties sprouted like  mushrooms. The union of the two parties is not only a pragmatic  response to China's divisive strategy, but a rare move breaking  the cultural myth that Chinese people are hopeless in standing  united together. It would only be too natural for Beijing to  read this unprecedented development in Hong Kong's short  democratic history with an eye of suspicion.    Lee and Cheung yesterday came out as winners, although the  leader of the new party will not be decided until a party  election in October. The appeal for others to join the union  was directed to other equally influential politicians like  Christine Loh and Emily Lau, both independent legislative  councillors. If they heed the appeal, it will not only soften  the male-dominated image of the new party, but harden its  political muscle by showing voters that the new party is  equipped with some of the most forthright pioneering  personalities who will contest the 1995 election. This, in  turn, will be balanced by the relatively moderate and  intellectual former members of the Meeting Point.    One of the losers is Frederick Fung Kin-kee's Association  for  Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL). The ADPL's image was  tarnished seriously when one of its founding members, Law  Cheung- kwok, raised his hand mistakenly to agree to a motion  proposed by some Hong Kong members of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference last month in Beijing to urge  the Chinese government to disband the three-tier councils after  1997. Since then Fung's party has been at pains to explain that  it has not been opportunistic and sycophantic in its relations  with China.    The formation of the new party will only further embarrass  the ADPL as it becomes marginalised. Relations between the ADPL  and some United Democrats have been cool since 1989. Some  veteran United Democrats, like Szeto Wah, view the ADPL with a  mixture of contempt and jealousy for its limited communications  with Beijing.    Fung says he has a sense of deep respect for Szeto, claiming  that his party was only following Szeto's old teaching of using  the carrot-and-stick ploy to deal with China. Its differences  with the United Democrats as a whole are less easily glossed  over. In fact, it seems that Fung has no choice but to unite  his party with the new Democratic Party, by way of a rite to  cleanse itself of the Law's appalling sin. Indeed the ADPL is  already knocking timidly on the door of the honeymooning newly  wedded political couple by "welcoming" the merger, asking if  there is still room for it to join the threesome.    Other parties yet to form an alliance are Allen Lee's  Liberal  Party and Tsang Yok-shing's Democratic Alliance for the  Betterment (DAB) of Hong Kong. They, however, make a much less  well-matched couple than the United Democrats and Meeting Point.  Their only common ground is that neither wants to upset Beijing  and the electorate at the same time. Some Liberals see the idea  of uniting with the DAB, being the party with a clear  pro-Chinese birthmark, as a suicidal move that will kiss goodbye  to Liberals' chance of getting directly-elected in 1995.    Xu Tzemin, a local member of China's National People's  Congress, has tried to be a marriage broker, dying to see the  newly-formed adulterous "anti-communist alliance" contained by a  united counterpart. It is unlikely there will be another  wedding party soon. It looks like an ironic retribution that  Hong Kong's democrats have stolen China's secret recipe of the  "united front" to form their own real united front.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Baird seeks Pounds 39m for expansion WILLIAM BAIRD, the textile and engineering group, yesterday joined the rights issue rush by announcing plans for a 1-for-5 issue at 210p to raise Pounds 39m for further expansion. Mr Donald Parr, chairman, said Baird was keen to expand organically and by acquisition within both textiles and engineering in the UK and other countries. He said the troubled state of both industries has created 'many interesting opportunities' for acquisitions. Baird's shares, which have rallied in recent months, fell by 20p to 238p on the announcement. In the rights issue, which is underwritten by Robert Fleming and distributed by James Capel, Baird will issue 18.62m new ordinary shares. News of the cash call came on the same day as the takeover battle between Coats Viyella and Tootal, two other large UK textile groups, gathered momentum as Coats raised its offer for Tootal. The textile industry has suffered severely in the present recession. Baird, one of the more resilient members of the industry, with long-established contacts with Marks and Spencer, recently reported static pre-tax profits of Pounds 33.8m on turnover of Pounds 519.6m for 1990. Mr Parr said the emphasis of expansion in textiles would be in the low labour cost economies of Asia, although Baird also plans to continue investment in the UK. Baird, like other British textile groups, is sourcing an increasingly high proportion of its products - 25 per cent of last year's Pounds 400m textile turnover - from Asia. Baird is also keen to expand its engineering interests in continental Europe, where it already has operations in France and Belgium. The group had Pounds 33m of borrowings - with gearing of 26 per cent - at its last year end. This meant it was comfortably within its committed facilities of over Pounds 70m. However, Mr Parr said the proceeds of the rights issue should enable Baird to take advantage of future expansion opportunities without allowing gearing to reach an 'uncomfortable' level. Baird also yesterday announced changes in its senior management team. Mr Nicholas Webster is leaving his current post as finance director - where he will be succeeded by a new recruit - to become chief executive of Baird Textiles. Mr Ken Patton, a senior executive in the textile division, is joining the main board.</p>

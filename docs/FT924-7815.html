			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Arts: No reserves - Paris saleroom AFTER a drab start to the season Paris's salerooms are waking up this month with a flurry of top quality modern art sales with low estimates and, in one case, no reserve prices. Meanwhile abroad, Paris auctioneers Drouot stands poised to hold its first sale of icons and jewellery in Moscow. Joel-Marie Millon, the company's chairman, spent a week in Russia last July negotiating a sale with the minister of culture and Art 2000. Millon is waiting for a final ministerial go-ahead. Drouot failed, however, to seize extensive premises across the street from its own overcrowded salerooms. Auctioneer Guy Loudmer opened there this month. His 72 lot sale of 19th-century and modern paintings on November 23 features works by Gericault - seven drawings, including a study for 'Le Radeau de la Meduse' and nine oils, ranging from small seascape to a fine portrait of Alfred de Dreux as a child estimated at FFrs4-6m (Pounds 413,500-Pounds 620,300). Jacques Tajan, meanwhile, of France's largest auction company Ader-Tajan is experiencing financial problems largely because a recalcitrant Japanese businessman owes him FFrs30m an art nouveau glass sale in November 1990. Tajan's plans to re-auction them in Japan last July were vetoed by his bankers, and sellers are still waiting for their money. Meanwhile the goods have lost 70 per cent of their value. Tajan's former partner Jean-Louis Picard holds his big modern art sale of the season on November 25. It includes drawings by Degas and Bonnard, two fine works on paper by Vuillard plus a remarkably atmospheric view of Paris by Marquet of 1904 (estimate FFrs1.7-2m, Pounds 200,000-Pounds 206,000) and a 1906 view of Rotterdam by Signac (estimate FFrs2-2.5m, Pounds 206,000-Pounds 257,500). The star sale, however, is Alain Lesieutre's collection of modern paintings by auctioneer Francis Briest on November 24. Paris art dealer Lesieutre, already forced to sell off his substantial Art Deco collection in December 1989, is obeying a court order to auction his paintings. There are no reserve prices and the 54 lots confirm that, whatever his business shortcomings, Lesieutre had great taste. The works include an ink drawing by Gericault and a a fishing boat painted in 1880 by Toulouse-Lautrec at the age of 16. There are also paintings and drawings by the French cubist Roger de La Fresnaye, three oils by Nicolas de Stael, three Degas bronze sculptures, a Sisley, a Pissarro and a fiery fauve Vlaminck of 1906.</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / International Company News: Cariplo counter-bid pleases market The Italian stock market yesterday welcomed the announcement by Cariplo, the world's biggest savings bank, that it planned a counter-bid for Credito Romagnolo (Rolo) of Bologna, in alliance with other companies. Directors of Rolo will meet today in Bologna to discuss the Cariplo offer, announced on Thursday, and the previous bid from Cariplo's Milanese rival Credito Italiano (Credit). On Thursday, Rolo said it had received the offer 'with interest'. 'The announcement firms up the hypothesis, already laid out to Rolo's management in an atmosphere of mutual collaboration, of a competing offer significantly better than that of Credito Italiano.' The consortium led by Cariplo intends to offer L21,500 a share for 70 per cent of Rolo. That compares with Credit's improved offer of L20,000 for only a 65 per cent holding. If shareholders accept, the Cariplo consortium will have to pay L3,291bn (Dollars 2bn) for the stake, 18 per cent more than Credit would have paid. Analysts agreed yesterday that the Cariplo offer would probably put Rolo out of reach of Credit, unless it too teams up with other bidders. Trading yesterday on the Milan stock exchange also suggested that Cariplo's plans might be enough to win Rolo. The Bologna bank's shares closed nearly 3 per cent higher at L18,884, having risen 3 per cent on Thursday ahead of the announcement. Cariplo, which is unquoted and owned by a charitable foundation, is likely to have a majority of the consortium. But other banks are set to form a nocciolo duro, or hard core, within Rolo's shareholder list if the bid succeeds. At the moment only IMI, the privatised banking group, and Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna, Rolo's neighbour, have formally put their names to the offer, but Bank Austria, which is controlled by the Vienna city authorities, and Reale Mutua, an Italian insurance company, are said to be discussing joining the bid. Cariplo and its allies still require the backing of the Bank of Italy, responsible for supervising Italy's fragmented banking sector, and Consob, the stock exchange watchdog. The group has until January to launch the offer formally. Credit's bid opens on Monday, and closes on January 16. If the Cariplo consortium wins the backing of the Rolo board today, it will represent a victory for a collaborative approach. The Milan savings bank, Italy's third largest bank, began discussing a deal with Rolo nine months ago. Analysts believe that Credit, on the other hand, made a number of crucial errors when it first announced plans for a bid at the end of October. Credit's first outline offer - of L19,000 a share - was dismissed as hostile by Rolo, and although its second bid received a warmer welcome two weeks ago, Rolo directors stopped short of giving it full support. A defeat for Credit would represent a defeat for Mediobanca, the secretive Milan merchant bank which has built up a strong influence over Credit and Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI), its recently privatised neighbour. BCI was thwarted in its attempt to gain control of Banco Ambrosiano Veneto, another quoted Italian bank, launched at about the same time Credit made its approach to Rolo. Before the Cariplo plans were announced, Mr Lucio Rondelli, Credit chairman, criticised the possibility of a deal with Cariplo, because, he said, it would put Rolo - one of Italy's most efficient quoted banks - under the shadow of the public sector. The Italian Treasury and the Bank of Italy have stressed that public foundations, such as the one that owns Cariplo, should accelerate the process of listing the shares of their banking subsidiaries. Cariplo (short for Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde) planned to float about 20 per cent of its shares on the Milan stock market earlier this year, but abandoned the operation because of adverse market conditions.</p>

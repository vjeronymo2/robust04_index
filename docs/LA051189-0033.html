			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOW-CAL RABBIT DISHES;  </P> <P> THE MAKING OF A CULINARY CLASSIC  </P> <P> Chefs are cooking rabbit in some of the country's top restaurant kitchens  because rabbit dishes are culinary classics that are high in prestige and low  in calories.  </P> <P> Europeans have long been rabbit fanciers with the French consuming more than  200 million rabbits a year, or about 13 pounds per person. Italy, Germany and  Spain consume about the same amount, with England right behind.  </P> <P> Health-conscious dieters should note that rabbit has fewer calories per pound,  more protein and less cholesterol than chicken or veal.  </P> <P> Traditionally, rabbit has been fried, stewed, baked, broiled, roasted, curried,  hashed or eaten as a pie or ragout. Today's cooks serve rabbit in coconut milk,  in sour cream and mustard sauce, barbecued, boiled, cacciatore, en casserole  and Creole style.  </P> <P> Angus Cameron and Judith Jones, authors of "The L.L. Bean Game and Fish  Cookbook," maintain that "rabbit can be prepared with any recipe you use for  chicken. There is only one difference," they said. "Rabbit is better."  </P> <P> New York writer Charlie Rubin orders rabbit at business lunches -- he finds it  a power play as well as a culinary choice.  </P> <P> "It knocks out the guys you're with," he said. "People think you're a serious  eater."  </P> <P> Rubin ranked rabbit this way: "Rabbit is as good as alligator tails, less good  than frog legs."  </P> <P> Michel Jean, owner of New York's Provence bistro, said most restaurants served  only the filet, which is tender but too bland. The French use more flavorful  cuts.  </P> <P> "I'm trying to make it more appealing," Jean said. "I want to include more  traditional Provencal dishes such as rabbit Brignolaise (cut in pieces, stuffed  with rosemary, garlic and thyme, wrapped in bacon and roasted with garlic  cloves) or a rabbit stew, which is tastier and gamy."  </P> <P> Rabbit is served in a number of New York restaurants, as well as sophisticated  eateries in Chicago and Beverly Hills. "In L.A., rabbits are rampant," said  Mickey Ziffren, a novelist and wife of Paul Ziffren, chairman of the 1984  Olympics.  </P> <P> Rabbits are traditional in regional cooking. In New Orleans, Cajun-Creole  restaurants prepare rabbit in time-honored as well as innovative ways. In North  Carolina, professional cook Carrie Lyerly uses a simple century-old family  recipe. She says people today do too much to rabbit. "They put in so many  things that the rabbit loses its distinctive flavor," she said.  </P> <P> In New Mexico, the Pueblo Indians go on rabbit hunts in spring and fall.  </P></p>

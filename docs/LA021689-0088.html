			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUCKEY FREED ON $1.5-MILLION BAIL AFTER 5 YEARS IN JAIL  </P> <P> A smiling Raymond Buckey, the principal defendant in the McMartin Pre-School  molestation case, was released on $1.5-million bail from Los Angeles County  Men's Central Jail on Wednesday night after spending nearly five years behind  bars.  </P> <P> Buckey, 30, made his way through a crowd of reporters and broadcast news crews  to his attorney's car without saying a word. The one-time preschool teacher  rode away with his attorney, Daniel G. Davis, and a private security officer to  an undisclosed location.  </P> <P> Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, are in the 22nd month of their  trial on 65 counts of child molestation and conspiracy involving 11 children  who attended their family-run nursery school in Manhattan Beach. She is free on  $295,000 bail.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders ordered Buckey released last  week after determining that he had met the $1.5-million bail by pledging real  estate worth twice that amount, as required by law.  </P> <P> He had been jailed since March, 1984, when he was arrested along with his  mother, grandmother, sister and three other former teachers at the school,  which has since closed. Charges against all of the defendants, except Buckey  and his mother, have been dropped.  </P> <P> In ordering Buckey's release, Pounders ruled that he must surrender his  passport and not have any contact with anyone under age 14 who is not a blood  relative or accompanied by a parent. The judge also ruled that Buckey stay out  of the cities of Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach unless he  receives court permission, and that he be kept under 24-hour guard.  </P></p>

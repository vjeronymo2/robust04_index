			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Heorhiy Vorotnyuk from Odessa: "A New Competitor </F> on the Danube?"]    [Text] According to the Moldovan mass media, the  government of that country does everything possible to promote  the creation of its own merchant fleet on the Danube. For that  purpose, not only are negotiations conducted with the CIS  countries on the fair division of the former Union's fleet, but  possibilities are also sought to purchase, build, and charter  vessels. A shipping company -- "Moldova Shipping Company" --  was recently created there. It already has seven vessels at its  disposal: three passenger ships, three freight vessels, and a  barge. All of them have been chartered from Romanian ship  owners and are, for the time being, kept in the Romanian port of  Constanta. However, in the near future, our neighbors will  start building a port on the Danube, where the Moldovan  territory is adjacent to the river.    It looks like the Ukrainian Danube Shipping Company will  have  yet another competitor. At any rate, it will take care of the  cargo from Moldova itself.</p>

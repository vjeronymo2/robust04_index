			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment: Nordic Countries (6): New structure could be key to expansion - Profile: Unitas UNION Bank of Finland's decision to reorganise its banking operations and equity holdings under a new parent banking group is seen as a wise move, possibly paving the way for a bold expansion in the insurance sector soon. Finnish banks may only own up to 10 per cent of an insurance company, although a new law allowing banks to wholly-own insurers is expected to come into force in January 1993. In the meantime, there is nothing to stop a holding company from owning 100 per cent of a bank or insurance company, thus by-passing the 10 per cent restriction. The new UBF structure consists of a parent banking group, called Unitas, with subsidiaries for the commercial banking operations and strategic holdings. If Unitas changes its status to that of a holding company, as is widely expected, then it would be able to acquire an insurance group and establish a more broadly-based financial services group without having to wait for the ownership law to be changed. Mr Ahti Hirvonen, chairman of the Unitas board of management, says the bank's reorganisation was influenced by developments in Europe, where 'the barriers between banking and insurance have been coming down.' He says: 'Only a minor part of insurance is interesting to the bank, namely life insurance,' adding that the group could expand in this area either by close co-operation with an insurance group, or by owning an insurer. Mr Hirvonen believes that the new structure has other advantages, providing a clearer picture of how the different business areas perform under separate management. 'It allows clear management and a clear picture of profits . . . traditionally in Finland, banks have held substantial stakes in industrial companies and we feel it is better to separate responsibility between the commercial banking side and the long-term strategic holdings,' he says. As prices slumped in the Finnish stock market, Unitas had to write down the value of its equity holdings last year: it made a loss of FM70m on the sale of current asset equity holdings while profit on the sale of investment assets was FM33.5m compared with FM101.5m the previous year. On the banking side, too, Unitas is facing difficult times. Last year, the Unitas group made a loss of FM128m before extraordinary items, appropriations and taxes, compared with a profit of FM 480m in 1990. Like other Finnish banks, Unitas blames its poor performance on the recession and the low interest margins following the deregulation of Finland's financial markets. Small- and medium-sized businesses in particular have been badly hit by the recession and many are no longer assured of a market in the Soviet Union following its disintegration. 'Soviet trade was very important for us as Finland exchanged consumer goods for Soviet oil. Finnish textile and clothing companies were particularly badly affected by the fall in Soviet demand for goods,' says Mr Hirvonen. Meanwhile, the recession has taken its toll on companies in the property, construction and consumer goods sectors. Group credit write-offs jumped 44 per cent in 1991 to FM1.092bn. Net interest income has fallen by FM252m to FM2.321bn because of low interest margins and the growth in non-performing loans, which amounted to FM5.718bn at the end of 1991. One of the most frequent complaints among Finnish bankers is the fact that the bulk of their longer-term credits (particularly mortgages) are tied to the Finnish base rate while their funding costs are dictated by the more volatile money market rates. Money market rates rose sharply in the first part and autumn of 1991 and are much higher than the base rate. Many bankers want the base rate's use as a measure for setting rates on loans to be phased out. However, they see little chance of this happening since the Parliamentary Supervisory Board of the Bank of Finland, which makes decisions on interest rate policy, consists of politicians who are reluctant to force up mortgage rates and upset the voters. As the majority of new credits tend to be granted at market interest rates, the proportion of loans tied to the base rate is gradually decreasing. For Unitas, 57 per cent of the loan portfolio was still tied to the base rate at the end of 1991. 'We are not satisfied with the 1991 results,' says Mr Hirvonen, who retires next year and who will be replaced by Mr Vesa Vainio, currently president and managing director at the Finnish pulp and paper group Kymmene in which Unitas is a leading shareholder. Mr Hirvonen thinks bankers will have little cause to celebrate this year as loan write-offs will remain high and non-performing loans will continue to increase. '1992 will be difficult, but maybe towards the end of 1992 we can expect some upturn in the business cycle,' he says, attempting a smile.</p>

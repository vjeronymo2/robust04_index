			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Arts: Today's Television Can you imagine the high horses that would be mounted, the shrill outcry, were BBC2 to promise a programme in which three men discussed what delighted and disgusted them about women, femininity and female hygiene? But don't worry, today's 10 x 10 is politically correct to its enamelled fingertips: it promises three women discussing what delights and disgusts them about men, masculinity, and male hygiene. So that's OK (10.20). Three Indian hucksters are the subject of Under The Sun (9.30 BBC2). Shakeel sells kohl and sings at Muslim festivals; Ansfar peddles home-made potions, he admitting 'My balm doesn't work on me, I use Vick'; and Hashmat sells a magic book and is an alcoholic. The subject of Ross McElwee's documentary for True Stories (9.35 C4) is his own life and family. He says he is 'more comfortable filming the family than starting one', though the programme shows him announcing his engagement. If you have managed to avoid hearing the score in the first day of the Third Test it will take some strength of character to switch on (11.50 BBC1) and find out.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Clark seeks Dollars 100m acquisition CLARK Equipment, the US capitals goods manufacturer, is looking for an acquisition of around Dollars 100m that could take it into a new business sector. Last summer, Clark sold its lift truck business to Terex, the US industrial and construction machinery group, for Dollars 90m. The sale prompted considerable interest among investors about Clark's future plans. Mr Frank Sims, Clark's senior vice-president, said in London yesterday that Clark was looking at companies worth around Dollars 100m in businesses which would fit with Clark's current range. 'It would be a mid-sized company to which we could add value,' he said. There were a surprising number of opportunities among private companies, or divisions of big corporations, he said. The acquisition was more likely to be in the US, to balance costs such as retiree health expenses. Clark has all but completed a big programme of investment in its manufacturing base, but Mr Sims stressed that it intended to be patient in its search for a takeover. It could, alternatively, do 'bolt-on' acquisitions for its present businesses. Clark's 1992 results will be out next week. Its main problem is the unconsolidated VME, which has been hit by the construction equipment recession worldwide and is undergoing a restructuring. Clark's share in VME's nine-month loss was Dollars 40.7m. Mr Sims said he was cautiously optimistic for 1993, with business conditions improving in the US.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["fk"-signed report: "The European Central Bank Will Not Be </F> Simply Modelled on the German One"]    [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- Alexandre Lamfalussy firmly  believes that European monetary union "will come sooner rather  than later" and that it will be a union to promote stability.  Addressing the German banking community, the president of the  European Monetary Institute [EMI] made it clear that the  European Central Bank (EZB) would not be modelled solely on the  Bundesbank.    An extensive shift, a kind of "cultural revolution" geared  toward price stability has taken place in Europe, explained the  former general director of the Basel Bank for International  Settlements (BIZ) in Frankfurt, addressing representatives of  the German banking industry for the first time in his capacity  as EWI president. It is no coincidence that inflation in a  number of European countries has stood at below 3 percent for  years and has even exhibited a downward trend in countries that  have seen the value of their currencies fall.    According to Lamfalussy, Germany and the Bundesbank have  earned the respect of their partners for the successful pursuit  of a monetary policy geared toward price stability over a longer  period of time. The decision to base the EMI and the future  European Central Bank in Frankfurt is a tribute to that success.  "However, it should come as no surprise to you that other  European countries also have learned something that merits  praise. A process of learning from one another" has commenced.    Lamfalussy recalled that the EMI's main task is to enhance  the coordination of member-states' monetary policies while the  responsibility for the formulation and implementation of  monetary policies is still firmly in the hands of national  central banks. He cannot share the view that this amounts to  squaring a circle, because the Maastricht Treaty expressly  describes "ensuring price stability" as the goal of coordination  efforts.    Speaking about the preparations that the EMI has to make for  the future European Central Bank, Lamfalussy focussed on the  monetary supply target envisaged by the Bundesbank. The central  banks could use goals of that kind to make themselves to a  certain extent independent of political pressure and ensure that  there is no relaxation of policy rigors. In any case, there has  to be a sufficiently stable relationship between the money  supply and prices, and this is something central banks are in a  position to influence by means of medium-term money supply  targets.    Germany and several other countries believe that both  conditions "have been satisfied, not completely, but  adequately," explained Lamfalussy. In the case of Great  Britain, which is the most important example in Europe, at least  one of these conditions is no longer relevant (the same applies  to Canada and the United States). The EMI's chief's assessment  of the present situation is "irrespective of what we agree on  regarding a medium-term goal, the European Central Bank will in  any event require a clear, operational medium-term goal, such as  the level of short-term interest rates."    According to Lamfalussy, monetary union can be the result of  a peaceful and gradual convergence process (with the EMI making  its contribution in this respect) or possibly the result of a  crisis (which the EMI could try to prevent). In any event, he  believes that monetary union will occur "and sooner than  sometime next century," because economic and financial markets  "are forcing us to do so."    Lamfalussy warned that without a genuine monetary union, the  reality of the European single market will be endangered by  pronounced negative developments with regard to real exchange  rates. The European Monetary System is a provisional solution,  which can be torpedoed by pressure from speculation in a  situation in which there is free movement of capital. It is  "self-evident," said the EMI chief, that only those countries  that have achieved a reasonable degree of convergence will  maintain stable nominal exchange rates within the European Union.</p>

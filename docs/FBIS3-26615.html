			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by staff reporter Chen Chien-ping (7115 </F> 1696 1627) in Beijing: "The Central Authorities' New  `20-Character' Guiding Principle"]    [Text] Beijing, 8 Feb (WEN WEI PO)--A few days ago, CPC  General Secretary Jiang Zemin, on behalf of the CPC Central  Committee, formally put forward the 20-character principle for  the overall situation which clearly demonstrated the work focus  for this year. The 20-character principle is to: "Seize the  opportunity (zhua zhu ji yu 2119 0145 2623 6657), deepen the  reform (shen hua gai ge 3234 0553 2395 7245), open up wider (kuo  da kai fang 2368 1129 7030 2397), promote development (cu jin fa  zhan 0191 6651 4099 1455), and maintain stability (bao chi wen  ding 0202 2170 4489 1353)." This principle is aimed at solving  the problem of the relationship between reform, development, and  stability from the high plane of understanding and practice.  <H3>  It Is Necessary To Properly Handle the Relationship Between  the Three </H3>   As far as this reporter knows, the senior leadership of the  CPC Central Committee hold that the relationship between reform,  development, and stability should be as follows: Reform is the  motive force of development, development is the goal of reform,  and stability is the prerequisite for, and guarantee of, reform  and fulfillment of the goal. As long as we can properly handle  the relationship between the three, the construction of the  entire national economy can take on the normal path of  "sustained, rapid, and healthy development (chi xu kuai su jian  kang fa zhan 2170 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455)."    Since the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee held last year, two kinds of completely different  understanding on a large number of reform measures introduced  all at once by the central authorities in 1994, which are  vigorous and profound and have great impact, have existed in  society: First, some people are doubtful of the full-scale  reform implemented in 1994: Are the conditions ripe? Have we  been really thoughtful? Have we made full preparations for it?  Second, others consider it as the coming of another chance for  high-speed development. This situation has attracted great  attention from the senior leadership.    According to authoritative sources, when discussing the  major  reform measures introduced in 1994, all members of the CPC  Central Committee Political Bureau unanimously held that 1994  was a rare and probably the best opportunity. Their reply to  people who are doubtful of the measures was: There is a risk in  reform but we do not fear it because we have made full  preparations. Viewed from the angle of the senior leadership,  what they describe as full preparations come from two sides:  First, the whole macroscopic environment has created conditions  for promoting reform. These conditions include the  establishment of Deng Xiaoping's ideological theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, the macroscopic economic  environment, the experience drawn from reform and opening up  over the past 15 years, the establishment of the new system of  socialist market economy advocated by the CPC Central Committee,  and the extensive support of the masses given to the overall  framework of the socialist market economy. Second, the reform  measures introduced have been repeatedly expounded and proved.  <H5>  The Reform Package Is More Mature </H5>   The authoritative sources said: From last May onwards, Jiang  Zemin has been personally in command of the design of the reform  package and the whole process was divided into two parts. The  first part was mainly handled by intellectuals who studied the  issue from the angle of theoretical knowledge; whereas the  second part was mainly handled by leading cadres with experience  in practice who approached the issue from practical work  experience. In this way, personnel in charge of the two parts  repeatedly studied the issue. During this period, hundreds of  meetings, ranging from professional meetings, to CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau meetings, and even to Political  Bureau Standing Committee meetings were held. At last, the  package was submitted to the Third Plenary Session for approval.  Hence, the reform package is more mature after long  deliberation. As commented by a senior leader: We must be  resolute when we have to, we should never hesitate, and we must  strive to make a major breakthrough within two to three years.  We can turn back and deal with minor problems after the major  problems of the system have been solved. In this way, we can  create conditions for development.  <H5>  The Scale of Capital Construction Cannot Be Expanded </H5>   To reform, it is necessary to take risks and to develop, it  is necessary to care about conditions. Obviously, the central  authorities are critical of the trend of blindly seeking rapid  development. Hence, the central authorities call for "promoting  development" instead of "accelerating development." As far as  the senior leadership is concerned, the 13 percent growth for  two consecutive years is a very high pace of development and  there will be greater risks in reform if we further accelerate  the pace of development, apart from strengthening reform, in  1994. For example, the present high level of capital  construction, which has reached 1.2 trillion yuan, is unlikely  to scale down. If the central authorities further lay stress on  accelerating development, it will heighten the scale of capital  construction and will definitely trigger off high inflation,  thus causing great problems in reform or even falling short of  success for lack of a final effort. Hence, the senior  leadership of the central authorities insist on a "soft landing"  for economic development this year and keep reaffirming the  necessity to guard against overheated economic development and  to impose strict control on the scale of capital construction.  The central authorities are calling for development, step by  step, in a down-to-earth manner.  <H3>  Li Peng Granted 100 Million Yuan in Allowances for  Undergraduates </H3>   Stability is the prerequisite of reform and development.  Over the past few years, the senior leadership of the central  authorities has always placed stability in an extremely  important position and have strived to maintain political and  social stability and stable popular support to create a less  restricted environment for reform and to lay a good foundation  for development. In order to maintain stability, the central  authorities paid close attention to every issue, ranging from  big issues such as interstate relations to small ones such as  whether or not primary and secondary school students and  undergraduates had enough to eat. It has been learned that due  to commodity price rises caused by high-speed economic growth  last year, undergraduates from the hinterland did not have  enough to eat even though each of them was granted 100 yuan in  food allowance. Unlike their schoolmates from coastal provinces,  undergraduates from the hinterland do not have well-to-do  families to support them. In order to solve these students'  living problems and to stabilize their mood for learning, State  Council Premier Li Peng personally granted 100 million yuan to  the State Education Commission as special funds for subsidizing  students who did not have enough to eat.    The authoritative sources said: Decisionmakers at the  central level hold that although economic development problems  arose in 1993, it was still a brilliant year. In 1994, the  overall economy still maintains a very good development trend.  In order to maintain this trend, decisionmakers at the central  level urge everyone throughout the country, when doing all kinds  of work, to be subordinated to the 20-character principle  extracted from the experiences and lessons of 1993.</p>

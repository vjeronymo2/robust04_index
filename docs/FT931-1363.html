			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Bank chief damps Labor's upbeat mood: Australia's newly elected leaders are urged to cut budget deficit LESS than two weeks after its surprise victory in Australia's federal election, the Labor party's celebrations have been unceremoniously interrupted by Mr Bernie Fraser, governor of the Reserve Bank. Mr Fraser obliged the government on Tuesday by cutting official interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 5.25 per cent, effectively redeeming one of Labor's election promises. The governor said easier monetary conditions would help to accelerate Australia's sluggish recovery from the 1990-91 recession, which has so far been too weak to reduce unemployment from near record levels. But he also warned that a sustained increase in business investment, a prerequisite for long-term economic growth, would not take place un-less there is a substantial reduction in the federal budget deficit. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, brushed off a similar warning during the election campaign, claiming that it was aimed at the conservative opposition's plans to introduce a goods and services tax (GST). Mr Keating argues that the budget slipped into deficit in 1991-92 because of the cyclical effects of the recession, and claims that faster economic growth will virtually balance the government's books by 1996-97. But Mr Fraser's warning adds weight to claims by many economists that the bulk of the deterioration reflects structural changes in the composition of the budget which will not be eliminated by recovery. Mr Bill Shields, chief economist at Macquarie Bank, says that even before in-cluding election promises worth ADollars 2bn (Pounds 980m), the federal budget deficit is likely to rise from ADollars 15.9bn this year to ADollars 16.3bn in 1993-94, equivalent to 3.6 per cent of gross domestic product. Worse still, he forecasts that the net public sector borrowing requirement, which includes state budgets, will rise to nearly 6 per cent of GDP next year, excluding asset sales. This compares with net repayments of nearly 2 per cent of GDP in 1988-89. The danger is that this increased call on savings will impede private sector investment by pushing up real long-term interest rates. But balancing the budget will not be easy. Paradoxically, the government's success in reducing inflation to 0.3 per cent will reduce growth in revenue by limiting the impact of partial tax indexation, or 'fiscal drag.' In addition, Labor's pre-election manoeuvring included legislation guaranteeing ADollars 8bn in personal tax cuts in the two years to 1996. The opposition parties, which control the Senate, are unlikely to allow Mr Keating to withdraw the reductions, even if he thought it politically sensible. In its pre-election economic statement, the government forecast that accelerating growth would reduce the federal budget deficit to about 1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97, which would stabilise federal government debt at about 21.6 per cent of GDP. Macquarie Bank's analysis suggests that such an outcome could be achieved only by substantial cuts in government spending - ADollars 4.4bn over four years if real growth averages 4.25 per cent, or ADollars 10.5bn on the more realistic assumption of 3 per cent average growth. But the real fiscal position may be even worse. Mr Geoffrey Lehmann, a partner in Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, calculates that Labor's policy announcements since the last budget, including uncosted election promises, will reduce revenue by a net ADollars 11bn net over the next four years. If this view is correct, the government will be forced to abandon hopes that revenue growth will correct the deficit, and will have to make hard choices about spending cuts in the next budget, due in August. Like many economists, Mr Lehmann thinks Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer, will be forced to raise taxes to bridge the gap, probably by widening Australia's relatively narrow indirect tax net, which is equivalent to about 8.5 per cent of GDP, compared with the OECD average of 11.8 per cent. The neatest solution would be to introduce a GST, which would work in the same way as Europe's value added tax. However, the government's vehement campaign rhetoric has closed off this option for the foreseeable future. The most likely alternative is a substantial increase in the existing sales tax, which was streamlined by the govern-ment last year, possibly with future revenue-raising needs in mind. Handled carefully, a substantial increase in revenue could be achieved in conjunction with a rebate system to remove existing taxes on business inputs. Ironically, such a tax would look very like a GST.</p>

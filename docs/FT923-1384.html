			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Greycoat to pass dividends SHARES IN Greycoat, the property investment company, yesterday fell by a third from 21p to 14p when the company passed its preference dividend and rescinded its recommendation to pay a final dividend. The group blamed its decision on a slowdown in the property market over the summer, which delayed completion of sales. Any payment of dividends would have had to be financed by property sales, since the company's net rental income is only sufficient to cover its interest costs. By passing the dividend the company saves Pounds 6.7m, including advance corporation tax. 'Prudence dictated that if they are to have any chance of survival, they should not pay a dividend. They need every penny they have got,' said an analyst. The company, which has debts of Pounds 390m, said it is pursuing an aggressive programme of property dis-posals to reduce gearing of 180 per cent to less than 100 per cent. So far this year, it has sold Pounds 70m worth of property. Mr Geoffrey Wilson, chairman, said that although the property market had not completely dried up, purchasers had delayed making decisions over the summer. The final dividend of 2.9p per share, which was announced on July 23, was due to be put to the annual meeting tomorrow and be paid on October 1.</p>

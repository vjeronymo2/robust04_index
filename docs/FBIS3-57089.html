The discussion  proceeded in a businesslike atmosphere.    The deputies, who took the floor during the discussion,  arrived at the conclusion that the vast legislative programme,  submitted by People's Deputy Mikhail Mityukov, had to be  examined in detail and finalised in Duma committees.    This refers primarily to the package of economic  legislations. Deputy Sergey Kalashnikov, moved to hear a  government report on the concept of the economic reform. He  claimed that the economic policy, conducted by the cabinet in  recent years, "completely overlooked the human factor". The  speaker stressed that "Russia needs workable economic laws that  will not merely discharge populist functions". In his opinion,  it is necessary, first and foremost, to map out the main  directions of the social policy, to elaborate laws on employment  and on the minimum consumers budget.    Deputy Sergey Glazyev moved to discuss primarily the  presidential decrees submitted to the two chambers of the  parliament. He stressed the need for clearly determined  priorities in drawing up legislations. This idea was backed by  other MPs. Deputy Lyudmila Zavadskaya described as deplorable  the lot of women and children in Russia. She stressed that  these problems needed legal regulation. Deputy Nikolay Kotov  believes that the Duma should adopted first of all laws  governing the work of the agro-industrial complex, land  relations, and also the taxation police and social insurance.    Deputy Aleksandr Piskunov insisted that questions linked  with  the military service and participation of Russian troops in  peace- keeping actions abroad brooked no delay. Several  deputies moved to revise the conversion programme, to bring  legislative acts in line with the new Russian constitution.  Deputy Viktor Ustinov tabled a motion to elaborate primarily a  bill on the restoration of the constitutional court.</p>

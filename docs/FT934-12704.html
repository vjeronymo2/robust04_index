			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Paris puts on brave face over UK's nuclear 'Non' FRANCE claimed yesterday it would not let disappointment at the UK government's decision to cancel an air-launched missile project affect its desire for closer Anglo-French nuclear co-operation. Paris had hoped London would join it in extending the range of an existing Aerospatiale air-fired missile into a nuclear weapon for both countries' air forces, in order to share costs. But last week the UK, with an even stronger desire to save money, decided to abandon any such idea and to rely instead solely on its Trident nuclear submarines. At a joint Paris news conference with his UK counterpart, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, France's defence minister, Mr Francois Leotard, said diplomatically 'we take note of it (the British decision), but we think it would be a pity to sacrifice what has been achieved in the nuclear dialogue between France and Britain over the past two years'. Both ministers praised the usefulness of this dialogue, which has focused chiefly on such issues as how and against whom Europe's two nuclear powers might consider using their atomic arsenals, as well as questions of nuclear non-proliferation and testing. Mr Rifkind, who later today will visit France's nuclear submarine base at Brest, was slightly more open than UK ministers have been on the eventual possibility of the two countries' nuclear submarines patrolling together, saying 'discussion on this could not be excluded in the weeks and months to come'. However, a French official said yesterday: 'With the British, it is always the same - the courtship is fine, but we never get into bed.' Collaboration on conventional arms is easier, with the UK, France and Italy committed to building frigates together. Earlier yesterday, Mr Leotard took Mr Rifkind to his southern mayoralty of Frejus and to Eurocopter, the Franco-German joint venture which hopes to sell its Tiger anti-tank helicopter to the UK. Mr Rifkind said it would take the UK a year from now to make its helicopter decision. With his defence review drawing to a close, Mr Leotard said the new French government accepted a closer relationship with a reformed Nato, but gave no indication this might allow him to start attending regular Nato meetings. Mr Leotard said France had 'an open attitude' to the possibility of extending Nato to east European countries, but felt that the Western European Union, converted by the Maastricht treaty into a defence arm of the EC, had to play a role.</p>

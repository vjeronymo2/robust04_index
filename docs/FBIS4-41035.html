			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign investors will only begin to deposit their  capital in the Ukrainian economy if there is political and  economic stabilization. This was stated in an interview with  the UKRAINSKIYE VEDOMOSTI magazine by Bohdan Havrylyshyn, an  independent adviser to the Ukrainian president. He noted that  if the current pace of reform is maintained, Ukraine may end up  in international isolation and be transformed into an economic  refugee. Bohdan Havrylyshyn emphasized that without conducting  deep economic transformations, Ukraine cannot count on financial  assistance from the West.</p>

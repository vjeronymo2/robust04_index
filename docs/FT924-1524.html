			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Japan withholding tax expected to continue THE Japanese government is likely to approve the continuation of withholding tax exemption for Japanese corporate bonds issued overseas. The decision, expected to be finalised today by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's Tax Research Commission, comes after strong lobbying from Japanese companies and securities houses, which feel the introduction of withholding tax would deter overseas investors. The Keidanren, the federation of leading business organisations, the Federation of Electric Power Companies, and the International Primary Markets Association, lobbied against the abolition of the withholding tax exemption rule for non-resident investors, or Article 6 under the Special Taxation Measures Law. The special law is reviewed every two years, and will expire next March. Japanese companies face a wave of equity-linked bond redemptions over the next two years, with maturities next year estimated at some Y10,000bn (Dollars 80.4bn). Most companies are expected to refinance these bonds through straight bonds. Underwriting of foreign bonds has become an important source of income for Japanese securities houses, which face a sharp drop in profits due to the sluggish volumes on the Tokyo stock market. However, the main beneficiaries of the move will be Japanese institutional investors, who are the leading buyers of Japanese corporate bonds issued overseas.</p>

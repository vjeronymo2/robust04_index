			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROCKWELL PUTS NEW DEFENSE ELECTRONICS UNIT IN ANAHEIM  </P> <P> In anticipation of reduced Pentagon spending, Rockwell International Corp. on  Thursday announced the formation of a Defense Electronics division, which will  be based in Anaheim and have 14,000 employees in seven states.  </P> <P> "This new organization merges the bulk of Rockwell's defense electronics  activities into one business segment," Kent M. Black, Rockwell's executive vice  president and chief operating officer, said in a statement.  </P> <P> "Modifying our business structure is only one of many tools being used to make  us more competitive."  </P> <P> The new division will be headed by John A. McLuckey, a 31-year Rockwell veteran  who has headed the company's Autonetics division in Anaheim since 1987.  McLuckey was named president of the Defense Electronics unit, which will have  projected sales of about $1.8 billion.  </P> <P> The Defense Electronics organization will merge the following divisions:  Autonetics ICBM Systems, Autonetics Marine Systems and Autonetics Sensors and  Aircraft Systems, all headquartered in Anaheim; Collins Defense Communications,  Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Missile Systems, Duluth, Ga.  </P> <P> "This internally provides a better management, under one organization reporting  to one person," said Tony Longo, a Rockwell spokesman.  </P> <P> In a separate move, Rockwell's Digital Communications Systems unit said it is  reorganizing its Microelectronics Technology Center in Newport Beach to focus  more on commercial programs rather than defense programs.  </P> <P> The move will affect about 70 employees in the sales, marketing, finance,  operations and quality-control departments. Rockwell anticipates placing more  than half of those 70 workers in other jobs with the firm, said Patricia Dixon,  a company spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Rockwell employs about 1,200 people in Newport Beach.  </P></p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Oftel move hits BT NEWS that Oftel, the telecommunications watchdog, had introduced a much tougher price-capping formula than expected, hit BT shares, which underperformed the market to close a net 7 1/2 off at 354p. The partly-paid shares were also heavily sold and settled 7 lower at 133p. Turnover in the 'old' shares reached 12m, while the 'new' partly-paid stock attracted turnover of 19m shares. Oftel told BT that its price fixing formula would be altered to inflation minus 7.5 per cent - compared with the current inflation rate of minus 6.25 per cent. Oftel's move was more negative than expected but still manageable, according to Mr Paul Norris at BZW. Mr Marshall Whiting, telecoms specialist at Girozentrale Gilbert Eliott, the stockbroker, said Oftel's move 'kills off suggestions that BT is loosely regulated'. He added that the price-capping 'runs the risk of putting too heavy a burden on BT's operating network; if you pare costs too much and hold back on investment then the service will inevitably deteriorate'. The Girozentrale analyst said BT shares 'will tread water at best, possibly they will track the market'. Mr Bobby Phillips of the telecoms team at County NatWest described Oftel's moves as 'harsher than expected but almost in the price'. He said there would have to be profits downgrades after the news. County reduced its 1994 estimate from Pounds 3.4bn to Pounds 3.3bn. The BT price cap also affected Cable and Wireless, which, via its Mercury telecoms operation, is BT's only UK opposition. C and W shares retreated 16 to 535p. Frogmore placing A placing of 3.9m shares in Frogmore Estates dragged the price down 32 to 268p. Regalian Properties, which had bought a stake of about 10 per cent in Frogmore last year for around 350p per share following a rights issue, placed these yesterday at 265p, against the overnight price of 300p. Regalian, which lost a fifth of its value on Monday, falling 5p, recovered 2 to 22p yesterday, ahead of today's results, but dealers suggested that questions were likely to be asked by shareholders after a particularly ill-judged move. It was estimated that after taking into account various expenses, Regalian lost some Pounds 4m on the deal over the six-month period that it held the shares. Regalian said that it had raised Pounds 10.57m through the sale and would use it to reduce group borrowings. In the banking sector, Midland Bank staged a strong revival after the sharp falls of the past couple of trading sessions triggered a flurry of cheap buying and the closing of short positions. The shares ended the day 6 higher at 426p on hefty turnover of 14m. Reuters unsettled Reuters shares were unsettled by a cautious investment note from BZW. The broker told its clients that 'the shares would need to fall to a price earnings relative of 125 or below before we renewed our buy recommendation.' BZW claims that the progress of Reuters' Dealing 2000-2 foreign exchange dealing system has been no more than gradual; that liquidity on the system is low with nine out of the ten banks involved in the Electronic Broking Service, competitor to the Reuters system, deciding not to participate in the initial phase of Dealing 2000-2 until it proves successful, hampering the rate of take up. Reuters shares closed 14 lower at 1134p. The insurance areas of the market were set alight by two stories; one, the suggestion that Swiss-based Zurich Insurance, and UAP, the French company were keen on buying a UK life assurance outfit; two, that life assurance group London &amp; Manchester was about to adopt the method of transferring any surplus from its life fund to the company's profit and loss account. The news triggered a strong advance by all the life assurance stocks, with Prudential leading the way and finishing 9 higher at 251p on heavy turnover of 6.8m shares. London &amp; Manchester jumped 18 to 286p. A block of 5.5m Refuge shares, just over 10 per cent of the equity, traded at 705p very late in the session. Composite insurance stocks also made strong progress led by Royal, shares of which were boosted by hints that the long-rumoured sale of its Royal Life subsidiary was imminent; Royal shares closed 9 higher at 254p, with a hefty 2.9m traded. Guardian Royal Exchange, long viewed by UK analysts as the prime takeover target in the sector, moved up 5 to 155p. Shares in bid target Dowty Group, the aerospace and information technology company, currently the subject of a hostile bid from specialist engineering group TI, closed a penny lower at 175p, equal to the cash alternative of the bid terms. The view in the market is that TI is likely to emerge the winner after today's 1pm deadline for the bid. One analyst said yesterday: 'It's in the bag for TI, so it's the end of the road for Dowty.' TI also eased a penny to end at 352p. Land Securities slipped 11 to 397p as the company, with large property holdings in the Victoria area of London, appeared to be badly placed in any deal involving the movement of civil servants to Canary Wharf. The oil sector remained under pressure but was helped by a bullish note issued by Hoare Govett. The stockbroker said latest data suggested that OECD first quarter demand rose by about 2 per cent, mostly attributable to stronger demand than expected in North America and Europe. 'We believe that the prospects for sharp oil demand recovery after the recession has been underestimated and that it should be possible for OPEC to achieve oil prices which average to its target, Dollars 22 for Brent crude,' said Mr Nick Antill at Hoare. Ship builder Vosper Thornycroft jumped 25 to 325p after the company reported a 12 per cent improvement in full year profits at Pounds 16m, ahead of analysts forecasts. The market was particularly cheered by news of the current order book put at around Pounds 700m stretched over a five-year period. Predicting that current year profits would rise to Pounds 20m, Mr Clive Forestier-Walker at Charterhouse Tilney said: 'Few companies have such a strong long term order book and strong cash position.' Panmure Gordon, the company's broker upgraded its forecast by Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 19m. Turnover in Rolls-Royce rose to 5.1m and the shares firmed 2 to 165p. Charterhouse Tilney favours the stock. Powerscreen edged a penny forward to 282p after reporting an improvement in full year figures. Mr Martin Ruscoe at Charterhouse Tilney predicted current year profits of Pounds 22m.

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Kinnock spells out limits for tax burden MR NEIL KINNOCK last night moved to end concern that Labour would push up the general level of taxation by offering specific pledges that the most important tax rates would not be raised. Speaking on BBC television's Panorama, the Labour leader said he would resist all pressures to increase the 25p basic rate of tax and the present 9 per cent level of National Insurance contributions. In the interview with David Dimbleby, he also pledged not to introduce a top rate of income tax above the 50 per cent proposed in his party's Budget nor to raise the present 40p rate paid on taxable incomes of over Pounds 23,000. In a confident performance which contrasted with his less-sure display in a weekend television interview with Brian Walden, Mr Kinnock insisted a Labour government's economic strategy would be bound by a set of fixed 'perimeters'. Those perimeters would include a commitment not to devalue sterling within the European exchange rate mechanism and a longer-term objective to meet the requirement for budget deficits set out in the Maastricht Treaty on European monetary union. Closely questioned on his party's stance on tax thresholds, Mr Kinnock insisted that these would remain indexed to the inflation rate. 'It is essential that they are because they have a terrible impact on people on average and below-average incomes, as we saw when Geoffrey Howe didn't index in one year and by that means gave a great thrust to the tax burden which the Tories never managed to get better,' he said. Mr Kinnock said Labour's economic strategy would produce investment-led growth 'greater than the growth of the Conservatives; that's been the historical record'. Earlier Mr Kinnock had dismissed Tory attacks on Labour tax plans as 'a little pathetic', claiming they reflected mounting despair in government ranks. Visiting a shopping complex in Dudley, West Midlands, Mr Kinnock said repeated charges that his manifesto commitments would require Pounds 38bn in additional spending had been judged 'absurd' by independent commentators. He added: 'Every time they repeat these ridiculous figures, the level of absurdity rises.' Insisting that he would not lift basic tax rates, Mr Kinnock said it was not in Labour's interests to alienate voters. 'The idea of us waiting to pile a great burden of taxation on the British people is patent nonsense,' he said. Labour used its morning news conference in an attempt to 'spoil' the Tories' expected return to the tax issue. Last night, in a party election broadcast, Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, sought to give a reassuring account of the effects of his alternative Budget. Asked whether a rise in public spending would be possible in the light of recent analysis of revenue and expenditure forecasts, Mr Smith said published figures did not suggest that cuts would be necessary. The emphasis throughout the day was on the caution of Labour's programme, with Mr Smith insisting that prudence had persuaded him to limit his spending plans in the light of the gloomy economic outlook.</p>

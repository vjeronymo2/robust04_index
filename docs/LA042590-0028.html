			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BACKERS OF PROPOSED CHURCH LOSE CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENT  </P> <P> A religious group that wants to build a church in Granada Hills complained at a  planning hearing at Los Angeles City Hall Tuesday that zoning restrictions  infringe its constitutional freedom of religion, but the argument backfired,  putting construction of the church in doubt.  </P> <P> Speaking before the City Council's Planning and Land Use Management Committee,  a representative of the Christadelphians said restrictions imposed on the  church by the Board of Zoning Appeals violate the church's First Amendment  rights.  </P> <P> The board in October said a church building could be constructed at 15711 San  Fernando Mission Blvd. only if membership were limited to 50 members and  worship restricted to Sundays and one weeknight.  </P> <P> "We very strongly object to the city limiting the membership of any religious  organization or any other organization," said Fred Gaines of Sherman Oaks, who  represented the group. "The limitation of the type and number of religious  ceremonies . . . is again a question of First Amendment rights."  </P> <P> Councilman Hal Bernson, chairman of the planning committee, agreed with the  Christadelphians' complaints, but said unconstitutional restrictions are the  only way the church could fit into the surrounding neighborhood.  </P> <P> So, Bernson recommended that the full council deny the church permission to  build at the site altogether.  </P> <P> "They can't really get what they need there with the conditions imposed," he  said, "and those conditions are there to protect the community."  </P> <P> The Christadelphians' proposal is scheduled for consideration by the full  council at the end of May.  </P> <P> The Christadelphians, organized in 1844 by a doctor in Virginia, oppose war and  believe Christ will return to Earth and establish the Kingdom of God,  resurrecting the dead to be judged.  </P></p>

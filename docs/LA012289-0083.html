			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOT OF WARMTH AND SOME HEAT FOR YAROSLAVSKY;  </P> <P> CONTENDERS PROTEST THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD EQUAL TIME AT FORUM  </P> <P> In one of his first political outings since he decided to seek reelection to  the Los Angeles City Council instead of running for mayor, Zev Yaroslavsky got  a warm welcome from a major residents' group.  </P> <P> Appearing with his three opponents for the 5th District seat before the Sherman  Oaks Homeowners Assn., Yaroslavsky spoke at length of his efforts to increase  police protection, reduce large development and improve government services.  </P> <P> Later, Richard Close, the homeowner group's president, said Yaroslavsky has won  the respect of voters on the valley side of the district. "The people in  Sherman Oaks view him as a leader trying to solve problems," Close said. "That  was indicated (at the meeting). I would be shocked if he had any problems in  the valley."  </P> <P> Close allowed Yaroslavsky to speak much longer at than any of his three  challengers on the ground, he said, that the forum, which was the monthly  meeting of the homeowners group, gave the voters a good opportunity to hear  their representative.  </P> <P> But Yaroslavsky's opponents cried foul, charging that the councilman was given  preferential treatment at the meeting, held Wednesday at the Dixie Canyon  Elementary School and attended by about 100 people.  </P> <P> Laura M. Lake, a Westwood activist who is seen as Yaroslavsky's primary foe in  the council race, said each candidate deserved equal time. The three stayed to  talk to Close at the end of the meeting.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'More Fairness'  </P> <P> "Close played fast and loose with the format. . . . We wanted more fairness,"  Lake said.  </P> <P> Challenger Jack McGrath of North Hollywood, a former campaign manager and chief  deputy of Yaroslavsky's who now works in real estate, said he complained about  the format before the meeting, to no avail. McGrath said he had hoped to  question Yaroslavsky about development and other issues during the forum.  </P> <P> Residents, however, were in no mood to throw stones, Close said. "This meeting  was an opportunity for the general public to complain or criticize. But  everyone appeared to be very pleased with what (Yaroslavsky) is trying to do."  </P> <P> In another event Wednesday, the ever-changing field of candidates in the 5th  District race changed again, when political activist Steve Saltzman bowed out  of the race.  </P> <P> Most observers say Yaroslavsky will be reelected easily now that he has decided  against running for mayor. But the remaining three challengers have vowed to  wage active campaigns, and Yaroslavsky said he takes them seriously.  </P> <P> In his opening remarks to the homeowners group, Yaroslavsky unveiled a plan to  add 10,000 officers to the Los Angeles Police Department by 1993. He also  discussed efforts to reduce development along Ventura Boulevard by lowering  density. Responding to questions, Yaroslavsky said he would oppose an  above-ground light-rail system in the valley if it were to cause problems for  residents.  </P> <P> "When it comes time to make the decision, . . . there's no way I'm going to  allow it to go by people's windows," he said. "I just ain't gonna do it."  Yaroslavsky also defended his support for slow-growth initiatives, telling a  disgruntled developer that he knew of no other way to control development.  </P> <P> The other three hopefuls in the April 11 election for the 5th District seat,  which includes the Beverly-Fairfax area, Century City, Bel-Air, Westwood, West  Los Angeles, and parts of Sherman Oaks, North Hollywood and Van Nuys, were  allowed to make only brief remarks at the beginning of the meeting.  </P> <P> </P> <P> UCLA Professor  </P> <P> Lake, a UCLA environmental sciences professor on leave who has been highly  critical of Yaroslavsky's representation of the Westwood area, said she would  always put the people's interests first.  </P> <P> "This race will be about fairly representing the people of the 5th District,"  she said. "We need a council person willing to work with the 5th District  rather than against it. . . . Vote as if your neighborhood depended on it,  because it does."  </P> <P> Lake had formally kicked off her campaign Monday with a spirited rally outside  the Westside Pavilion. At that time, Lake, who heads Friends of Westwood,  blamed Yaroslavsky for the expansion of the shopping mall and for other  developments that have plagued Westside residents. Lake said she believes  Sherman Oaks residents have the same concerns.  </P> <P> "I would not say that Sherman Oaks is in anyone's pocket," Lake said. "They  have enormous problems, and I think they're looking for a leader to solve  them."  </P> <P> McGrath also accused the councilman of turning his back on the voters.  </P> <P> "Zev was an independent, he was a visionary," McGrath told the Sherman Oaks  homeowners. "But the last three years, something has happened. We've got real  problems in River City here. . . . And we've got to bring people together."  </P> <P> Ryan Snyder, a private traffic consultant from Westwood, was the final  challenger to address the group. Snyder did not criticize Yaroslavsky but told  the group that he himself is the only candidate with the know-how to solve the  area's chronic traffic problems.  </P> <P> Snyder said he would create transportation-management organizations aimed at  addressing traffic woes in each community. Snyder also pledged to return the  diamond lane to the Ventura Freeway.  </P></p>

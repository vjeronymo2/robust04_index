			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Letter: Plan to reverse industrial decline Sir, Government speculation on recovery from the present recession is moving from the sublime to the ridiculous ('CBI cautious about timing of economic recovery', May 1). Gypsy Rose Lee would have a better record. Hundreds of our members in manufacturing and financial services are losing their jobs every week. They know the recession is deepening. But the chancellor is telling them that the economy has reached a 'turning point'. While there may or may not be a recovery next year, Britain's performance in relation to its main competitors will have deteriorated because of the loss of valuable skills. The present recession is reducing productive capacity, just when the need for a strong competitive industry is most vital. Britain will face the 1992 internal market having cut investment by 10 per cent in 1991. Mr Peter Lilley, secretary for trade and industry, believes more foreign investment is the solution. This is hardly the way for an independent democracy to order its affairs. Or do the Tories prefer the British economy to be run from Tokyo, Berlin and Detroit? Millions of working people want and deserve a secure future. A plan for industry, encouraging investment, training and product development is the only way to reverse the decline. Ken Gill, MSF general secretary, Park House, 64-66 Wandsworth Common, North Side SW18 2SH</p>

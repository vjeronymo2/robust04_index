			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / United Newspapers pays Dollars 100m for US periodicals United Newspapers, publisher of the Daily and Sunday Express, yesterday expanded its US advertising periodicals business through the acquisition of Harmon Publishing Company for Dollars 100m (Pounds 66.6m) cash. The purchase was made by United Advertising Periodicals, United's Dallas-based subsidiary. Recoverable trade debtors were also purchased. United Newspapers shares yesterday rose by 17p to 708p. Harmon, founded in 1988, publishes 216 local advertising periodicals - mainly covering homes for sale, but some focus on cars - in 99 markets spread across 31 states. The periodicals contain no editorial and are distributed free through supermarkets. Harmon, which employs 900, last year reported a turnover ofDollars 70m and pre-tax profits of Dollars 6.7m. It had net assets at the end of December of Dollars 9.8m, of which Dollars 7.6m represented collectable net trade debts which were paid for in cash at completion. UAP, founded in 1986, is already a leading US advertising periodical publisher, with annual turnover of Dollars 100m. Mr Graham Wilson, United's managing director, said Harmon was a good fit with the existingbusiness. 'There will be significant merger benefits,' he said, predicting savings on printing costs and on paper buying, as well as on joint use of distribution channels and display racks. Mr Wilson said the key to the US periodicals market was effective distribution. Harmon will be gradually brought under UAP's distribution system. About 30 per cent of United Newspapers' turnover comes from the US, said Mr Wilson, who expects the acquisition to bolster 1994earnings. Last summer when it launched a Pounds 190m rights issue, United said that several opportunities for expanding existing publishing and exhibition interests were being 'actively pursued in the US and Far East'. Mr Wilsonsaid yesterday that the purchase of Harmon 'fulfils part of those plans and isan important step in building a pre-eminent position in the US advertising periodical market'. Last December, United raised Pounds 73.5m from the sale of Extel Financial, the financial information group, to Pearson, publishers of the Financial Times. Lex, Page 20</p>

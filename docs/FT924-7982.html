			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Labour condemns 'spiteful mini-budget' THE Autumn Statement failed to provide an effective economic and industrial strategy for the future, Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, told the Commons. Waving aside shouts of 'cheer up' from the Tory benches he maintained that, with unemployment still set to rise, the chancellor should have gone still further in adopting Labour policies as a way of restoring the confidence needed in order to get the economy moving again. Mr Brown's remarks contrasted sharply with the enthusiastic response which most Tory backbenchers accorded Mr Norman Lamont in private and public. A concerted effort by Treasury ministers to brief Conservative MPs of the economic backdrop to the statement appeared to have paid off. He was told by one of his more persistent critics, Mr Nicholas Winterton, MP for Macclesfield, that 'your credibility has been restored'. Lord Parkinson, the former Tory Cabinet minister and frequent critic of the government, said on BBC television that Mr Lamont, 'was clearly right on top of the job'. But Mr Alan Beith, Treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, contended that the total package was unlikely to have anything like the impact needed. 'There is a danger that today's fireworks may burn out very quickly,' he said Mr Robert Sheldon (Lab Ashton-under-Lyne), a former Treasury minister, welcomed the chancellor's belated recognition of the need to help the manufacturing sector through improved capital allowances but warned 'although you have done something you have not done enough'. The decision to impose a zero to 1.5 per cent limit on public-sector wage increases was fiercely condemned by the Opposition. Mr Dennis Skinner (Lab Bolsover) accused the chancellor of having introduced a 'spiteful mini-budget' which attacked the lowest paid, and Mr John Garrett (Lab Norwich South), protested that thousands of public-sector workers faced an absolute cut in their standard of living and quality of life. The chancellor stressed that in the past two years public-sector workers had done better, on average, than those in the private sector. Responding to concern from Tory backbenchers that the policy of the banks had prevented small businesses from receiving the full benefit of earlier reductions in interest rates Mr Lamont noted that some had imposed a 'floor' below which they would not reduce their charges. To cheers, he said: 'I hope they will consider this position very carefully.' While the help provided for the housing market was given a general welcome Mr Lamont agreed with Mr George Walden (C Buckingham) that it would be 'a great mistake if we just tried to have a great house price boom again'.</p>

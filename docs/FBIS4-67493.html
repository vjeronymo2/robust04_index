			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Deborah Berlinck in Geneva] </F>   [Text] Brazilian Ambassador Luiz Felipe Lampreia was  yesterday elected chairman of a group of countries that will  propose a number of recommendations on trade and environmental  issues to the future World Trade Organization (WTO). These  issues could generate a great many controversies for the future  organization, as several countries, Brazil included, are afraid  that some countries, like the United States, could use  environmental protection to erect new protectionist barriers.    The WTO, which will start functioning in January 1995, will  regulate all of the agreements reached during the Uruguay Round  of the GATT talks and approved this month in Marrakech, thus  putting an end to the most ambitious global GATT negotiations to  liberalize world trade in history. The idea of the group led by  Brazil is to pave the way for the WTO to reach an agreement to  reconcile the requirements contained in the many environmental  protection treaties, including those approved in the Rio-92  Conference, with trade regulations.    This will not be an easy task: American environmentalists,  for instance, do not want the issue discussed at the WTO,  claiming that trade interests will prevail and that  environmental standards will suffer. It is the pressure of  these environmentalists that is forcing shrimp catchers in the  Brazilian northeastern region to install a new device in their  fishing nets to avoid the risk of killing turtles while catching  shrimp. A U.S. law protecting turtles enables the U.S.  Government today to ban imports of Brazilian shrimp.    In 1991, the United States banned imports of Mexican tuna  fish over the use of inappropriate nets that were risking the  lives of dolphins. The case was taken to GATT, but Mexico  itself withdrew the case later when it was trying to join NAFTA.</p>

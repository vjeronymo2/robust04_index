			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Chelsfield buys Belgravia property Chelsfield, the property company run by Mr Elliott Bernerd, has formed a joint venture to buy some of central London's most expensive residential property for Pounds 48.5m. The 17 buildings on the Chesham Place Estate, between Eaton Square and Belgrave Square in Belgravia, are being acquired from the executors of the estate of Mr Eric Hopton, who died in 1991. Chelsfield is taking a 50 per cent interest in a new joint venture with Olayan, the Saudi Arabian investment institution, to buy the portfolio. The Chesham Place Estate comprises 121,000 sq ft of residential accommodation, including some of the capital's most exclusive addresses, and 85,000 sq ft of offices. Chelsfield said that the portfolio had been valued for banking purposes at Pounds 53.5m. Most of the houses and apartments are let on occupational leases at rents far lower than could be achieved in the open market. The estate generates an annual rental income of Pounds 1.3m, against an estimated Pounds 3m which could be achieved if all the property was let at today's rents. The majority of the leases expire in September 1995. Chelsfield will then be free to either negotiate new leases with the occupants or to sell the properties. 'The estate has been well looked after but there are some development opportunities for us,' commented Mr Bernerd, Chelsfield chairman. 'We envisage a gradual realisation of the portfolio over a number of years.' Knight Frank and Rutley, the surveyors, estimated that the break-up value of the estate could be as high as Pounds 80m. Mr Bernerd added that long leaseholds offered for sale would have rarity value, because Belgravia is dominated by the Cadogan and Grosvenor Estates, which tend to grant shorter lea-ses. The joint venture company will fund the acquisition through bank borrowings. Chelsfield will manage the properties in return for a management fee linked to the investment performance of the portfolio.</p>

All fees shall be charged to the requester, except where the charging of fees is limited under &sect;2604.503 (a) and (b) or where a waiver or reduction of fees is granted under &sect;2604.503(c). Requesters shall pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Types of charges. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The types of charges that may be assessed in connection with the production of records in response to a FOIA request are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Searches <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Manual searches for records. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Whenever feasible, the office will charge at the salary rate (i.e., basic pay plus 16%) of the employee making the search. However, where a homogeneous class of personnel is used exclusively in a search (e.g., all clerical time or all professional time) the Office will charge $10.00 per hour for clerical time and $20.00 per hour for professional time. Charges for search time will be billed by fifteen minute segments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Computer searches for records. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Requesters will be charged the actual direct cost of conducting a search using existing programming. These direct costs shall include the cost of operating a central processing unit for that portion of operating time that is directly attributable to searching for records responsive to a request, as well as the cost of operator/programmer salary apportionable to the search. The Office will not alter or develop programming to conduct a search. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Unproductive searches. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Office will charge search fees even if no records are found which are responsive to the request, of if the records found are exempt from disclosure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Duplication. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The standard copying charge for documents in paper copy is $.15 per page. When responsive information is provided in a format other than paper copy, such as in the form of computer tapes and discs, the requester may be charged the direct costs of the tape, disc, or whatever medium is used to produce the information, as well as any related reproduction costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Review. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Costs associated with the review of documents, as defined in &sect;2604.104(q), will be charged at the salary rate (i.e., basic pay plus 16%) of the employee conducting the review. Except as noted below, charges may be assessed only for review at the initial level, i.e., the review undertaken the first time the documents are analyzed to determine the applicability of specific exemptions to a particular record or portion of the records. A requester will not be charged for review at the administrative appeal level concerning the applicability of an exemption already applied at the initial level. However, when a record has been withheld pursuant to an exemption which is subsequently determined not to apply and the record is reviewed again at the appeal level to determine the potential applicability of other exemptions, the costs of such additional review may be assessed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other services and materials. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Where the Office elects, as a matter of administrative discretion, to comply with a request for a special service or materials, such as certifying that records are true copies or sending records by special methods, the actual direct costs of providing the service or materials will be charged. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;2604.502  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Fees to be charged_categories of requesters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fees for various requester categories. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The paragraphs below state, for each category of requester, the type of fees generally charged by the Office. However, for each of these categories, the fees may be limited, waived or reduced in accordance with the provisions set forth in &sect;2604.503. In determining whether a requester belongs in any of the following categories, the Office will determine the use to which the requester will put the documents requested. If the Office has reasonable cause to doubt the use to which the requester will put the records sought, or where the use is not clear from the request itself, the Office will seek clarification before assigning the request to a specific category. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Commercial use requester. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Office will charge the full costs of search, review, and duplication. Commercial use requesters are not entitled to two hours of free search time or 100 free pages of reproduction as described in &sect;2604.503(a); however, the de minimis fees provision of &sect;2604.503(b) does apply to such requesters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Educational and noncommercial scientific institutions and news media. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If the request is from an educational institution or a noncommercial scientific institution, operated for scholarly or scientific research, or a representative of the news media, and the request is not for a commercial use, the Office will charge only for duplication of documents, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 20 May (MENA)--The Egyptian Foreign Ministry  last night summoned the Sudanese charge d'affaires in Cairo and  informed him of its strong protest at the unacceptable and  unjustified practices that primarily target Egyptian individuals  and families living in Sudan.    The Foreign Ministry explained that these practices come on  holy days, when Muslims everywhere celebrate the blessed 'Id  al-Adha, when there is tranquility in Egyptian-Sudanese  relations, and when Egypt has repeatedly stressed that it wants  Sudan's territorial unity and its people's interests.    The Sudanese diplomat was informed that Egypt will find  itself compelled to adopt the necessary measures and stances on  the bilateral and international levels to confront this policy.    MENA has learned that the Foreign Ministry asked the  Egyptian  ambassador in Khartoum to lodge a similar protest and to explain  the Egyptian stance on these practices in the same way the  protest was conveyed to the Sudanese charge d'affaires in Cairo.    Egyptian Foreign Ministry sources have stated that both the  Egyptian and Sudanese people feel regret and sadness over the  Sudanese Government's continuation of its unfriendly policy,  which aims to sever all ties and bonds between the two peoples  and to draw a gloomy end to a long history of constructive  cooperation and fruitful effort that served to deepen and  consolidate everlasting bilateral relations.    The Egyptian sources stressed that despite the feelings of  sorrow sparked by these unjustified Sudanese practices, the  Egyptian Foreign Ministry emphasizes the following:    1. These measures will not affect the firm relations between  the two fraternal Egyptian and Sudanese peoples because those  who are carrying them out are a "minority"; they do not  represent the Sudanese people and do not consider their  traditions and real interests.    2. Egypt has always wanted to safeguard the interests of  fraternal Sudan. It has expected the Sudanese Government to  show the same level of responsibility.    3. Egypt hopes the Sudanese officials will reconsider their  policy to safeguard their historic bilateral relations so that  Egypt will not be compelled to adopt measures and a stance that  so far, it has been eager not to take.</p>

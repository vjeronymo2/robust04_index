			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by National Congress President Marco </F> Vinicio Villar Anleu with unidentified reporters; place and date  not given; from the "Telepress" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] Deputy Obdulio Chinchilla Vega remains hospitalized  after he was the victim of an attack on 6 April. Reports from El  Peten Department indicate that the controversial congressman was  to be proclaimed presidential candidate next Saturday at a  meeting of the 12 organizations affiliated with the  Revolutionary Party in that department.    Today there were more reactions to the attack. Here is  National Congress President Marco Vinicio Villar Anleu, who  commented on the subject with reporters.    [Villar] The Board of Directors has no knowledge of death  threats against any deputy or against Deputy Obdulio Chinchilla  Vega in particular. We only know what has been reported about  the attack on Deputy Obdulio Chinchilla Vega and the attack  yesterday on Deputy Rene Barrios.    [Reporter] Will the National Congress Board of Directors  adopt any special strategy? It is obvious that any deputy can  be the target of an attack. Will the Board of Directors take  any special security measures or [words indistinct]?    [Villar] Yes, the Congress will take preventive measures to  protect the deputies and the building where congressional  meetings are held. It is clear that this was an attack against  the Congress as an institution, obviously to destabilize the  country and hinder political activities.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Villar] No. Our analysis of the situation has remained  within Congress. I have clearly said that we will not recommend  a state of (?emergency). That decision must be made by the  executive branch. It will depend on the information we receive  from the ministers summoned by Congress and a meeting we will  have with the president.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Villar] No. They were called upon to inform us of the  mechanisms, it is not an (?interpellation).    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] health of the two deputies  [words indistinct]?    [Villar] Thank God, we can say that Deputy Obdulio  Chinchilla Vega, who is currently in a private hospital, is  clinically out of danger, although his condition is still  critical. He will be under observation for 72 hours. As for  Deputy Rene Barrios Samayoa, thank God it was only an attempt to  kidnap him. He is in perfect health, but he was emotionally and  psychologically affected.    [Reporter] It is said that Deputy Chinchilla Vega knew there  would be an attack against him and that he met with the defense  minister and other top government officials the day before the  attack to inform them.    [Villar] We have heard that report. Several deputies and  even journalists have reported this, but the Board of Directors  has no official knowledge of that.    [Reporter] Deputy, Deputy Rene Barrios reportedly has not  filed any complaint with the National Police. [Words indistinct]    [Villar] We were informed yesterday and at last night's  meeting with the deputies and the Board of Directors that he  said he has information about the vehicles used in the  kidnapping attempt. He said he spoke directly with the president  and the presidential staff to apprise them of the facts. They  are aware of the situation.    [Reporter] Mr. Congress President, how can it be possible  that (?Congress has not) said anything about a possible state of  emergency when the government is waging a campaign in  Guatemala's [word indistinct] in support of such a measure.  [Words indistinct]    [Villar] Quite simply, the executive branch is authorized to  call a state of emergency. Congress cannot do it. All Congress  can do is confirm it if it is officially sent to the  legislature. I believe that the state of law and constitutional  order must prevail in such situations and that we should demand  that the executive branch, which is in charge of public and  internal security, adopt the necessary urgent measures within  the framework of the Constitution and existing laws.    [Reporter] [Question indistinct]    [Villar] No. I have categorically stated that Congress will  not request a state of emergency. So far Congress has not  decided to do that. The executive branch has the authority to  implement such a measure, and the decision will have to come  from that branch.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] can Congress ask the president  to impose [words indistinct].    [Villar] That is what I announced at the beginning of the  news conference. We are going to invite the president and the  two ministers to a meeting.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Villar] In the president's case -- I must be clear about  this -- in accordance with existing laws, he cannot be summoned  to Congress or to the plenum. We can, however, extend a cordial  invitation to him to attend a meeting within the framework of  the coordination of the branches of state, but always observing  each branch's independence.    [Reporter] Is it true that the secretary general of the  Christian Democratic Party left the country because of this  situation?    [Villar] I have no official information on that. I spoke to  him early this morning. He was in the country as of 0830.  Since then I have been in a meeting with the Board of  Directors, and I do not have any official information about his  departure.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] to generate a coup d'etat.  [words indistinct]    [Villar] I had not heard that until you mentioned it, so I  have no opinion.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Hopes launched of uplift in tanker shipping  -Events which point to the end of a 20-year bear market in new shipbuilding Attracting new money into tanker shipping has been a difficult task in recent years. The banks had their fingers badly burned, while equity finance has been hard to come by. But there are signs of a change. The past six months have seen a rash of equity issues which some analysts believe may herald the first significant uplift in the tanker and bulk shipping market for two decades. More than Dollars 500m (Pounds 335m) of new equity has been raised by means of rights issues and share placings to finance spending on new and second-hand vessels. 'We are seeing the end of a 20-year bear market in new shipbuilding,' predicts Mr Mark McVicar, shipping analyst at NatWest Securities. At the same time, family-owned shipping companies are taking the opportunity to restructure their businesses to make them more transparent, and hence more attractive to the institutional investor. Recent equity issues have included: Bona Shipholding. Established as a private company last year to own and operate the tanker and product fleet of Leif Hoegh, a Norwegian shipping group, Bona is raising Dollars 120m and seeking an Oslo listing. Its shares will also be traded in London and the US after the offer closes on December 16. The effect will be to reduce Leif Hoegh's stake from 76 to about 42 per cent. London &amp; Overseas Freighters. Lofs, a London-listed company controlled by the Kulukundis family, has placed Dollars 75m of new shares and obtained a listing on the US Nasdaq market. This reduces the Kulukundis holding from 85 to 24 per cent and gives the company greater exposure to US investors. First Olsen Tankers. This company was set up to take over most of the midsize - 100,000 to 150,000 dwt - tanker interests of the Norwegian shipping group Fred Olsen &amp; Co. It completed a Dollars 105m share offering last month. The deal left Fred Olsen and associates with an unchanged 45 per cent of the shares, but brought in new institutional shareholders and created a more tax-efficient structure. Other recent developments have included the listing in Oslo last June of Smedvig Tankships via a Dollars 138m offering, a Dollars 53m share issue by Benor Tankers, a Bermuda-registered operator of product carriers and a Dollars 61m rights issue by the Swedish ICB Shipping. The amounts of equity being raised are tiny compared with the billions which will be needed to renew the world tanker fleet over the next few years. Together they would buy just five new supertankers. But they are seen by shipping analysts as a hopeful sign of revival in the tanker sector. Underlying this flurry of stock market activity is the expectation of a rise in the charter rates for tankers and bulk carriers. Rates for a reasonably modern super-tanker are about Dollars 14,000 a day. Some analysts hope for an improvement in rates in the new year. On this will depend whether there are any more equity issues. Expectations of an upturn in rates are based on forecasts of economic recovery and an upturn in demand for oil. They also hinge on the end of the chronic overcapacity in tankers, which has depressed earnings for the past two decades. This overcapacity dates from the early 1970s, when new tankers were leaving the shipyards in record numbers. New tanker construction doubled in 1973 and again in 1974 before peaking at more than 35m dwt in 1975, just when the oil crisis cut off demand for capacity. Except for a short upward blip in market rates before the US-led attack on Iraq during the Gulf war, when large amounts of oil were pumped out of the Gulf and stored in tankers, the market has been dogged by excess capacity. But many of these tankers built in the early 1970s are approaching their fourth five-year survey, which can be a costly event. 'After 20 years you have to replace a lot of steel,' says Mr Matthew Stainer, shipping analyst at Schroder Securities. 'Charter rates have been so low that a lot of tonnage has not been well maintained. Over the next five years half of the tanker fleet will move past its 20th birthday.' This ageing of the fleet has coincided with the introduction of tough environmental controls by the US government and the International Maritime Organisation. The US regulations will force shipowners to modernise their fleets or face the prospect of being barred from American waters. The main threat hanging over shipowners is the US Oil Pollution Act of 1990, introduced in the wake of the Exxon Valdez disaster off the coast of Alaska, and other recent oil spills. Some provisions of the act will not work through until well into the next century, but others, such as the requirement for new tankers to have double hulls, have taken immediate effect. The tough liability imposed on shipowners by the OPA has persuaded some tanker operators to restructure their shipping holdings, reducing their direct stakes. The aim is to ensure that liability for a spill stops with the tanker subsidiary and cannot be enforced on the parent company. 'They want to reduce their catastrophe risk,' comments Mr Frans Hoyer, transport analyst with SG Warburg Securities. But the restructuring of the shipowners' holdings also reflects their desire to create corporate structures more acceptable to investors. 'Investors want clean structures which will be acceptable to the major stock exchanges,' comments Mr Stainer. 'They don't want conflicts of interest with remote management companies or promoters' fees.' Investors do not want a return to the late 1980s, which saw the launch of a number of closed-end shipping investment funds. Many of these funds charged management fees and often took a stake of up to 30 per cent in any capital appreciation of the vessels involved. 'This left a bad taste,' said Mr McVicar. More importantly, many investors lost money. The shipping industry is still dominated by private owners, but analysts believe that recent fund-raisings reflect a shift towards putting ships into publicly owned companies. Even some of the famously secretive Greek shipowning families are moving in this direction. But there are limits to this trend. Making a profit from shipowning can still depend more on a feel for the market - spotting when to buy or sell a vessel or an entire fleet - than on shaving 10 per cent off running costs by better management. And for all the excitement generated by the analysts' graphs of supply and demand, the sector is still notoriously dependent on the unexpected. A large oil spill or political upset in the Middle East could throw out all the clever calculations.</p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAC-10 SWIMMING AND DIVING;  </P> <P> STANFORD GRABS EARLY LEAD; UCLA IN THIRD, USC FIFTH  </P> <P> Stanford got off to a fast start by winning three of five events Friday at the  Pacific 10 Conference women's swimming championships at East Los Angeles  College.  </P> <P> The Cardinal leads California, 519 to 376.  </P> <P> UCLA is third at 340, Arizona State fourth at 304 and USC is fifth at 236.  </P> <P> Earlier, Stanford senior Katie Connors won the one-meter springboard diving  event at the McDonald's Swim Stadium at USC.  </P> <P> Connor edged UCLA freshman Kristen Walls, 410.85 to 409.65. Because the East L.  A. pool has no diving facilities, those events are being held at USC. The  three-meter springboard finals are today at 1:30 p.m. and the 10-meter platform  is Sunday at 10 a.m.  </P> <P> Stanford took up where Connors left off. After Cal won the 200-yard freestyle  relay, the Cardinal depth took over. Janet Evans led four Stanford swimmers in  the championship final of the 500-yard freestyle with a time of 4:43.74. In the  next event, the 200-yard individual medley, Stanford swimmers placed first,  third, fifth, sixth and seventh, led by freshman Janel Jorgensen in 2:02.81.  Teri O'Laughlin of USC was second in 2:03.67.  </P> <P> Kris Stoudt of UCLA won the 50-yard freestyle with an NCAA qualifying time of  23.36 to give the Bruins their only victory.  </P> <P> The Pac-10 men's diving championship started as UCLA sophomore Chris Dudka won  the three-meter springboard. He defeated USC's Brian Earley, 551.40 to 527.05.  </P></p>

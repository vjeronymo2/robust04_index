			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / China clay group to shed 230 jobs ECC International Europe is to shed 230 jobs at its china clay operations in Cornwall and Devon, Roland Adburgham writes. Most of the job losses will be at St Austell, Cornwall, where the unemployment rate is already 14.4 per cent. The company said 130 white-collar jobs and 100 manual jobs would be lost. It was seeking voluntary severance but could not rule out compulsory redundancies. Redundancies - to take effect by May 20 - were caused by a combination of factors. 'The markets we serve in the paper industry continue to be under pressure with some over-capacity,' it said. Another reason was the company's reorganisation last month into separate divisions for Europe and the US.</p>

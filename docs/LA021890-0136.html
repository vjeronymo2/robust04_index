			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPLY TO REALTOR  </P> <P> After reading Heather Simms letter (Feb. 4) complaining about Robert J. Bruss'  advice to sellers to only give a listing to a realtor for 30 days and to  include a cancellation of listing clause if the agent is not doing his/her job,  I am forced to wonder if these agents have ever worked for a living at all.  </P> <P> Her point questioning "what contract of employment may be terminated at a  moments notice?" betrays her lack of experience and knowledge of the workplace  most of us are familiar with.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, employees are terminated with little or no advanced notice every  day for incompetance, irresponsibility and low productivity. Are we to believe  that no realtor has ever been guilty of these traits?  </P> <P> Without the 30-day listing and cancellation clause what other recourse does the  seller have? If her personal sales record is as good as she implies, why is she  so threatened by such a contract?  </P> <P> As for the money Simms' realty spends to promote listings, is this not normal  business overhead that should be quickly repaid by high volume sales?  </P> <P> Furthermore, if a home is hard to show, if the house is untidy or asking price  too high, who else but the realtor is at fault? Isn't this precisely their job  to advise the client on these issues and if the client is uncooperative  wouldn't the realtor just as soon lose such a time-waster in order to better  concentrate on sellable listings?  </P> <P> PHIL MERCURIO  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

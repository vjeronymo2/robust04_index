			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [News Report: "Dunkel to Help Increase India's Share in </F> International Trade"]    [Text] New Delhi, 16 December--The government clarified in  the Lok Sabha today that India's share in international trade  will increase with Dunkel proposals, and it will not affect the  public distribution system in the country. The opposition  members who had been angrily protesting Dunkel since yesterday  agreed to listen to Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji on  condition that this issue will be discussed in the House with  the prime minister present there.    Mr. Pranab Mukherji said that the government had concluded  after a lot of thinking that India will benefit more by the  Uruguay agreement that will increase international trade. He  said that India's export may increase by $1.5-$2 billion.    Mr. Mukherji informed the House that the Uruguay talks were  finished the night before. At the same time, agreement were made  on intellectual property related to trade in the areas of  services and products, investment means, and general agreement  over garments and agricultural products. These will be approved  by the governments of 117 nations that are taking part in these  talks.    He said that the government had clarified several times in  the Parliament that India supports multi-party trade which  profits all the member nations.    Mr. Mukherji said that the agreement has made it clear that  only 10 percent of the total agricultural product can be given  in agricultural subsidies, and this is more than the present  subsidies. Mr. Mukherji said that the agreement has also  clarified that the assistance to the urban and rural poor does  not come under this system. Thus, our public distribution system  will continue without any problem.    The commerce minister also said that the government will  provide amble protection to farmers and researchers in the area  of seeds. He said that the agreement does not call for patenting  natural genes and genetic process. He made it clear that the  changes the government is making in patent laws in two years  will have no such provision.    Discussing ways for investment in business, Mr. Mukherji  said  that the government has the right to decide what kind of foreign  investment it should allow in the country. Discussing the  agreement over cloth trade, he said that we are not satisfied  with the desire of the importing nations to keep the present  system for the next 10 years and increasing the import quotas.    Mr. Mukherji said some industrialized nations tried to  change  the clothes agreement against us during the past phase of the  talks, however, we successfully defended our stand. These  countries said that India was taking advantage of the open trade  arrangement and was competitive in garment trade, but still had  closed its own market.    Mr. Mukherji explained that the permanent committee of the  commerce ministry had thoroughly discussed the Dunkel draft and  had recommended that India should try to protect its interests  in the areas of agriculture and intellectual property, and  should participate in multi-sided trade structure so that India  is not left alone. The commerce minister said that instead of  following another option, our participation in this agreement  will help us benefit from the international market.</p>

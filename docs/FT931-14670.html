			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tell the taxman ON September 30 last year, I retired at the age of 63 1/2 . At that time my tax affairs were completely in accordance with the PAYE tax tables. The trustees of my employer's pension scheme purchased an annuity for me equal to the benefit to which I am entitled by that scheme and my P45 form forwarded by my ex-employers to the insurance company involved. Instead of using this information the insurance company (on the instructions of the Inland Revenue, they claim) has been taxing me on an interim code (OT) which apparently authorises the removal on 25 per cent of the gross pension due, irrespective of my circumstances. This pension is my sole source of taxed income until I reach 65. As a result, although we are only nine months into the tax year, I have not only paid my complete tax liability for 1992/93, I have also had Pounds 274 deducted above my obligations (a credit towards my 1993/94 tax) Have the Revenue the power to so over-tax me, and have I any claim for interest on the over-paid sum and the costs of postage, telephone, photo-copying etc that I have incurred in getting the situation corrected? First the bad news: On the bare fact outlined, you do not appear to be eligible for any recompense from either the Revenue or the insurance company. Your complaint appears to lie against your employers: if they had explained what you should tell the insurance company's tax office in order to get the appropriate code applied to the pension, you would probably be paying the right amount of tax. For your employers simply to send your P45 to the insurance company was not very helpful - but there is, of course, no legal obligation upon employers to offer any guidance on tax matters to their retiring employees (and the cost of providing any such guidance could be taxable as a benefit). It is up to you to tell the tax office your date of birth. The fact that you have not given us enough information for us to calculate what your current code number should be, suggests that you may not have given enough information to the tax office either. So, probably, the tax office is not be blame, but neither are you, because you did not know what you should have told them. Write to the insurance company's tax office, giving formal notice of objection to code OT under regulation 10(1) of the Income Tax (Employments) Regulations 1973, as amended; if possible, say what you think the code number ought to be. Tell them your date of birth, the total pay and tax shown on your P45 (if known), and the amount of untaxed income which you expect to receive in 1992-93. (You told us that the pension is your 'sole source of taxed income' at present, but you said nothing about your untaxed income). If you do not receive a satisfactory response within a couple of weeks, write to the District Inspector saying that, in default of agreement to your objection, you now give formal notice of appeal against the determination of code OT and that you require the appeal to be heard by the General Commissioners in February without fail, in order that the correct (retrospective) coding be applied to the final instalment of your pension for the current tax year. We take it that you would have no difficulty in attending a meeting of the General Commissioners at short notice, in order to present your argument for an appropriate code number. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

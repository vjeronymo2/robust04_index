			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sextant, Allied Signal abandon plans for link Sextant Avionique of France and Allied Signal of the US yesterday announced that they had abandoned plans to form a joint venture in avionics which would have created one of the world's largest aircraft electronics groups. The companies said they were 'well positioned in their markets but that they were unable to find a mutually satisfactory way to integrate Allied Signal's commercial avionics and Sextant's commercial and military avionics businesses in a satisfactory way'. The problem appeared to involve Sextant's desire to guarantee the confidentiality of its defence-related activities. Sextant, which is controlled by Thomson-CSF, the French state-owned defence and civil electronics group, derives just under half of its sales from military activities. When Sextant announced last year that it was negotiating to form a joint venture with Allied, the French company estimated that combined sales could total more than FFr1bn (Dollars 170m). In spite of the failure of the joint venture, the two companies said that they would continue to explore areas of co-operation in the commercial avionics market.</p>

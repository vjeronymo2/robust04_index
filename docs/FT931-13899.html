			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fair play urged for lottery THE Commons national heritage committee yesterday appealed to the government to ensure that football pools and the new national lottery would operate 'on a level playing field'. The committee rejected the arguments of Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, that football pools were a game of skill rather than effectively a lottery and therefore not entitled to similar treatment. The committee recommended that the lottery and the pools be treated equally in the way they are marketed. Pools, for example, should gain the right to advertise on television, to market their products in the same way as the lottery and to roll up jackpots from one week to the next. At the moment all prize money has to be distributed in the week it is received. The committee, chaired by Mr Gerald Kaufman, Labour MP for Manchester Gorton, said 90 per cent of pools players used the same numbers every week so that the pools were in effect a lottery rather than a game of skill. The committee felt that 'the similarities between the pools and the national lottery are substantial; it is essential that the two should operate on a level playing field.' The committee said the Office of the National Lottery should be sited in the Liverpool area because that was where job losses in the pools industry would hit hardest. The second reading of the National Lottery Bill is scheduled for Monday. The shadow cabinet agreed last night to table an amendment to the lottery bill insisting that jobs in the pools industry are safeguarded.</p>

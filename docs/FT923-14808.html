			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Manders scorns Kalon bid as a defensive move MANDERS, the Wolver-hampton-based paint, ink and property group, yesterday dismissed the hostile Pounds 97m all-share bid by rival Kalon as a defensive move to eliminate competition. 'They are trying to nip competition in the bud before we tear them to pieces,' said Mr Roy Akers, chief executive. 'And it won't work.' In the defence document, published yesterday, Mr Roy Amos, Manders' chairman, claimed the offer was 'wholly inadequate' and did not take into account the significant increase in the value of Manders' investment property, a shopping centre in Wolverhampton. He added that the real reason for the bid was his company's acquisition of the Windeck paint manufacturer, Kalon's main competitor in the own label business. Windeck 'is now a serious challenge to Kalon,' he said. The Windeck acquisition would contribute more than Pounds 1m to profits in the first half, Mr Akers said. Mr Amos claimed that Kalon's sharp rise in profits last year - a 57 per cent jump to Pounds 9.2m - was the result of windfall factors. He cited the general increase in paint prices of about 10 per cent and the decline in raw material costs. 'The price of Kalon shares which ordinary shareholders are being offered is inflated by windfall profits and may not be sustained,' he said. 'These circumstances are unlikely to coincide again.' A takeover would also mean a 16 per cent reduction in dividend, he added. Kalon's 8-for-3 offer made last month values the target's shares at 262.6p, compared with Friday's close of 259p. Kalon closed at 98 1/2 p. Mr Mike Hennessy, Kalon's managing director, said the defence document had a 'very hollow ring'. He accused Manders of avoiding the questions raised by the offer document, such as the target's decline in profits. The company challenged Manders' accusation of windfall profits. 'How come they didn't benefit from the decrease in raw material prices and increase in paint prices?' a spokesman asked.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Alastair Morton faces financial engineering test: Why Eurotunnel's negotiations with banks will be difficult BUILDING the Channel tunnel has to date been as much a feat of financial engineering as of civil engineering. But Sir Alastair Morton, the former merchant banker who is co-chairman of Eurotunnel, now faces his biggest test. He has to persuade Eurotunnel's 220 bank creditors to continue giving the company access to its Pounds 6.8bn of banking facilities. Bankers are uneasy about providing this support as the Pounds 6.8bn is inadequate to meet the company's needs over the next three years, but Sir Alastair is refusing to give any binding commitments on how this funding shortfall will be met. The company's 18 leading or 'instructing' banks met on Wednesday with the four agent, or main banks - National Westminster and Midland of the UK and France's Banque Nationale de Paris and Credit Lyonnais - to discuss the conditions they should impose on Eurotunnel in return for continued access to the funds. A banker described the meeting as 'lively', with two UK clearers, Barclays and Lloyds, wanting to provide a longer-term funding commitment to Eurotunnel than Midland and NatWest. Eurotunnel and the banks concur however that sometime in 1994 the company will have drawn down all its loans - having already used up all its equity - and need about Pounds 500m more. 'We will have used up the Pounds 6.8bn by the autumn of 1994 on our forecasts,' Sir Alastair said yesterday. The banks, on the other hand, believe that Eurotunnel will need to ask for new funds in spring 1994. There are two main reasons for the funding shortfall: The tunnel is opening later than expected, in spring 1994 at the latest. The company's official line is that opening could be 'either side of Christmas 1993', unless there is a settlement of its long-running dispute over construction costs with Transmanche Link, the group of contractors building the tunnel, in which case it must open in mid-December under the contract. There will be significant delays in the delivery of rolling stock, so revenues will build up only gradually in 1994, while the company will have to pay out huge amounts in bank interest. Data shown to the banks on Wednesday illustrates that borrowings continue to rise to the end of the decade, mainly due to interest charges. As a result, Eurotunnel will need to be recapitalised with an injection of new equity. However, Eurotunnel believes it is impractical to ask shareholders for that money now. It could not issue a formal prospectus to accompany a share issue at the moment, because there are too many uncertainties about its future costs and revenues. Sir Alastair wants to wait until the company has operated for a full year - and can assess profitability - before raising around Pounds 500m from a rights issue and possibly also the sale of convertible bonds. But if the company will need to raise new equity, then some banks argue that they are already 'taking an equity risk' by continuing to provide debt finance. So they say they should earn an equity return. The four agent banks have therefore told Eurotunnel that it should pay the banks tens of millions of pounds in additional fees - Pounds 50m according to one banker - in return for their continued support. Eurotunnel was outraged by this suggestion, having been forced by its banks to quibble over much smaller demands for payment from TML. But Eurotunnel's more fundamental criticism of the banks' demand is that they are only proposing to allow Eurotunnel to continue to draw funds for a further six months - or possibly another year - after which there would be another round of bank negotiations. Using the bankers' jargon, the agent banks are proposing to waive breaches of the lending covenants to allow Eurotunnel access to the loan facilities. There is a deadline of the end of November to secure the waiver - assent is required from 65 per cent of the banks. However Sir Alastair wants the waiver to last until the tunnel is open. If the banks were to concur, Eurotunnel would probably concede the payment of additional fees, though it would still balk at Pounds 50m. Eurotunnel needs the waiver because it is in breach of its loan covenants. Indeed there is even a dispute between Eurotunnel and its banks about whether the breach is a less serious, 'technical' breach, or whether the company is in default, as the banks claim. This latter disagreement hinges on expectations of Eurotunnel's revenues during the early years of operation. The banks' forecast of traffic through the tunnel in 1994 is more pessimistic than Eurotunnel's. As a result, the banks expect the company's peak indebtedness to be Pounds 100m higher than Eurotunnel does. Even if Sir Alastair succeeds in obtaining a waiver until the tunnel is open, this would probably merely defer a final showdown with the banks. In the spring of 1994 the banks would have to provide additional debt as a bridging loan, pending a rights issue. Eurotunnel was taken to the brink of financial collapse the last time it tried to obtain additional bank facilities from its banks, in the autumn of 1990. The company would not expect it to be easier this time.</p>

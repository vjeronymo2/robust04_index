Meciar Favors Election on 24 and 25 </F> June"]    [Text] Bratislava--"I think it is admirable that Mr. Kohl  has expressed an opinion on something about which he does not  think it necessary to ascertain the actual facts; this  underscores the credibility of his point of view," said V.  Meciar following the coalition talks between the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia and the Slovak National Party [SNS] in reply  to a question from SME on what he thinks of the view expressed  by A. Kohl, secretary general of the European Democratic Union,  who feels that holding a referendum on the deputies' mandates is  incompatible with Slovakia's membership in the Council of Europe.    According to Meciar, the need to stabilize the situation and  to resolve the current political crisis was discussed at the  coalition talks. The two parties agreed to fundamental talks  with the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] on the means of  achieving stability. He also pointed out that it was necessary  to take into consideration the forceful protest from  representatives of the Association of Slovak Towns and  Communities against holding local and national elections at the  same time and the view expressed by more than 400,000 citizens  that all three issues be resolved by a referendum. "It is in the  interests of the state to hold the elections as soon as  possible. The optimum date seems to us to be 24-25 June, but  our two parties do not have enough votes to push this through  parliament. Therefore, we need to negotiate with other  political parties," said the prime minister. He added that "we  have agreed with the SDL that both parties will hold talks with  it."    SNS Chairman Jan Slota said that the date of the early  elections is the most important thing. He said that, for the  SNS, "the most suitable time is June. For this reason, it is  necessary to strive to ensure at all costs that the elections  are held in June, and, if the Slovak part of the SDL decides to  support them, we will be very pleased." He specified what he  meant by the Slovak part of the SDL as follows: "You would have  to look among those deputies and see. There are enough ethnic  Hungarian deputies there and, perhaps, also deputies of other  nationalities. In this part of the SDL, the majority are  Slovaks."    In reaction to the possibility that no agreement will be  reached in parliament, V. Meciar said that, in this case, the  citizens will have to decide because "such a loss of time leads  to a decline in credits and a decline in investments, the  state's economic interests are harmed, and the laws that can  help the economy cannot be passed."    According to the prime minister, the petition questions and  the referendum do not only concern whether a deputy can make a  free decision when laws are being determined, but also whether  the citizen has the right to supervise a deputy's activity. The  statements made by the Christian Democratic Union "are, in this  regard, a distortion of the situation; they do not correspond to  the political, legal, or actual situation, and I believe that it  will be necessary, to say the least, to draft a new electoral  law," added the prime minister.</p>

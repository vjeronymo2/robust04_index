			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tanya Tsekova] </F>   [Text] Sofia, January 12 (BTA) -- Bulgarian President  Zhelyu Zhelev and the floor leader of the Union of Democratic  Forces (SDS) Mr. Stefan Savov held a tete-a-tete discussion  which lasted for two hours and a half today. The two met at the  invitation of Dr. Zhelev more than two years after their last  meeting. During that time the president maintained his contacts  with the other parliamentary groups. After he was elected  president as a SDS nominee, the stands of Dr. Zhelev and the SDS  tended to diverge.    "We made a deep and comprehensive analysis of the domestic  and external political situation. As far as foreign policy is  concerned, there are no differences between the president and  myself, as for home policy issues, we agreed on one thing: The  reform should go on," Stefan Savov told journalists after the  meeting.    The two also dwelled on the scandal which the press recently  fanned up in relation to an issued but unpublished presidential  decree which, according to the two major political forces, the  Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and the SDS, provided for  creating structures parallel to those of the army. "According  to President Zhelev, the establishment of a military office is a  matter of collecting and processing information and it (the  office) will have no operational functions," Mr. Savov said. He  declined to make further comments and went on to say that he had  received the decree from the president and the SDS parliamentary  group will come out with an official stand after carefully  considering it. Meetings of the SDS and BSP leaderships held  yesterday decided to ask Dr. Zhelev expound the matter.    Mr. Savov said that President Zhelev has brought forward the  question of restoring the old parliamentary majority of the SDS  and the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS),  but the two failed to reach a common understanding, as the SDS  remained firm on their stand that they would never collaborate  with those who had betrayed them. The SDS-DPS majority fell  apart in late 1992, following a dissent on the formation of a  joint cabinet. Then the incumbent non-partisan cabinet was  formed on the mandate of the DPS after Prof. Berov was elected  by a majority of the DPS and BSP votes.    The opinions of Dr. Zhelev and Mr. Savov diverged on yet  another issue -- whether parliament should be dissolved in case  of formation of a caretaker cabinet and early general elections,  Mr. Savov also said. This will leave a period of some two or  three months without a sitting parliament. While the president  was supportive of the idea, the SDS believe that Bulgaria is a  parliamentary republic and should never be left without  parliament. This stand enjoys the support of the BSP as well.    There was full agreement between the president and myself as  to foreign policy, Mr. Savov said. The two discussed  possibilities for NATO-Bulgarian cooperation and the events in  Russia.    We failed to agree on most issues, but I think that the  meeting was useful and I am satisfied as a whole, Mr. Savov  concluded.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Top pay going overboard The public reaction to this week's Pounds 2.02m pay-off for Reed Elsevier's former co-chairman is symptomatic of a growing disquiet at the way UK executives are paid. Cautious efforts to reform the system have thus far focused on avoiding its most obvious excesses. But shareholders and executives should realise that there is more at stake. The steady pace of the current recovery owes much to the restrained growth in average wages. Bucking that trend in the boardroom may threaten that achievement. The three-year rolling contracts offered to Reed Elsevier's directors have been the subject of a welcome campaign by PosTel Investment Management, one of the UK's largest pension funds. So far, as Wednesday's FT survey on the subject showed, the fund's efforts are having limited success. PosTel itself has only tried to outlaw rolling contracts of longer than two years, though it is difficult to find a justification for ones lasting longer than a year. Even these would merely lower the cost of rewarding failure, not eliminate the practice altogether. Building a system of executive compensation that better matches risk with reward means analysing the way incumbent executives are paid, not merely those who depart with 'golden parachutes'. Headline-grabbing pay rises for top executives continue to incite public mistrust of that process, much of it deserved. Focusing on million-pound packages may give a distorted picture of the 'going rate' for upper and middle management, but overall behaviour is not much more restrained. Sedgwick Noble Lowndes, the pay and benefits consultants, last month reported that executive pay was rising 50 per cent faster than the 3.75 per cent growth in average earnings announced yesterday for the year to June. Sound judgment It is up to shareholders, and executives themselves, to decide whether their salaries are excessive, not the government. But UK shareholders are currently ill-equipped to make a sound judgment, while executives appear to see few advantages in restraint. One approach to making their interests more compatible, performance-related pay, is increasingly popular: 44 per cent of top executives are now covered by such a scheme. But experience of these schemes in the UK and the US has been mixed. Understanding the terms of such schemes is often as tricky as judging their effectiveness. Indeed, research by Mr Martin Conyon and Mr Paul Gregg, published yesterday in the Economic Review of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, indicates that even where the concerns of shareholders have an effect, it is not always a desirable one. They find that, in the latter half of the 1980s, many top UK executives were able to win themselves higher salaries by engaging in takeover and other sales-boosting strategies, even though this did not add to shareholder returns, and often made the company particularly vulnerable in the subsequent recession. Greater disclosure There is no single route to improving this process, but any attempt will rely on greater disclosure of its inner workings. The 1993 Cadbury report on corporate governance should have gone further in its recommendations on disclosure, but that should not stop shareholders themselves from demanding greater transparency. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission has forced companies to reveal much more than is now required in the UK. It is a human trait to believe that one is paid at least as much as one deserves, but this must be balanced against the broader consequences. Executives need to remember that a competitive market system depends, for its legitimacy, on the visible reward only of visible success. The current system ensures neither. The challenge is not principally to the executives, but to the shareholders who own these companies. Unfortunately, greater transparency is likely to have only a limited effect on their ability to control executive pay. Even if shareholders are given information, the fragmented structure of share ownership means that few have a significant stake in acting on it aggressively. It is up to those big institutions that own large shares in individual companies to give a far stronger lead.</p>

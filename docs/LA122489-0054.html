			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR MORTGAGE;  </P> <P> WHEN A NON-ASSUMABLE LOAN IS ASSUMABLE;  </P> <P> LEGAL RIGHTS: THERE ARE SEVEN SITUATIONS UNDER A 1982 LAW WHEN PROPERTY CAN BE  TRANSFERRED WITHOUT NEED TO REFINANCE.  </P> <P> Your elderly father died, willing his home to you. It will be perfect for you  and your family. But the mortgage lender says you can't take over the 7%  interest-rate mortgage. Don't believe it.  </P> <P> Or imagine that you and your joint-tenant friend co-owner invested in property  together. Your friend dies. The mortgage lender wants you to pay off the old 8%  interest-rate mortgage. Don't do it.  </P> <P> Suppose you and your spouse get a divorce and you receive title to the house.  The lender insists that you pay off the old low-interest-rate mortgage. You  don't have to.  </P> <P> In the three situations above, thanks to the 1982 Garn-St. Germain Law, the  lender cannot force the borrower to pay off the mortgage even if it contains a  due on sale clause.  </P> <P> There are seven situations where a non-assumable mortgage can be assumed. If  you know your legal rights, you can assume an existing mortgage without lender  interference. Here are the seven most common situations where you can avoid  paying off an existing mortgage:  </P> <P> When there is no due on sale clause. Many mortgage lenders instruct their loan  service clerks to tell borrowers every existing mortgage cannot be assumed when  a property title is transferred. This is not correct. The most obvious  situation where a mortgage can be assumed by a new owner occurs when there is  no due on sale clause. Always get a copy of the mortgage or trust deed to check  if there is a due on sale clause. If there is none, the lender cannot demand  payment when the property title is transferred.  </P> <P> When title is transferred by interhitance to a new owner-occupant relative.  When a property owner dies, if a relative inherits the property and occupies  it, the mortgage lender cannot enforce a due on sale clause. However, if the  inheriting relative does not occupy the residence, then the lender can call the  loan if it has a due on sale clause.  </P> <P> * When a surviving joint tenant takes over ownership. If one joint tenant  co-owner dies, the mortgage lender cannot enforce a due on sale clause and  demand that the surviving joint tenant pay off the mortgage. It doesn't matter  whether or not the joint tenants were relatives.  </P> <P> * When a new junior mortgage is recorded on the property. Surprisingly, many  mortgages have a "due on encumbrance" clause that says the first mortgage  lender can call the loan if a second mortgage is recorded on the property. But  the Garn-St. Germain Law prohibits enforcement of such a clause.  </P> <P> * When a divorce results in transfer to either a spouse or an offspring. If a  divorce results in a title transfer to either an owner-occupant ex-spouse or to  children of the marriage, then the lender cannot enforce the due on sale  clause.  </P> <P> * When property is leased for less than three years and there is no purchase  option. Some due on sale clauses allow the lender to call the loan if the  property is leased without the lender's permission. However, the Garn-St.  Germain Law bars lenders from enforcing such a clause if the lease is less than  three years and the tenant does not have a purchase option.  </P> <P> * When title is transferred into an inter vivos living trust. For estate  planning purposes and to avoid probate costs, many smart property owners place  their properties in an inter vivos living trust. Such a title transfer will not  trigger the due on sale clause when the borrower is the beneficiary and  continues occupying the property.  </P> <P> Many mortgage lenders routinely tell borrowers their mortgage must be paid off  when title to the property is transferred. But an advantageous existing  mortgage can be called by the lender only if the situation does not fall into  one of the circumstances outlined above.

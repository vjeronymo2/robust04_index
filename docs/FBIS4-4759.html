			<p>BFN     [Text] A high-ranking Chinese leader has told the speaker  of New Zealand's Parliament Peter Tapsell that the United States  should not force North Korea into a corner over the nuclear  inspection issue. The Eastern Maori MP has met the chairman of  the Chinese Government's Standing Committee, Qiao Shi, in  Beijing.    From Beijing, Peter Tapsell says Chairman Qiao told him he  resists the United States' confrontational stance and says China  doesn't have the influence over North Korea that Western nations  seem to think it has.    [Begin Tapsell recording] He was confident that left alone,  North and South Korea would iron out their difficulties in the  course of time. It wouldn't happen quickly, but he said the  last thing we wanted was to demonstrate a confrontational  attitude which might bring things to a head in this region. [end  recording]</p>

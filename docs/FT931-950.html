			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Saved pits could start to close within year BRITISH COAL executives expect to start closing some of the 12 reprieved pits within a year even if the company secures deals to sell extra coal to the electricity generators. They believe further pit closures and redundancies will be inevitable around April next year because of a fall in sales to generators from that month, and fear they may be forced to act sooner. 'Even if we can negotiate good supplementary deals with the generators, there are severe doubts about whether all 12 can survive a year,' one executive said. Problems will increase significantly in April 1994 because contracts about to be signed with generators include a 25 per cent sales drop from then, he said. Similarly pessimistic views were being expressed privately yesterday by a range of senior British Coal employees. Their comments will add substance to charges by the Labour party and trade unions that the coal white paper, published on Thursday, was a short-term fix aimed solely at ending a Tory backbench revolt over earlier plans to close 31 pits. An early test of miners' feelings will come next week after the politically moderate Union of Democratic Mineworkers decided yesterday to hold a strike ballot over the government's revised pit closure plans under which 19 of the 31 mines will either close or cease significant production. The Labour party said yesterday that in Monday's parliamentary debate on coal it would be calling for existing volumes of production to be maintained. It will also urge that the House of Commons adopts the recent report on coal by the trade and industry select committee which called for a larger market for coal than the government has created. The government seems certain to survive the vote but will face renewed criticism if, as seems likely, the negotiations between British Coal and the generators fail to secure a future beyond Christmas for all 12 reprieved pits. The manager of one of the reprieved mines said yesterday: 'There are two other mines in this area which have been reprieved. At least one of us will close within a year.' In the next few days British Coal and the electricity generators and regional power companies are likely to sign 'core contracts' involving 40m tonnes of coal for the year from April 1 and 30m in the subsequent four years. It could take months, however, to conclude contracts for additional tonnages aimed at keeping open the 12 reprieved pits. The level of subsidies, needed to satisfy generator demands that British Coal provides coal at world prices, is to be determined and this will have a crucial effect on how much coal the generators commit themselves to. The potential will be restricted by white paper provisions that British Coal must license to the private sector any pits it does not want. All of this could mean British Coal would have to settle for an extra 10m tonnes of sales in each of the two years the subsidies are likely to last and less still beyond that. Increasing productivity means some of the additional coal could be mined from the 19 pits whose short-term future was always secure. 'We are going to have to fight to keep more than a handful of the reprieved pits open after 1995,' said one executive.

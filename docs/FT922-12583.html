			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Companies prepare for the single market ALMOST half the companies in Germany have taken action to improve their ability to compete in the single European market, due to be introduced at the turn of the year, according to a survey. They are 'self-confident and well-equipped', the DIHT chamber of trade and industry reported yesterday. An analysis of a survey covering 15,000 businesses, published yesterday, said most had prepared strategic plans, incorporating several measures, to enhance their position. The most popular steps were investment and rationalisation of existing plant, product innovation and improved marketing. Some 17 per cent had prepared new products. Setting up abroad had been an option or a priority for relatively few, the report said. However, 8 per cent had already invested outside Germany specifically to prepare for the single market, compared with the 5 per cent which had said they planned such moves in a similar poll three years ago. Investment targets have also changed. Attention, particularly among high-technology and automotive manufacturers in the south of Germany, has switched from Spain, Portugal and Italy to low-cost countries such as Czechoslovakia. Despite the optimism, however, many employers recognised they would face increased price competition from other EC companies, and felt disadvantaged by Germany's high wage costs, company taxation and the burdens of meeting the country's strict environmental standards. Wage costs in east Germany last year soared to 31 per cent of companies' sales, compared with 20 per cent in the west, the IW economics institute, Cologne, said yesterday.</p>

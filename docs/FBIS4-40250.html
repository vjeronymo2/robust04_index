			<p>BFN     [Text] Lvov -- The political council of the New Wave  Association has made its decision on support of candidates in  the presidential election, Yuriy Shveda, chairman of the  association's secretariat, told UNIAN on 14 June. "Only recently  New Wave was inclined to support Ivan Plyushch," he said. "But  today there are two presidential candidates who really stand a  chance to be elected, Leonid Kuchma and Leonid Kravchuk.  Considering this setup, and also the fact that Kuchma  represents pro-Russian forces in Ukraine, New Wave has decided  to support and campaign for the current president of Ukraine,  Leonid Kravchuk.    "Although we have certain reservations about him, and we are  particularly dissatisfied with his indecisive attitude to  economic reforms and his personnel policy, New Wave sees no  alternative to Kravchuk," Shveda told UNIAN.</p>

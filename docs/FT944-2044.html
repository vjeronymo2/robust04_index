			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Books: Companions for the sporting life - Peter Berlin reviews the sports books of the year Until very recently the majority of sports have been ill-served by publishers. The exceptions were cricket and baseball, supposedly the more meditative and intellectual sports. Books on these were permitted literary ambitions. Thomas Boswell probably did not have his tongue entirely in his cheek when he called a collection of baseball essays: 'How life imitates the World Series.' It was no accident that, for most of this century, the only outstanding British sports refence book was Wisden, the cricket annual. Good books on other sports were rare indeed. That has begun to change. Sports publishing is still dominated by the shallow biography or ghosted autobiography, although some are considerably better than others. This year's better efforts include James Hunt - the Biography by Gerald Donaldson (Collins Willow Pounds 15.99); and Clough - the Autobiography by Brian Clough with John Sadler (Partridge Press, Pounds 16.99). Alongside the usual torrent of froth, the silver trickle of books which treat fans seriously is turning into a stream. These are books written by fans, often about the experience of being a fan. In Anyone But England, his assault on the English cricket establishment (and, by extension, English society as a whole), Mike Marqusee recalls life as a teenager in 1960s America. 'Swallowed up in a culture of mass protest which rejected competitiveness and aggression, I lost interest in sport.' He rediscovered sport at university in England, listening to Test Match Special with stoned, giggling ex-public schoolboys and at Taunton, where he watched Somerset play in the company of 'middle-aged men and women bundled in tweeds' . . .and 'not a few long-haired remnants of an era that was rapidly vanishing' - one of whom sold cannabis resin behind the scoreboard. Marqusee, who unashamedly sees the hand of Marxist historical determinism in Test results, is the middle-class rebel as sports fan. Colin Ward's Steaming In, published in 1989, was reprinted in paperback this year (Simon &amp; Schuster, Pounds 5.99). Ward is a different sort of rebel to Marqusee. The book is a paean to the golden days of terrace-fighting in the 1970s. It is a catalogue of thuggery across the British Isles and the continent of Europe. For all its violence, the tale has a heroic quality. Ward followed a code of honour. He disapproved of racism, thieving and weapons. He would not attack people who had not indicated they were ready for a fight, or continue to kick people once they were unconscious. In another time his tales of daring, cunning raids on enemy strongholds and brave defence of home territory were the stuff of manly young dreams. One of the hooligan leaders, Hickey, is courageous, witty, generous and deeply racist. With a different accent and a regimental tie, he could be the hero of a Buchan novel. Instead, he was arrested in 1986 as part of Operation Own Goal and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Steaming In makes an excellent companion to Nick Hornby's more genteel and literary Fever Pitch, about which quite enough has been written, and this year's gloriously eccentric - and award winning - addition to the fan genre, Football against the Enemy (Orion, Pounds 14.99) by Simon Kuper (now an FT journalist). Kuper spent nine months travelling the world, watching games and exploring the link between soccer and politics. Everywhere he went people told him: 'you've come to the right place'. In every country, Kuper found fans, footballers and administrators with tales to tell and theories to expound. Perhaps the star is Roman Obchenko, head of international relations at Dynamo Kiev, who explained that the club exports not just footballers but nuclear missile parts. Kuper does not need to hammer his point home. In the old USSR fans went to games to whistle. Soccer matches were the only place they could show political dissent. The lightness and economy of the account of a trip to a Celtic-Rangers match in Glasgow with which Kuper ends his book contrasts favourably with the self-conscious, stodgy and embarrassingly partisan meditation on the Old Firm rivalry with which Don Watson opens Dancing in the Streets (Gollancz Pounds 9.99). This is the tale of Watson's adventures in 'World Cup City'. It starts in a pub on the Edgware Road, where Watson watches Ireland qualify for the 1994 World Cup on television and ends in Pasadena, dancing in the streets with triumphant Brazilian fans. Ostensibly, Watson set off to follow Ireland. It is is difficult to avoid the suspicion that he was really following the footsteps of Pete Davies, whose All Played Out, a fan's eye view of England's 1990 World Cup campaign was, and is, a best seller. There are other worthwhile works of a more conventional nature: Mihir Bose's Sporting Colours (Robson Books), on sport in South Africa, Simon Wilde's Letting Rip (Witherby Cassell) about fast bowlers, and Boswell's baseball book, Cracking the Show (Pounds 19.99). But the best-thumbed books in any sports fan's library are reference works. These too are improving. Wisden remains a perennial best-seller, as does Rothman's Football Yearbook (Headline, Pounds 16.99), which celebrated its 25th anniversary this year. But while Wisden remains unchallenged, Rothman's now has a rival, The Endsleigh Football Club Directory (Harmsworth Active, Pounds 14.95). This lacks Rothman's polished presentation and historical scope, but does offer even more thorough player and club statistics. Soccer, with its large fan base, dominates the field. The outstanding recent reference books are works of eccentrics, obsessives - true soccer fans. Three of the best, Guy Oliver's masterful World Soccer (Guiness, Pounds 19.95, 1992) and Simon Inglis' engrossing Football Grounds of Great Britain (Willow, 1987, Pounds 11.99) and Football Grounds of Europe (Willow, 1990, Pounds 14.95) are being updated. A pleasing addition to the soccer library this year has been David Pickering's Cassell Soccer Companion (Pounds 16.99) a quirky mix of strange soccer facts and train-spotterish listings of non-league clubs. Beyond soccer there is the Radio 5 Sports Yearbook 1995 (Oddball, Pounds 11.99), the latest incarnation of the invaluable annual that started as The Sportspages Almanac, and gives a well-judged mix of statistics for almost every sport. It makes an utterly reliable Christmas gift.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Dunhill to buy Karl Lagerfeld fashion business MR KARL LAGERFELD, the German designer who is one of the brightest stars of French fashion, yesterday agreed to sell his business to Dunhill Holdings, the British luxury goods group. Lord Douro, chairman of Dunhill, said he paid 'less than FFr160m' (Pounds 16m) to buy Karl Lagerfeld from Revillon Luxe, the privately owned French group which used to control it. The Karl Lagerfeld business includes a Paris-based haute couture house, a shop on the exclusive Rue du Faubourg St Honore near the Elysee palace, the French company's trade marks, a franchise and a network of foreign boutiques. In return, Mr Lagerfeld has agreed to again become designer for Dunhill's Chloe ready-to-wear fashions business, acquired by the British company in 1985. He will present his first Chloe collection in October, said Lord Douro. Mr Lagerfeld used to work for Chloe in the 1970s but left when Dunhill took over. He was hired by Chanel where he is credited with having restored the group's image and fortunes. It is understood that he will continue to design collections for Chanel. 'This acquisition is evidence of our strategic objective to have a significant investment in the female luxury fashion market worldwide,' said Lord Douro. 'We look forward to further growth in the Lagerfeld and Chloe brand names over the coming years,' he said. Both brands' distribution and franchise networks would be enlarged. There would be no senior management changes, so that Mr Ralph Toledano would continue as Karl Lagerfeld's managing director and Mr Jean-Claude Piedelievre will stay on as Chloe's managing director, said Lord Douro. Several leading Parisian fashion houses are believed to be incurring losses, after two years' of recession, worsened by the Gulf war. Like most of its French competitors, Karl Lagerfeld does not publish results. It would be surprising if it were not affected by the fashion industry downturn. Dunhill also owns Mont Blanc pens and Hackett, a chain of classic English clothing stores, as well as marketing its own brands of accessories and clothes. Christian Dior, the fashion house which was floated on the Paris stock exchange last year, yesterday reported a 12.3 per cent net profits increase for 1991. The group, owned by Mr Bernard Arnault's Financiere Agache holding group, made FFr902m net. Operating profits rose from FFr5.89bn to FFr6.53bn. Most of the increase came from increased sales of champagne, spirits and luxury baggage, and through Christian Dior's share of profits in the LVMH luxury goods giant by way of a holding company which has 47.5 per cent of LVMH.</p>

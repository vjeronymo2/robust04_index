			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Books: Final drop for the scaffold - The history behind the abolition of public execution THE HANGING TREE: EXECUTION AND THE ENGLISH PEOPLE 1770-1868 by VAC Gatrell Oxford University Press Pounds 20, 654 pages This is a powerful, committed and well-written book with a problematic theme. Gatrell drives home the horrors of hanging and then seeks to explain the process by which hanging from the 1830s was confined to murderers and from 1868 was no longer carried out in public. This is not seen as a triumph for humane sensibility or reform, both of which are presented as having serious limits, but rather as a shift in the balance of terror by which control was imposed. For Gatrell, 'the abolition of public execution spoke for anxiety, not complacency'. The poor, still voteless after the 1867 reform act, excited the concern, even fear, of the elite, and hidden executions were seen as a more effective form of control. The elite was also concerned both about the responses of scaffold crowds, and about the extent to which public executions allowed both criminal and crowd to deride or criticise the nature of justice. Gatrell claims that the abolition of public punishment undercut those who pressed for total abolition and greatly delayed their cause. For Gatrell 'the state's retributive power continued to override imaginative compassion, and the horror continued behind prison walls for a century yet'. There is no doubt of where Gatrell's sympathies lie: of the judges, 'one or two like Dudley Ryder (Chief Justice of King's Bench) wept fashionably' as they sent young women to the gallows and subsequent dissection. After nudging a reluctant jury in 1754 to convict a possibly insane young woman of infanticide and then, 'very well satisfied', condemning her to the noose and the anatomist, Ryder made a speech which 'so affected' him, he told his diary, 'that the tears were gushing out'. Sir John Silvester, Recorder of London 1803-22, propositioned women who sought mercy for their relatives. There is an excellent discussion of the handling of appeals by the Home Secretary: Peel emerges as a determined hanger, who eased and encouraged prosecutions. He believed that society could survive in turbulent times only if secular authority was resolutely defended. The case is strongly argued. This is not the law as a consensual system for eliciting support for the norms of authority, but a cruel, callous, calculating and vicious denial of justice. Many will find this a convincing analysis, but doubts can be expressed. Without making any reference to the modern debate on capital punishment, it can be argued that Gatrell displays all too little sympathy both for the victims of murder and for the problems created by social change. There was major change in the 19th century, necessarily as both cause and consequence of a society with a mass electorate, universal education, and widespread urbanisation and industrialisation. These brought social dislocation, instability and fears. Deference and traditional social patterns, never as fixed as some thought, ebbed, and the new and newly expanded cities and towns created new living environments in which the role and rule of the old world were far less significant. These problems clearly do not excite Gatrell's sympathetic attention; indeed his essential outsider's approach, which provides much of the passion of the book, is also one of his limitations. The views of the scaffold crowd are analysed, but there is insufficient attention to legal and governmental policies and strategies. Cruelty again is a complex issue. A society that was willing to send its men to kill and be killed across the face of the globe, that in 1878 applauded the 'Great Macdermott' as his music-hall song launched jingoism, may have had a different emphasis than Gatrell suggests. He is understandably repelled by the practice and details of 19th-century executions, but to this reviewer much of his fascinating book was more redolent of the 1960s than of the Victorian era. The discussion of the manner in which many sought to disguise the reality of what was going on is compelling as is the brutality of many of the case studies, but it is far from clear that most of the population had any real sympathy with murderers or regretted their fate. Yet, this is a continually interesting book, by the standards of modern scholarly publishing excellent value for money, and a study that ably bridges modern and historical concerns.

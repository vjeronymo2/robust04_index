			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISRESPECT FOR LAWYERS AND THE COURTS  </P> <P> Some of us do not love to hate lawyers -- but two years of being either ignored  or over-charged by some of Southern California's finest attorneys turned my  former admiration to the proverbial ashes and dust in my mouth.  </P> <P> To be told by more than one, "It does not pay me to take a case only involving  $7,000" only becomes understandable when one remembers the hourly charges as  shown in a recent Times article. Most of the local attorneys charge more per  hour than I can earn in one day. It takes me a very long time to save up $7,000  let alone the sanctions ordered by a judge.  </P> <P> As a widow still unable to work full-time, I am falling so far behind in my  debts that there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel. What seems left  is either bankruptcy or suicide.  </P> <P> The legal system is set up by attorneys -- but if one is too rich for charity  and too poor to pay an attorney, there is no place left to turn. My husband was  a World War II veteran with five medals. He never used one red cent of his  veterans benefits -- but his widow cannot find anyone in the legal system to  help.  </P> <P> MRS. K. TANAKA  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MASTERS NATIONAL CYCLING;  </P> <P> TESKE, HOFFENBERG BEAT THE PACK USING TEAM TACTICS TO FINISH 1-2  </P> <P> Team tactics paid off for Evan Teske and Mark Hoffenberg as they finished  one-two in the men's 30-34 Criterium at the Great Earth Masters National  Cycling Championships Sunday.  </P> <P> In the race, which consisted of over 100 cyclists, Teske and Hoffenberg worked  together with teammates Tom Broznowski (of San Diego) and Danny Van Haute (of  San Marcos) to take control of the field. (Broznowski and Van Haute race for  Cycles Veloce).  </P> <P> Teske crossed the finish line in 1:23.25 with Hoffenberg close behind.  </P> <P> "We were planning to get a break away going with two to three guys and  hopefully lap the field," said Teske, who rides for Nissan/Schwinn. "We wanted  at least two guys in the top three."  </P> <P> Said Hoffenberg, who rides for Vita-Crunch/Schwinn: "We wanted to send guys off  in pairs. Danny and I were a pair and Tom and Evan were a pair. We just wanted  the team to do well."  </P> <P> In the middle of the 47-lap, 60 kilometer race Broznowski and Steve Wood (of  Brentwood), riding for Velo Club LaGrange, broke away from the pack and held  the lead for eight laps before being absorbed by the field of racers.  </P> <P> Wood again broke away, this time solo, with eight laps remaining in the race,  but five laps later he dropped back into the pack. Wood finished third.  Broznowski remained in the front of the field with two laps remaining but fell  back and failed to place.  </P> <P> "I did my best to get away because I'm normally not a very good sprinter," Wood  said. "Then a big hole opened up."  </P> <P> Teske was in the center of the pack when he saw his chance to break free.  </P> <P> "I was boxed in really bad," Teske said. "Somewhere half-way down the stretch a  hole opened up and I turned on the after burner."  </P> <P> Said Hoffenberg: "When there was 100 meters to go and I saw my teammate's  jersey, I was pretty confident it was Evan, I knew it was going to be a one-two  finish. Evan just barely beat me. It was so close."  </P> <P> Hoffenberg had to rely on teammates to move ahead, because as the defending  national champion he wore the red-white-and-blue jersey and was being  challenged by other cyclists.  </P> <P> "The problem with wearing this jersey is they're not willing to let me go,"  Hoffenberg said. "With 10 laps to go I fell back and tried to remain  inconspicuous."  </P> <P> Last year Teske placed 13th in the Criterium, 10th in the road race and 10th in  the time trials. He will be competing in the road race but decided not to do  the time trials this year.  </P> <P> "I'm really just a criterium rider, a sprinter but I'm basically going to the  road race to help the team," Teske said.  </P> <P> Teske felt he had a good chance of winning, coming off two victories at a  Masters Criterium in Temecula last weekend. He won the 30+ criterium and a  category I-II race.  </P> <P> A collision on the final stretch of the women's 35-39 race had a definite  effect on the outcome.  </P> <P> The eventual winner was Karen Hornbostel of Louisville, Colo. with Camille Hood  of Katy Texas close behind.  </P> <P> Meg Berry (of Vista) and former national champion Betsy King (of Gainesville,  Fla.) collided then crashed into the sideline fence and were unable to finish  the race.  </P> <P> There was a discrepancy among cyclists as to what actually occurred in the  collision. Moments following the crash King began blaming it on Hood who was  actually ahead of the group when the crash occured.  </P> <P> King immediately left the race site and according to Race Director Mike  McCollum, King went to the hospital with a deep puncture wound in her arm.  </P> <P> Berry, who lost consciousness, was treated by American Red Cross medics for a  badly bruised arm and abrasions on her hip.  </P> <P> "I was passing everyone. I was coming on the inside of Betsy King. She knew I  could win so she plowed me into the fence. I was going about 40 miles an hour  when I hit," Berry said.  </P> <P> "Linda Stein (of Laguna Beach) who was riding my wheel said she saw Betsy plow  into me then someone ran into her. Betsy said that someone ran into her but she  was the one to hit me first."  </P> <P> Local rider Tisha Whitney, of Irvine, who rides with San Diego Cyclo-Vets, won  the national title in the women's 40-44 race in 56:47.  </P></p>

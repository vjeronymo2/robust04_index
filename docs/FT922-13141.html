			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Letter: Short-term view is a threat to Britain's energy R&amp;D Sir, The Central Electricity Generating Board took its responsibilities for pursuing generic R&amp;D in energy supply seriously, if a little heavy-handedly. Its successors, as Clive Cookson points out (Technology: 'A shock to the system', April 9), have abandoned this responsibility, no doubt with, as always, the shareholders in mind. The power manufacturing industry is equally bad; the result of kow-towing to the CEGB for many years and expecting the CEGB to pay for any research they did. So who is to be responsible for long-term R&amp;D in future; the regulator? He has more than enough on his plate. The Department of Energy might have done, but that, according to the Conservatives' manifesto, is to disappear into the maw of Department of Trade and Industry. We are in serious danger of becoming an offshore energy 'banana republic', buying licences from European colleagues who have the good sense to take a long-term view rather than rely on market-led, short-termism as an 'energy strategy'.

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / International Company News: BIS finds mixed securities trend Investors were heavy sellers of securities in the first quarter, while banks became net sellers in the second quarter, according to the latest report on international banking and financial market developments by the Bank for International Settlements. In the first quarter, there was 'a major reduction in holdings of foreign securities by non-bank entities located in Japan', according to the report. 'As a result of an increased preference for liquidity among non-bank investors, banks in the US, Germany, Switzerland and France recorded a strong rise in external liabilities.' While institutional investors may have completed much of their portfolio adjustment by the end of the first quarter, following the turnround in the US interest rate cycle in early February, some banks were net sellers of securities in the second quarter, having been net buyers in the first. However, Japanese residents became net buyers in April. Unsettled market conditions also affected financing activity, with primary issues of international bonds down 33 per cent from the first quarter at Dollars 90bn, and net new issuance down 61 per cent. This suggests that reflows of capital and interset payments were the main support of activity. 'Increased investor reluctance to commit funds to bond issues forced some borrowers to delay planned flotations, to scale down the size of offerings, to shorten the maturity profile of their debt or to offer investors more generous terms,' the report said.</p>

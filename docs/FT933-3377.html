			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Forth Ports shares jump despite warning SHARES in Forth Ports jumped to a high of 365p yesterday, shrugging off the Scottish port operator's warning on second half trading to focus on better than expected interim operating profits of Pounds 5.66m against Pounds 5.05m last year. The shares, which were floated on the stock exchange at 110p in March last year, fell back by the end of the day to close 23p higher at 357p. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 27 fell by Pounds 980,000 to Pounds 5.49m, reflecting the loss of interest gains following the early repayment of government loans. Earnings per share fell from 15.4p to 11.9p, largely due to the repayment. Turnover was 5 per cent higher at Pounds 17.1m, while overall tonnage increased by more than 4 per cent to 11.4m tonnes. Mr Hugh Thompson, Forth's chief executive, warned that the second half would not be as good as the first. In spite of overall increases in tonnage for products including animal feeds, cement and timber the markets served by some of Forth's main customers - most particularly British Pipe Coaters, which serves the North Sea oil sector - remained depressed. However, he was more optimistic about 1994, citing the new BP terminal. Tonnage handled by the new terminal and the existing one would be more than three times the volume expected this year. This bullish outlook left the group sufficiently confident to increase its dividend by 13 per cent to 2.25p. The group's property joint venture had concluded the Pounds 47.5m sale of land and development to the government for the new Scottish Office. Mr Thompson said the payments would be made in stages until 1995. Mr Thompson said Forth had 'not wasted any money' in preliminary investigations into the acquisition of Medway Ports, which is now in takeover discussions with Mersey Docks Harbour Company. Forth was now interested in pursuing purchases of soon-to-be-privatised ports on the east coast of England.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (24): Where are the expatriates? - Investment from Britain LIKE unwilling guests at a feast, they are reluctant to come to the table. Even when they do, they don't really want to taste the delicacies. This just about sums up the attitude of Indians to overtures by the Indian government to invest in their motherland. Chinese success is in complete contrast to the Indian experience. 'India can never become China,' said Mr Manmohan Singh, India's finance minister, after a recent meeting with London's wealthy NRIs (or non-resident Indians). 'Unfortunately, there are not too many Indians flourishing outside India. Besides, the Chinese programme began in the 1970s. We started much later. Even in 1986, the reform programme was very limited. Today we have a greater canvas.' But its colours may not be rich enough. The lack of seriously wealthy people is just one factor. Lack of industrial entrepreneurship is a greater hurdle. Almost without exception, Indian businessmen who come to the UK - both from India and East Africa - start out as traders and shopkeepers. Many get into real estate. Some into catering and hotels. Few are able to change their mind-set. 'If they find it difficult to make the transition from being a trader to an industrialist in the UK, how can they do so in India?' asks Mr Raj Kumar Bagri, chairman of the Pounds 350m Metdist Group and the London Metal Exchange. Mr Bagri is one of the very few NRIs to have jumped this barrier - in rags-to-riches style. He reached London with Pounds 2,000 in his pocket in 1959. Today there are Metdist offices in the UK, India, Canada, Nigeria and Malaysia, though the group's biggest manufacturing concerns are in Malaysia, where it runs a 85,000 tonnes a year copper rod and wire mill and a highly sophisticated Dollars 50m integrated copper tube plant supplying the air conditioning industry. Lack of industrial entrepreneurship is compounded by a perceptible lack of interest in India among second generation immigrants. Brought up in the UK, this jeans generation is not bound to India by the same feelings as their parents. Increasingly they will be responsible for investment decisions. Some have already stepped into top management, others are waiting in the wings. Most simply do not want the hassle of learning about and dealing with a notoriously difficult country. 'Once I am out of the picture, I doubt if my sons will have the same enthusiasm for India which I have,' acknowledges Mr Swraj Paul, chairman of the Caparo Group, a privately owned Pounds 330m steel products group. Mr Paul, 61, emigrated from India to the UK in 1966. Today, his three sons run the 17-company business on a day-to-day basis. Over the past 10 years, Mr Paul has proposed - unsuccessfully - several major projects in India, including a Rs7.5bn fertiliser plant at Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh and the Rs60bn rehabilitation of the Indian Iron and Steel Co at Burnpur, West Bengal. Unperturbed by his failures, his latest ambition is to build a Rs64bn 1.5m tonne a year integrated steel plant at Daitari, in Orissa. 'I would prefer a smaller project in India, say one requiring just Dollars 1-Dollars 2m. I love India, but sometimes I wonder why we are wasting time there,' says Mr Angad Paul, 23, revealing the enormous gap between his father's ambitions and his own. Currently, Paul junior is cutting his business teeth by setting up a small plastic extrusion plant in the UK. On occasions when parents do gain the support of their progenies for Indian adventures, NRIs find they are unable to cut though India's thick red tape. 'The spirit of reforms has yet to percolate through the bureaucracy and to state governments. A core of dedicated civil servants must be identified if foreign investment is to increase,' says Mr Gopichand Hinduja, one of the four brothers who founded the estimated Pounds 1bn Hinduja Group. The mainly trading conglomerate already runs India's second largest truck manufacturer (Ashok Leyland) and hopes to promote a power plant, an oil refinery, a lubricants company and a financial services firm in India, besides enhancing Ashok Leyland's product range. While local Indians take petty hassles in their stride, dealing with the Indian bureaucracy is much more frustrating for NRIs who commute thousands of miles between their headquarters and India. 'Despite liberalisation, the implementation of any project in India is still like entering a hurdle race when it comes to sorting out details with state and local authorities on infrastructure, local taxes and related issues,' ' says Mr Bagri. 'You have to take India on trust.' Mr Bagri has certainly done so. His project is one of a handful which may take off shortly. These include: a Rs2bn 150,000 tonnes a year copper smelter and refinery by the Metdist Group. The plant will simultaneously produce 450,000 tonnes a year of byproducts and sulphuric acid. It will also have its own power station. a Rs60bn 2x500 megawatt thermal power station to be developed by the Hinduja Group in collaboration with UK's National Power. Located at Vishakhapatnam, in Andhra Pradesh, the project is at an advanced stage. a Rs1.86bn 200,000 tonnes a year cold rolled sheets and coils plant by the Comcratt Group. Located at Palej, Gujarat, the plant is ready for commissioning. The pitifully small number of projects highlights the fact that out of the approximately 820,000 Indians living in the UK, few have the ability, the money or the interest to invest in India's future.</p>

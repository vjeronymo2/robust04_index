			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSIAL COUNCILMAN IN RANCHO P.V. RESIGNS ABRUPTLY;  </P> <P> POLITICS: COLLEAGUES AT CITY HALL ARE STUNNED -- ESPECIALLY SINCE ROBERT E.  RYAN IS LISTED AS A COUNCIL CANDIDATE IN THE NEXT ELECTION.  </P> <P> Longtime Rancho Palos Verdes Councilman Robert E. Ryan, who had bickered with  council colleagues and is a candidate in the Nov. 7 election, resigned without  warning in a one-sentence statement he left for the council at its meeting  Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Ryan did not attend the meeting and could not be reached for comment Wednesday.  </P> <P> "This is to inform you that I am resigning as a member of the Rancho Palos  Verdes City Council, effective 7:30 p.m. Oct. 17," Ryan wrote in the  one-sentence resignation read by City Clerk Jo Purcell, who also is his wife.  </P> <P> Council members and the audience of 30 were stunned. Ryan has been on the  council since the city's incorporation in 1973, and served as both mayor and  mayor pro tem.  </P> <P> "I am very surprised. It was a shock," said Mayor Jacki Bacharach during a  recess.  </P> <P> Ryan's name appears on the November ballot.  </P> <P> "He can theoretically resign from this council and be elected to the next. . .  . That certainly is possible," said City Manager Dennis McDuffie.  </P> <P> Purcell said in an interview during a recess that her husband is not ill,  adding she had little warning of his plan.  </P> <P> In a telephone call Wednesday, Purcell said: "I didn't know about it, and I  have nothing else left to say."  </P> <P> Bacharach, a contender in next month's election, said that despite Ryan missing  the last couple of meetings, she had no idea that he would resign.  </P> <P> City Atty. Ariel P. Calonne said Ryan's resignation is final.  </P> <P> Robert E. McNulty, an attorney who is challenging Ryan in the election,  speculated that Ryan's resignation might be due to illness because Ryan has not  been seen in several weeks.  </P> <P> "My ego would like to think we were doing so well, and he'd rather resign than  to face defeat," said McNulty outside the council meeting.  </P> <P> In April, Ryan said this might be his last term on the council, though, he  said, he could change his mind to combat development.  </P> <P> Two Ryan allies, Councilman John McTaggart and businessman Alan Carlan, said  they too were surprised by Ryan's resignation, adding that he appeared "fired  up" at a homeowners association meeting last weekend.  </P> <P> "He gave no hints he'd resign," said Carlan, who is running for a seat on the  council.  </P> <P> City Manager Dennis McDuffie, with whom Ryan often butted heads, said he could  not understand why Purcell did not tell the council of her husband's  resignation earlier Tuesday.  </P> <P> "That's what I find disturbing," McDuffie said.  </P> <P> At a council meeting in August, Ryan had called McDuffie the worst city manager  in the city's history.  </P> <P> "He was a city councilman, and I am a city manager. However, in his case, it  was not a mutual admiration society," McDuffie said Wednesday in describing his  relationship with Ryan.  </P> <P> Ryan's name-calling caused low morale among some at City Hall.  </P> <P> In March, tension between Ryan and the council majority swelled when the  council learned of Ryan's December, 1987, marriage to Purcell. Councilman Mel  Hughes called it deceit.  </P> <P> Councilman Douglas Hinchliffe, who characterized his relationship with Ryan as  adversarial, nevertheless praised Ryan for his 16 years of service to the city.  </P></p>

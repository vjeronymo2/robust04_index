			<p>BFN     [Text] The situation in the state of emergency zone will  never stabilize if the Interim Administration on Ingush and  South Ossetian territory and Vladikavkaz ignore the decree on  the return of deported Ingush to their places of permanent  residence issued by the Russian president. This was stated by  Ingush President Ruslan Aushev at a press conference in Nazran  today. The press conference was held on the decision of the  Russian Federation Council which had confirmed the presidential  decree on extending the state of emergency in the zone of the  inter-ethnic conflict until July 31.    Aushev said that the return of Ingush refugees would depend  on how efficiently the Interim Administration headed by Vladimir  Lozovoy would perform.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / EIB agrees Pounds 98m funding for Jubilee Line extension THE EUROPEAN Investment Bank yesterday agreed to provide Pounds 98m of the private sector's Pounds 160m contribution towards the Pounds 1.8bn Jubilee Line underground extension. Bankers said this meant that the most important hurdle in providing the Pounds 160m contribution to the Jubilee's costs had been cleared. The government had been insisting on Pounds 400m from the private sector but this is spread over 30 years, so is worth little more than Pounds 160m at today's value. The EIB is owned by European Community member states. Last night Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said: 'Today's decision marks a significant milestone. The next will be for the private sector to conclude with London Transport a satisfactory funding agreement covering the basis of their contribution to the Jubilee Line extension.' The EIB said its decision completed the financing arrangements necessary for Canary Wharf and meant the government could begin construction of the Jubilee Line extension. London Underground, which will build the line, welcomed the EIB's decision to approve the payment, but remained cautious over an early start on construction of the Pounds 1.8bn extension to Docklands. It said other hurdles, including government approval, needed to be cleared before the go-ahead could be given. The banks also have to reach agreement with London Underground on the construction contract, including setting a deadline for completion of the project. If these obstacles are overcome, work on the line could start almost immediately, London Underground said. Last night the Labour MP Mr Rhodri Morgan said: 'It is the good old public sector that has come to the rescue of a crashed private sector project, and no amount of flannel can hide that. 'It is not possible to argue that the private sector is providing the commitment that Norman Lamont promised to the House of Commons that he would insist on when he gave the go-ahead to the project in the Autumn Statement.' Negotiations between bank lenders to Canary Wharf and the government on the private sector contribution for the Jubilee line extension have been going on for almost a year, following the collapse of Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian company which built Canary Wharf, the East London property development. The banks hope the building project will soon be able to come out of administration, a form of insolvency protection. Construction of the line is expected to employ 12,000 people through the lifetime of the project. If approval comes soon, the line could open in 1997. The EIB loan was agreed as part of its remit to speed the financing of large infrastructure projects to encourage European economic growth.</p>

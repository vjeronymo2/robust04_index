			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / PowerGen year-end profits rise 32%: Cost cuts and price rises boost electricity generator POWERGEN, the smaller of Britain's two privatised electricity generators, yesterday announced a 32 per cent increase in profits for last year, above market expectations. Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive, said the increase was due to cost cutting, price rises and a 50 per cent increase in direct sales to industrial users. Meanwhile, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, warned PowerGen not to force too hard a bargain out of British Coal in the current negotiations over long-term coal supply to the electricity generators. He said: 'Remember when you are negotiating these contracts that you are determining the future availability of a national resource for which you have longer-term need.' PowerGen's results were condemned by Mr Frank Dobson MP, Labour's shadow energy minister: 'The profits show that electricity privatisation has become a legalised racket with huge profits for the shareholders and massive pay and perks for the bosses.' Labour is expected to keep up its attack as National Power, the other generator, and the 12 regional companies report profit increases of up to 40 per cent, helped by one-off price factors. PowerGen increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 272m to Pounds 359m in the year to March 29. Turnover increased 14 per cent from Pounds 2.65bn to Pounds 3.01bn, helped by average price rises of 9 per cent. The company cut its workforce by more than 2,000 people to just over 6,000 during the year. Exceptional provisions of Pounds 94m were made to cover future redundancies and closure of power stations. However, there were exceptional profits of Pounds 88m from two power stations closed in March. Mr Wallis said there was less uncertainty about the March 1993 deadline for renegotiation of contracts with British Coal and the regional companies. The company's shares fell 4p to 249p on profit-taking after a strong run. Earnings per share increased 35 per cent from 23p to 31p. The company is recommending a final dividend of 6.2p to make a total of 9.25p. Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of electricity supply, agreed yesterday with the Commons energy committee that National Power, PowerGen and Nuclear Electric were too dominant in the electricity market.

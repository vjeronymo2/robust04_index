			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: United criticises BA proposal UNITED Airlines, the second biggest US carrier, yesterday called on the US government to block British Airways' proposed Dollars 750m investment in one of its rivals, USAir, unless concessions on operating in Europe were obtained. In a letter to United Airlines employees, Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman of United's parent company UAL, said the US Transportation Department would make 'the most monumental mistake' if it did not extract a 'fair, balanced exchange of opportunities' for US carriers in Britain. British Airways replied that United was trying to link a business deal with a bi-lateral arrangement between governments. 'The proposed deal is entirely within US law.' Meanwhile, Mr Seth Schofield, chairman of USAir, claimed that United's statement 'parroted' earlier protests from American and Delta, the other US mega-carriers, and was 'a great testament to the ability of the USAir/British Airways alliance to create a fourth effective domestic competitor'. Last week, American said the US government should not approve the investment deal unless the US secured 'equal opportunities for US carriers'. Delta called on the US Transportation Department to take action to stop the deal 'as a matter of law'. United's comments were the most outspoken yet. 'British Airways is attempting to secure indirectly that which it is barred by law from securing directly: effective control of a major US air carrier,' Mr Wolf said. US law limits foreign ownership of airlines to 25 per cent voting stake and 49 per cent overall. The UK was not 'making the slightest crack in its protectionist policies,' he said. 'Those policies prevent us, among other things from operating non-stop from our largest hub to London.' He said that the BA-USAir deal, while not giving majority control to BA meant that it could veto USAir's decisions.</p>

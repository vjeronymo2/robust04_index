			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: US steel groups hit by winter weather US Steel and Bethlehem Steel yesterday revealed disappointing results for the first three months of the year, underlining the impact of severe weather on the sector's performance in the winter. Both groups said they expected to improve in the second quarter as production levels returned to normal. US Steel, part of the USX energy group, suffered the biggest setback, posting a net loss of Dollars 35m, or 56 cents a share, including the effects of an accounting change, against a profit of Dollars 10m, or 13 cents, in the first quarter of 1993. Sales improved 14 per cent to Dollars 1.38bn on a 9 per cent increase in steel shipments and a modest upturn in prices. The results, although unimpressive, were mostly attributable to factors outside the company's control. Record low temperatures and heavy snowfalls in January disrupted raw material production and steel-making operations. The weather forced the government to cut power supplies, which further reduced output. Steel production was also affected by a 13-day shutdown of the Mon Valley Works near Pittsburgh. Production returned to normal earlier this month. Modernisation of a hot-strip mill in Gary, Indiana, also contributed to the loss. Bethlehem also suffered from the weather. Net income of Dollars 13m marked a return to profitability after last year's loss of Dollars 41m, but earnings of 2 cents a share were well below Wall Street forecasts of 13 cents a share. Revenues improved 11 per cent to Dollars 1.13bn, due to demand from the vehicle, machinery and construction markets. However, the company said severe cold and snow reduced operating results by Dollars 20m.</p>

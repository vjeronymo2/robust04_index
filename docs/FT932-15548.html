			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Backing on private cash for hospitals HOSPITALS should be free to use private-sector funding to finance new facilities, a prominent Tory backbench MP argues in a new paper, David Owen writes. Mr David Willetts, the MP for Havant and a member of the influential social security select committee, makes the suggestion in a wide-ranging examination of how private funding could be brought into the National Health Service. He urges the government to 'be clear' about what sort of ideas it is prepared to contemplate. 'The political sensitivity surrounding private provision is much reduced if it is manifestly supplying an extra new facility,' he says. Mr Willetts, a former director of studies at the Centre for Policy Studies, the rightwing think tank, says that the 'crucial' first step in giving private providers the opportunity to tender for new NHS developments would be for the Department of Health to liberalise its capital control pro-cedures. Past proposals for bringing private finance into the NHS have failed to come to fruition mainly because of a combination of Treasury rules, political caution and exaggerated expectations, Mr Willetts says. The paper was written at the request of the Social Market Foundation, an independent think tank.</p>

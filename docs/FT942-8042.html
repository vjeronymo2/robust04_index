			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / More unions may face blow to revenues A growing number of trade unions may face severe financial difficulties if they fail to win their members' approval for subscriptions to be deducted by employers from wages under the check-off system. By law unions have until August to persuade their estimated 6m members on check-off to agree to its renewal. Few unions report resistance from members they have contacted to continue with check-off, and many employers have co-operated with unions in the exercise which will have to be repeated every three years. However, financial experts fear that unions might lose Pounds 25m to Pounds 50m in total, amounting to 5 per cent to 10 per cent of their current pre-tax income, as a result of a membership shortfall through the changed check-off rules. 'Many unions are being too complacent about the success of their check-off campaigns,' said one union adviser. 'They think they will have done well if 95 per cent of their members re-sign for check-off but the loss of income that would result could still be serious for many of them.' Two unions already with financial difficulties face further problems as a result of the check-off change. These are the NUCPS civil service union and Ucatt, the construction union. The NUCPS says it has secured about 38 per cent of members on check-off but remains below its target, and even a 5 per cent shortfall would mean a Pounds 220,000 loss in revenue. Ucatt has 90 per cent of its membership on check-off but even at its most optimistic estimate the union believes it will lose 10 per cent of them. This could cost it about Pounds 500,000 in lost income. The RMT transport union had its check-off facilities withdrawn last summer by British Rail during a dispute. The withdrawal has been one factor blamed for a subsequent 20 per cent decline in the union's membership. As many as 80 per cent of its members were on check-off and there is resistance to switching payment of subscriptions through employees' bank accounts by direct debit. The RMT stands to lose as much as Pounds 1.6m a year as a result. Other unions say their check-off campaigns are going well. The GMB general union claims to have increased its membership by 4 per cent as a result, with large net gains in Scotland and northern England. Among other unions that believe they will increase their memberships are the UCW postal union and the NCU communications union. The IRSF tax officers' union and the CPSA civil service union have virtually completed their check-off campaigns which they believe will result in all members being signed up. Big general unions such as the TGWU and technical union MSF still have some progress to make to achieve this aim. Only a small number remain to be signed up in the AEEU engineering union.</p>

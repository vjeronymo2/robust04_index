			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW YORK MAYOR CALLS FOR 'WAVE OF UNITY' AGAINST BIGOTRY  </P> <P> Mayor David N. Dinkins proclaimed a "day of solidarity against bigotry" Tuesday  and called for a color-blind campaign for "respect and unity" to dispel racial  tensions in the city.  </P> <P> An overflow crowd of more than 5,000 people packed the Episcopal Cathedral of  St. John the Divine to hear the mayor ask New Yorkers to rededicate themselves  to "the values of justice, opportunity and caring."  </P> <P> "This is the time to come together to create a wave of energy and unity so  powerful that it can wash away the hate and the hurt," the mayor said. "I'm  sick of the pain. I've seen too much. I need you to be my companions in this  campaign for respect and unity."  </P> <P> Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and representatives of black, Irish, Latino, Italian,  Jewish, Korean and homosexual groups also spoke.  </P> <P> The most recent irritant to race relations was a pair of verdicts in the  Bensonhurst case. One white teen-ager was convicted of killing a black youth  during a gang attack in a predominantly white section of Brooklyn in August. A  co-defendant was acquitted of murder but convicted of lesser charges.  </P></p>

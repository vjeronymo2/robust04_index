			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Budget likely to help jobless and small businesses THE TREASURY was last night making final preparations for tomorrow's 1993-94 Budget which is expected to increase Britain's tax burden moderately but may also strengthen Mr Norman Lamont's reputation as a fiscal innovator. The chancellor's third Budget - and the last of the traditional spring revenue-raising budgets - will contain a package of measures to help the long-term unemployed and reduce the number of officially registered jobless from more than 3m at present. It is also expected to provide encouragement for small businesses, which Mr John Major, the prime minister, believes can do most for job creation once the UK pulls out of recession. As Budget day has approached, speculation has increased that Mr Lamont will partially offset tax increases by extending significantly the bottom 20 per cent tax band, which he introduced last year for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income. Such a move would be a step towards turning the 20 per cent band into the tax rate for the average citizen. It could be financed by freezing tax thresholds for the higher paid and possibly by converting the personal tax allowance - the amount that people can earn before they pay income tax - into a tax credit that might apply at either the 25 per cent basic rate or the 20 per cent rate of income tax. At present, allowances are deducted from gross income to give disproportionate benefit to payers of the higher 40 per cent tax rate. The news blackout surrounding the chancellor's Budget plans has been tighter than ever this year. But commentators believe Mr Lamont will announce a radical and innovative package in an attempt to boost the government's flagging political fortunes and his own chances of staying in office. Apparently ruled out is a Budget Day cut in bank base rates from their current 6 per cent level. In recent weeks, Mr Lamont and the Bank of England have tried to discourage expectations of an early rate cut. The authorities not only believe that 6 per cent is the right level to encourage economic recovery but are concerned that lower rates could undermine sterling and so rekindle inflationary pressures. Mr Lamont's main objectives will be to encourage economic recovery and convince financial markets that he will take no risks with inflation by allowing the UK's large government deficit to spiral out of control. Polls of City institutions, taken by the financial information companies MMS International and IDEA, suggest that London's financial markets expect Mr Lamont will raise taxes by Pounds 2bn to Pounds 2.25bn in tomorrow's Budget and by Pounds 4bn in the first unified taxing and spending Budget in November. The markets are hoping for relatively good news on the deficit. The consensus forecasts published by MMS and IDEA suggest the City expects Mr Lamont to announce a public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 35bn for 1992-93, down from the Pounds 37bn forecast in the government's Autumn Statement. On the strength of the Budget measures, he is expected to predict a deficit of about Pounds 45bn for 1993-94, below recent expectations of Pounds 50bn. The chancellor will take a relatively upbeat view of Britain's prospects: according to an interview with the Independent on Sunday yesterday, he believes Britain is heading for a 'period of normal and sustained growth'.

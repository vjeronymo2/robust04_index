			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News analysis" by Teng Wenqi: "Great Change in S. African </F> Election Process"]    [Text] Johannesburg, April 22 (XINHUA) -- With the  announcement of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) participation in  next week's non-racial election in South Africa, it is expected  the poll will proceed in an atmosphere of goodwill and  reconciliation.    The April 26-28 election is historically important to South  Africa as it is the result of the 300-year struggle of the South  African people, the blacks in particular.    Since the Dutch invaded the South African continent in 1652,  the black people have gradually become the slaves of the white  settlers.    Before the implementation of the 1993 interim constitution,  South Africa was the only country in the world which had  legalized the apartheid system.    The current election in South Africa symbolizes the end of  the inhuman apartheid system in the human history.    On April 19, or one week before the election, the Inkatha  Freedom Party -- the second biggest black party in South Africa  -- announced its participation in the election.    The South African press described the IFP's participation in  the election as "a miracle."    In reality, this is a natural result for the IFP after an  international mediation failed in the previous week.    If the IFP does not want to be a guerilla movement in a new  South Africa after the election, it has no other choice but to  participate in the election.    The IFP stands for a federal or confederate state in a  future  South Africa. It asked the international mediation over the  constitutional dispute between the IFP and its rival, the  African National Congress (ANC), so that the 1993 interim  constitution is amended and the election postponed.    The IFP can only become an opposition party if it does not  participate in the election after the failure of the  itnernational mediation.    IFP's decision to participate in the election has greatly  changed the political situation in South Africa.    The three major political players in South Africa, namely  the  ruling National Party, the ANC and the IFP, will all participate  in the election. They are expected to obtain 85 percent votes  of all the voters in the country.    On April 19, South African President F.W. de Klerk, ANC  president Nelson Mandela and IFP president Mangosuthu Buthelezi  signed an agreement and a joint statement in Pretoria.    The agreement said the three parties reject violence and are  committed to realize reconciliation and peace in South Africa.    The joint statement appealed to the South African people to  end violence, exercise maximum restraint and pursue their  objectives by peaceful means.    The agreement and the joint statement will create  circumstances conducive to the holding of a free, fair and  peaceful election in South Africa.    Buthelezi said his party will accept the election result so  long as the international community regards it free and fair.    After the IFP decision was declared, many Zulu people  expressed their ardent wish to participate in the election.    Buthelezi was given a hero's welcome and support when he  returned to Ulundi, capital of the Kwazulu homeland, on April 19  after the signing of the agreement and the joint statement.    Definitely, violence will greatly be reduced as the root  cause of the political conflicts between the IFP and the ANC  have been removed.    An amendment on the 1993 interim constitution was tabled in  the parliament on April 21.    The bill will be debated and approved at a special session  of  the parliament on April 25.    The bill makes provisions for the institution, role,  authority and status of the Zulu monarch, King Goodwill  Zwelithini.    This is the result of a reconciliation among the ruling  national party, the ANC and the IFP.    Where will the seven million Zulu people go? it is important  to the result of the April 26-28 election.</p>

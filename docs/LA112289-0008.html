			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXCLUSION IN PRIVATE CLUBS  </P> <P> Stein's article has many valid observations, but if "Jews have long since  stopped caring about restricted clubs as a high priority," they should not do  so. Nor should they react as Stein reacts when he states, "As for me, the  racially exclusive club no longer makes me angry or hurt." There is a  "trickle-down" aspect to anti-Semitism. It may not be sound economics, but it  is sound prejudice.  </P> <P> When prestigious clubs restrict Jews, this trickles down to all levels of  society. I do not look upon this practice as an illness or comparable to drug  addiction. It is a practice which perpetuates anti-Semitism, and has no place  in a fair and just society.  </P> <P> SAUL S.

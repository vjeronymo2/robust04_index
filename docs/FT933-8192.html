			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: Philips in electronic media move PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, is to regroup its international efforts in the field of consumer electronics 'software' as part of an attempt to seize worldwide opportunities in the field of multi-media education and entertainment. It described the internal reorganisation as a first step to making Philips a truly global competitor in electronic media. The core of the Dutch company's revamped efforts in electronic media will be its New York-based Philips Media unit. The unit's creation earlier this year had already underlined the company's heightened interest in producing and distributing 'software' to complement consumer electronic 'hardware' such as televisions, video cassette recorders (VCRs) and new products like compact disc-interactive. Philips, Europe's largest manufacturer of consumer electronics, is trying to emphasise high-margin software, such as video cassette rentals, as a way of countering the narrow margins and fierce price wars in the sale of VCRs and compact disc players. In its new guise, Philips Media will bring together the group's existing international and national programmes in interactive media into one organisation. The new organisation, Philips Media Electronic Publishing, will aim to grow in target markets such as children's electronic publishing and the production of electronic games and home entertainment packages. 'I believe the company's new structure will enable us to be both responsive and proactive in this rapidly changing world of electronic media,' Mr Scott Marden, chief executive officer of Philips Media, said. Mr Marden added that one of the unit's prime tasks is to enable Philips to pursue opportunities with other big media companies. Philips Media's interests include a minority stake in Whittle Communications of the US, which is active in television programmes broadcast to US schools, and Blockbuster, the US video rental chain. The strengthening of Philips Media in New York is also part of a trend towards locating Philips management closer to major markets and away from the group's base in the Dutch town of Eindhoven. Earlier this summer, Philips said it was moving the headquarters of its audio business from Eindhoven to Singapore</p>

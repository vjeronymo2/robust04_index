			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Hungarian coalition poll boost Hungary's Socialist-Liberal coalition government won all but one of the country's 19 counties as well as several large towns in Sunday's nationwide local elections, but fell short of the resounding 72 per cent victory it achieved in last May's general elections, according to partial results released last night. With 94 per cent of votes counted, the ruling Socialist party and its junior coalition partner, the Free Democrats, looked set to win a two-thirds majority in two counties and in Budapest and to win a simple majority in all other counties except for one. In Budapest, where 20 per cent of Hungary's 10.5m population lives, Mr Gabor Demszky, a Free Democrat, was easily re-elected for a second four-year term as mayor. The Socialists won 32 per cent of the capital's general assembly, with the Free Democrats and centre-right parties, which, for the first time, fielded joint candidates, in joint second place, both with 29 per cent. Independent candidates were the big winners in mayoral contests in the rest of the country, taking more than 80 per cent of the 3,150 posts nationwide.</p>

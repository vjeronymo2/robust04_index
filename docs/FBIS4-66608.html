			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, February 18--The government has nominated  a member on the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) to  deal exclusively with policy matters relating to export  promotion in Customs and Central excise areas, and also to  interact and co-ordinate with the ministry of commerce in such  matters.    Mr K. Vishwanathan will assume charge as member (export  promotion) with immediate effect.    This was one of the decisions arrived at a meeting held by  the cabinet secretary, Mr Zafar Saifullah, on Thursday with  secretaries and head of departments of about a dozen ministries  and official agencies dealing with export-related problems.    It was decided that there would be no ceiling on export  credit where such applications were genuine. All export credit  applications would be considered without reference to the 10  percent ceiling in the case of quality borrowers engaged in  export and all cases of export credit rejection will be required  to be put up to the chairman of the concerned bank.    The meeting decided that a 24-hour customs clearance  facility  would be introduced at Delhi, Bombay, Madras and Calcutta  airports and at Bombay and Madras ports, to begin with, by March  31.    The cabinet secretary reiterated the overriding importance  of  exports as a national priority and a collective effort "in which  each one of us is a player" involving the entire government  including all connected ministries and agencies. While  expressing his appreciation of the fact that awareness of the  need for export promotion was gathering momentum, he was  categorical that greater efforts were needed at the operating  levels to translate strategies into action and to ensure prompt  removal of bottlenecks through effective grievance redressal  mechanisms. He wanted banks and financial institutions and all  other connected departments to gear up their style of  functioning to ensure that export activities were not hindered  in any manner.    The meeting reviewed in detail the action points concerning  different ministries on export-related problems arising out of  the last such meeting taken by the cabinet secretary in  November, 1993. Ministries covered in the meeting included  agriculture, commerce, telecommunications, civil aviation,  labour, surface transport, textiles and posts.    It was confirmed that a foreign post-office had started  functioning at Varanasi and foreign post-offices would be opened  shortly at Surat and Kanpur to cater to the growing need of  exporters in those areas.    The meeting noted that the electronic data interchange (EDI)  for international trade had already been launched from Bombay  well ahead of the scheduled deadline of March, 1994 and  workshops were being held at all major port cities to enthuse  and educate exporters to link up with the fast emerging EDI  network.    It was indicated that the cabinet secretary would hold two  follow-up meetings to discuss fiscal and banking issues relating  to exports after the budget session of Parliament.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: German-Italian consortium buys Ilva special steels unit A German-Italian consortium led by Krupp Hoesch, Germany's second biggest steelmaker, yesterday paid almost L600bn (Dollars 374.3m) for Acciai Speciali Terni (Ast), the special steels section of the state-run Ilva group. The German-Italian consortium, 50 per cent of which is owned by the three Italian steelmakers Riva, Agarini and Falck, made a better offer than an earlier bid from a Franco-Italian group which had only weeks ago threatened to contest the bid with a court case. It remained unclear last night whether the rival group - led by Usinor-Sacilor, the French steelmaker, and including Lucchini, Foroni, Spc and Euroacciai - would press ahead with a complaint to the European Commission. A spokesman for Krupp Hoesch would not reveal details about the German-Italian consortium, but said that the German company's worldwide distribution network and strong position in the special steel markets left it in an 'optimal position to take over Ast'. Special steels have fared much better than other steel products during recent turbulence on world steel markets. New uses in catalytic converters and construction meant the sector was developing better than other areas of the steel business, according to Mr Jurgen Claasen, a spokesman for Krupp Hoesch. With Ast in its portfolio, Krupp Hoesch's share of the European stainless steel market will rise from 27 to 43 per cent. Had the French consortium won, Usinor's share would have increased from 18 to 33 per cent. As part of its continuing restructuring, Krupp Hoesch last week broke its steel division into four separate units in order to be able to adapt more quickly to different markets. The Krupp Hoesch-led consortium entered a bid for Ast only in mid-May, just at the time when Riva, the private Italian group, gave up its interest in Eko Stahl, the ailing east German steel plant. There has been speculation that Krupp Hoesch persuaded Riva the Ast venture would be more interesting. The Ast sale is part of a broader restructuring of Italy's state steel interests grouped around Ilva, a process being carried out by Iri, the state holding company. The special steels operations based round Terni are the first to be sold and have been separated from the flat products produced at the loss-making complex in Taranto. The 50 per cent stake in Ast will become part of a joint venture between Krupp Hoesch and Thyssen, Germany's largest steelmaker, which is due to come into being on October 1. Krupp Hoesch will hold a 60 per cent stake while Thyssen will hold the remainder.</p>

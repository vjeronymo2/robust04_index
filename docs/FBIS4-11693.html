			<p>BFN     [Text] An IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldier sustained  moderate head injuries in a stoning incident in the vicinity of  the village of al-Jib north of Jerusalem. He was transferred to  the Hadassah-'En Kerem Hospital. Our correspondent Moti Amir  reports that the soldier was driving near the village, which is  under curfew, when his car came under a barrage of stones.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0800 GMT on 31 March  adds the following: "Terrorists fired at an IDF outpost in the  Jabalyah refugee camp this morning. None of the soldiers were  hurt. The troops returned fire, gravely injuring one of the  terrorists. The other gunman escaped, and Army troops mounted a  manhunt for him. Our correspondent reports that one of the  terrorists used an M-16 rifle and the other a Kalashnikov  against the soldiers. Riots erupted in the refugee camp in the  wake of the incident."]    Our correspondent notes that numerous Judaea and Samaria  cities and villages remain under curfew today, including Nabulus  and its environs; Tulkarm and the adjacent refugee camps;  downtown Ramallah and the refugee camps near Ramallah; the  al-Duhayshah refugee camp; and downtown Hebron.    Owners of gas stations in the territories complained today  that the IDF has been prohibiting the supply of cooking gas and  fuel to the Judaea and Samaria stations. A check conducted by  our correspondent revealed that for security reasons, the IDF  has been barring the entry of fuel and cooking gas trucks into  the area for over two weeks, and the local population's fuel and  cooking gas supplies are running out.</p>

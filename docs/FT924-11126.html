			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: Royal Trust retreats from US ROYAL TRUST, the Canadian financial services group controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, has retreated with a bloodied nose from the US by selling its Seattle-based network of former savings and loan institutions. Washington Mutual Savings Bank of Seattle will pay Royal Trust USDollars 663m for Pacific First Financial, which operates 134 branches in three western US states and has assets totalling Dollars 6.5bn. However, the Canadian company will take over Dollars 600m to Dollars 700m of Pacific First's real estate loan portfolio as well as investments in markets where Washington Mutual has no presence. About one-third of the loans are non-performing and are expected to be liquidated over the next four years. Royal Trust has agreed to buy up to Dollars 150m of preferred shares in Washington Mutual as part of the capital which the US group plans to raise to finance the purchase of Pacific First. Royal said it would take writedowns totalling CDollars 75m (Dollars 60.4m) as a result of the sale. This includes CDollars 55m for goodwill and CDollars 20m in loan loss provisions. Royal's total investment in Pacific First was USDollars 691m. Royal Trust bought a string of savings and loan companies in 1989 and 1990 and later stitched them together into Pacific First as part of an ambitious international expansion. While Royal Trust has a strong presence in Canada, its experience outside the country has largely been an unhappy one. Besides selling Pacific First, it has spun off or closed most of the businesses it acquired in its 1986 purchase of Dow Chemical's financial services business. Mr Michael Cornelissen, Royal Trust's chief executive who spearheaded the thrust into foreign markets, recently announced that he was leaving his job. Mr Kerry Killinger, Washington Mutual chairman and chief executive, said the bank expected the deal to lift earnings and lower its non-performing assets ratio, Reuter adds from Seattle. 'We've indicated in our schedules that the asset quality that we're bringing across should be excellent,' Mr Killinger said. The size of Pacific First's possible problem loans had been considered a potential obstacle to sale of the bank.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Argentine capital in cash crisis THE mayor of Buenos Aires, a key political appointee, was forced from office on Monday evening by a deepening financial crisis that has left Argentina's capital virtually bankrupt, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires. Mr Carlos Grosso, appointed by President Carlos Menem in 1989, had to leave after failing to impose order on the city's chaotic administration. His fate is a warning to other local government leaders seeking to restore financial order. Although no precise figures are available, Buenos Aires appears to have a 1992 budget deficit of between Dollars 270m and Dollars 690m (Pounds 423.3m)  -equivalent to 11-29 per cent of the total budget. Mr Saul Bouer, the new mayor, is one of Mr Menem's hard men. Formerly federal treasury secretary and public works secretary, his specialty is ruthless pruning of jobs. He has already promised to increase property taxes in wealthy neighbourhoods and sack one in eight employees; conservative estimates say the city has 120,000 workers. Mr Grosso can point to some notable achievements. The city is cleaner than before and he has privatised collection of taxes and traffic fines. But he sealed his fate by announcing he would 'temporarily' stop paying contractors and renegotiate unpaid bills. The contractors, especially Waste Management of the US which collects the city's rubbish, threatened to suspend services.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (a) In the case of a foreign broker/dealer or bank which is participating in the distribution as an underwriter, the agreement among underwriters contains a provision which obligates the said foreign broker/dealer or bank not to sell any of the securities which it receives as a participant in the distribution to persons enumerated in paragraphs (1) through (5) above, or in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of paragraph (6) hereof; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) In the case of sales to a foreign broker/dealer or bank which is not participating in the distribution as an underwriter, the selling member: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> (i) Makes an affirmative inquiry of such foreign broker/dealer or bank as to whether the ultimate purchasers would be persons enumerated in paragraphs (1) through (5) hereof and receives satisfactory assurance that the ultimate purchasers of the securities so purchased would not be such persons, and that the securities would not be sold in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of paragraph (6) hereof; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A recording is made on the order ticket, or its equivalent, or upon some other supporting document, of the name of the person to whom the inquiry was made at the foreign broker/dealer or bank as well as the substance of what was said by that person and what was done as a result thereof; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The order ticket, or its equivalent, is initialed by a registered principal of the member. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The obligations imposed upon members in their dealings with foreign broker/dealers or banks by this paragraph 8(b) can be fulfilled by having the foreign broker/dealer or bank to which sales falling within the scope of this Interpretation are made execute Form RF&hyph;1, or a reasonable facsimile thereof. This form, which gives a blanket assurance from the foreign broker/dealer or bank that no sales will be made in contravention of the provisions of this Interpretation, can be obtained at any District Office of the Association or at the Executive Office. The acceptance of an executed Form FR&hyph;1, or other written assurance, by a member must in all instances be made in good faith. Thus, if a member knows or should have known of facts which are inconsistent with the representations received, such will not operate to satisfy the obligations imposed upon him by this paragraph. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Scope and Intent of Interpretation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In addition to the obvious scope and intent of the above provisions, the intent of the Board of Governors in the following specific situations is outlined for the guidance of members. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Limited Business Broker/Dealer <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The restrictions placed on associated persons pursuant to Paragraph 2 of the Interpretation shall not apply to persons associated with NASD members engaged solely in the purchase or sale of either investment company/variable contracts securities or direct participation program securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Issuer Directed Securities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> This Interpretation shall apply to securities which are part of a public offering notwithstanding that some or all of those securities are specifically directed by the issuer to accounts which are included within the scope of paragraphs (3) through (8) above. Therefore, if a person within the scope of those paragraphs to whom securities were directed did not have the required <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  [an] investment history [with the member or registered representative from whom they were to be purchased], the member would not be permitted to sell him such securities. Also, the ``disproportionate'' and ``insubstantial'' tests would apply as in all other situations. Thus, the directing of a substantial number of securities to any one person would be prohibited as would the directing of securities to such accounts in amounts which would be disproportionate as compared to sales to members of the public.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> If such issuer-directed securities are sold to the issuer's employees or directors or potential employees or directors resulting from an intended merger, acquisition, or other business combination, such securities may be sold without limitation as to amount and regardless of whether such employees have an investment history as required by the Interpretation; provided, however, that in the case of an offering of securities for which a bona fide independent market does not exist, such securities shall not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, or hypothecated for a period of three months following the effective date of the offering. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This Interpretation shall also apply to securities which are part of a public offering notwithstanding that some of those securities are specifically directed by the issuer on a non-underwritten basis. In such cases, the managing underwriter of the offering shall be responsible for insuring compliance with this Interpretation in respect to those securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notwithstanding the above, sales of issuer directed securities may be made to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> non-employee/director <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  restricted persons without the required investment history after receiving permission from the Board of Governors. Permission will be given only if there is a demonstration of valid business reasons for such sales (such as sales to distributors and suppliers [or key employees], who are in each case incidentally restricted persons), and the member seeking permission is prepared to demonstrate that the aggregate amount of securities so sold is insubstantial and not disproportionate as compared to sales to members of the public, and that the amount sold to any one of such persons is insubstantial in amount <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ; provided, however, that such securities shall not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, or hypothecated for a period of three months following the effective date of the offering. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Stand-By Purchasers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Securities purchased pursuant to a stand-by arrangement shall not be subject to the provisions of the Interpretation if the following conditions are met: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 --> 1. The stand-by agreement is disclosed in the prospectus. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The stand-by arrangement is the subject of a formal written agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The managing underwriter represents in writing that it was unable to find any other purchasers for the securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.

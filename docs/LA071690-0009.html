			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON THE SOVIET UNION;  </P> <P> LET REFORMS TAKE HOLD BEFORE AID FLOWS;  </P> <P> A STUDY OF THE SOVIET ECONOMY WILL HELP, BUT CAUTIOUS GUIDELINES FOR WESTERN  AID CAN ALREADY BE DRAWN.  </P> <P> Western governments are justified in considering whether they can encourage  far-reaching economic liberalization in the Soviet Union. The dominant impetus  for reform will have to come from within the Soviet Union itself but, at least  at the margins, the West may have a useful role to play.  </P> <P> What that role should be is a point of contention, however. Last week's  economic summit in Houston revealed fundamental disagreements among the  industrial democracies about how to aid the Soviet Union. West Germany is eager  to move ahead promptly with large-scale monetary assistance, in no small part  to obtain Soviet acceptance of a reunited Germany within the Atlantic Alliance.  Bonn has already proposed $15 billion in aid, with more than $3 billion to come  almost immediately.  </P> <P> The other two leading economic powers -- the United States and Japan -- have  been far more cautious. The Bush Administration is reluctant to provide any  financial assistance until the Soviets adopt genuine market reforms and cut  their military budget. President Bush has suggested that instead of sending  money, Western countries should simply provide technical specialists to offer  advice on how to set up a private banking system, a stock market and other  institutions. The Japanese also are wary of supplying aid before reforms are  implemented, an are reluctant to establish closer economic ties at all unless  the Soviet Union agrees to give back the four northern Japanese islands that it  annexed in 1945.  </P> <P> Having failed to reach a consensus on the matter, the assembled leaders agreed  merely to sponsor a study of Soviet economic needs, while allowing individual  Western countries, especially West Germany and France, to offer financial aid  to Moscow on a bilateral basis. The proposed study is to be carried out by the  International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development, in conjunction with the European Community, and is  to be released at the end of the year. A separate group under the European  Community's auspices has already embarked on a study of the Soviet economy,  which is scheduled to be completed by October. While both studies may provide  some useful details, it is already possible to set forth some tentative  guidelines for a collective Western economic strategy vis-a-vis the Soviet  Union:  </P> <P>  -- The cautious approach espoused by the American and Japanese governments  makes sense. The experience with Poland in the 1970s, when large infusions of  Western aid induced the Polish government to avoid much-needed reforms, is  worth bearing in mind. The unreformed Polish economy could not properly absorb  imports of Western technology and the country was soon mired in economic  decline as well as burdened with a huge foreign debt. That pattern could repeat  itself in the Soviet Union if Western aid is not carefully timed and targeted.  Already, imported Western machinery often sits rusting in crates after arriving  in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P>  -- Despite the need for caution, the Bush Administration is wise to let the  West German and French governments press ahead with large-scale financial  credits. Both governments have strong political motivations to provide the aid  and any heavy-handed American attempt to discourage them from doing so would be  futile and counterproductive. What the United States might do, however, is to  consult closely with the West Germans and the French to ensure that the  assistance is targeted either to the fledgling private sector or to the  decrepit Soviet transportation network.  </P> <P>  -- For some time to come, the bulk of Western aid to countries outside the  developing world should still be directed to East European states such as  Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Progress toward democratic systems and  free-market economies is far greater in these countries than it is in the  Soviet Union.  </P> <P>  -- Political issues such as Japan's desire to regain the northern islands and  the American demand for a reduction in Soviet military aid to Cuba are  legitimate considerations. But these issues are best dealt with primarily  behind the scenes, where a change of Soviet policy will not be as easily  construed as a humiliating backdown.  </P> <P>  -- In the near term, the Bush Administration's proposal to send technical  advisers is a sound one, particularly if it includes specialists who can devise  a pool of basic data about the Soviet economy. The lack of reliable statistics  has been a great impediment to economic reform. In addition, it would be useful  to provide Western technicians who can assist Soviet military factories in  their conversion to civilian production.  </P> <P> If genuine market-oriented reforms do take hold, then collective Western  assistance might then be appropriate. Such assistance, however, should be  directed almost exclusively to the private sector, including cooperatives and  joint ventures.  </P> <P> The IMF and the European Community are the appropriate channels for collective  Western aid. Although the record of the IMF is mixed, it is the only  international agency well-suited to deal with countries that are moving toward  free-market systems. Moreover, the IMF has considerable experience in Eastern  Europe. It will take time, of course, before Moscow is willing to divulge the  kinds of information that the IMF would demand. But if Soviet leaders are  sincere about wanting to adopt market-oriented reforms, they will almost surely  agree to disclose more data than they ever would have in the past. Channeling  some aid through the European Community would be a useful complement to the  IMF, to avoid the appearance of relying too heavily on any single organization.  </P> <P> A coordinated Western strategy will not greatly ease the process of Soviet  economic reform. The outcome of that process will ultimately depend on what the  Soviet Union itself can accomplish. But at least Western governments will be  able to do what they can to promote greater democracy and a free-market Soviet  economy, not to mention a continued easing of East-West relations.  </P></p>

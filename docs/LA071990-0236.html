			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE WALL RETURNS TO BERLIN, BUT THIS ONE IS PINK FLOYD'S VERSION  </P> <P> The Wall is back in Berlin -- not the concrete barrier that divided the city  for 28 years but the rock extravaganza by Pink Floyd.  </P> <P> Hundreds of musicians, actors and even Soviet and British soldiers will perform  "The Wall" on Saturday at a bizarre venue -- the former death strip where  border guards once had orders to open fire on East Germans trying to flee to  the West.  </P> <P> The acclaimed rock opera by Pink Floyd's former leader, Roger Waters, will be  performed on a grand scale.  </P> <P> "Nobody's ever thought about doing a concert between two countries in a  prohibited military zone, as this area still was when we started planning,"  producer Mick Worwood said. "We've created a city here."  </P> <P> More than 150,000 people will attend the $8-million concert featuring a  symphony orchestra, Soviet and British military helicopters, a Soviet army  marching band, Hells Angels motorcycle riders, Waters' new group The Bleeding  Hearts and a clutch of guest musicians including folk-rock singers Joni  Mitchell and Van Morrison.  </P> <P> The 200-foot-high stage near the Brandenburg Gate has dominated Berlin's  skyline for weeks.  </P> <P> Few traces remain at the site of the Berlin Wall, opened last November and  since mostly demolished. But the set includes a wall of its own, made from  2,000 white polystyrene blocks, as a backdrop to the tale of rebellion against  authority and alienation told by the music.  </P> <P> Saturday's concert is the most elaborate of several events planned this summer  to celebrate the end of the Cold War division of Berlin.  </P></p>

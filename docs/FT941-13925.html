			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions The market soars to unexploded heights and we wait to see what directors will do. Some do nothing much, some sell a little to take profits, others continue to deal for personal financial planning reasons. Nobo Group produces office equipment. In the second week of January, the company announced interim results strongly ahead of the same period last year. The share price has moved up on the back of it so the sale of 200,000 shares each by Peter Kent, the non-executive chairman, and Reginald Barr, the chief executive, is not surprising. Each director retains considerable quantities of stock. Sales should aid market liquidity. Thomas French &amp; Sons, the home decoration company, appears in both the sale and buy columns. Final results were announced at the beginning of January and M Snapes was appointed as a new chief executive. He then bought 100,000 shares. The chairman and erstwhile managing director, Thomas French, sold 100,000 shares to Snapes and sold the other 250,000 shares for a beneficial trust. A Beckman Plc is involved in both textile converting and merchanting and property investment. Melvin Lawson, an executive director bought 120,000 shares for 55p, increasing his holding to over 900,000.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                  No of Company                   Sector       Shares      Value     directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Airsprung Furnitur        HGod        149,242        440            4* Anglian Water             Watr         65,645        365            1* Berkeley Group            BCon         77,880        409            1* Blacks Leisure            RetG         35,500         13            3 Cater Allen               OthF         35,706        221            3* Clinton Cards             RegG        174,000        287 East Midlands Elec        Elec         70,750        444            1* Fleming Intl Hi Inc       InvT         57,453         56 Gleeson Group             BCon         28,500        260            1* Gold Greenlees            Mdia         36,685         83            4* Halma                     Eng           6,200         14            1 Hunters Armley            PP&amp;P        725,000      1,283            3 Jeyes                     HGod         33,243        120            1* Kenwood Appliances        Tran         80,000        293            1 Marshalls                 BM&amp;M         30,000         39            1* Nobo Group                OS&amp;B        400,000        988            2 Osborne &amp; Little          HGod         22,000         55            3 P &amp; O (inc def)           Tran         16,000        103            1 RMC Group                 BM&amp;M          1,500         15            1 Sainsbury J               RetF          9,500         44            2 Sherwood Computer         SSer        100,000        154            1* Tay Homes                 BCon        500,000      1,070            1 Thomas French &amp; Sons      Text        350,000        350            1 Tinsley Robor             PP&amp;P        120,000         24            1 Treatt                    FdMa         48,060         96            4* Walker Greenbank          HGod         50,000         52            1* Wetherspoon               Brew          4,000         15            1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Beckman A                 Text        120,000         66            1 Birse Group               BCon     20,734,580      4,147            6 Capital Inds (pref)       PP&amp;P         62,000         47            1 FKI                       Eng          10,000         18            2 Gt WesternResources       OilE        150,000         54            2 Guinness                  SW&amp;C         10,372         50            1 Hamlet Group              Text         25,000         39            1 Kalamazoo                 SSer         20,000         20            1 N Atlantic Small Co       InvT         17,062         38            1 Old Ct Currency Fnd       n/a          11,317        114            1 Osprey Communicatn        Mdia        106,833         44            1 QS Holdings               retG         10,000         24            1 Taylor Nelson AGB         Mdia         75,120         20            1 Thomas French &amp; Son       Text        100,000        100            1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

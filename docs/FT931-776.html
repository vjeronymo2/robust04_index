			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Arts: Grade E for Mr C . . . - Clement Crisp despairs of a 'Bejart-vu phenomenon' AFTER AN absence of more than a decade, Maurice Bejart has brought his forces back to London's Sadler's Wells. Not the former cohorts of bare-chested men and stabbing-point women. Not, the apologists would have us believe, the old spectaculars that could fill the Boboli Gardens and the Grand Palais with physical hyperbole and enough gassy philosophising to launch a hot-air balloon. This is the new, slimmed-down Rudra Bejart company from Lausanne, leaner in forces and concentrated in effects, and more personal. After seeing Mr C . . ., which opened a Sadler's Wells season on Thursday night, I can but report that the difference is imperceptible. This is what it always was, a Bejart-vu phenomenon, more flatulent and more heart-sinkingly awful than any I have seen from this choreographer in the past 30 years. Mr C . . . is allegedly 'about' Charlie Chaplin. I start with the disadvantage of finding Chaplin marginally less entertaining than war, pestilence and famine, and I am damned if I will subscribe to Bejart's comment that 'He is love, and no-one can resist loving him', nor his belief that he was a 'sacred cow who invented cinema' and 'the greatest dancer ever'. These quotes may give some indication of Bejart's concerns during this 90-minute exercise in mega-tedium. They do not, though, prepare us for the appearances of Chaplin's daughter, Annie, who acts as mistress of these desperate ceremonies and is Very Vivacious Indeed; nor of Chaplin's grandson, Charlie Bubbles, who has the air of a man lost in a maze - for which no-one can blame him in these surroundings. The sequence of events during this hour and a half - was that all? I know that empires fell, and dinosaurs came and went on the Earth - defeats rational comment. The curtain rises to reveal the heaving posteriors of Bejart's chaps - a motley crew, and still bare-chested - and thereafter various sideways-on glances are cast at Hollywood and Chaplin's films. (They are obligingly catalogued by Miss Chaplin and Mr Bubbles, laundry-list fashion). We see Sennet bathing beauties; an audition by various grotesques; a baying performance by Martyn Fleming as the bearded bully of those early Chaplin silents. Gems from Romeo and Juliet are spoken into telephones by Miss Chaplin and Mr Bubbles (whose calls were not to the RSC, I am certain). There is also a cat, performed with unseemly roguishness by Juishi Kobayashi, and a fat girl in a pink dress playing a trombone. No further warnings should be necessary. Chaplin is impersonated with some discretion by Gil Roman, and I wondered what that fine dancer Koen Onzia was doing in this galere. It remains for me to note that much of the accompanying score is confected from Chaplin's own saccharine little tunes, and that design is minimal and dull. Of dramatic purpose, structure, dance merit, or even good old-fashioned entertainment, I could discern no trace. I do not think even Charlie Chaplin deserves this sort of treatment, though the subtle moment when Chaplin boxes with his daughter, and is knocked out by her, seems to me to be not without significance. After Mr C .., the Iron Maid of Nuremberg would be welcome. The programming plays a clever card by presenting Sylvie Guillem in Bejart's newest creation for her. He has shown her in other successful pieces - Mouvement, Rhythme, Etude at the Paris Opera was a first dazzling study of her gifts - and Sissi is no less apt. It is concerned with the Empress Elizabeth - or rather, with a madwoman who thinks she is the Empress. At curtain-rise Mlle Guillem is found en beaute in a white crinoline by Gianni Versace, looking like a Winterhalter. Two attendants are there to dress her, and Olivier Chanut serves as both courtier and doctor in an asylum. But this is essentially a bravura solo, whose action shifts between the Empress's longings and her final assassination, and the woman's fantasies and her agonised mental state. It is intriguingly constructed, so we believe in both personae. Regal manners and hallucinatory suffering alternate. Mlle Guillem speaks Kennst du das land with a simplicity and poetic grace that mark her portrayal of Elizabeth; then (in a vestigial shift) probes the woman's anguish with flashing technique. The piece is a vehicle, and richly decked with emotional and physical cliches. Without Mlle Guillem, it would be insufferable. With her, it is fascinating. Her performance has a relaxed assurance, a command of feeling, that shows a new maturity in her abilities. She is everywhere touching, dance and expression fine-tuned. The accompaniment is a mish-mash of scores; the design simple. Nothing detracts from the authority of Mlle Guillem's grand impersonation. Rudra Bejart Lausanne is at Sadler's Wells, with mixed programmes, until April 3.</p>

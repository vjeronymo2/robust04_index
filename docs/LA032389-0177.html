			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: FINE LITTLE ART CATCHES EYE AT BENEFIT  </P> <P> Tom Tierney dubbed them "the only affordable housing in Orange County" at  Tiffany &amp; Co. in South Coast Plaza on Sunday night.  </P> <P> Tierney was talking about the homey sculptures of Gifford Myers, creator of the  Multiple Listings collection, some of which were on exhibit at the jewelry  store's benefit for the Fine Arts Gallery at UC Irvine.  </P> <P> Myers' ceramic works -- displayed in built-in wall cases -- received almost as  much attention as Tiffany's heart-stopping trinkets. One piece in particular,  "Hold Out/Holding On," got a lion's share of stares from guests.  </P> <P> "It's about the little guy," said Myers, peering into the showcase at the  teensy house he had sandwiched between two skyscrapers. "He's been offered over  a million bucks for his property, but money has no meaning to him. Emotional  value does. So he says: 'Let them build on either side. The hell with you guys.  We're going to hold out!' " His sculptures are priced from $3,500 to $5,000,  said Myers, who teaches art at UC Irvine.  </P> <P> Supporters of the Fine Arts Gallery gathered at 6:30 p.m. to be wined and dined  and, along with Myers' works, enjoy the whimsical displays of artist Gene  Moore, master window designer for Tiffany &amp; Co. in New York.  </P> <P> (It was Moore who did the windows for the movie "Breakfast at Tiffany's." "We  filled them with miniature chandeliers. They were beautiful," said Moore, who  noted that he saw Audrey Hepburn recently.)  </P> <P> Among the guests was UC Irvine Chancellor Jack W. Peltason, attending with his  wife, Suzanne, and their daughter, Nancy Elliott. "The art gallery is a gem,"  he said. "It's especially appropriate for the campus since it involves  teachers, students, audiences and continuing discussion about what goes on.  It's a hidden treasure that is becoming less hidden."  </P> <P> For the gallery's director, Melinda Wortz, it's a place to spotlight  "cutting-edge art." On Wortz's dream list: a gallery large enough to display  California light and space sculptors, such as Robert Irwin, Larry Bell and  Bruce Nauman.  </P> <P> "Giuseppe Ponza of Milan, Italy, is a collector of these artists," said Wortz,  an avid art collector who has known Ponza for several years. "Our goal is to  accommodate his collection."  </P> <P> Renee Segerstrom was honorary chairwoman of the benefit, which raised more than  $8,000.  </P> <P> Red hot: He plays it cool on the podium, but he sure knows how to heat up a  party.  </P> <P> Having mixed with music lovers at the Center Club after his performance with  the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra on Saturday, Zubin Mehta sat down to dine.  </P> <P> While his table partners watched with fascination (and uttered nary a word),  the dashing maestro brought forth a tiny gold filigree box from deep inside his  coat pocket.  </P> <P> Delicately, he opened it and produced two of the skinniest objects this side of  a pair of chopsticks. Placing the red peppers on his plate, he minced them,  then folded the flecks into his spinach crepes and saucy chicken.  </P> <P> What was it all about? No one dared ask. But one Mehta-watcher ventured a  guess. "I figure since he is Indian, he must love spicy food," said Erich  Vollmer, executive director of the Orange County Philharmonic Society. (The  society co-sponsored the champagne and petit buffet with the Orange County  chapter of the American Jewish Committee.)  </P> <P> Earlier in the evening, Mehta -- whose appearance at the Orange County  Performing Arts Center marked his first since he starred at its opening -- had  received a nod from Lewis Janowsky, vice president of the local committee. But  first, Mehta had told the arts-loving crowd that he felt uncomfortable about  receiving the International Cultural Diplomacy Award.  </P> <P> "I really don't deserve this," he said. "What I've given of my artistry to the  state of Israel, the state has given me back a hundred times.  </P> <P> "I have just come from a month of concerts there. We try to show the world that  there is a side of Israel other than the one we read about on the front pages  of world newspapers. And it is our fervent wish that Israel will once and for  all be wiped off the front pages, or exist there only for cultural and  scientific reasons. Because in cultural and scientific areas, Israel is on par  with everyone else in the world."  </P> <P> Life is a stage: Talk about a soft sell. It was fizzy champagne and snazzy  canapes for members of the Theatre Guild of South Coast Repertory on Saturday  when they gathered to raise money at I. Magnin at South Coast Plaza.  </P> <P> Rubbing elbows in the tony department store's Miss Magnin and Fine Apparel  departments, guests got to ogle the latest in daytime wear while they ogled  each other in the latest in cocktail wear. (For benefit committee members,  spangled, ruffled and poufed knits by St. John were the hands-down favorites.)  </P> <P> But the soft sell had as much to do with what's new for spring as it had to do  with marketing Magnin. Chiffon scarfs are what's triple hot in accessories,  said Noddie Weltner, special events coordinator for I. Magnin's southern  region.  </P> <P> "The chiffon scarf is the accessory item," she noted. "And you can wear it with  anything -- a suit, a blouse and skirt . . . ."  </P> <P> And you can drape it several ways: around your neck, over your shoulder, even  around your waist. "It's really new to tie a scarf around your head and throw  on a pair of shades," Weltner said.  </P> <P> "Sunglasses are another important accessory this season. There are the kind you  hide behind, and there are the kind you buy to make a fashion statement."  </P> <P> After yummies, guests rode the escalators to watch a first-floor fashion show  that featured the spring silhouettes of such designers as Claude Montana,  Geoffrey Beene and Bill Blass, a favorite of the First Lady (as if you didn't  know).  </P> <P> Proceeds were estimated at $5,000. Rosemary Sieve is Guild president. Catherine  Steisel and Donna Gaglia were co-chairwomen.  </P></p>

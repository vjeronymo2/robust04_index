			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'MY' EMPLOYEES ARE MAKING A MISTAKE HERE; THIS HEAP IS A NEW EDEN;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: AFTER A VISIT TO ZEKE THE SHEIK'S COMPOST PILE, IT'S HARD TO CALL  IT A NUISANCE. THE BUREAUCRATS SHOULD LEARN FROM HIM.  </P> <P> The other day I drove by Zeke the Sheik's 30-foot-high compost pile in  Altadena, which briefly caught fire and as a result has been under fire from  various of my employees. I say they are my employees because they are County of  Los Angeles bureaucrats, and I am a citizen and taxpayer in this county. I  wanted to see the nuisance they are attempting to abate in my name and for my  good.  </P> <P> Zeke was there, talking to neighbors and a stream of visitors. The neighbors  focused on neighborly concerns like saying hello, getting Zeke to haul some of  their rubbish away with his truck, or receiving some of the vegetables Zeke  grows. Some of the visitors were friends, I might even say co-conspirators. I  should note that there has always been a good supply of free-thinkers living up  against the San Gabriels, starting with John Brown's sons, who spent a quiet  old age in a canyon after the raid on Harpers Ferry, continuing through  Charlotte Perkins Gilman, author of among other things a feminist utopia called  Herland, and coming into the present with the late Richard Feynman and Jirayr  Zorthian, who also lives up a canyon. Zorthian likes to make sculptures out of  telephone poles. I went to junior high with his son, Toby. So the local  independent characters are numerous, though not all famous. Zeke can count on a  body of support.  </P> <P> At any rate, I visited Zeke partly because I'm curious but also because, like  Zeke, I have a compost pile. I wanted to see how far I could take mine. You  see, I've been reading the papers. I've been receiving instructions on how to  recycle (which I was already doing) from other employees of mine, this time in  the Pasadena Waste Reduction office. Recently I've been told a lot of things I  already believe. That we are running out of landfill space. That we need more  forests but instead are cutting down the rain forests to make toilet paper and  for ranch land to graze beef for the junk-food chains.  </P> <P> Pasadena's recycling plan consists of me putting jars, cans, newspapers, motor  oil, etc., undifferentiated, into a blue bin, which I then put on the curb. The  glass will probably end up in the landfill anyway. There is not as yet much  demand for it, in that a large part of the Earth's mantle is made of silicon,  which can be easily turned into glass that is free of the Paul Newman spaghetti  sauce I failed to get completely washed out of mine. I used a large quantity of  water, which in the next couple of months will probably be rationed.  </P> <P> The city's new recycling program costs me $1.50 a month. On the long-awaited  first day I looked out the front window and saw a middle-aged Latino taking  most of the contents of my recycling bin. He zig-zagged down the street from  blue bin to blue bin in a 15-year-old station wagon. I said to my wife, "Janet,  come look at Pasadena's recycling program," realizing with disappointment just  as I said it that this was simply a man for whom it made economic sense to go  house-to-house, picking up other people's recycling. He wouldn't have cost me  $1.50 a month.  </P> <P> But to return to Zeke's spread and my search for a nuisance, there wasn't one.  The property, including the "mountain of dung," as the (Pasadena) Star-News  called it in the headline of a good-natured story, was beautiful. From the top  of the heap, looking down, I could see that Zeke's square two-story wood house  sat in a local analog of the rain forest -- lush growth everywhere, succulents  and cacti, banana trees, palms, fruit trees, taller trees, bushes and shrubs  too numerous to name. A ladder was propped against bushes. Someone unseen was  pruning a tree. There were pathways and chickens, ducks and geese roaming free.  A huge turkey, more than 40 pounds, whose name I have forgotten, but who  replaced an even larger one named Butch, according to Zeke, functions partly as  watchdog and will chase intruders through the forest.  </P> <P> Zeke has solved his problem with the fires that got the county out there in the  first place, but the firefighters are going to come by and pick up some plants  that he's offered them, he says. He has planted the heap with powerful  vegetables -- collard and mustard greens, onions, leeks and beets. At the top  there are roses and azaleas. There are also a couple of crosses, but I think a  man should be allowed a few eccentricities. It is clear Zeke is trying to  create on his property, and also on a strip of land apparently owned by a  nearby cemetery, a new Eden, something whole and alive and so energetic it is  capable, if not watched, of bursting into flames or at least smoldering. As I  was leaving he offered to give me some compost to energize my pile. Others have  come in recent days to haul away a bushel or a truckload in the face of  imminent threats that Zeke's heap will be forcibly leveled.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, my employees, not too worried about the 55-gallon drums of toxic  waste routinely dumped by the side of the roads of our county, have declared  Zeke's heap an unlawful landfill. My other employees have neglected to include  leaves and lawn clippings in their recycling plan, despite the fact that they  can be composted in any back yard, or commercially, and make up something like  one-third of what the trash collectors pick up. Soon we will be paying them to  keep the man out of our blue recycling bin. I find more irony in this than I  can easily stand.  </P></p>

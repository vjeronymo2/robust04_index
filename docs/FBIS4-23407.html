			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] According to the Angolan Government, there has been  the fiercest fighting yet around Cuito since the flare up of the  conflict 10 days ago. UNITA [National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola] rebels have been launching offensives at  Cuito and Malanje, while the government has been bombing UNITA  headquarters at Huambo. Aid flights have been interrupted and  the civilian death toll is already well into the hundreds.    Well, today, a flight made it to Cuito and came back with a  number of relief workers being evacuated from the city. World  Food Program Director in Angola Philip Borel was on the plane.  On the line to Luanda, Chris Greene asked him what the relief  workers had said about the situation in Cuito over the past few  days.    [Begin recording] [Borel] Well, the situation is very bad. I  can't say nothing more than that. It is extremely bad.    [Greene] Could they give any impression of the number of  people who have been killed?    [Borel] It is very difficult to give statistics when you are  most of the time in a bunker.    [Greene] You say they spent most of their time in a bunker.  Does that mean that the shelling was more or less continuous for  the last few days?    [Borel] Correct. Even last night and even in the morning.    [Greene] So, it is still going on?    [Borel] Yes, yes. We are very concerned.    [Greene] Do you see any possibility of being able to get  relief flights into Cuito in the near future?    [Borel] I think it is extremely premature to say anything  before the political arm of the United Nations has indicated to  us that we may resume the flights.    [Greene] Are your people who have just come out of Cuito  able  to tell you anything about the food situation there?    [Borel] Yes, sure. The food situation is terrible. Mr. Hans  Peter Vicola who is our [word indistinct] manager in Cuito has  done a beautiful job. He has himself made the latest  distribution on Monday and after that, since a bomb fell on our  warehouse, we have no more food to distribute; but according to  his information, we may have maybe one week of spare food for  all the population and after that, there will be [words  indistinct] survive.    [Greene] How many people had WFP been feeding up there?    [Borel] More or less 160,000.    [Greene] So, basically the entire population?    [Borel] That is correct. You see, they have no other link  [words indistinct] our flights.    [Greene] What information have you had today about the  situation in other parts of Angola?    [Borel] I think the situation is bad in Malanje again. We  have not resumed a flight to Malanje. The situation is still  difficult in Huambo. We have resumed a flight to Huambo. The  situation in the north also is quite tense and we have not  resumed a flight. Everywhere else [words indistinct] normally.    [Greene] What does normal mean in that kind of context?    [Borel] Normal means that we have flights without problems  to  Luena, Saurimo, Menongue, and [words indistinct] corridors, from  Namibe, Lubango, Ndjiva, and from Lobito to Cubal, and a lot of  other places. Yesterday, we succeeding a [words indistinct] to  Dundo. [end recording]</p>

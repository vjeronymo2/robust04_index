			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / No star to steer by Heigh-ho, here we go. Summer fun is over for us all, not least President Bill Clinton. Look at him with kind eyes. It is a sorry sight. His work is nowhere near done, but he can hardly be enjoying it these days. Something is going wrong. It is too soon to declare his presidency a failure, but it does not seem, from the eastern side of the Atlantic, to be on the road to glittering success. According to the most recent Time/CNN canvass of public opinion, only 40 per cent of respondents approve of the way Mr Clinton is handling his job. This, we read, is the lowest such score in the past 40 years for any president at the same stage of the game. Many of his policies receive respectable indications of assent from the electorate at large, but the esteem attached to his name is demonstrably low. Democratic candidates in the congressional elections for which campaigning officially began yesterday have been advised not to associate themselves with their national leader. Some of Mr Clinton's misfortune is explicable by factors particular to himself. The Whitewater investigation, an endless prying into the details of land investments made long before he publicly aspired to the presidency, is one such. The outcome may be inconclusive, or it may wholly exonerate Mr and Mrs Clinton, but that is beside the point. The president is weakened by the process. He has been further debilitated by the descent, almost to British levels, of public speculation about his past private life. A second cause of the president's difficulties is beyond his ability to redress. The weakness of party discipline in the US legislature has long been a matter of wonder to European parliamentarians. Democrats and Republicans, whether senators or congressmen, owe their primary allegiance to their local districts and their own careers; support for a president of the same party comes after that. A popular president, espousing popular policies, can overcome congressional obstruction, but Mr Clinton did not win the necessarily overwhelming popular mandate, and consequently does not command sufficient clout. He has achieved a crime bill, sort of, but his star policy, a comprehensive health insurance scheme, looks bogged down. Welfare reform, promised during the campaign, awaits progress on health. These storms might have been better weathered if the president had convinced the American people that he had an idea of where he was taking them. Perhaps he did when he started, but the evidence suggests otherwise. His foreign policy is inchoate, his domestic policy lamed, his strength of purpose uncertain. His long hesitation on the brink of an invasion of Haiti is one indication of his inherent wobbliness; his tailoring of his Cuban policy to the niceties of Florida politics another. Mr Clinton has had important successes: the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Partnership for Peace strategy to enlarge Nato, the completion (although not yet the congressional ratification) of the Uruguay round of trade talks. None of them has been set in the context of a global strategy. That is the trouble. By all accounts the president is a highly intelligent man, a quick master of a brief, consultative, fascinated by debate and policy detail. He is, however, possessed by the need to win political points with every move he makes; he cannot, or will not, take the risks leadership requires. There is a double-edged lesson here for centre-left challengers everywhere. As to campaigning, follow the president; as to running the country, don't. Mr Tony Blair, the new leader of Britain's Labour party, has closely studied Mr Clinton's 1992 campaign. The then governor of Arkansas spent several years establishing himself as first among the 'new' Democrats. He worked at bringing the party back from the hopeless left towards the political centre. After the long Reagan-Bush years, he campaigned on strong themes calculated to allay middle-class fears. He told people what they wanted to hear, smiled a lot, was blessed by the intervention of Mr Ross Perot, and won. Mr Blair plainly intends to do much the same. It is a proven election-winning formula, which could, in spite of everything, deliver a second term to Mr Clinton in 1996, not to mention a Labour victory in the same year. It has done marvellously well for Mr Blair this summer: he appears to be as popular as ice-cream. If he does not melt, he could become the first Labour prime minister in nearly two decades. The US formula does not, however, deliver anything of true value once the votes are counted. I suspect - hope - Mr Blair is aware of this. It is not worth winning an election if you do not have a clear purpose in doing so. Labour thinking is naturally shaped by long contemplation of the causes of the party's dismal record of electoral failure since 1979. The pitfalls to avoid are often rehearsed. One, frequently referred to by the late Mr John Smith and his then deputy leader, Mrs Margaret Beckett, was the production of detailed policies. You must never do that, they said. The Conservatives would cost them, distort the results, and throw the figures back in Labour's face. We will see how much of this obsession with past defeats governs the thinking of Mr Blair when he speaks at Labour's annual conference next month. His fixation must necessarily be with electoral victory, but he is sophisticated enough to know that office is not all. For confirmation, he has only to consider the case of Mr John Major. In spite of his shortcomings, the prime minister has consistently steered by the light of low inflation. He has also shown determination, and courage, in seeking peace in Northern Ireland. If the latter be sealed, the two achievements will be recognised by historians, if not necessarily rewarded by the voters. The big conundrum remains unresolved. In what direction will Labour steer if it wins? Never mind the details. Let us have just sufficient to assure us that Britain's refreshed party of the centre-left is not to follow the Clinton Democrats down the path to disappointment. Would Labour lapse into a strategy of allowing a little bit more inflation, in the hope of faster growth and more jobs? Would it seek to redistribute some income or wealth? What would be its principal lodestar? If we are not to know, can we be sure that the putative next prime minister does?</p>

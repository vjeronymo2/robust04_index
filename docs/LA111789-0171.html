			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH CONVEYS PEACE WISHES TO GORBACHEV  </P> <P> President Bush has sent a cable to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev  expressing hopes for "a calm and peaceful period of change" in Eastern Europe  as democratic reforms are adopted, the White House said today.  </P> <P> The message echoed the theme of a cable that Gorbachev sent to Bush last  Friday.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the President  "indicated his support for the changes in Eastern Europe and the reforms under  way in the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> "He said the United States wants a calm and peaceful period of change in  Eastern Europe as Poland, Hungary and East Germany seek to implement their  reforms," the spokesman said.  </P> <P> "The President said he believes these historic steps will make a positive  contribution to a Europe that is whole and free," Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> The message was dispatched to Moscow on Thursday evening and will be delivered  by U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock.  </P> <P> A week ago, Fitzwater had said that Gorbachev's message to Bush "underscored  the importance of the changes taking place and expressed the hope that the  situation will remain calm and peaceful."  </P> <P> Bush and Gorbachev will meet Dec. 2 and 3 on ships off the coast of Malta for  their first summit.  </P> <P> Fitzwater said the dominant issue will be the changes in Eastern Europe and  their impact on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact, and  on East-West relations in general.  </P> <P> Bush talked by telephone today with President Francois Mitterrand of France,  Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West  Germany about events in Eastern Europe and the summit.  </P> <P> Fitzwater said Bush and Mitterrand agreed to talk again after a meeting of  European leaders this weekend and before Bush sits down with Gorbachev. Bush  and Mulroney also said they would talk after Malta.  </P> <P> In preparation for the talks, Bush planned to confer at the White House today  with four former U.S. ambassadors to the Soviet Union: George Kennan, Malcolm  Toon, Thomas Watson and Arthur Hartman.  </P> <P> Fitzwater said the United States is not concerned that Gorbachev might spring a  surprise on Bush, as he did with then-President Ronald Reagan when he proposed  sweeping arms cuts during the Reykjavik summit.  </P> <P> Fitzwater said, "Obviously, if President Gorbachev makes a proposal, the  President will say, 'Well, that's very interesting -- why do you feel that way  and what's your reasoning?' and he'll give him his points of view and his ideas  and say, 'We'll take these matters up with the Allies, and we'll talk about  them again at our next summit.' "  </P> <P> Fitzwater added, "We don't anticipate any negotiating going on there or the  emergence of any specific agreements in any kind of formal fashion."  </P></p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Kvaerner lowers forecast as oil and gas side incurs loss Kvaerner, Norway's second largest stock market-listed company, warned yesterday that losses on a project by the oil and gas division, along with restructuring costs, would damage profits for the first eight months of this year. Profits for the full year would also decline, it said. It expects the oil and gas division to incur a loss of about NKr200m (Dollars 29.8m) for the first eight months, and losses of the same order for 1994, because of losses on deliveries to the Troll oil project and restructuring costs of the division. 'This result partly reflects a substantial loss already reported by the group on its deliveries to the Troll oil platform in the Norwegian North Sea,' it said. Kvaerner, headed by Mr Erik Tonseth, said this implied a weaker 1994 result for the group as a whole. Last time, profits before unrealised foreign currency items and tax reached NKr1.5bn. The company had earlier forecast profits for 1994 at the same level as the year before. Kvaerner is due on Friday to report full figures for the first eight months. In the first four months of the year, the group boosted pre-tax profits by 36 per cent to NKr590m. However, the oil and gas division saw pre-tax profits cut by more than half, to NKr57m from NKr135m. The division plunged into an operating loss of NKr3m in the period after a profit of NKr116m a year earlier. Last week Aker, the Norwegian oil and gas technology and cement and building materials group and Kvaerner's main competitor for deliveries to the oil and gas sector, reported a fall in pre-tax profits by its oil and gas technology division, to NKr156m from NKr343m. It also warned of lower annual profit.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Fathallah] </F>   [Excerpt] Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif has  affirmed that there can be no dialogue with terrorists because  they are a group of schemers funded from abroad, similar to the  German gangs. Their objective is to strike at political  stability in Egypt and try to weaken its economy. They hide  behind Islam although they are a misguided group. The majority  of the Egyptian people are Muslim and do not need guardians or  someone to teach them about Islam.    He said that the issue of terrorism in Egypt is different  from the issue of terrorism in Algeria, where the terrorist  groups succeeded in getting into parliament. But in Egypt the  terrorists have failed to get into the People's Assembly or  Consultative Council. They have also failed to infiltrate the  ranks of the Army, security forces, and large institutions.    In addition, the terrorist phenomenon in Egypt is different  from that in the United Kingdom, for example, due to the  presence of the shadow government and some form of Irish  independence from the United Kingdom.    Al-Sharif said this in answer to a question posed by an  African journalist about the parallels between terrorism in  Egypt and Algeria and the possibility of holding a dialogue with  the terrorists in Egypt to reach a peaceful solution, such as  that going on now between the United Kingdom and Ireland.    During his meeting with the members of the conference of the  African Journalists Office under the chairmanship of Mahfuz  al-Ansari, head of the African Journalists Union and chief  editor of AL-JUMHURIYAH, al-Sharif added that there are 440  seats in the People's Assembly, representing all political  trends. None of them belong to the groups that describe  themselves as Islamic. None of the so-called Islamic groups  have managed to get into the opposition parties such as the  National Progressive Unionist Grouping Party, the Wafd Party,  and the Labor Party. He noted that the Muslim Brotherhood are  represented by only 12 members out of the 43 members from the  Labor Party; and they succeeded only because they belong to big  families and tribes in the rural areas. He said the National  Democratic Party has given opportunities to people from all  political currents in Egypt, considering that 33,000 citizens  ran in the elections. [passage omitted]</p>

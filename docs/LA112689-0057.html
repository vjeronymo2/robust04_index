			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS  </P> <P> Ten years ago, school teachers Evie Werner and Al Davis bid goodby to their  classes in the San Francisco Bay Area and headed for Hawaii to launch a B&amp;B  reservation service aimed at the budget traveler. The idea dawned after Werner  and Davis fell in love with the islands during a vacation. The couple sent  their regrets to friends on the mainland: "Goodby, we've found our Paradise."  Only, could they afford the gamble?  </P> <P> Werner and Davis decided it was worth the risk, so they bought a home and put  up their shingle: "Bed &amp; Breakfast." Just the one home in the beginning.  Now Werner and Davis represent more than 150 residences on Kauai, Maui, the Big  Island, Oahu, Molokai and Lanai. Rates from $30/$50 single, $35/$80 double. A  choice of homes, studio apartments, private cottages. The Werner/Davis team  make the rounds personally, checking out hillside homes, beach houses and  shacks by the sea, signing up only the best. In addition, they've put together  a book listing the rentals.  </P> <P> Write to Werner/Davis c/o Bed &amp; Breakfast Hawaii, P.O. Box 449, Kapaa,  Kauai, Hawaii 96746. Telephone (808) 822-7771.

The Mauna Lani Bay Hotel on  the Big Island of Hawaii has set Dec. 20 as the opening date for five new  multimillion-dollar rental homes: $2,000/$2,500 per day!

The airline has blocked rooms at several Seattle/Tacoma hotels (two-night  minimums).

Sokol of Beverly Hills: "Vacationed last summer at the Drowsy Water  Ranch in Granby, Colo. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Felt that the entire operation  hosted by owners Ken and Randy Sue Fosha was excellent. The staff were  attentive and solicitous and understood the needs of both adults and children  to make the week enjoyable and safe. Guests ranged from secretaries to heads of  corporations. A wonderful mix of people. We were surprised to find four  separate families from England that had been returning to the ranch year after  year. The accommodations, although Spartan, were just what we felt a ranch  should have -- that is, log cabins. The food was wholesome and plentiful. We  certainly recommend Drowsy Water Ranch as a wonderful family vacation."  </P> <P> For brochures, write to Ken and Randy Sue Fosha, Drowsy Water Ranch, Box 147,  Granby, Colo. 80446. Telephone (303) 725-3456. Drowsy Water opens in late May,  closes late in September. Rates: $800 per week single, $1,450 double. Cheaper  family rates.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Capital's $82m Trade Surplus a Good Sign"] </F>   [Text] Beijing posted a foreign trade surplus of $82  million last month, indicating China may be on the way to  recovering from last year's $12.2 billion deficit.    However, nationwide figures are not yet available.    The capital's imports and exports rose 120 per cent from  January last year to $183 million. Imports were about $50  million, up 116 per cent.    The municipal government said yesterday that the Shougang  Company (Capital Iron and Steel Complex) increased its exports  by $8.01 million, a bigger rise than any other firm in the city.    Shougang is one of China's largest corporations and  Beijing's  leading earner of foreign exchange.    Exports from the Beijing Machinery Equipment Import and  Export Corporation rose 620 per cent, but their exact volume was  unavailable.    Foreign-funded firms in Beijing exported goods worth $40  million in January, 31 per cent of the city's total.    And barter trade, mainly with the former Soviet republics,  increased 78 per cent to $4.23 million, municipal officials said.    State-run trading companies, the mainstay of the capital's  foreign business, increased their exports by 68 per cent.    These corporations export goods such as grain, silk, arts  and  crafts, and chemicals.    Exports from the country's State run enterprises, including  those in Beijing, shrank last year because of the sluggish  international market.    Most of them turned their attention to more profitable  domestic business as the national economy grew 13 per cent over  1992.    Analysts said the unification of the foreign exchange rates  on January 1, which formally devalued the yuan, might help  exports recover.    But it was too early to say whether Beijing, or the rest of  the country, could sustain the export momentum.    "We have to wait and see whether the current foreign  exchange  rate will remain stable for the whole year," said an expert who  asked not to be named.    "If the yuan is further devalued as inflation soars, the  exporters might face prohibitive purchase prices at home and a  demand from foreign importers to slash export prices."</p>

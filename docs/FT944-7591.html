			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Outspoken Tory resigns party post Mr Patrick Nicholls last night resigned as a Conservative party vice-chairman after making an outspoken attack on the French and Germans in his local newspaper. The MP for Teignbridge and former minister said he bitterly regretted any embarrassment he might have caused to the government in the article, which was disowned by Conservative Central Office. He said remarks about Germany and France had deflected from the main message of the article which was that 'our destiny lies in Europe'. He said his comments had also deflected attention from the fact that the prime minister had been 'singularly successful in securing Britain's interests in Europe'. That was why he would be supporting the government in the vote on Monday on a bill increasing Britain's contributions to the European Union budget. Mr Nicholls quit as junior environment minister when caught drink-driving at the 1990 Tory party conference. He had previously been at the employment department where he was a member of the ministerial group on alcohol misuse. Writing in the Western Morning News, Mr Nicholls ridiculed Germans as warmongers and French as cowards. He said Germany's main contribution to Europe had been to plunge the Continent into two world wars within living memory. 'Too many of my compatriots have died to the strains of Deutschland uber Alles,' he said. Mr Nicholls dismissed the French as 'a nation of collaborators', who presented themselves as a nation of resistance fighters. France was 'incapable of winning any war unless it is fought by the French Foreign Legion, and only then because it is officered for the most part by English, Americans and Germans'. Mr Nicholls wrote: 'I wish I was not in the European Community. It is far from the merely economic community we were led to expect, and if I thought it was feasible to leave it, I would be off tomorrow.' Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said he deplored 'a statement of rather old-fashioned prejudices against anybody on the continent of Europe'. Mr Nicholls' comments were not a helpful approach. 'One of the things I am anxious to do is have an intelligent European debate.' Mrs Noreen Atkinson, Mr Nicholls's constituency chairman, said she thought he had been trying to put the case 'very squarely'. Mr Nicholls, 46, is a former ministerial aide to Mr David Mellor in the Home Office and Mr John Gummer in the Ministry of Agriculture. He fought off a strong centre-party challenge to win his seat in 1983. A strong loyalist with a reputation for forcefully defending government policies, he was given special responsibilities for campaigning in May 1993 when he was appointed one of the five vice-chairmen who help run the party organisation under Mr Jeremy Hanley, the Tory chairman.</p>

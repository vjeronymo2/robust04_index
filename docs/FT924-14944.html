			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / BA steps up fight to gain stake in USAir BRITISH AIRWAYS yesterday stepped up pressure on the US government to approve its Dollars 750m (Pounds 421.30m) investment for a 44 per cent stake in USAir, warning that rejection of the deal would have severe consequences for airline de-regulation. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's deputy chairman and chief executive, said 'non-approval by the US would create a response of a fortress mentality in the UK and elsewhere and put back the course of deregulation for many years.' Sir Colin said his airline would fight vigorously 'for our right to make a legitimate investment in USAir'. His warning coincided with the start of a new round of negotiations in Washington between the US and the UK over the BA deal. Last week BA announced services from Birmingham to New York and from Manchester to Los Angeles which are expected to intensify still further competition across the Atlantic. The US authorities are now coming under intense pressure from the three largest US carriers - American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta Air Lines - to block the BA-USAir deal unless they can secure from the British government greater access for the three US carriers in the UK and continental European markets. The UK government is prepared to negotiate a new 'open skies' bilateral agreement with the US, but it has so far opposed linking the BA-USAir deal with a new bilateral aviation accord between the two countries. Airline industry officials yesterday warned that the issue risked becoming a cause celebre if the US government rejected the BA-USAir deal. However, BA is still hoping to secure US approval for the deal before the transaction's deadline of December 24. BA could consider taking legal action in the US high court if the deal is blocked. Sir Colin said: 'Our plan falls firmly within prevailing US regulations and there is no legitimate ground for non-approval in Washington.' He also argued that the balance weighed heavily in favour of US airlines which could operate from 771 points in the US to the UK, while BA operated from seven points in the UK to 20 in the US. Sir Colin said: 'The big three US carriers control 60 per cent of the US market, which accounts for 40 per cent of world air travel, while the UK accounts for just over 3 per cent of world travel.' The US carriers argue that the current bilateral agreement gives BA an advantage by restricting their access to the UK.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Labour plans curbs on hostile takeovers Labour party plans due out tomorrow provide for a shake-up of corporate governance and a clampdown on hostile takeovers. Pressures on companies to pay high dividends to City institutions would be reduced. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman - and a potential Labour leadership candidate - said yesterday he wanted to 'remove the terror' that frightened company chairmen into paying big dividends. 'Companies often have to place dividends before investment because they fear a fall in their share price will make them vulnerable to a takeover,' he said. In a paper called Winning for Britain, Mr Cook blames much of the decline in investment performance on the fact that over the past 15 years the proportion of net profits taken out of the business in dividends has increased from half to three quarters. The government is also reviewing whether companies are paying too much in dividends. Mr Cook wants to reverse the burden of proof in takeovers on to the company launching a hostile bid to show that it is in the public interest. At present, a hostile takeover would be stopped only if it clearly transgressed competition rules. Mr Cook accepts that curbing the number of hostile takeovers - expected to increase again after a lull during the recession - will not be sufficient to ensure that companies invest more and improve performance. He is proposing a package of measures designed 'to encourage committed owners, promote collective contribution to the strength of the business enterprise and raise the priority of long-term organic development of businesses'. They include tax changes to encourage long-term holding of shares; better information for pension fund trustees; statutory reporting of long-term indicators of corporate strength in annual reports; and a review of whether to establish a minimum legal standard for the composition of company boards. Although the plans are likely to upset business organisations, they are less ambitious than Labour's previous policies and there is a strong stress on changing corporate 'culture' and encouraging collaborative networking between companies. Big companies will only be encouraged rather than forced to introduce Labour's favoured two-tier board option, with a supervisory board monitoring an executive board.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Belskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 25 TASS -- Former Soviet Defence  Minister Dmitriy Yazov, one of the 1991 August failed coup  leaders, now tried for high treason admitted on Tuesday that the  coup attempt was unconstitutional.    Yazov also admitted the unconstitutionality of the measures  taken against Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev who was  removed from power and isolated at his Black Sea dacha.  However, he stressed once again that these measures were  necessary and aimed at preventing the Soviet Union from  disintegration which, as he believes, would have been inevitable  if a federal treaty had been signed by six instead of 15  republics.    He said the reasons for declaring a state of emergency in  the  former Soviet Union were extraordinary and much stronger than  was envisaged by the Law on the State of Emergency.    The former defence minister regretted that the number of  troops brought into the city on August 19, 1991 to help police  ensure the state of emergency was too small. At the same time  he added that no combat orders had been issued to the troops.    Yazov stressed that he personally ordered the troops on high  alert, but denied he had ordered Soviet air forces on full  combat readiness. He noted that all orders to the troops had  been sent by the command of the airborne troops, who,  apparently, have overstepped their powers.    The court ruled that all materials of investigation obtained  from Yazov in absence of his lawyer shall be excluded from court  hearings.</p>

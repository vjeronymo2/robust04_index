			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Bangkok citizens rally to Mr Clean GENERAL Chamlong Srimuang, the opposition politician on the fourth day of a hunger strike to demand the resignation of Thailand's unelected premier, is a moralistic former general dubbed 'Mr Clean' by his supporters, Reuter reports from Bangkok. His uncompromising piety and idealism have made him hugely popular among Bangkok citizens grown tired of rampant corruption and influence-peddling in high office. They voted for his Palang Dharma or 'Moral Force' party in droves during the March 22 general elections and it swept 32 of the 35 seats contested in the city. Gen Chamlong's vow to fast to the death unless Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon resigns the premiership brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets in support of his protest. A devout Buddhist, Gen Chamlong won his spurs politically in two terms as Bangkok's governor where his efforts to fight corruption, clean up the city's streets and free them from annual floods won him a strong support base. He spurns the expensive suits, flashy cars and gold watches favoured by many other politicians. He wears the simple denim garb of a peasant and sandals cut from old tyres. His image as a politician untainted by corruption contrasts strongly with that of the new Thai cabinet, which includes ministers Gen Suchinda himself accused of corruption after staging a coup against the last elected prime minister in February 1991. Gen Chamlong has survived attacks by rivals who criticised him for failing to solve Bangkok's worsening traffic and air pollution problems and who tried to discredit him for associating with a renegade Buddhist sect deemed heretical by the religion's mainstream authorities. In a city known for its massive sex industry, Gen Chamlong abstains from sexual contact with his wife. He wakes before dawn and eats just one meal a day. 'Eat less, spend less, work harder' has become his catchphrase. Thais prefix his name with the title Maha  - denoting a venerated Buddhist  -because of his monkish habits. Gen Chamlong was born into a poor ethnic Chinese family, which his widowed mother struggled to support as a street vendor. Top grades in school took him into the army where he saw action in Vietnam and Laos and eventually rose to the rank of major-general. He left the military in the early 1980s to stand for the Bangkok governorship. Because of his steely character his vow to fast until death has been taken seriously. He has ordered his supporters to stand guard in shifts to prevent any attempts to force him to eat or take him to hospital. He vowed not to speak during his fast and instead communicated through signs.</p>

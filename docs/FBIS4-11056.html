			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments monitored through 19 April.    Exports grew by only 2.9 percent in 1993, but imports grew  at  an accelerated rate. The government believes this is normal in  view of the ongoing process to eliminate tariffs. It trusts  exports will perform well beginning in 1995. The National  Customs and Tax Directorate has reported Colombians imported  $9.8 billion in 1993, compared to $6.5 billion in 1992; that is,  51.1 percent more.    There was an increase from $958.3 million in 1992 to $1.7  billion in 1993; that is, an 82.27-percent increase. The  highest increase was in raw materials; the highest increase was  registered in durable consumer goods, including private  automobiles, weapons, military equipment, and home appliances;  there was a 126-percent increase in this area. The highest  increase was in raw materials, intermediate products, and fuels,  with a total of $4.2 billion.    The purchase of capital goods also registered a considerable  increase, with a total of $3.8 billion; that is, a 75.73-percent  increase in 1993 compared with 1992. The United States was  again Colombia's main purveyor. Colombia imported $3.4 billion  from this country in 1993; that is, 42 percent more than in  1992. Venezuela was the second purveyor, with $968.1 million in  1993 compared to $424 million in 1992.    Concerning exports, they increased by only 2.9 percent, for  a  total of $7.1 billion. Nontraditional exports increased by  11.95 percent; that is, $3.9 billion; this was caused by an  expansion of bananas and emerald sales abroad. Banana sales  totaled $393.8 million and emerald sales totaled $308.6 million,  exports of which increased by 77.2 percent in 1993 compared to  1992.    Traditional exports dropped due to lower sales of coffee,  ferronickel, and petroleum. Coffee exports dropped 9.45  percent, ferronickel exports by 18.58 percent, and petroleum  sales by 6.3 percent in 1993 compared to 1992. (Santa Fe de  Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 9 April 94 p 11a)    The National Administrative Department of Statistics, Dane,  reported yesterday unemployment in the country's seven most  important cities increased from 9.6 percent in March 1993 to  10.3 percent in March 1994. That nearly 1-percent increase is  equivalent to 46,000 more unemployed. The growth in  unemployment was due to a slight decrease in economic growth.  Dane reported the largest departmental capitals registered  considerable increases in unemployment, but three smaller  capitals, Bucaramanga, manizales, and Pasto, registered  decreases. Medellin fared the worst, with 13.3 percent. Santa  Fe de Bogota registered the lowest rate, with 8.2 percent.  (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 13 April 94 pp 1b, 3b)</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Proconsular Visit"] </F>   [Text] General Joseph P. Hoar, commander of [as published]  chief of the US central command, has by now become a frequent  visitor in Pakistan who is treated with somewhat greater  deference than what is shown for generals from elsewhere. He is  here again on what may be his umpteenth visit, going through an  almost unchanging itinerary. This includes not only a junket  throughout the country inspecting the military installations but  calling on the state functionaries including the President.    The frequency of his visits suggest this is no mere courtesy  call but a routine function of his responsibilities as the  C-in-C [Commander in Chief] of a command which covers the region  Pakistan is in. No government has ever given any explanation  for the regularity of the General's visits and it is needless to  expect the present regime to do so. Military matters of this  nature are still obscured by a sort of an information denial  system and little is ever known of such issues till much later  when comment becomes redundant.    However, in the present circumstances, there is need to  quantify the American General's visit as it comes at a time when  there has been no change in Washington's policy towards  Islamabad. Although Pakistan just escaped by a hair's breadth  from being put on the black list of the states accused of aiding  terrorism, it is still in a grey area, a kind of a limbo, as far  as relations with America are concerned. None of the stringent  curbs imposed as a result of the Pressler amendment have been  lifted, nor has the State Department relented from raising the  bogey of nuclear weapons, supposedly stashed away in Pakistan.  To all intents and purposes, this country remains out in the  cold waiting with consummate patience to be returned to the good  graces of the United States.    Against this background, General Hoar's visit arouses even  greater curiosity that needs to be cleared away. As Pakistan is  no longer the recipient of any kind of American military aid nor  any of the security pacts are operative that once linked the two  states, it is intriguing why should the General be here so often  and under what sort of understanding the joint US-Pak military  exercises are being held. These two queries must also be seen  in the light of Islamabad's increasing concern over the apparent  American leniency towards India on the nuclear issue and its  hardline policy towards Pakistan. It makes no sense that  Islamabad should remain involved in a bizarre love hate linkage  with Washington, which neither holds any gilt-edged guarantee of  better times ahead nor allows taking up other options.    This policy has been pursued by all the governments after  the  bonanza of American munificence resulting from the "Afghan  jehad" gradually dried up. Even the Nawaz Sharif regime, which  made a fetish of its self-proclaimed "independent" policy and  doing away with the "crutches" of aid, never really got out of  this Catch-22 situation. General Hoar was then just as much a  regular visitor as now. In fact no government has ever thought  of charting out a brave new policy or will do so, specially in  the present unipolar world. It is quite likely the vague policy  of waiting for America to issue us a certificate of fitness,  after Islamabad has done its best to clear away the doubts, will  continue.</p>

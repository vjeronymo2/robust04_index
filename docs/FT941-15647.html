			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Three consortia seek to dial into Italian mobile network: The race to win liberalised phone market licence So popular has cellular telecommunications become in Italy that many fashion houses are producing snappy designer pouches to hold the growing number of phones in circulation. The state airline, Alitalia, has started warning against the use of phones on its flights. But this only provokes the same cravings as the ban on smoking: as soon as the doors open dozens light up or start pushing buttons. But cellular telephony is more than just a fad in Italy, whatever the national propensity to follow fashion. As elsewhere in Europe, the ability to make calls on the move has become a valuable business tool. The division of responsibilities between the political capital in Rome and the business centre in Milan means managers are often in transit. In a country where ownership of a second, or even third, holiday home is not just a luxury for the ultra-rich, access to a mobile phone can also represent a saving compared with paying charges for a fixed line, which may be used only occasionally. The merits of the mobile phone are now so widely perceived that Italy has become Europe's third-biggest market, with more than 1.1m subscribers. That is still behind the UK - the biggest user of mobile telecommunications, thanks to a relatively early start - but not far behind Germany, considering the latter's bigger population. For the companies jockeying to win the licence to run Italy's new Europe-wide GSM standard network, the hope is that such sharp growth will continue. Mr Tommaso Pompei, managing director of Pronto Italia, one of the bidders, predicts subscribers will rise more than six-fold to about 8m by the turn of the century. Pronto Italia is one of three consortia putting the finishing touches to their proposals before the pre-qualification deadline on Saturday. The others are Unitel, composed of Fiat, Fininvest and Vodafone of the UK; and Omnitel, comprising Olivetti, Swedish Telecom, BellAtlantic, Cellular Communications and Lehman Brothers. All three have been slightly taken aback by the speed with which Italy is moving to liberalise its mobile telecommunications market after months of false starts. Hitherto monopolised by the state-controlled Sip telephones utility, the market is being opened up after pressure from the European Commission in Brussels to meet European Union commitments on greater competition. After paying lip service in the past, matters have moved forward fast under the government of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. The post and telecommunications ministry has 15 days after the first deadline on Saturday to name companies meeting its pre-qualification criteria. Although no timetable has been set after that and matters could slip because of uncertainty surrounding new elections, expected in March, a winner should be revealed by the end of April. The race has already produced some surprises. This week, Etra, one of the bidding consortia, comprising subsidiaries of the big Eni energy and chemicals group, Premafin, BellSouth and Millicom, said it was throwing in its lot with Unitel, reducing the competition to a three-cornered fight. Though that may have put Unitel in pole position, its two rivals are not giving up. Mr Francesco Caio, Omnitel's chairman, says his consortium is the only one to include a company - Olivetti - which sees telecommunications and information technology services as core businesses. Having Swedish Telcom, recently renamed Telia, on board adds a partner with a strong record from the country with the highest per capita penetration of mobile phones, he adds. Perhaps reacting to lingering doubts about its precise composition, which has yet to be revealed, Pronto Italia also stresses the experience of its members. Mannesmann and Pacific Telesis, the two foreign partners, won the mandate to operate Germany's GSM network, which has signed up 500,000 subscribers within 18 months of opening. There is still some confusion about the other partners, however. Mr Pompei says the remainder, comprising about 15 medium-sized Italian companies, will only be revealed next week. All three consortiums, which are expected easily to fulfil the pre-qualification criteria, point to their financial muscle. Omnitel, in which Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, has 8 per cent, is raising its capital to L200bn (Pounds 78m). Unitel is also planning a big rights issue, opening the way for the entry of the Etra consortium members. Pronto Italia, meanwhile, notes that its shareholders include some big banks. Access to capital will be as important as having the right technology on tap. Both Unitel and Omnitel have so far spent about L7bn just on preliminary studies and market research. Pronto Italia, advised by SG Warburg, the UK merchant bank, claims to have got through about L35bn. Mr Nicolo Nefri, Unitel's chairman, confidently draws attention to the combination of Fiat's industrial might with the marketing skills of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest group. The arrival of the Etra partners should further enhance Unitel's image. Olivetti, the main partner in Omnitel, has been pitching all out for the business. With revenues from hardware in decline, it knows it must move into services to maintain profitability, while distinctions between computers and telecommunications are tending to blur. The winner is unlikely to be known until after the elections. However, with such powerful corporate forces at play, some cynics are already predicting the mandate may eventually be awarded jointly to Unitel and Omnitel, which would then join forces to run the new network together.</p>

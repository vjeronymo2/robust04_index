			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Industry and unions urge initiatives as car sales fall NEW CAR sales in the UK dropped to a nine-year low in 1991, motor industry figures confirmed yesterday. The 20.74 per cent drop to 1.59m units, described as 'extremely serious' by Sir Hal Miller, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, prompted opposition and union calls for urgent government action to stimulate the economy. With SMMT statistics showing the commercial vehicle industry to have been even harder hit - sales fell 28.78 per cent, to 209,021, compared with 1990  -Mr Gordon Brown, shadow industry secretary, called for 'a new manufacturing investment incentive and direct action on training and jobs to bring about economic recovery.' His call came on the eve of an ambitious attempt to address the long-term problems of the engineering industry through initiatives backed by companies, institutions, unions and government. It will be launched today by the National Economic Development Council. The initiative - led by Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEU engineering union, and Mr Ian Gibson, chairman of Nissan UK - aims to tackle factors which have contributed to the poor performance of UK engineering over the past decade. A report to today's NEDC meeting, chaired by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, says a 'vigorous marketing exercise is needed to ensure that all firms in the industry are aware of the best manufacturing technologies and how the apply them'. It recommends drawing on the experience of a small number of UK engineering companies which have made the transition to new manufacturing methods. The report adds that defence contractors need help to move into new markets. The NEDC Engineering Sector Group will launch a project to identify product and technology gaps in the supply chains of the three lead sectors of motor vehicles, defence/aerospace and capital plant. The report sees a need to 'close the skills gap and to improve the supply infrastructure which serves the whole industry.' It says too many of the 130,000 managers in the industry lack the skills and understanding necessary to compete in world markets, and points to deficient education and training among foremen and supervisors.

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Powell Duffryn calls for Pounds 71m - Expansion of ports activities proposed as profits reach Pounds 17m Powell Duffryn is proposing to raise Pounds 70.7m net of expenses via a rights issue, to fund the acquisition of the shares it does not own in Teesside Holdings and Humberside Holdings. The specialist engineering, distribution and storage company said the acquisition would fit in with the corporate strategy of expanding its ports activities. Teesside Holdings, which owns Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority, is owned by a consortium of Powell Duffryn, 3i Group and Humberside Holdings. Humberside is owned equally by Powell Duffryn and the family of Mr John Holloway, chief executive of Teesside and a director of Humberside. The 1-for-4 issue of 16.6m new ordinary shares is priced at 440p and has been underwritten by SG Warburg. The share price yesterday closed 25p down at 517p. Powell Duffryn is planning a total investment of Pounds 98.4m, including an offer of Pounds 8.6m for the employees' 5 per cent holding in Teesside. Mr Bill Andrews, chief executive, said about 350 employees were shareholders and, if they accepted a cash offer of Pounds 18.17 a share, the maximum any individual would receive would be about Pounds 60,000 before tax. The group is planning to pay Pounds 82.3m for the acquisitions, of which Pounds 12m is in the form of loan notes, Pounds 7.5m in Powell Duffryn shares and the balance in cash. In addition, the vendors of Humberside will receive a cash dividend of Pounds 7.5m. The rights issue and acquisitions are subject to shareholder approval and an extraordinary general meeting will be held on December 29. Powell Duffryn said its investment, made in early 1992, had been 'extremely successful'. Teesside made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 13.6m in the year to end-March. Humberside Holdings, which runs services at east coast ports including Immingham, Hull and Grimsby, made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 6.7m in the year to end-March. Mr David Hubbard, chairman, said pro-forma gearing after the rights issue would be about 30 per cent, which he described as 'very comfortable'. The group also announced an advance in pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 17m on turnover up by Pounds 8.8m to Pounds 354m for the six months to end-September. The pre-tax outcome, however, included a profit of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 5.7m deficit) from discontinued activities. The interest charge was cut to Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 2.6m) and earnings came out at 17.8p (8.2p) - or 15p (14.1p) excluding exceptionals. The interim dividend is being raised to 8p (6.6p). Mr Hubbard said: 'With some exceptions, trading throughout the group continues to show the benefits of the steady improvement now evident in the UK and US economies.'</p>

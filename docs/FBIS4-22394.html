They considered drafts of a number of decrees submitted as  legislative initiatives with the corresponding generalizations  by chairmen of parliamentary commissions. In particular, the  Presidium decided to propose for discussion at the regular  three-day parliamentary session questions on making additions to  the Supreme Council Decree "On Holidays and Memorial Days of the  Republic of Armenia" and declaring 7 April to be a nonworking  day for the celebration of maternity and beauty.

Additionally, the Presidium considered it expedient to  place on the agenda the question of the rules for adoption of  the Constitution of the Republic of Armenia. Having raised the  question of the legally established elections of two members of  the board of the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia, the  Supreme Council Presidium by a secret vote elected candidates  from those submitted by the Commission on Financial-Tax and  Budget Questions of the Supreme Council of the Republic of  Armenia and approved Vardan Bostandzhyan as a member of the  board of the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia.    At the session they also discussed the question of the  studies conducted by the Supreme Council Commission on Questions  of Economic Independence and Development of the Economy in the  System of the Ministry of Light Industry of the Republic of  Armenia. In this connection the chairman of the commission,  Ruben Torosyan, familiarized the Supreme Council Presidium with  the conclusions presented by the work group created for the  purpose of studying complaints directed against parliament and,  on behalf of the commission, suggested raising for discussion of  the Supreme Council the draft of the corresponding decree.    Clarifications were also presented at the meeting by the  Minister of Light Industry of the Republic of Armenia Rudolf  Teymurazyan. After debating this issue and reaching a positive  evaluation, the Presidium decreed that the question of reviewing  R. Teymurazyan's appointment to the position of minister of  light industry of the Republic of Armenia be placed on the  overall agenda.    Then a report on the course of the fulfillment of the  instructions given by decrees of the Supreme Council to the  government and permanent commissions of parliament was presented  by the secretary of the Supreme Council, Varazdat Avoyan. The  Supreme Council Presidium adopted a decree regarding this issue  as well.    Discussing the question of the report from the government of  the Republic of Armenia in connection with implementation of the  program for socioeconomic development of the Republic of Armenia  in 1993, the Supreme Council Presidium decreed that it be  suggested to the government of the Republic of Armenia that it  present the corresponding report to the Supreme Council before 1  June of this year.</p>

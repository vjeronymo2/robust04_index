			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Burnfield raising Pounds 7.6m for acquisition BURNFIELD, the acquisition vehicle of Mr Brian McGowan, former chief executive of Williams Holdings, has bought the privately-owned Budenberg Gauge Company for Pounds 8m. The consideration will be satisfied by the issue of 4.3m new ordinary shares, of which 4.1m have been placed with institutions to raise Pounds 7.59m, subject to clawback on the basis of one for every 3.5 shares held. Net assets of Budenberg, a manufacturer of pressure gauges and testing equipment, amounted to Pounds 5.9m before taking into account the valuation of the freehold properties. It also has Pounds 500,000 cash. Its three directors, who are brothers, are retiring. They will take 200,000 of the new Burnfield shares and Pounds 7.59m in cash. Mr McGowan described them as Cambridge academics who had not managed their company as aggressively as they might. Burnfield was created in September 1990 out of Isopad, a surface heating system maker, as a holding company to purchase businesses. Budenberg will bring Burnfield's assets to Pounds 15m, with a little less than Pounds 1m of debt. 'We are not in the business of getting geared up. Those that do often go bust,' Mr McGowan said. He added that the acquisition of Budenberg, at a price approximating to net asset value, showed that there were many good opportunities to buy companies. Earlier this month Burnfield announced a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2m to Pounds 1.4m, before exceptional items, for the 11 months to December.</p>

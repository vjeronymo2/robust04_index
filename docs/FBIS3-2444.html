			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Chang Sheng-tai (1728 5110 </F> 1486) ]    [Text] The portion of the work report made by mainland  premier Li Peng on foreign affairs was smaller compared to  previous years in terms of length and number of characters. The  highlighted keynote was still that China wishes to have a  peaceful environment to promote economic development. As to  bilateral relations with other countries, special emphasis was  laid on diplomacy with the United States, indicating the  latter's importance to China. But he made no mention of  relations with Britain. To counter the "China threat theory"  discussed by foreign media in recent years, the work report made  a point of creating a "peace-loving" image of the CPC.    The portion of Li Peng's report on diplomatic work is under  1,300 characters, shorter than those of previous years, which  devoted nearly 2,000 characters to this topic. Therefore,  almost all the topics that were given much space in previous  years were mentioned only briefly this time. Also, there was  not much originality, but much of the same old tune. On the  overall international situation, Li Peng first highlighted that  the world is moving toward multipolarization and that hegemonism  and power politics still exist. This has been a consistent  viewpoint held by the CPC authorities in recent years on the  post-cold-war period, especially after the Gulf War in 1991.  But Li Peng made a special point that the economy is becoming a  dominant factor which influences the development of  international relations.    On the topic of bilateral relations with other countries,  apart from the Sino-U.S. relations that took up quite some  space, all other relations were mentioned briefly with such  wording as "the relations made progress" and "the friendly and  cooperative relations gained further development." Last year,  China devoted much space to emphasizing the importance of  improving relations with surrounding countries, but the  treatment of this topic in this year's report simply cannot be  compared. Besides, the part on the Third World, which China  used to set great store by, was almost completely left out this  time. On the front of diplomacy with West Europe, Sino- German  relations have obviously become China's focus in its Europe  diplomacy and in the meantime, France's restoring friendship  with Beijing was also praised.    In last year's report, when talking about relations with the  United States, Li Peng only emphasized the importance of  observing three communiques, saying that it would lead to the  improvement of bilateral relations. This year's report, besides  repeating this idea, held Deng Xiaoping's 16-character  statement, i.e. "increasing trust, reducing trouble, developing  cooperation, and refraining from confrontation," as the standard  and emphasized the importance to have in mind the whole world  and the 21st century. This shows that the two sides restored  their relations after mainland President Jiang Zemin and U.S.  President Clinton met each other last year, and that China needs  the U.S. market, technology, and cooperation in security affairs.    Unlike previous years, in the final two parts on China's  role  in the United Nations and China's opinion on international  issues, Li Peng strongly expressed the hope for peace and  refuted the "China threat theory." Li Peng said: China stands  for overall prohibition of nuclear weapons and the conclusion of  agreements on banning all nuclear tests through negotiations.  China does not engage in the arms race, does not join any  military bloc, and does not seek its sphere of influence. He  also emphasized that since there are many differences between  countries, the relations between any two countries should be  built on generally recognized norms of international relations.  China is against hegemony. It does not seek hegemony now and  will not do so after its economy is developed. It will not pose  a threat to the world and the region. This effort to create a  "peace-loving" image indicates that China's diplomatic policies  in the coming years will serve its economic construction.</p>

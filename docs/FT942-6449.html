			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Arts: Openings Holland Festival Riccardo Chially is the conductor of a new production of Verdi's Falstaff, which should set the Holland Festival off to a sparkling start on Wednesday. The festival is based in Amsterdam and lasts for the month of June. Falstaff apart, there are several themes this year, including new music written in China since the end of the Cultural Revolution - a generally unknown quantity, advertised as 'expressive, theatrical, exotic'. Dance and theatre events, led by Merce Cunningham and Peter Brook, support the main music programme. Royal Academy Summer Show Once it signalled the start of the London season and it remains a social event of a very English sort. The Summer Show, in which members of the public are invited to contribute up to three works of art for exhibition alongside Royal Academicians, has been held annually since 1769. This year there were 13,000 entries - paintings, sculpture and architectural designs. A final 1,300, among them The Bathers by Bill Jacklin RA, were selected. After a week of private views and parties, the exhibition opens on Sunday. Royal Ballet Marking its return to Covent Garden after its American tour, the Royal Ballet revives Anthony Dowell's production of Don Quixote. Sylvie Guillem is, according to our dance critic Clement Crisp, 'trapped aboard this Titanic of the dance: she may have the wit to find the only life-belt.' Performances, all with Mlle Guillem, tonight, Wednesday and Saturday. Ballet-lovers in New York will be at the State Theater for New York City Ballet. Tonight in Paris, the Opera Bastille hosts the wonderful La Bayadere. Jazz The spirit of carnival and tropical Bahia comes to London on Wednesday when the original Tropicalia musicians, Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso, are reunited for the first time in 20 years at the Royal Albert Hall. Joined by Gal Costa and Caetano's sister Maria Bethania, the Doces Barbados (the four great Bahians) will perform alongside the 50 drummers and dancers of the Mangueira school of Samba in an exciting climax to the Brazilian Contemporary Arts 'Festival of Bahia'. Bonn Opera One of the most unusual operatic premieres of the season takes place on Sunday when the Bonn Opera stages Il Guarany, a four-act opera-ballet by Brazilian composer Antonio Carlos Gomes. Based on a love story about the Guarani Indians, it was first performed at La Scala in 1870. Long forgotten outside Brazil, it owes its revival to Placido Domingo who sings the title role. The producer is Werner Herzog, of Fitzcarraldo fame.</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Battle of soap powder giants gets even dirtier Blue and red striped boxer shorts yesterday became the latest weapon in the fierce battle between the world's soap giants. Procter &amp; Gamble, the US manufacturer, claimed that one pair of underpants, faded and shredded to the point of indecency, had disintegrated during repeated washing in the new soap powder launched by its bitter rival Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group. According to P&amp;G, tests by research institutes show that clothes are damaged by washing in Unilever's Persil Power. P&amp;G yesterday circulated some of the institutes' reports and distributed colour photographs contrasting the tattered state of clothes washed in its rival's powder with the pristine, crisp state of those washed in its own. P&amp;G later admitted the photographs were not from the research institutes but from its own tests. 'There was no intention to mislead in supplying the photos together with the institutes' reports,' it said last night. Unilever rejected P&amp;G's claims. It said its own tests, carried out at one of the research institutes quoted by P&amp;G, had shown no damage. On Friday, Unilever dropped a Dutch court case against P&amp;G for making 'untruthful and misleading statements' about the properties of its new detergent, which is sold as Omo Power in Continental markets. Unilever acknowledged that its new generation washing powder could damage clothing under 'extreme laboratory conditions'. P&amp;G also claimed yesterday that clothes washed in Persil Power might continue to fray even if consumers switched to a different soap brand, because manganese residues from the powder, included to aid washing, had built up on the fabric and remained 'active'. Yesterday in Rotterdam, Unilever said: 'In the huge number of articles of clothing washed in field trials there was no systematic build-up of manganese residue. Moreover, even if there is manganese left on the clothing, it does not later become reactivated.' Independent institutes in France, Germany the Netherlands and the UK had confirmed these results, it said. P&amp;G's claims are based on reports from six European research institutes. According to P&amp;G, the institutes, which tested clothes under normal household conditions and followed the clothing manufacturers' instructions, all reached 'similar conclusions'. It quoted the British Textile Technology Group, based in Manchester, as concluding that 'Persil Power results in fabric damage which would be unacceptable to a consumer'. The EMPA Institute for Material Testing and Research in Switzerland found 'strong to very strong weakening of the cotton fibres' after up to 25 washes in Persil Power, P&amp;G said. It also quoted a Dutch study last week as saying 'the use of Omo Power under domestic washing conditions appears to result in extreme fabric damage on some consumer garments making them unfit for use'. Mr Andrew Seth, chief executive of Lever Brothers UK, said yesterday: 'It is always possible in laboratories to choose test conditions which will give you the results that you plan to get.' The temperature of the wash, the type of garment and its colouring, and the level of soiling all affected the results, he said. 'I am not saying that (P&amp;G's) data is inaccurate, just that it's irrelevant,' he said. In separate tests conducted by BTTG, Unilever had been assured that 'after repeated washing . . . no physical damage was visible'. He also cited tests by the UK's Fabric Care Association which concluded 'essentially we see no evidence of visually apparent damage after 25 washes'. He said Persil Power had been used in 60,000 homes and in 3m washes since it went on sale in Europe and there had been 'a minuscule number of complaints  -fewer than 10'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Moscow Shows Firm Stance Against Pyongyang's Nuclear </F> Ambitions"--YONHAP headline]    [Text] Moscow, April 30 (YONHAP) -- With South Korean  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae's ongoing visit to Moscow helping  to cement bilateral military ties, Seoul seems satisfied with  the results of a meeting Friday between Yi and his Russian  counterpart Pavel Grachev that showed Russia's firm opposition  to Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions.    The fact that the two ministers discussed expanding  bilateral  military cooperation and the North Korean nuclear issue alone  deserves attention, Western diplomats here say.    Pyongyang, which still maintains a military alliance with  Moscow, will likely feel pressure from the meeting where it was  agreed that North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program must  be stopped because it could threaten world peace as well as  security in Northeast Asia.    Yi, the first South Korean defense minister to visit Moscow,  said the meeting has paved the way for enhanced military links  between the two countries.    Seoul and Moscow maintained unofficial military ties before  1992, when Grachev and his South Korean counterpart signed an  accord on bilateral military relations. Grachev, at the time,  was accompanying Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Seoul for a  summit meeting.    In line with the accord, Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff, visited Moscow and naval ships from the two  countries made friendly return calls last year.    The accord signed Friday, the second of its kind, calls for  only two exchanges of military personnel, giving the impression  that it carries no more importance than the 1992 pact.    Military experts, however, view the second accord as being  considerably more important because it calls for visits to Seoul  by Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff, and Defense  Minister Grachev this fall and next year, respectively.    During Friday's meeting, the two ministers agreed on another  treaty which calls for the two navies to provide ships to rescue  stranded vessels from their countries. The treaty will be  signed formally in early June when South Korean President Kim  Yong-sam makes a state visit to Russia.    Meanwhile, Moscow seems intent on maintaining military ties  "to a certain extent" with Pyongyang, its traditional communist  ally since the era of the former Soviet Union, in an effort to  retain some influence over Pyongyang. A senior official from  the Russian Defense Ministry visited Pyongyang last December to  sign a memorandum on bilateral military exchanges, demonstrating  Moscow's desire to maintain defense ties with Pyongyang, western  diplomats said. Moreover, a group within the Russian military  is still calling for an undiluted relationship with the  kremlin's old ally.    They also argue that Moscow wishes to preserve and improve  diplomatic, economic and military ties with Pyongyang, which  have been strained since it normalized relations with Seoul. In  their view, Moscow is apparently trying to strike a balance  between Seoul and Pyongyang.    However, it was a surprise that South Korean Defense  Minister  Yi told reporters that the meeting's agenda did not include the  purchase of Russian weapons and the transfer of arms production  technology. Yi's remark was unexpected given that Moscow has  already delivered to Seoul a list of state-of-the-art Russian  arms that could be provided to repay past South Korean loans.    Moscow has also taken an aggressive line toward establishing  a South Korea-Russia joint venture to produce arms with Russian  technology and South Korean capital and marketing expertise.    Military experts believe the Korean side did not want to  address the issues of arms joint ventures and Russian weapons  transfers in exchange for loans, even though the Russians wanted  to discuss the matters. Instead, the issues can be dealt with  during a meeting of the Korea-Russia Economic Cooperation  Committee slated for May, they say.</p>

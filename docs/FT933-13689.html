			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Miyazawa set to lose majority: Ruling LDP leader denies suggestion of VAT rise in run-up to poll JAPANESE politicians have taken to the streets for their final pleas to voters before tomorrow's general election, which is expected to leave the ruling Liberal Democratic party without a majority and struggling to find a coalition partner. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, entered the final day of the campaign with a cabinet popularity rating of 10.3 per cent. Campaigning in Hiroshima yesterday, he was forced to disown an ill-timed suggestion that an increase in an unpopular value added tax might be necessary. Other LDP officials, aware that talk of lifting the 3 per cent tax could be a vote-loser, insisted there would be no need for an increase after the election and said the greatest threat to the economy's health was political instability. A survey of executives released yesterday by the Japan Association of Corporate Executives found that the appreciation of the yen and the fall of Mr Miyazawa's government have prompted more business people to expect a delay in economic recovery. Three months ago, 17 per cent of the executives surveyed thought the recovery would not come until next year or later, but the figure is now 29 per cent. The association found that member executives, on average, expect economic growth of 1.8 per cent in the year to March 1994 against a figure of 2.18 per cent three months ago. Japanese executives have generally supported calls for political reform, but there are concerns that the election will be inconclusive, creating a year or more of political instability and hindering the introduction of a stimulatory spending package. An opinion poll released yesterday by Jiji, the Japanese news agency, suggested that 38.2 per cent of respondents favoured a post-election coalition government led by the LDP, while 25.7 per cent preferred a coalition containing newer groups such as the Japan Renewal party and the Japan New party. These results contrasted with the 25.6 per cent of voters who said they would support the LDP tomorrow, down from 31.9 per cent in a similar survey taken a month ago by the same agency, and a sign that the polished performance by Mr Miyazawa at the Group of Seven summit earlier this month was not enough to satisfy voters. In spite of his cabinet's unpopularity, Mr Miyazawa was confident yesterday he would win another term as prime minister. His fate is likely to be decided by the voting patterns revealed tomorrow evening. What the voters think, Page 4</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries improve on benign inflation data US bonds finished with modest gains yesterday in a tentative response to a benign reading on consumer price inflation. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  3/8 higher at 97 27/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.678 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was  1/16 better at 99 27/32 , to yield 6.317 per cent. In spite of the positive ending, the session revealed the depth of the market's pessimism in the wake of Friday's news that producer prices are rising at a much faster pace than previously supposed. With traders braced for more bad news yesterday morning, the Labor Department announced that the August consumer price index had risen 0.3 per cent from the previous month, a little less than the consensus forecast of a 0.4 per cent increase. The 'core' rate, which excludes the more volatile energy and food sectors, showed a 0.3 per cent gain, matching expectations. The lower than expected result lent credence to a scenario which sees the Federal Reserve waiting until November before lifting short-term interest rates again. That development was enough to allow bonds across the board make an early move forward. Dealers rushed in to cover positions which had been set up on the expectation of a more unsettling reading and a subsequent sell-off. But despite the favourable outlook on rates, traders were not completely convinced that inflationary pressures in the economy were contained. Many were having second thoughts, especially after the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta revealed a moderate increase in the prices-paid component of its monthly survey on business conditions. As a result, bonds zig-zagged several times during the session. In the end, prices were up across the board, though the gains may prove short-lived. The market has to face several important economic reports, including retail sales and industrial production, due out later in the week. UK gilts edged higher yesterday as favourable figures for US inflation lifted European markets. The long end was also supported by hopes that today's spate of UK data, which includes inflation figures for August, would be favourable for the market. Meanwhile, analysts were digesting the implications of Monday's rise in UK base rates. Mr Michael Pratten at Kidder Peabody said the UK rate rise had increased credibility in the government's anti-inflationary stance. 'But the market is still worried as to whether the government will take any more necessary action on interest rates,' he said. Mr Michael Saunders at Salomon Brothers said there may be a narrowing of the yield spread over bunds: 'The UK's inflationary outlook is good and the policymakers are doing the right thing.' The yield spread between gilts and bunds widened from about 135 basis points on Monday to around 138 yesterday. On Liffe, the December long gilt future fell to 99 9/32 before rallying to 100 5/32 , up  3/16 points on the day. German bunds built on Monday's gains but analysts said the market remained concerned about supply and the outcome of next month's federal elections. The Bundesbank is believed to want to raise between DM8bn and DM10bn when it holds an auction of 10-year paper next week. The poor showing by the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the governing coalition, in last weekend's elections in two east German states revived investors' awareness that a victory for Chancellor Helmut Kohl was not a foregone conclusion. Analysts said that hopes in some quarters of the market that the Bundesbank could announce a marginal cut of around five basis points in the repo rate after its meeting on Thursday were unlikely to be realised. On Liffe, the December bund future rose 0.20 points to 89.20 in moderate trading. Better supply and receding fears about an early presidential election supported French government bonds. On the Matif, the notional bond future rose 0.14 to 112.30. Some analysts expect the spread between bunds and OATs to break below the current level of around 50 basis points in the run-up to the German election. Canadian bonds rose on the back of the stronger than expected showing by the Liberal party in a provincial election, which calmed fears that Quebec would separate from Canada. 'The market thinks there is no mandate for a referendum now,' said Mr Simon Maggs at UBS. Yields at the short end fell 30 basis points to 7.70 per cent in early trading, and 10-year bond yields fell 15 basis points to 9.03 per cent.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / UK in arms supply talks with Kuwait BRITAIN is negotiating with Kuwait to supply it with a range of light armoured vehicles, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, said yesterday, Reuter reports from London. Mr Rifkind said that the Ministry of Defence was handling talks with the Kuwaiti authorities about Warrior and Piranha armoured fighting vehicles made by GKN, the British engineering company. The negotiations follow disappointment in Britain that Kuwait had chosen American-designed M1A tanks rather than the British Challenger II in the wake of the Gulf war with Iraq. Mr Rifkind said that Britain's share of the world market for vehicles in the Warrior and Piranha class had risen to 20 per cent from 17 per cent in the past year.</p>

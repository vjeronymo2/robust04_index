			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 9 (XINHUA) -- A grand performance  staged by three Indian troupes here this evening marked the  opening of the two-month Indian Culture Festival.    The festival is expected to be held in 16 Chinese cities.  Indian performances, exhibitions and a movie festival will be  held in cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing and  Guangzhou.    The Indian Government will dispatch seven cultural  delegations to China to participate in the festival.    Among those present at today's opening ceremony were Li  Tieying, Chinese State Councillor, Buhe, vice-chairman of the  Chinese National People's Congress Standing Committee, Liu  Zhongde, Chinese culture minister, and Arjun Singh, head of the  culture delegation of the Indian Government and minister of  human resources development.    They also lighted lamps, an Indian version of cutting the  ribbon, to open the festival.    This is the first time for China to sponsor such a  large-scale foreign culture festival since the founding of the  country in 1949.    The premiers of the two countries decided to exchange  culture  festivals when Chinese Premier Li Peng visited India in 1991,  and the decision was contained in the Sino-Indian Joint  Communique issued at that time.    A 45-day Chinese Culture Festival was successfully held in  11  Indian cities in late 1992.</p>

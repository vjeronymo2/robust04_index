			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> RAMS' MAJOR PROBLEM MAY BE INEFFECTIVE RUNNING GAME  </P> <P> The other day, when Coach Buddy Ryan of the Philadelphia Eagles was talking  about the 1988 Washington Redskins, he could have meant the 1989 Rams.  </P> <P> "(The Redskins) didn't have a running game last year, and that really hurt  their defensive team," Ryan said.  </P> <P> "You can't control the ball without a running game. When you can't make first  downs, you've got to punt it, and that keeps piling more pressure on your  defense."  </P> <P> For the Rams Sunday, that's what went wrong in the New Orleans game.  </P> <P> In the aftermath of their two-game losing streak, the focus this week has been  on the Rams' pass-defense deficiencies.  </P> <P> But it's more likely that the real problem is their ineffective running attack.  </P> <P> The Saints largely ignored running back Greg Bell and went after quarterback  Jim Everett vigorously, knocking him around and jarring the Ram pass offense  off stride.  </P> <P> The same things had happened in the Monday night game at Buffalo, where Bell  didn't run far, either.  </P> <P> That stopped the Ram offense, putting the ball in the hands of the Bills, who  wore down the Ram defense.  </P> <P> With the kind of blockers they have, this has been another season in which the  Rams have been productive running Bell against mediocre defenses but not  against top defenses.  </P> <P> And the irony, of course, is that their coach, John Robinson, is a running-play  expert.  </P> <P> In recent years, Robinson has also come to realize that you can't run your way  to the Super Bowl, and so, now, he is stressing the pass.  </P> <P> Which may not leave time enough to polish the student body right in the old  way.  </P> <P> Thus, the Rams' crying need is for a running back who can burst through for  important yardage on fake-pass plays when the defense overloads against  Everett.  </P> <P> Getting Gaston Green in the Eric Dickerson trade didn't do it.  </P> <P> On a typical day of NFL football, 12 of last Sunday's 13 winners were the teams  that outgained the other side on the ground.  </P> <P> The only good running team that lost to a passer was Seattle. And Denver won  that one when, on a Seahawk field-goal try, the snapper snapped the ball into  the holder's head when the holder wasn't looking.  </P> <P> Quarterback Steve DeBerg, who passed for 237 yards as Kansas City defeated  Dallas, 36-28, said the difference in his game was running back Christian  Okoye.  </P> <P> "Dallas looked at him on every down, and that opened up the passing game,"  DeBerg said.  </P> <P> After winning, most NFL quarterbacks say as much, or think as much.  </P> <P> All five of the league's leading ground-gainers Sunday played on winning teams.  </P> <P> Only three of the top five passers won.  </P> <P> Running problems this year are bringing down, among others, the AFC champion  Cincinnati Bengals. The Bengals (4-3) still have passer Boomer Esiason, but  they lost their running game when they lost Ickey Woods to injury.  </P> <P> In the NFC, Minnesota just gave up half the farm for a running back, Herschel  Walker.  </P> <P> "You win with the pass -- but if you can't run, you can't pass," said George  Young, general manager of the New York Giants.  </P> <P> That's the NFL today.  </P> <P> The Washington Redskins are coming into the Coliseum Sunday with one of the  NFL's best running teams, having outgained Tampa Bay on the ground last week,  179 yards to 1.  </P> <P> But this time, the Raiders will have a shot against an Eastern contender,  because Washington has lost its most valuable defensive player, cornerback  Darrell Green, who was injured in the second half of the Buccaneer game.  </P> <P> Even with Green this year, the Redskins were having defensive troubles. Without  him, they gave up three touchdown passes to Tampa Bay in the fourth quarter as  Buccaneer quarterback Vinny Testaverde came close at the end, 32-28.  </P> <P> "I think (Green's injury) helped us out," Testaverde said. "He's a great  player."  </P> <P> From Philadelphia, here's Ryan on the Redskins:  </P> <P> "What they do is, they go out and get the best people money can buy. Wilber  Marshall is the best outside right linebacker in the league.  </P> <P> "The Redskins go out and they got one of the best offensive tackles in the  league last year, Jim Lachey.  </P> <P> "This year, they go out and get two experienced, excellent running backs,  Earnest Byner and Gerald Riggs.  </P> <P> "They get proven, quality players who know how to play the pro game, so that  makes them tough."  </P> <P> Testaverde's improvement in his third pro season is one of the stories of the  year.  </P> <P> It was Testaverde who earlier this month put the Chicago Bears into their  three-game slide, and, otherwise, his interceptions are down and his touchdown  passes up for a club that was surprisingly batting .500 last week going into  Washington.  </P> <P> "I feel like I'm more of a quarterback now than the thrower I was last year,"  Testaverde said.  </P> <P> "I throw the ball low or away when I have to, rather than force it.  </P> <P> "When I'm sacked, I (usually) hold the ball. Last year, I threw it and it got  intercepted."  </P> <P> With some experience, that's what they all say.  </P> <P> "When Vinny matures a little more, we'll have a great quarterback," Tampa Bay  owner Hugh Culverhouse said.  </P> <P> The Minnesota Vikings, not long ago, were two games behind the Bears. Today,  contemplating the Giants in one of the big Monday night games of the year next  week, the 5-2 Vikings are one up on the Bears in their division, and only one  behind the flying Giants in the NFC.  </P> <P> And their coach, Jerry Burns, has one explanation.  </P> <P> "We've got two winning quarterbacks," he said, identifying starter Wade Wilson  and backup Tommy Kramer. "That's what it takes."  </P> <P> Wilson is expected to be on the sidelines in the Meadowlands with two screws in  the broken knuckle of his left ring finger, and without him, the Vikings are  less menacing.  </P> <P> Against a team like the Giants, most NFC coaches and scouts, based on their  preseason views, would start Wilson instead of Kramer.  </P> <P> But Minnesota's outspoken players, who will take sides on anything, seem happy  enough with Kramer, who is 2-0 this month after Wilson's 3-2 start.  </P> <P> "We know we can count on Tommy," Pro Bowl receiver Anthony Carter told  Minneapolis reporters. "He gets it going in the huddle. Not taking anything  away from (Wilson), but the guys seem to react a little better to Tommy."  </P> <P> That is an opinion that coincides, more or less, with Kramer's.  </P> <P> "I don't think we lose a thing when I come in," Kramer said. "It's a luxury to  have two quarterbacks."  </P> <P> The San Francisco 49ers also win with two quarterbacks.  </P> <P> Steve Young replaced injured starter Joe Montana at halftime last week and  completed 11 of 12 passes for 188 yards -- more than Montana got -- as the  49ers turned back New England, 37-20.  </P> <P> Said Patriot Coach Raymond Berry: "That's the tremendous strength of their  team, a one-two punch at quarterback."  </P> <P> The Raiders have also used two quarterbacks, with limited success. Jay  Schroeder and Steve Beuerlein are one-two, or two-one.  </P> <P> The Beuerlein-Willie Gault touchdown in Philadelphia Sunday, on a 24-yard pass  into the end zone, was the only really professional play of an unspectacular,  windswept game.  </P> <P> More than ever these days, the Eagles' highly predictable offense is holding  back quarterback Randall Cunningham, who accomplished hardly anything in the  victory over the Raiders.  </P> <P> "We've got to change our philosophy a little bit," Cunningham told reporters  this week. "We're at a point right now where people know what we're doing. I  think we're always coming out to establish the running game."  </P> <P> That's the way it looks, and that's the way Ryan, a conservative, wants it,  perhaps.  </P> <P> But one rule of thumb in football coaching is that the strategy should be  adapted to the personnel. And this year, the Eagles are hardly doing that.  </P> <P> Their offensive coordinator, Ted Plumb, weighs in each week with particularly  uninspired game plans.  </P> <P> They have three assets in Philadelphia -- a superior coach in Ryan and two  great players in Cunningham and defensive end Reggie White -- but a plodding  offense can nullify the best of talent.  </P> <P> Contemplating the score of the Raider game, 10-7, Ryan said: "It doesn't seem  like we played that good."  </P> <P> He was right again.  </P></p>

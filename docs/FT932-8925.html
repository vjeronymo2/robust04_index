			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: SMS reverses into Osprey SHARES IN Osprey Communications, the marketing services and advertising group temporariliy suspended on Thursday at 26p, yesterday jumped 6 1/2 p to 32 1/2 p following news that SMS Communications Group had reversed into it. Osprey will allot 4.5m ordinary shares of 25p and pay Pounds 500,000 in cash to the vendors - a total value of Pounds 1.63m. Osprey is also to launch a rights issue on a 1-for-3 basis to raise Pounds 1.3m net. SMS is headed by Mr Jack Rubins who was previously chairman and chief executive of Dorland, the UK's second biggest advertising agency and a Saatchi &amp; Saatchi subsidiary, and group chairman of McCann-Erickson, the US advertising group. On completion of the current deal, Mr Rubins will become chairman and chief executive of Osprey, replacing Mr John French, who will retire. Furthermore Mr Rubins will have a personal stake of about 21 per cent - and consequently effective control - of the new Osprey. Completion, however, hinges on the successful disposal of Osprey's marketing services side to its management for an initial Pounds 2m cash and a deferred Pounds 200,000 depending on post-tax profits and assets at May 31. Osprey felt the division had not managed sufficient growth in its main tourism and travel markets as a result of the squeeze on client budgets and 'increasingly competitive conditions'. It was expected to make a loss in the current year. Consequently, Osprey needed to revert to its advertising core. Also, it can safely be assumed that Mr Rubins would not want involvement with a company with anything more than negligible gearing. The proceeds of the rights issue and the disposal will all but wipe out Osprey's short-term borrowings and will enable it to pay the cash element of the SMS acquisition. Some 60 per cent of SMS' business in the year to October 1992 derived from its BSkyB billings. It is thought that Mr Rubins would not have reversed into Osprey without assurances from the satellite TV service that the account would stay put. It is thought that BSkyB will account for about 15 per cent of the new Osprey's billings.</p>

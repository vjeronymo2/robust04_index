			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROCK AS IT NEARS 40: RUNNING ON EMPTY?  </P> <P> In his diatribe against rock's "rusty" stars, Hilburn manages to fault the  artists, the fans, record companies and radio programmers.  </P> <P> But wait a minute . . . what seems to be missing from that list? Critics,  perhaps? Specifically, critics who continuously rattle out gushing reviews of  the same old dinosaurs (Tyrannosaurus springsteen) while ignoring newer bands  experimenting with newer rock forms.  </P> <P> Rock has always been a medium that thrives on the energy of youth. Instead of  the next installment of "Dear Bruce," why doesn't Hilburn use the space to  explore the work of young artists, the ones who just might keep rock 'n' roll  from rusting out completely?  </P> <P> DAN MOLITOR  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

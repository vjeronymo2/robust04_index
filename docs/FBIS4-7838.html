			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dragan Cicic: "The Old School"] </F>   [Text] It is believed that Ratko Mladic is a champion  of part of Yugoslavia's military leadership which is using him  to ensure its autonomy from political structures on both sides  of the Drina.    Three weeks ago, during the withdrawal of the Serbian  artillery from the vicinity of Sarajevo, rumors appeared that  General Ratko Mladic's "career was over." The same  sources--people close to the military and political leadership  of the republic of Srpska [RS]--quickly denied their own story.  Few people, however, failed to notice that General Mladic has  been seen less and less often in public, and that his chief of  staff, General Manojlo Milovanovic, is speaking up more and more  often.    In the latter's appearances, a certain "dropping of the  ball"  has been evident, that is, a certain spirit of conciliation that  has underlined Mladic's uncompromising attitude even more. After  all, the acceptance of NATO's ultimatum, wrapped up in the guise  of a Russian diplomatic initiative, had to appear to Mladic like  a personal defeat. On 10 February 1994, he stated to the  newspaper VOJSKA (the Army of Yugoslavia's organ): "As far as I  am concerned, the war will symbolically be over for me when the  Muslims surrender their weapons to me in the same Volunteer  Street (the center of Sarajevo) in which they committed a  disgraceful attack and crime against the former JNA's [Yugoslav  People's Army] military column."  <H5>  Theoretician </H5>   Mladic showed that he had not given up this position just a  few days before the expiration of the ultimatum, when he  suddenly came out with the assertion that the RS army, which had  then already begun to withdraw, would not withdraw.    The episode with the ultimatum, in addition to being a good  illustration of Mladic's attitudes, also indicates the outlines  of the extent of his influence. Specifically, the final  withdrawal could not be started, in spite of Karadzic's  acceptance of the obligation, before Mladic talked with Vitaliy  Churkin in Belgrade in the Federal Assembly's offices on  Thursday, 17 February, three days before the expiration of the  ultimatum. They say that the general was very furious and quite  unpleasant to that emissary, who made it clear to him that he  had to withdraw or suffer very serious consequences. In the end,  however, he had to accept the demand.    Where does Mladic get so much power that international  negotiators' direct contact with this general is essential for  the success of an agreement that has already been accepted by  the RS's political leadership? The fact is that Ratko Mladic is  a legend among the Bosnian Serbs. He began to gain his fame back  during the war in the Krajina by carrying out rapid and harsh  offensive actions. He also used the same approach in pushing  through the corridor that was a sine qua non for the survival of  the RS. There is no doubt that Mladic is a competent officer. He  is considered to be one of the few people in the former JNA who  studied Clausewitz, Sun Tsu Wu, and other theoreticians in  detail. He did not limit himself to just planning operations,  however: He often sat in an armored vehicle himself and led the  attack. With these and similar steps, he succeeded in  establishing himself among the people as "a Serbian officer of  the old school."    Back in Knin he was also inclined toward political  maneuvering, and he continued to follow that course after his  transfer to Bosnia. Many people think that he most used his  influence for political purposes during last year's Bijeljina  session, and then the Pale session, of the RS Assembly, when the  Vance-Owen plan was rejected. At that time Zeljko "Arkan"  Raznjatovic showered Mladic with abuse, accusing him of  "ordering the deputies to reject the plan" accepted by Slobodan  Milosevic and the Serbian leadership.    The fact that all of that did not shake Mladic's position  shows that no matter how skillful he is, this general is not  just acting on his own behalf. Sources close to the RS military  and political leadership claim that Ratko Mladic is actually a  very direct champion of part of the Army of Yugoslavia's  military leadership. According to those sources, Radovan  Karadzic's influence over the RS army is negligible. Allegedly,  through Mladic part of Yugoslavia's military leadership is  ensuring that it keeps considerable autonomy from Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia political structures.    If influential circles in the Army of Yugoslavia really want  to keep at least partial political influence and relative  independence from the civilian authorities, there is nothing  more useful for those purposes than the existence of the war  conflagration in Bosnia. Those circumstances immeasurably  increase the army's importance and ensure that it has influence  over the adoption of political decisions that depend to a great  extent on the assessments offered by military circles.    The downing of the aircraft over Bosnia is introducing new  elements in this story. Although it turned out, according to the  UN's findings, that the four aircraft took off from the Udbina  airport in the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK], it is hard to  believe that it all happened without the RS army's involvement.  <H5>  Airport </H5>   Furthermore, several hours after the aircraft were shot  down,  artillery fire was opened against Tuzla. There was a fierce  response to it, at a time when a political agreement on opening  the Tuzla airport was already on the way. That was later  confirmed in Moscow, once again in spite of Mladic's explicit  opposition. "In connection with the story about intervention,  people are asking me why I did not allow UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] tanks to come to Bosnia and why the Serbian side is  opposing the opening of the Tuzla airport.... But when they land  planes in Tuzla, that will be an open threat against Belgrade as  well! It is a `step by step' occupation," Mladic told VOJSKA.    In spite of everything, however, there are no signs that any  sort of campaign is being started against Mladic. In a way there  is still a sort of balance of power and the conflict is not too  severe. One analyst has described all the recent steps by the RS  that do not follow Milosevic's and Karadzic's policy as "petty  malice." The military structures both here and in the RS will  hardly venture to engage in any more serious confrontation.  Their financial position, in fact, is such that they are  extremely dependent upon the state budget. The bond announced a  month ago for the RS army has allegedly collected 200,000 German  marks. The amount appears large, but it is only enough for a  tank battalion (27 tanks) to operate for two days.    On the other hand, Mladic's popularity and the support of  part of the military establishment are securing his position for  the time being, provided that there is no serious clash with the  Serbian leadership. "Someone will hardly make a decision to  replace Mladic as long as the war is going on," says one person  familiar with the situation in Bosnia.</p>

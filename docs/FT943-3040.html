			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Economic Watch: Dutch unemployment rises Dutch non-seasonally adjusted unemployment rose to an average 470,000 people in June-August from 465,000 in May-July, the Central Bureau of Statistics announced. The bureau said the increase in the number of registered unemployed was normal for the time of year, because of the entry of graduates into the labour market. The quarterly totals have been increasing at a slower rate since hitting a nine-year peak of 520,000 people in the first quarter of 1994. Sweden's consumer price index was unchanged in August from July. Monthly figures brought the year-on-year inflation rate to 2.7 per cent in August, down from 2.9 per cent in July. Finland's underlying rate of inflation rose to 1.4 per cent year-on-year in July from 0.9 per cent in June. Polish consumer prices rose 1.7 per cent in August after a 1.5 per cent rise in July, but year-on-year inflation fell to 32.2 per cent from 32.8 per cent.</p>

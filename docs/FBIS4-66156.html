			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Henrik Wilen: "Nordic Security"] </F>   [Text] The Nordic security policy balance, which was a  well-worn cliche in the days of the Cold War, is only a memory,  and today there is great irresolution in Oslo, Stockholm, and  Helsinki.    In NORDISK KONTAKT's special issue on security Anders Ferm,  the editor in chief of the Malmo newspaper ARBETET, states that  a fog hangs over the development of security policy in Europe,  and that it will not be dispelled for several years to come.    It is no enviable task for Nordic politicians and military  people to try to navigate in this fog. It is true that  initiatives and pointers are presented at regular intervals,  primarily by debaters who cannot directly influence policy  content, but in the absence of clear landmarks the contributions  to the debate often increase the confusion.    The people who are responsible for setting policy lines are  lying low and contenting themselves with noting that as long as  Norway, Sweden, and Finland stand in the European Union (EU)  anteroom the best thing to do is wait and see. And if some of  them venture to discuss security policy in the EU after the  Nordic trio -- or part of it -- joins Denmark in the EU, they  generally make a brief reference to the EU conference in 1996.  <H5>  Security Policy Cooperation? </H5>   As Finland is no longer bound by the VSB [Friendship,  Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance] Pact but, like Sweden and  Norway, has applied for EU membership, proposals on Nordic  security policy and even military cooperation in the future are  presented from time to time. For example, General Bengt  Gustafsson, commander in chief of the Swedish Armed Forces, has  called several times for increased Nordic defense cooperation.  Gustafsson's proposals have not met with much sympathy.    The way things look today, concrete cooperation is  improbable, and even if all three Nordic candidates become EU  members, it is highly unlikely that Finland and Sweden will  become NATO members in the near future. And the basic  constellation will remain, as pointedly expressed by minister  Max Jakobson, among others: Norway has NATO, Sweden has Finland,  and Finland has a mutual border with Russia that is 1,000  kilometers long.    But everything is fluid and a lot can happen in a few years.  After the eventful fall of 1989 the opinions of all foreign and  security policy experts have become suspect, and one analysis is  as good as another. In any case foreign and security policy in  the Nordic countries has undergone a quite revolutionary change  in recent years, and now that the prime ministers have seized  the initiative one cannot rule out the possibility that  cooperation will cover new areas in the future.  <H5>  Russia a Question Mark </H5>   The big question mark in the Nordic security policy debate  is  Russia. The old threat scenarios are no longer relevant, of  course -- not many people include a Russian invasion of any of  the Nordic countries in their calculations -- but the chaotic  situation in Russia could lead to crises, for example in the  Baltic states, that would immediately be reflected in the  situation in the Nordic region.    When Finland decided to apply for EU membership two years  ago  the main justifications were trade policy and economic reasons.  Little was said about security policy, but today it is openly  stressed that membership also has an important security policy  dimension. And we may assume that as we approach the popular  referendum this fall security arguments will be discussed almost  as frequently as the future of agriculture.  <H5>  Nonalignment Without Guarantees </H5>   For EU membership will inevitably also lead to security  policy ties. Pekka Visuri, a researcher at the Foreign Policy  Institute, points out in the same issue of NORDISK KONTAKT  mentioned above that it is questionable whether there will be  any possibility of staying out of military policy cooperation  within the framework of the economic and political dimension. He  points out that the definition of "freedom from military  alliances and an independent national defense system" used by  Finland and Sweden will not seem particularly credible to the  rest of the world unless it is combined with guarantees that the  EU countries will continue to sanction this position in the  future.    The debate on future Nordic security policy solutions should  get under way in earnest. When it comes to Finland there is a  risk that we will reach a decision in the accustomed manner,  with no discussion worth mentioning, and explain afterward that  what happened was for the best.</p>

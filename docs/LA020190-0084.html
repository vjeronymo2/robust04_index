			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: CSUN AND CLU, GOING SEPARATE WAYS IN FOOTBALL, WILL NOT MEET IN '90  </P> <P> The football rivalry between Cal State Northridge and Cal Lutheran, which dates  to 1972, might be over.  </P> <P> CSUN and CLU tentatively were scheduled to play in Thousand Oaks on Nov. 10,  but the game has been canceled. Cal Lutheran will be playing its second season  without adding scholarship players during its transition from Division II to  the Division III Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.  Northridge, which holds a 10-3 series lead, is expected to be one of the top  teams in the Division II Western Football Conference.  </P> <P> Northridge has replaced Cal Lutheran with Cal State Long Beach. The Matadors  will close out the regular season on Nov. 10 against the 49ers at Veterans  Stadium in Long Beach.  </P> <P> CSUN will open the season with nonconference games at Northern Arizona on Sept.  1, at home against Eastern New Mexico on Sept. 8, at Central (Okla.) State on  Sept. 22 and at home against UC Davis on Sept. 29.  </P> <P> Portland State, three-time defending WFC champion, will be CSUN's first  conference opponent on Oct. 6. The Matadors will play at Southern Utah State on  Oct. 13, at home against Cal State Sacramento on Oct. 20, at Santa Clara on  Oct. 27 and at home against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo on Nov. 3.  </P> <P> Rick Provenzano of Glendale College got an early start on the track season,  qualifying for The Times/Eagle Indoor Meet Feb. 16 at the Forum by placing  second in the 800 meters in the qualifying meet Saturday at USC.  </P> <P> Provenzano's time of 1 minute 53.55 seconds was a little more than a second off  his personal best (1:52.54) run last May while at Arcadia High.  </P> <P> "It's surprising he's running that fast so early in the year," Glendale Coach  Ed Lopez said. "He's been training hard and he's in the best shape of his  life."  </P> <P> However, by participating in The Times meet, Provenzano will miss Glendale's  opener against West L. A. and Santa Barbara, which is also scheduled for Feb.  16.  </P> <P> Erick McBride, a freshman from Cal State Northridge, also qualified for the  meet (1:55.08) by placing fourth in the same race, but he was well off his time  of 1:52.6, which he ran at Northridge's all-comers meet in December.  </P></p>

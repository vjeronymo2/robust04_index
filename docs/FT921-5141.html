			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour would use full PSBR increase  -Alternative Budget Proposals THE FULL amount of any increase in public sector borrowing through next week's Budget would be allocated to the economic programme of an incoming Labour government, the party said yesterday. The decision, confirmed in a pre-Budget briefing by Mr John Smith, could mean a substantial cash boost to the party's own public spending plans, possibly raising available resources by as much as Pounds 4bn. The shadow chancellor claimed the depth of the recession and the need for investment meant 'it is necessary and desirable to increase government borrowing.' But he went on to add: 'It must be borrowing for the right purpose. Borrowing to build a stronger economy and lasting wealth for our country and for the generations that follow us.' Unlike a Tory 'tax bribe', Labour would use the money for investment to build the productive capacity that 'provides the means to pay off our debt' and to balance the budget in the longer term. Party officials have been careful, however, not to rule out the option of using some of the extra borrowing to modify their own tax and spending plans, due to be announced a week after next Tuesday's Budget, when a general election is widely expected to be under way. By promising to take up the full PSBR rise, Labour would be implicitly accepting the government's view on what constitutes a prudent rise. But campaign strategists believe that the Opposition will still be able to level the 'imprudence' charge by making the distinction between PSBR rises to promote investment-led growth and a windfall Tory tax cut for voters. If the City and the markets judged the Tory PSBR proposals as reasonable, then they could not consider them unacceptable from Labour, one party official said. Under Labour's plans as currently published, about Pounds 4.4bn in new spending on recovery measures and increased pensions and child benefit would be entirely met by tax rises and the removal of the upper earnings limit on national insurance contributions (NICs). Comparing the government's autumn economic projections with new figures from independent forecasters, Mr Smith said it was 'very clear' that a Labour government would take office in quite different economic circumstances than first expected. That comment may provoke some to conclude that Labour is preparing to modify its plans to raise top tax rates and to phase in its proposal on NICs. Mr Smith would not be drawn on the detail of his 'shadow Budget', scheduled to be presented on March 17 as a significant component in Labour's election campaign. It is clear that the document will be a comprehensive budget statement, possibly almost as fulsome as that tabled by the government a week earlier. The shadow chancellor agreed, however, that there was scope and 'a strong case' for an immediate  1/2 percentage point cut in interest rates.</p>

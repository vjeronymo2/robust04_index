			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Ipeco slips to Pounds 1.2m Ipeco Holdings, the maker of specialist products for the aviation and defence industries, reported a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.57m to Pounds 1.21m for the half year to June 25. Mr Christopher Johnson, chairman, said the results reflected conditions in the aerospace market. However, they represented progress from the low point reached last autumn. He also announced the award of a contract for the supply of crew seats to the new 737-700 range of airliners, which, he said, firmly cemented the long-term relationship with Boeing. Turnover slipped to Pounds 9.47m (Pounds 10.6m). The interim dividend is maintained at 1.3p, payable from lower earnings of 2.94p (3.8p) per share.</p>

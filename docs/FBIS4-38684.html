			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 2 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Russia  announced a "constructive and mutually complementary  partnership" at Thursday's [2 June] summit, promising broad  cooperation ranging from the economy to the North Korean nuclear  and regional security issues.    Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Boris Yeltsin wrapped up the  second day of their summit by issuing a joint declaration  supporting Moscow's ongoing reforms and a nuclear-free Korean  peninsula.    Delving into the finer points of bilateral relations, the  declaration says Yeltsin promised to give favorable  consideration to South Korea's bid for non-permanent U.N.  Security Council membership while Seoul will do the same for  Russia's application to join the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC).    Moscow agreed with Seoul's insistence on maintaining the  present Korean armistice regime until a new peace structure can  be created between the two Koreas.    To implement the new partnership, the two countries plan to  engage in more active political dialogue at all levels including  heads of state and government figures.    Kim arrived in Moscow Wednesday for a four-day visit that  began with a dinner meeting on the day of his arrival and  continued with a second summit round Thursday.    "The presidents declared that the relationship between the  Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation is now turning into  a `constructive and mutually complementary partnership' based on  the common values of freedom, democracy, rule of law, respect  for human rights and a market economy," the declaration read.    Much of the declaration was given over to an emphasis on  finding common principles between the two countries and  expressing support for each other's stands on key issues.    Kim reassured Yeltsin of Seoul's support for and cooperation  with the ongoing reform process in Russia and pledged to promote  human rights improvement.    They found common ground in seeking a security dialogue  among  Northeast Asian countries and agreed to keep open a bilateral  channel on formulating a regional security forum.    They took note of the other side's concerns, chiefly South  Korea's position on the North Korean nuclear crisis.    "President Yeltsin confirmed that Russia, along with the  states involved, will continue to play an active part in the  efforts of the international community to achieve the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," the declaration  states.    Recording that Kim explained his country's bid for a  non-permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, it notes that  "President Yeltsin promised to consider it favorably."    Likewise, Kim "welcomed Russia's intention to participate  actively and constructively in all areas of Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation and... Would give favorable consideration  to the candidacy of the Russian Federation for APEC membership  when the matter is taken up at future APEC fora."    They touched briefly on clearing up the awkward past, with  Kim thanking Moscow for its efforts in restoring the dignity of  ethnic Koreans in Russia, handing over documents related to the  downing of a Korean air passenger jet in 1983 by a Soviet  fighter jet and delivery of archival documents on the Korean war.    On the economic front, Kim and Yeltsin hoped to combine  Russian technology with the industrial know-how of South Korea  and to encourage investment in developing Russia's natural  resources.    Capping the declaration, the presidents state they will  "intensify the political dialogue at various levels, including  summit meetings of the heads of state or government, parliament  leaders and ministers."</p>

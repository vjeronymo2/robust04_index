			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Government's package disappoints Tokyo Tokyo THE NIKKEI average fell to a new five-year low yesterday as the government's economic stimulus package disappointed the market and the Bank of Japan's delayed for a day its discount rate cut, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average lost 323.36 to 19,345.95, the lowest close since 20 January 1987. The index hit the day's high of 19,914.69 in the morning session on residual window-dressing on the last day of the fiscal year. However, the Nikkei later dropped to an intraday low of 19,343.34 as the futures market weakened. Volume picked up moderately to 220m shares from 170m. Institutional investors, who were expected to boost prices on the last day of the fiscal year, remained inactive. Declines led advances by 550 to 386, with 189 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks weakened 11.63 to 1,418.52, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index ended 3.85 firmer at 1,112.30. Market participants were sceptical of the government's seven-point emergency economic package, which included: front-loading public works projects for fiscal 1992; increasing capital expenditure for public utilities; promoting fewer working hours to boost consumer spending and housing investments; promoting labour-saving investments with loan extensions; supporting small and medium-sized companies; restructuring financial markets for smoother corporate funding; and implementing a more flexible monetary policy. Miss Kathy Matsui, strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said: 'There was nothing the market did not know already.' She added that the only stock market beneficiaries would be public works-related issues. Foreigners were seen selling in small lots. Mr Nick Cant at Baring Securities said that due to the continued weakness in the Tokyo market, there was a danger that foreign asset allocaters could review their exposure to Japan. Investors ignored published predictions, later proved correct, that the Bank of Japan would cut the official discount rate by 75 basis points today. Declines in blue chips reflected the general bearishness. Nippon Steel shed Y7 to Y313. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, a gauge for market sentiment, ended the fiscal year down Y5,000 at an all-time low of Y636,000. Speculative issues fell on heavy selling and renewed concern over a bankruptcy of a leading speculator. Minebea, the most active issue of the day, tumbled Y25 to Y464 and Clarion Y70 to Y940. Financials were lower on worries about increasing bad loans at many of the leading banks. Moody's Investor Services yesterday lowered the long-term ratings of three banks and the short-term rating of a regional bank. Industrial Bank of Japan dipped Y20 to Y2,220 and Mitsubishi Bank dropped Y110 to Y1,950. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 100.98 to 21,060.91 in volume of 242.5m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets were mixed yesterday as the weakness in Tokyo weighed on sentiment. HONG KONG was pushed lower by rumours that a leading company was about to make a rights issue. The Hang Seng index retreated 39.97 to 4,938.30 in turnover of HKDollars 1.95bn. Among the most active stocks were Cheung Kong, off 50 cents at HKDollars 21.30, HSBC, down 50 cents at HKDollars 39.75, and Hutchison Whampoa, 10 cents easier at HKDollars 15.20. SEOUL rose in late trading as institutions increased the value of their holdings on the last day of the fiscal year. The composite index climbed 8.63 to 606.32 in turnover of Won388bn. KUALA LUMPUR fell as investors reacted to the economic statement released by the central bank after the market closed on Monday. The composite index shed 4.48 to 593.21 in volume of 35m shares. SINGAPORE weakened further. The Straits Times Industrial index fell 11.48 to 1,414.26 in turnover of SDollars 676m. TAIWAN receded on late selling of financial issues. The weighted index lost 32.53 to 4,800.94 in TDollars 16.9bn turnover. BANGKOK eased on profit-taking as investors waited for the formation of the new government. The SET index finished 4.52 down at 822.72 in turnover of Bt7.4bn. AUSTRALIA was supported by window-dressing at the end of the quarter. The All Ordinaries index put on 9.2 to 1,582.6 in turnover of ADollars 235.5m. BOMBAY reached its second successive record high, the BSE index adding 193.57 at 4,285.00. Export-related shares were boosted by rumours that the government would allow export houses to convert their entire foreign exchange earnings at the market rate.</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (11): A problem with typecasting - What does not come readily to mind is Guernsey as a base for manufacturing and this has been a problem in attracting new enterprises / Manufacturing ONE of Guernsey's problems is that it tends to get typecast. People used to think of cows, flowers and holidays; nowadays it might be financial services. What does not come readily to mind is Guernsey as a base for manufacturing industry and this has been a problem in attracting new enterprises. The island's administration decided in the early 1980s that a small but strong manufacturing sector would be an invaluable asset and should be encouraged in order to extend the range of available jobs beyond financial services, horticulture and tourism. A number of small businesses were set up and flourished at a time of high economic growth, with exports peaking in the middle of the decade at about Pounds 70m a year. However, with the onset of the recession, exports have now fallen to Pounds 30m and the manufacturing sector contributes about 6 per cent of exports compared with 15 per cent at the peak. The authorities now accept that with little available development land, a limited labour pool and the disadvantages associated with the high costs of transport, it is difficult for Guernsey to become a significant location for light industry. The latest strategic and corporate plan states: 'It would be unrealistic to assume that this economic sector will show any increased contribution towards the island's gross national product in the next five years.' The States (the local parliament), had reserved land for light industrial use but has decided that as the need to provide more housing is more urgent, some land earmarked for industry will now be developed primarily for residential purposes. Nevertheless, manufacturing industry continues to provide a valuable broadening of the limited economic base, and currently employs about 2,000 people. The sector includes electronics, engineering, printing, pharmaceuticals, plastics, textiles, crafts and boat building, with an overwhelming predominance of very small companies. By far the largest group of companies is in electronics, which maintained exports at about Pounds 15m over each of the past three years, down from a peak of Pounds 68m in the mid-1980s. Companies on the island include Dynatech Data Communications, Offshore Electronics and Datalink International which produces multi-currency integrated software systems for the offshore finance industry. Pharmaceuticals is another appropriate industry for Guernsey because the products are high value and easily transportable. Printing, which employs 500, supports the local finance and manufacturing industries by producing packaging, brochures and advertising material, and the sector exports Pounds 3m worth of goods a year. Boat building and repairs are a natural industry for the island and the sector is beginning to recover from the setback of the recession. Two of the biggest companies are Seaward Marine which builds pilot vessels, launches and motor yachts, and Aqua-Star, builders of pleasure craft and fishing boats in fibreglass. Local craft industries such as silversmiths, coppersmiths, jewellers, knitwear manufacturers and furniture makers - aimed largely at the tourist - have also suffered badly from the UK recession, but there are signs of improvement. One of the aims of the island's Board of Industry, responsible for promoting and developing industry and commerce, is to encourage small companies to develop niche markets rather than attempt to compete in mainstream industries. This has been successful in limited areas and there are now market leaders in medical diagnostic equipment, disposable respiratory equipment, software for the finance industry and sonar technology. Marine Electronics, which specialises in the design and manufacture of underwater acoustic sonars and telemetry systems used in the offshore oil industry, is typical. It was set up on the island 10 years ago and has become a market leader with its transponders and telemetry innovations. The equipment is used for commercial offshore operations as well as naval applications for the Ministry of Defence. A range of scanning sonar systems which operate like short-range radar is exported worldwide but operated mainly in North Sea oil exploration and maintenance. Design and final assembly is done in premises on a small industrial estate. Mr Brian Evans, managing director, says: 'The recession hit us over the last two years, but the amount of work is now going right up and we are advertising for more staff. There are definite signs of recovery.' Another niche company which sends 80 per cent of its goods and services outside the Channel Islands and the UK is Vapormatt, which specialises in surface finishing equipment and abrasives, and employs 45 people. Mr Robin Ashworth, one of three Guernsey brothers who run the company, sees no problem in operating worldwide from a small offshore island with a limited industrial base. 'The quality of the workforce is good, and the infrastructure is excellent because of the needs of the financial services and tourism industries,' he says.</p>

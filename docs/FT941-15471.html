			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: LA Gear sees return to the red L. A. Gear, the US sports shoe maker which last quarter reported its first profit in three years, yesterday said it expected to return to the red in the fourth quarter with after-tax losses of Dollars 14m to Dollars 16m on continuing operations. The company said strong sales of children's shoes had helped cut losses from Dollars 79.6m to between Dollars 39.2m and Dollars 41.2m for the year to last Novem-ber. But it warned that the industry was suffering from high inventory levels which would probably cut gross margins.</p>

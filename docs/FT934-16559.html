			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / World Trade News: UK-Peruvian accord marks investment drive PERU and Britain signed this week a mutual investment protection and promotion agreement. The accord was signed in London by the Peruvian foreign minister, Mr Efrain Goldenberg, who is leading a business delegation from Lima to Europe. The agreement is part of an effort by the government of President Alberto Fujimori to open the country to foreign investment. The aim is also to stimulate foreign interest in a sweeping Peruvian privatisation programme and to persuade foreign companies to look again at the country following gains by the government against terrorists. The group, which includes legislators, businessmen, government officials and stock exchange representatives, moves on today to France and then to Germany. Members of the group said there was a growing international interest in the stock exchange - the capitalisation of which has doubled this year - and in direct investment, particularly in mining. Companies from neighbouring Chile are among those looking at the privatisation of the country's electricity utilities. The proposed privatisations also include state mining assets and the telephone company. Mr Fujimori said last week the leader of the guerrilla group Sendero Luminoso, Abimael Guzman, had requested a peace accord with the government. However, despite this, bombings by Sendero have over the last week blacked out some areas of the capital.</p>

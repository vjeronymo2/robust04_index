			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Blenheim ahead to Pounds 19m but shares fall on French trading warning Shares in Blenheim Group, Europe's biggest exhibitions organiser, fell by 12 per cent yesterday as the group warned of persistent tough trading conditions in France. The shares closed at 215p, down 28p, and almost half the year's high of 405p. Mr Neville Buch, chairman, said that difficult trading conditions in France, which accounts for half of turnover in a full year, had intensified. 'We should have reacted earlier,' he said, warning that full-year results would be lower than budgeted. In the six months to end-June, pre-tax profits increased from a restated Pounds 15.8m to Pounds 19.2m, while turnover grew from Pounds 82.5m to Pounds 99.7m. The latest figures included Pounds 2.3m of profit and Pounds 9.9m of turnover from acquisitions. Mr Christopher Crowcroft, finance director, said that on a like-for-like basis operating profits were down 5 per cent, reflecting the French situation. Turnover from all acquisitions, including those completed last year, accounted for Pounds 16.2m of the total, while operating profits benefited by Pounds 4.1m. In France business was down 11 per cent and the amount of space sold fell by 13 per cent. Margins declined from 19 to 15 per cent, compared with total group margins down from 24 to 22 per cent. The decline in French business was reflected in a fall in the net cash inflow to Pounds 10m (Pounds 26.5m). Mr Staffan Svenby, managing director, said that recession 'struck a large part of our market and we were slow to react to what was going on. Customers were questioning the value of exhibitions, and when we convinced them they were worth doing they demanded increased value for money.' The group is now restructuring its French operations, cutting nine divisions down to four. Business improved in the US, but margins fell from 32 to 25 per cent. In contrast the UK business increased margins from 18 to 20 per cent. Net interest payable fell from Pounds 4m to Pounds 2.9m. Earnings per share declined from 11.7p to 10.8p, reflecting an increase in the tax charge from 32 to 35 per cent and the low yield on the remaining cash from last year's Pounds 76m convertible preference share issue. The interim dividend is increased from 3.4p to 3.5p. COMMENT It will be some time before confidence in this stock can be restored. The management, now wearing hair shirts, clearly believed that exhibitions were relatively immune to recession. Their forecasts were too optimistic, and they were not quick enough to adapt to changing conditions. While that has all changed, it could be another six to nine months before any good news emerges from France. However, investors willing to gamble on a strong future for exhibitions might be attracted. If nothing else goes wrong, and earnings next year reach 23p, the discount to the market is around 25 per cent, and the yield is 6 per cent.</p>

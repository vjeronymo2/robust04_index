Obayashi, Japan's  fourth-largest construction firm, passed on the money through  timber company President Mitsuo Moriya, 65, a former deputy  secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party's Miyagi  prefectural chapter and a close acquaintance of Ishii, the  sources said.    Moriya paid the sum into a bank account he administered for  Ishii, they said. The money allegedly came from Obayashi's  branch office for Tohoku, northeastern Japan.    According to the sources, Obayashi paid the money in a bid  to  have its status in the city's Kuzuoka waste incineration plant  project upgraded from subcontractor to main contractor for all  construction works. Plant maker Hitachi Zosen Corp. of Osaka  was the main contractor for the project, a 29.2 billion yen  incineration plant for ordinary waste and an 8.2 billion yen  incinerator for bulk waste.    The sources said Obayashi urged Ishii to commission the  construction work for the bulk-waste incinerator separately from  the orders placed with Hitachi Zosen, so that Obayashi could  carry out the work under its company name and reap higher  profits. In response, Ishii instructed the city administration  to review the contracts, advocating the separation of  construction and technological works for the plant, but the  changes never materialized, the sources said.    The incineration plant is scheduled to be completed by  September 1995.    A spokesman for Obayashi's Tokyo headquarters denied that  the  company paid bribes to the mayor or ever asked for separated  orders. Usually orders for waste disposal facilities are placed  with a plant maker as the main contractor, which commissions  subcontractors to do the construction work.    Ishii is on trial for allegedly taking a total of 130  million  yen in bribes from six general contractors including Hazama  Corp., Shimizu Corp., Taisei Co., and Nishimatsu Construction Co.    Moriya has been indicted in a separate bribery case  involving  former Miyagi Gov. Shuntaro (?who has been charged) with taking  a 20 million yen bribe from Taisei in late January.</p>

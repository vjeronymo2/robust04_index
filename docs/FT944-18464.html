			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank in Madrid: World Bank urges mixed pension policy A World Bank report yesterday urged governments to adopt pension policies where the burden for providing security for an increasingly ageing global population (see graph above) is shared by the public and private sectors, mixing mandatory and voluntary schemes. Warning that old-age security systems are in trouble worldwide, the report also called on governments to lift constraints on foreign investments by national pension funds in order to diversify risk and gain higher returns. The report stressed the 'ageing problem' had spread quickly to developing countries where the impact of declining fertility and increased longevity has allowed populations to age faster than in traditional industrial societies. It took more than 100 years for Belgium to register a doubling, from 9 per cent to 18 per cent, of its over-60s population. The same transition will take just 34 years in China, according to present forecasts and 22 in Venezuela. In 1990 almost half a billion people, slightly more than 9 per cent of the world's population, were over 60 years old and by 2030 the number will have tripled to 1.4bn. The report argues against 'single pillar' pension schemes in which publicly managed funds,financed out of payroll taxes on a pay-as-you-go basis, provide earnings-related benefits to the aged. It says they neither protect pensions savings nor adequately redistribute them. The high contribution rate, a feature common to 'single pillar' systems, is often seen as a tax to be evaded and not as a price for services received. Such schemes tend to distort local economies and reduce growth, mainly in countries with limited tax enforcement powers, imperfect labour markets and large informal sectors. The World Bank suggests a 'multi-pillar' system in which there would be a publicly managed and tax-financed 'pillar' that would have the limited object of alleviating old-age poverty, possibly using means-tested programmes; a second mandatory 'pillar', based either on personal savings accounts or occupational plans, that would be fully funded and privately managed; and a third voluntary 'pillar' for those wishing additional protection. The advantage for the ageing of the three-pronged approach is that it would concentrate the redistributive features of a public pension scheme on the first 'pillar', allocate its savings role to the second and allow for extra savings through the third. The 'multi-pillar' system would improve the insurance feature of national pension schemes by diversifying their risk. Averting the Old Age Crisis. A World Bank Policy Research Report.

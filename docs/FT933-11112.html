			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris greets Buba news with 2.3% gain SPECULATION over the future of the ERM intensified yesterday after the Bundesbank disappointed, surprised and baffled the markets by leaving the discount rate unchanged. Immediate reaction from many European strategists and analysts was not as confused as the signals emanating from Frankfurt, which was probably due to a split decision among Bundesbank council members. Mr David Roche of Morgan Stanley said that the Bundesbank had chosen to focus on domestic economic difficulties rather than the wider European vista, and that the break-up of the ERM was now likely before October. Mr Andrew Bell of BZW believed that there was now a 55-60 per cent chance that the ERM would be suspended in the coming days, with the reason perhaps being portrayed as the unique difficulties of the German economy. However, Mr Patrick Shields, a German analyst at NatWest Securities, believed that while there was intense pressure on the franc it would hold its course within the ERM, although French interest rates would very likely have to rise under this scenario. He noted that a franc devaluation would be damaging to Germany's balance of trade since France was a major export market. Some commentators, including Mr James Cornish at NatWest Securities, suggested that while the Bundesbank had officially 'gone on holiday' until the end of August, there was precedent for a discount rate cut in the interim if it became even clearer that action had to be taken to prevent the ERM disintegrating. PARIS gathered pace after the news from Frankfurt and the CAC-40 index closed at its highest level since May 1992, rising 46.47 or 2.34 per cent to 2,036.00. Turnover also accelerated to FFr4.8bn from FFr2.8bn. The market now believes that devaluation is imminent and that interest rates will be substantially eased in the near future. Among the day's movers were the interest rate sensitives: Peugeot gained FFr7 to FFr636, St Gobain, FFr23 to FFr572, Elf Aquitaine FFr10.10 to FFr426.00 and Bouygues FFr26 to FFr709. MADRID surged to a year's high as the peseta tumbled on the foreign exchanges, and the general index rose 4.31 or 1.6 per cent to 268.8. 'Demand picked up after the Bundesbank's announcement as people started betting on a break-up of the ERM and the buying became quite exaggerated towards the close,' said Mr David Joel of Madrid brokers, FG. Buying was broadly based, with the banking and building sectors in particular demand. Argentaria rose Pta400 or 8 per cent to Pta5,400 in the wake of its 14.6 per cent rise in first half pre-tax profits. LISBON opened firmly on continued demand for blue chip issues. But, said Mr Paulo Araujo of Schroders, the market did not react well to the Bundesbank's action and buying slowed sharply. The BTA index finished 17.6 higher at 2,229.9. FRANKFURT did little ahead of the council meeting and not a great deal in the post-bourse, the DAX index closing just 0.21 lower at 1,833.70 in turnover of DM6bn. Commerzbank, reporting a 16 per cent gain in first half operating profit, put on 30 pfg to DM316.00. VW remained under pressure, down DM3.70 at DM356.00. AMSTERDAM strengthened, the CBS Tendency index climbing 1.7 or 1.4 per cent to 121.3. DSM which fell 8 per cent after posting a sharp fall in second quarter profit and forecasting a disappointing third quarter, ended the day 90 cents up at Fl 95.40. BRUSSELS rebounded late in the session wiping out losses seen im immediate response to the German news. The Bel-20 index shed 1.66 to 1,300.01. MILAN opened firm, with the mood helped by indications that the government plans to press ahead with electoral reform in response to the bombings earlier in the week. But prices gave up some of their advance and the Comit index finished up 3.06 at 561.24. Fiat fell L118 to L6,548 with one large seller said to be active. Telecoms were firm as progress was seen with the privatisation programme. Sip added L54 to L2,363 in volume of 15.7m shares while Stet added L83 to L3,896 in volume of 7.6m shares. ZURICH eased, with profit-taking in blue chips leaving the SMI index 8.3 lower at 2,400.6.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- July 29                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                 Open       10.30       11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1239.41     1240.00     1240.83    1240.49 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1299.05     1299.87     1300.93    1300.85  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                13.00       14.00       15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1240.54     1241.57     1243.01    1242.42 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1299.60     1303.93     1304.99    1308.99  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jul 28    Jul 27    Jul 26    Jul 23    Jul 22  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1238.35   1238.95   1240.21   1224.42   1217.14 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1297.56   1297.42   1294.91   1279.96   1275.93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1243.69; 200 - 1308.99 Low/day: 100 - 1237.34 200 - 1294.61  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina began his  official visit to Uruguay by meeting with President Luis Alberto  Lacalle in Montevideo. Robaina's agenda in Uruguay includes  meetings with Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu, political  leaders, bankers, and businessmen.    In initial statements to the media in Montevideo, Foreign  Minister Robaina said he told President Lacalle of Cuba's  efforts to spur economic openness. The Cuban foreign minister  reaffirmed that Cuba prefers investments from Latin American  countries but welcomes investments from any country. According  to Roberto Robaina, foreign investors find tourism, oil, nickel,  citrus, and general agriculture the most attractive areas for  investment.    Foreign Minister Robaina will conclude his official visit to  Uruguay on 6 April, when he will travel to Argentina, Ecuador,  Peru, and Paraguay. The visit to Paraguay is unofficial because  Cuba does not have diplomatic relations with that country.</p>

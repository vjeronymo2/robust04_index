			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Local vernacular dailies on 4 and 5  February carry reports, articles, and editorials on new  Secretary of Defense William Perry's "pressuring" of ROK Defense  Minister Yi Pyong-tae last December to purchase the reportedly  "defective" Airborne Self-Protection Jammer (ASPJ) for the  Korean Fighter Project (KFP) for installation on F-16 fighters  to be flown by the ROK Air Force.    The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 4 February carries on page 1 a  500- word report by Washington-based correspondent Chong Il-hwa  headlined "Letter Uncovered Confirming U.S. Defense Secretary  Nominee (Then Deputy Defense Secretary) Pressuring the ROK To  Buy Arms--HANGUK ILBO Obtains Letter Urging Minister Yi To Buy  Faulty Radar Jammer, Requests Purchase Outside FMS Channels,  Contrary to Common Sense, Raises Suspicion of Lobbying for U.S.  Manufacturers." Featuring a photo copy of Secretary Perry's  letter to Defense Minister Yi Pyong- tae dated 23 December 1993  recommending that the ROK purchase the ASPJ via commercial  channels instead of through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS)  process, the report says, "It was confirmed on 3 February that  William Perry, U.S. secretary of defense-nominee, sent an  official letter to Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae to sell the  ASPJ, the radar jammer for F-16 fighters, to the ROK on  disadvantageous terms." Citing the letter's file number of  1-93/004246 and the gist of the contents of the letter, the  report says, "The letter leads us to suspect that he in fact  pressured for the procurement of the ASPJ deviating from the  normal practice in arms deals. In particular, because this  offer is made under the situation where the shortcomings of the  ASPJ had been found in a trial flight, suspicion arises that  Secretary-nominee Perry might have been asked to lobby for ITT  and Westinghouse, the manufacturers of the ASPJ. Meanwhile a  U.S. Defense Department official said, 'We understand that the  ASPJ was found to be short of its expected functions in the U.S.  Defense Department's test flight in 1992.'" The report cites an  article by THE NEW YORK TIMES that said the letter would have  been a problem at Perry's confirmation hearings.    The moderate TONG-A ILBO on 5 February carries on page 3 an  800- word editorial entitled "Transparency, Fairness Required  for Arms Procurement." The editorial notes ongoing "unsmooth"  U.S.-DPRK nuclear negotiations which could lead to war on the  Korean peninsula. The editorial then notes the report on the  deployment of Patriot missiles to the ROK and the "rumor" on  U.S. pressure to procure the ASPJ, adding, "It is natural that  these have become hot political pending issues." The editorial  then notes, "The issue of procurement of the ASPJ leads one to  suspect that it involved U.S. pressure on us to buy it deviating  from the normal practice of an arms deal." The editorial then  goes on to say, "The lobbying by major powers in their endeavor  to sell their arms should not become a high-handed one hurting  friendly relations between the countries concerned. If the  major powers regard our country as a country for dumping their  arms waste, it should be regarded as a grave matter hurting the  mutual friendly relations." The editorial then notes the ROK  Ministry of National Defense (MND) clarification concerning the  issue that the MND does not regard Secretary Perry's letter as  intending to pressure the ROK to purchase the ASPJ and that  "although the ASPJ in question falls short of the standard  required of the test, it is not defective equipment and that it  is better equipment than the equipment in current use." The  editorial then concludes, "The important thing is our attitude.  We must procure the arms we need at the most reasonable price."    The moderate TONG-A ILBO on 5 February carries on page 4 a  600-word article by reporter Ha Chun-u entitled "Why the ROK and  the United States Differ in Their Opinion--Focus on the  Procurement Method of Radar Jammers--Commercial Contract With  U.S. Firms Disadvantageous Pricewise." The article notes that  attention is focused on the cause and background behind the  method of procuring the ASPJ since the ROK and the United States  are showing differences over the method of its purchase. The  article then notes, "The U.S. operational test of the ASPJ in  1992 proved some of its functions to be short of the standard  required of the test. The U.S. military authorities wanted to  solve this problem but suspended the development project because  of defense budget cuts." The article notes the disadvantage of  purchasing the ASPJ through the commercial sales process over  the purchase through the FMS process. The article then  concludes, "The MND, therefore, is demanding that the United  States employ the FMS process as originally agreed. It appears  that the MND will watch the U.S. attitude until the United  States makes an official specific proposal for a change in the  procurement agreement."    The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 5 February carries on page 3 a  1,200-word report by Washington-based correspondent Chong  Chin-sok entitled "Defense Secretary's Nomination Ratified  Without Mentioning His Pressure on Arms Purchase--U.S. Senate  Keeps Silent in Consideration of National Interest, Arms Sale to  ROK Creates 20,000 Jobs, the Press Which Criticized Inman Now  Remains Dumb." The article notes U.S. Senate ratifying on 3  February U.S. defense secretary nominee as secretary of defense  without making issue of his reported pressure on the ROK to buy  ASPJ. The article notes, "The press, which was so critical of  Inman for a minor thing now remained silent," despite his  alleged recommendation that ROK buy faulty arms through  commercial channels. The article says, "The senators must have  had a good preconception of Perry because he is a person with a  background of a military-defense industry complex, which leads  the Arms Services Committee, whose relationship with defense  industrialists is inevitable, to have a good opinion of him."  The article notes, "If the ROK buys the ASPJ in question, the  manufacturers of Westinghouse in Baltimore and ITT in New Jersey  will have a sudden boom in business creating 20,000 jobs for the  American people." The article then observes, "The possibility  of ROK-U.S. friction because of the Perry letter seems remote in  view of the sensitive nature of the episode." The editorial  concludes, "Nevertheless, one has to give serious thought to the  comment of those in the political circles who say, `This episode  is reported at a time when the security situation on the Korean  peninsula is delicate, leading us to worry that it could affect  the security cooperation system between the ROK and the United  States.'"    The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 5 February carries on page 3 a  1,400-word article by reporters Chong Pyong-chin and Son Tae-kyu  on the position of the MND, the Chongwadae presidential offices,  and Foreign Ministry on Secretary Perry's letter. The article  notes the MND position, notes MND's embarrassed position, MND's  worries that the report on Perry's letter could adversely affect  the ROK-U.S. military diplomacy and cause the damage to the  reputation of the F-16 fighters. The article refers to a remark  by An Pyong-kil, second assistant defense minister, who stated  on 4 February, `It is not desirable that our relations with the  United States are affected by this minor problem. New Secretary  of Defense Perry could fall into a difficult position because of  this report, and this situation is not desirable for us.' The  article notes that this position of the MND comes from the MND  judgment that Perry's letter is not a means of applying pressure  but advice. The MND thinks that because of the friction between  the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Administration, "the ROK's  purchase of the ASPJ became difficult through the FMS process as  originally agreed, Perry requested our side to buy it through  commercial sales." Assistant Minister An noted that "ASPJ is  only part of the electronic device of the airplane, and the MND  is worried that the report on the shortcoming of some function  of the device could arouse misunderstanding that there is a  problem for the new generation fighter project as a whole." The  article then notes the Chongwadae position, notes its  embarrassed position, and refers to the comment of a Chongwadae  official, who says: "We have periodically demanded that the  United States ensure our purchase of the electronic jammer  according to the contract. We did so having in mind the  indemnity in case of a breach of contract. As for the letter  sent by the then Deputy Defense Secretary Perry, the United  States might have wanted to leave a ground of informing us of  the possibility for the purchase of the ASPJ through commercial  channels in case its fulfillment of the contract becomes  difficult for failure to get the U.S. Government approval." As  for the so-called pressure on the ROK to buy the ASPJ through  commercial channels, the Chongwadae official said, "It is far  from truth. The United States informed us of its will that it  will understand it if we think we should purchase through the  commercial channels the electronic jammer which failed to get  the U.S. Government approval in its performance test. We have  reconfirmed our position to the U.S. side that we hope  intergovernmental procurement will be made according to the F-16  purchase plan. It is absolutely impossible for us to buy it  through commercial channels." The article then notes the  Foreign Ministry official's remarks, who says: "We have no  knowledge of the Perry letter. If our government regards this  letter as pressure on us, the Foreign Ministry can consider a  corresponding diplomatic measure. In view of the fact that  defense secretary was unanimously approved in the U.S. Senate in  the ratification hearing, the United States does not seem to  regard this letter as 'an illegal document intended to exert  pressure,' the Foreign Ministry, therefore, holds a position  that we should treat this issue prudently."    The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN on 5 February carries on  page  3 a 300-word report on the MND position on the Perry letter. It  quotes An Pyong-kil, second assistant defense minister, as  saying on 4 February: "We have reconfirmed our position that our  position of purchasing the ASPJ through the FMS process, rather  than the commercial sales channel as advised by the U.S.  Government, and we will continue to maintain this position."</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / UK Company News In Brief: Swiss watch maker steps up payout SOCIETE Microelectronique et d'Horlogerie, the world's largest watchmaker, has posted a 60 per cent rise in net profits to more than SFr400m (Dollars 265m) for 1992, from SFr252m, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. SMH, known for its Swatch, Omega, Longines and Tissot brands, is proposing a dividend of SFr18 a share, against SFr14, and a five-for-one share split. ***** DG Bank, the Frankfurt-based central bank for the German co-operative movement,increased operating profits to DM340m (Dollars 204.8m) last year from DM94m in 1991, writes David Waller in Frankfurt. However, the bank, which is in the throes of restructuring, did no more than break even at the net level, after increasing provisions against doubtful country and corporate risks. ***** Haydaux du Tilly, the Paris stockbroker, is being taken over by Credit Agricole, one of France's biggest banks, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. After family shareholders of Haydaux were forced into a FFr62m (Dollars 11.3m) recapitalisation, Credit Agricole provided most of the new capital lifting its stake from 30 to 90 per cent. The family provided 10 per cent. ***** Huntsman Chemical, a privately-owned US chemical group, has agreed to buy half of Chemplex Australia from Consolidated Press, Mr Kerry Packer's Australian media and industrial group, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney. ConsPress had agreed to sell Chemplex to Sentrachem, the South African chemicals group, but the deal fell through after a disagreement over the price. ***** Rodamco, Europe's largest property investment fund, has bought 50 per cent stakes in three Australian shopping centres for Fl 650m (Dollars 347.5m) cash, Reuter reports from Rotterdam. The remaining stakes will be held by Westfield Trust, an Australian property fund.</p>

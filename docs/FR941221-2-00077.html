The affirmative findings were based on information that certain imports would be encompassed in the period of retroactive application of antidumping duties, subsequently found to be erroneous due to an incorrect calculation of such period. Commissioner Rohr and Commissioner Newquist therefore make a negative finding pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1673d(b)(4)(A) with respect to imports from Ukraine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission instituted these investigations effective June 16, 1994, following preliminary determinations by the Department of Commerce that imports of silicomanganese from Brazil, the People's Republic of China, Ukraine, and Venezuela were being sold at LTFV within the meaning of section 733(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b(b)). Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigations and of a public hearing to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing the notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of July 15, 1994 (59 FR 36212). The hearing was held in Washington, DC, on November 3, 1994, and all persons who requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel. On November 30, 1994, the Department of Commerce notified the Commission that it had suspended its investigation on silicomanganese from Ukraine, and on December 2, 1994, the Department of Commerce notified the Commission that it had continued its investigation on silicomanganese from Ukraine. Accordingly, pursuant to section 207.42 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 C.F.R. 207.42), the Commission continued its investigation on silicomanganese from Ukraine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission transmitted its determinations in these investigations to the Secretary of Commerce on December 14, 1994. The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2836 (December 1994), entitled Silicomanganese from Brazil, the People's Republic of China, Ukraine, and Venezuela: Investigations Nos. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;671&hyph;674 (Final). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued: December 16, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> By order of the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Donna R.

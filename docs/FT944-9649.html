			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Gas price 'too low to make money' British Gas is making little effort to regain market share in the industrial sector because it says the present low prices are unsustainable. Mr Simon Kirk, managing director of Business Gas, the new name for the contract trading division which sells gas to industrial and commercial users, said yesterday that customers were getting 'a wonderful deal' because of intense competition in the sector. But he said industrial gas prices had fallen 'too low for gas companies to make money on a long-term basis'. Ofgas, the industry regulator, recently lifted restrictions which prevented British Gas from offering discounts to commercial customers. The restrictions were imposed to encourage the growth of competition in the industrial segment of the market. Mr Kirk said British Gas's share of the overall market - which consumes more than 2,500 therms a year - had fallen to 51 per cent, and could fall further. In the large-company market - above 25,000 therms - its share had fallen to 14 per cent. But the company was not intent on rebuilding market share because of the low prices. Instead it would focus on profitability. Mr Kirk - who said the adoption of the Business Gas name was intended to help create a new competitive culture within the division - called on Ofgas to lift the remaining restrictions on the company next year. He said present rules prevented it from tendering for multi-site contracts which included locations that used less than 25,000 therms a year. He predicted that the competitive pressures in the sector were unlikely to ease soon. Some executives at independent gas marketing companies do not expect the market to improve for at least a year.</p>

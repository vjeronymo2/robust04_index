			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Putting tourists back on road to Mandalay: Nice sights, shame about the infrastructure - Victor Mallet on Burma's drive to attract more visitors NOBODY minds the sparrows building their nests in the restaurant at Rangoon airport, but the plump rats which scuttle around the reception desk at the Strand Hotel are living testimony to the sorry state of the Burmese tourism industry. To make matters worse the country's military rulers have restricted most tourists to frantic, seven-day visits for the past 30 years, and to seven-day group tours since the army crushed a pro-democracy uprising in 1988. All that is changing. In the past few weeks the State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc), the ruling junta, has welcomed individual travellers, announced that visas will be issued in 48 hours or granted on arrival, opened the Thai border to day trippers, and disclosed plans to start international flights to Mandalay. For the first time in years, a cruise ship has called at Rangoon, disgorging more than 400 tourists into the dilapidated capital. The government is courting foreign investors interested in refurbishing hotels in Rangoon and Mandalay, and the romantic but vermin-infested Strand is already being converted into a luxury Dollars 250-a-night hotel by a company from Hong Kong. Ambitious but unworldly, the Slorc generals initially said they were aiming to lure 500,000 tourists to Burma annually, compared with about 8,000 last year and a similar number in 1992. Now they admit that the shortage of hotel rooms and flights will make it hard to attract even 50,000. 'It is politically quite stable, so now we allow these tourists back here,' Mr Myo Lwin of the new Ministry of Tourism said recently. 'It's very difficult to make a target at the moment because the change has been so sudden. After more than 30 years, the government has relaxed the rules.' Officials admit they have no idea how many hotel rooms Burma will have in three years. Burma's attractions, from the pagodas of Pagan to the southern beaches, are more than a match for the better-known sights of neighbouring Thailand, but decades of civil war and economic mismanagement have left much of the country inaccessible. 'It could be a major earner for us,' says Mr Myo Lwin. 'If it can be for Thailand, it can be for us. But we need infrastructure.' For tourism as for other sectors of the economy over the past four years, the Slorc has abandoned the state's monopoly and encouraged entrepreneurs from Burma and abroad. The foreign investors have started redeveloping hotels, and licences have been granted to 30 travel agents in Burma. Progress, however, has been painfully slow. The transformation of Rangoon's Inya Lake Hotel, a grim edifice originally constructed with Soviet aid, is a case in point. Along with the Strand and the Thamada, the Inya Lake is being refurbished and the staff retrained under a joint venture agreement between Strand Hotels International of Hong Kong and the state-owned Myanmar Hotels and Tourism Services. It took eight months just to create and decorate the small room containing the new bar. The efforts of foreign investors to turn the hotels into profitable concerns are further undermined by official bureaucracy and the Slorc's reluctance to spend what little money it has on long-term investments. 'Clearing things from the customs can take up to a month,' says one frustrated foreign contractor. 'Everything takes so long. The (refurbished) Strand was supposed to be open by now.' Potential tourists would hardly have been encouraged by the sight of Gen Kyaw Ba, the new tourism minister, visiting the Strand's building site in October protected by a truckload of soldiers. Another obstacle is the government's refusal to devalue the kyat, the local currency. This means that a very ordinary Chinese meal for two with a few beers can theoretically cost about Dollars 350; travellers accustomed to the ways of the third world are happy to change their dollars on the black market (and get the same meal for Dollars 15) but the respectable tourists the Slorc wants are unlikely to be happy dealing on the black market.</p>

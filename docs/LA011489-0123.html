			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> $646,668 CHECK GOES TO ANTI-DRUG EFFORT  </P> <P> Law enforcement officials received a $646,668 check Friday from the U.S.  Customs Commission -- a portion of the $718,000 seized in a 1987 drug and  money-laundering raid in Garden Grove.  </P> <P> "We're catching the crooks with the crooks' money and not the taxpayer's  money," said Sheriff Brad Gates, who accepted the funds on behalf of the  Regional Narcotics Suppression Program.  </P> <P> The program, begun in 1987 to combat the narcotics trade in Orange County,  brings together officers from 23 local, federal and state agencies, Garden  Grove Police Capt. Tim Simon said.  </P> <P> According to Gates, the program gets back 90% of the money seized in  successfully prosecuted drug cases. Twenty-five percent of that goes toward the  program's administrative costs and the rest is divided among participating law  enforcement departments.  </P> <P> In the last 2 years, Gates said, the program has seized $32 million in cash,  90% of which is expected to be returned to it over the next 3 years as  prosecutions go through the court system.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: DIAMOND BAR;  </P> <P> GROUNDBREAKING FOR ROAD  </P> <P> A groundbreaking ceremony will take place at 8 a.m. today for the extension of  Chino Hills Parkway through the city.  </P> <P> The extension is expected to ease the traffic flow from the east. The road was  the pivotal point in an out-of-court settlement between Diamond Bar and San  Bernardino County in which the city promised to remove barricades on Grand  Avenue by September, 1990, in exchange for the county's help in building other  roads to siphon off Grand Avenue traffic through Diamond Bar. San Bernardino  also paid $1.2 million for traffic signals and road improvements in the area.  </P> <P> The county had sued the city earlier this year, claiming the barricades --  erected amid concerns that a single road through Diamond Bar would exacerbate  traffic problems -- illegally obstructed a public right of way.  </P> <P> The groundbreaking ceremony will be at the intersection of Phillips Ranch Road  and Scenic Ridge Drive.  </P></p>

			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Observer: Zwack's mishaps Trouble hounds some people. After first being sacked as Hungary's ambassador to the US, then having his Budapest flat gutted by fire, businessman Peter Zwack now has to worry about his livelihood. The unfortunate Hungarian-turned-American-turned-Hungarian ex-diplomat has a serious problem. The family alcohol business is deadlocked over who controls Unicum, Hungary's favourite tipple. An enterprising ancestor, physician to the Imperial Court of the Austro-Hungarian empire, invented the dark-green herbal liqueur in his spare hours. It made the Zwacks rich enough to afford two castles, and for Zwack's father to wear only silk shirts and send them to Switzerland for cleaning. He is also said to have insisted on having three seats to himself at the opera to ensure he had adequate elbow room. All this disappeared after the Communists came to power. The family fled, taking the secret Unicum recipe with them, and after various adventures - such as selling vacuum cleaners in the Bronx - began making the brew in Italy. More recently, Peter Zwack was lured back to Hungary by the promise that he could re-take control of the old family business. Unfortunately for him, the state-owned Budapest Liqueur owns half, and still produces a rival version of Unicum which it refuses to give up. Worse, Zwack's public bust-up with the Hungarian authorities is likely to encourage his enemies to sell out to someone else. Guinness is one outfit said to be lurking near the counter.</p>

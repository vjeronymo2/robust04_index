			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Crisis in Russia: Communist spectre returns to haunt media THE CHIEF villain of the Communist regime - the censor - has returned to Russia's political stage. It appeared yesterday that media censorship was part of the state of emergency declared by President Boris Yeltsin on Sunday night, covering even some newspapers that have generally supported him. An article describing panic in the Kremlin on the night of the rebellion by President Yeltsin's enemies was one of the articles removed by the censor who visited the offices of Russia's independent Sevodnya newspaper. Along with this came the banning of at least eight 'opposition' newspapers, such as Communist Pravda, and the extremist Den (Day). The other item removed by the censor from yesterday's edition of Sevodnya was a protest against the closing down of newspapers. Mr Dmitry Ostalsky, Sevodnya's editor, said yesterday that while he accepted the right of the censor to edit copy for the sake of a temporary state of emergency, the rapid restoration of a pluralistic and independent media was essential for the conduct of fair elections scheduled in December. 'Nobody will take seriously the results of any elections conducted in a state of emergency,' he said. Fully in favour of Mr Yeltsin's radical economic reforms, Sevodnya, founded by Mr Vladimir Gussinsky, chairman of the Most (Bridge) banking and construction group, is one of the first of the financially independent media in Russia. Unlike many other papers, it is not even restricted by dependence on state subsidies. His views were shared by many in the president's own entourage and among supporters of his reforms, in the first serious public split over how to move from Mr Yeltsin's week-long state of emergency to new democratic elections. Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, a presidential aide who had been standing in as information minister, resigned yesterday, apparently in protest at the censorship. His functions are to be taken over by Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister. Miss Alla Yarushinskaya, a member of the president's advisory council, told a radio interviewer that she had 'not joined the defenders of Ostankino TV centre to see political censorship imposed the next day on newspapers'. The ban, cited as necessary for maintaining order, even included middle-of-the-road papers such as Rabochaya Tribuna (Workers Tribune), funded by a union of industrialists and a large trade union confederation. 'This newspaper has done its best to keep workers off the streets,' said Mr Alexander Vladislavlev, deputy head of the industrialists' union. The union's president, Mr Arkady Volsky, meanwhile, went to see the prime minister to have the ban lifted on Rabochaya Tribuna. 'We must do our best to preserve immediately the young shoots of democracy,' said Mr Vladislavlev in an interview yesterday. He is also chairman of the Renewal party, which plans to take part in the December elections. Mr Yeltsin must move quickly to demonstrate whether the censorship exercised so far is part of a deliberate policy, or a temporary accident, like some of the other consequences of his state of emergency. Some of the bannings were clearly directed at nationalist and Communist media outlets opposed to Mr Yeltsin. Yesterday, for example, the '600 Seconds' television programme was suspended. The Information Ministry in Moscow said it had been stopped because it had 'whipped up national, class, social and religious intolerance'. The show is presented by Mr Alexander Nevzorov, a hardline nationalist journalist. The programme is popular over large areas of western Russia. Three pro-Yeltsin state-funded newspapers were kept off the streets because their printing house was strafed with bullets. The government's newspaper, Rossiisskaya Vesti, was seized by the government's own security forces - presumably by mistake. Others still could not be delivered to addresses near the White House because the nearby bridge was cut off by tanks involved in the mopping-up operation.</p>

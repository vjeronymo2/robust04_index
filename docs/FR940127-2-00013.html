			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of these initiations we are considering the subject merchandise to be one class or kind of merchandise. We invite interested parties to comment on this issue by March 25, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> United States Price and Foreign Market Value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Brazil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners based United States price (USP) on January&hyph;March 1993 invoices issued by the U.S. subsidiary of Acos Villares SA (Villares), a Brazilian producer of stainless steel bar, to an unrelated U.S. customer. Since USP was based on C&amp;F terms of sale, petitioners deducted from USP amounts for U.S. duty, ocean freight, marine insurance, and harbor maintenance and U.S. merchandise processing fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners used Villares' delivered home market prices as the basis for FMV. These prices and related expenses were contained in a market research report. FMV was based on actual tax-exclusive, May&hyph;June 1993 delivered sales prices of Villares to unrelated customers in Brazil. Petitioners deducted from FMV an amount for inland freight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners indicate that the home market price used for FMV was reported in U.S. dollars, thus taking into account Brazil's hyperinflationary economy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on a comparison of USP to FMV, the dumping margin alleged by petitioners for stainless steel bar from Brazil is 19.43 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> India  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners calculated USP based on two different methodologies. First, petitioners obtained a July 1993 U.S. price quote for stainless steel bar from India to an unrelated U.S. customer. Since the prices were quoted C&amp;F for delivery to the east or west coast of the United States, petitioners deducted from USP amounts for import duties, ocean freight, marine insurance, and harbor maintenance and U.S. merchandise processing fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners calculated a second weighted-average USP using the average import values of stainless steel bar from India for August and September 1993. The unit values were derived from U.S. Department of Commerce import statistics.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners used Indian home market prices for stainless steel bar from Mukand Ltd., the largest stainless steel bar producer in India, as the basis for FMV. These prices were contained in a market research report. Petitioners deducted from these prices taxes, insurance, freight, and a distributor's margin based on information in the market research report. Because the comparison of USP and FMV involved non-identical merchandise, petitioners made an adjustment for differences in merchandise based on information contained in the market research report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of this initiation, we have accepted petitioners' calculation of USP based on the first methodology. Accordingly, the range of dumping margins of stainless steel bar from India based on a comparison of USP to FMV alleged by petitioners under this methodology is 11.26 to 21.02 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Italy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners based USP on price quotations for U.S. sales made by Cogne, an Italian producer of stainless steel bar, to an unrelated U.S. customer. Since these USPs were quoted FOB duty paid, petitioners deducted the applicable import duties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners calculated FMV using two methodologies. First, petitioners used Cogne's delivered home market prices as the basis for FMV. These prices were contained in a market research report. Petitioners deducted from these prices inland freight and insurance based on information contained in the same report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, petitioners based FMV on constructed value (CV). Petitioners used CV because they alleged that Cogne's home market sales are being made at prices below the cost of production (COP). Petitioners also allege that another Italian company, Bolzano, is making home market sales of stainless steel bar at prices below the COP. These allegations are based on a comparison of home market prices for Cogne and Bolzano, obtained from the market research report, with COP. COP was based on the COP of an efficient U.S. producer of stainless steel bar, adjusted for known differences in costs between the United States and Italy. Where petitioners calculated CV, they used the COP derived from this U.S. producer and added the statutory minimum of eight percent for profit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

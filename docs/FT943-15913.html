			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Delay likely in reaching Ulster accord The UK government has virtually given up hope of agreeing with Dublin the framework for a comprehensive political settlement in Northern Ireland in time for the next Anglo-Irish summit later this month. With only about two weeks to go before the date pencilled in for this meeting, it emerged at Westminster last night that significant differences remain over at least two crucial issues. Recent contacts between officials working on the agreement are understood to have made little progress. September is now regarded as a more realistic target date for the document's completion. The main differences involve the repeal of Dublin's constitutional claim to Ulster and the shape and authority of proposed joint boards to enhance cross-border co-operation. London believes no credible agreement is possible if the issue of Dublin's territorial claim is not resolved. But it sees little point in granting concessions on north-south relations that would be rejected out of hand by unionists. It is understood, in particular, that Britain has rejected any suggestion that new north-south institutions could imply 'joint authority' over the province. Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, last week hinted that his party would take a hard line on the issue by telling MPs that any form of joint authority must 'terminate in British Isles unity for there is no halfway house'. London and Dublin are also divided on whether the framework document should simply provide a starting point for new political talks, in line with London's wishes, or set out a specific blueprint for the province's future. London has consistently avoided setting a firm deadline for completion of the document - covering relations between London and Dublin, cross-border co-operation and outline plans for a new assembly in Northern Ireland. The Republic of Ireland is seeking 'the closest possible links between a Northern Ireland administration and the Irish government', but this would not amount to joint administration with London, Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said yesterday, Tim Coone writes. Speaking in Dublin to business people from both sides of the border, his comments were made in response to recent criticisms from Unionists in Northern Ireland that the current bilateral talks between the two governments are aimed at establishing a joint authority. Mr Spring said a joint authority 'is not on the Irish government's agenda'. Deeper economic co-operation, however, would be encouraged. It would be 'realistic' to lift cross-border trade from IPounds 1.3bn (Pounds 1.28bn) a year to IPounds 3bn. In spite of deep political divisions 'there are very few who will contest the view that Ireland makes sense as a single economic area,' Mr Spring said.</p>

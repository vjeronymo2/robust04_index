			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article in two installments by Grigoriy Yavlinskiy under </F> the rubric "Concept": "A Different Kind of Reform: An Alternate  Strategy for the Transition Period Is Possible"]  <H5>  [10 Feb p 4] </H5>   [Text] The reform that began in 1992 consisted of several  main elements.    Stabilization of the ruble and the budget, and ruble  convertibility. The result: 25-30 percent inflation, a real  budget deficit amounting to 20 percent of GNP, and the ruble  exchange rate in relation to the dollar has fallen from 100 to  1,600 rubles [R].    Privatization: In the current year the decline in production  constitutes around 50 percent of 1989's [production]; investment  in industry in 1993 was close to zero, while the outflow of hard  currency to the West amounted to $15 billion.    Improving management: The ranks of staff employed by the  central executive authority have swelled by a factor of five to  six.    Crime, corruption...    Perhaps it is time to thank the reformers and, without  emotion, answer the question of how to proceed with reforms from  now on so that at least at some time in the future we will get  different results.    The content of the book "Lessons of Economic Reform" is not  a  correction to the course of reform, not an exhortation for "more  therapy and less shock" as is currently promoted by some people  in the government and opposition politicians. It is a  principally different transition period strategy. Its meaning is  not in the self-withdrawal of the government but, on the  contrary, in active actions by it in the area of  demonopolization, the creation of a competitive environment, and  privatization, with a serious accent on protection of property  and development of national industry, as well as the creation of  a financial system supporting savings, capital investment, and  growth, which is the only road to true financial stabilization.    The book "Lessons of Economic Reform," which presents a new  understanding of reforms in the most complete and structured  form, is now being readied for a second edition.  <H5>  1. Failure--of the Free Market or the Government? </H5>   Let us summarize a few things. Standard economic recipes  were  applied to the institutional, market, financial, and political  structures of Russia as they have been formed over 75 years in  the environment of a planned socialist system; they consisted of  deregulation, liberalization, and financial stabilization. As a  result, the perception of a closed vicious circle has emerged in  the economy; effectiveness dropped dramatically, and prospects  disappeared over the horizon. Blood was spilled in the country.  In this chaos it is very difficult to distinguish what  constitutes a change for the better (contains in it the seeds of  future development of a normal free market economy), and what is  an obvious weed that may overcome and destroy all the good  plants if nothing is done.    There is absolutely no doubt, however, that the outcome has  very little in common with what the official reformers and  Western well-wishers had hoped to obtain.    I am frequently asked what I think is wrong in the  reformers'  economic policy in the postsocialist countries of the former  Soviet Union and what, in my opinion, should be corrected.  Actually, I do not know the best answer. Imagine that you are an  artist and you are shown a painting created by someone whose  main problem is that the idea is not coming through. And then  you are asked to correct, improve, this work. In all probability  you will refuse and say that the only thing that can be done is  to take a blank sheet and try to draw everything from scratch.    Economic reform in a big country is not a case where you can  throw away everything that has been done so far and start with a  blank sheet. The misfortune of Russia and the other former  republics of the Soviet Union is that the "picture" of reforms  until now was being painted and is still being painted by  absolutely different people. When the government is in a state  such as it had been in the former Soviet Union and Russia over  the past few years, it is very difficult to decide what is  worse: trust the authorities or take the risk of going into the  still "unknown country" of the failure of the Russian market.  This truly is a Hamletian question, because in the Russian  economy today problems are being created both by the market and  by the government.    The market is failing because technological monopolies are  keeping prices and distortions in the area of wealth at a level  that sometimes even exceeds the old distortions of the planned  economy. The market is failing because property relations are  not defined clearly; because market agents do not think  strategically; and because there are no institutions that would  ensure free and fair access to information resources, as well as  competition in most markets.    The government is failing because it has not been able to  give up regulation. It still interferes in the economy, and by  arbitrary and ineffective methods at that. The system that  rationalized this interference in a planned economy and the  entire rationale for this interference have disappeared, but the  fragments of the old system may still be found here and there,  except that now the primary role they play is that of a life  support, providing "quite a nice life" first and foremost for  corrupt bureaucrats.    The government is failing because it cannot control the  budget and money; cannot get things in order; cannot force  economic agents to play by established rules and, moreover,  cannot itself refrain from changing the rules from day to day.    So, will we not perhaps improve the situation by choosing  free market instead of government interference? After all, the  free market has self-correction mechanisms, and many failures of  the system would be alleviated, provided the government had the  will to truly remove itself from the scene. For instance,  getting rid of arbitrary licensing, regulation, subsidies, and  investment could put an end to a considerable part of  corruption. This is the last bastion that needs to be conquered  (from the position of those who insist on total liberalism).    My answer to this may be divided into two parts. First, even  if it were desirable, this is impossible, because Russia is not  the United States of Thomas Jefferson. One of the legacies of  communism is a very complex, extremely unreliable  industrial-technological potential (not to mention the stockpile  of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons), which produced  Chernobyl and may produce many others if the government does  indeed decide to "resign" completely. It is also impossible  because the time frame and costs of a reform based solely of  market self-regulation will be so immense that they may exceed  even the Russian people's famous capacity for patience.    I am literally very distraught over concerns about the  "Weimarization" of the situation in East Europe--for instance,  in Hungary--which serious politicians and scholars voice  increasingly often. The socioeconomic situation in Russia is  several times worse, and, correspondingly, the threat to its new  institutions of political freedom and democracy is several times  greater. But if political freedom and democracy fail in Russia,  the entire world will feel the consequences. Therefore we must  be very responsible in our professional assessment of the  situation and in our actions. And the most important lesson we  must draw from the experience of the past two to three years is  that the state still should play a substantial role during the  transition period.    Second, in the current political conditions in Russia, no  matter who is the head of the government, it is practically  impossible for them to do anything constructive. I respect and  have high regard for some members of the Russian government.  Nevertheless, I feel that on the whole we should not expect  anything good from the current Russian government because of the  bottomlessness of the political crisis.    When Prime Minister B. Chernomyrdin was asked a question  about the well-remembered July exchange of banknotes, he  answered with the remarkable candor that I like so much in many  current Russian politicians. "We wanted to do what is best," he  said, "but the result was as usual." This was echoed by the  statement of a prominent Russian businessman: "We really can  depend on our government: If it can do anything to worsen the  economic situation, it will."    This second point does not necessarily mean desperation. On  the contrary, for me at least it means only one thing--political  conditions must be changed, and a new government that will be  able to work effectively must come to power. How to achieve this  is a separate topic. Therefore, permit me at this point to  bypass this problem and go on to describe what kind of  purposeful transformation is still possible in the current  conditions.    Our challenge to most economists' perceptions regarding the  general concept of transforming the postsocialist economy will  consist of the following:    1) It is impossible to achieve macroeconomic stabilization  before a sizable and real private sector emerges in the economy  and structural and institutional restructuring takes place.    Macroeconomic stabilization as a goal placed ahead of  everything else was a fallacious strategy from the very  beginning (see DIAGNOSIS, EPIcenter, May 1992). A planned  economy is an economy specially set up to function without money  in its true sense. Therefore it does not react to a tighter  macroeconomic policy the way it is described in textbooks. In  reality, for all practical purposes it does not react positively  to macroeconomic regulation altogether, and if there is any  reaction at all, it is very distorted, superficial, and very  often--as in the case of foreign currency exchange  rates--artificial.    This may seem an exaggeration on our side, but it is a fact.  And although certain market elements have emerged in the  economy, the bulk of it remains untransformed, and therefore we  are currently unable to do anything serious about either the  budget deficit or inflation.    2) It is impossible to correct disproportions in relative  prices, create the correct motivation for producers, and reduce  the loss of public wealth by merely removing controls and  freeing prices.    In order for Adam Smith's "invisible hand" to bring the  desired results, we, again, need institutional and structural  changes, including a resolution of the main issue--property;  real implementation of land reform; demonopolization of the  economy--first and foremost, liquidation of technological  monopolies--and at least the first signs of competition; freeing  enterprises from the burden of financing the social sphere; and  many other measures.    Otherwise the disproportions that existed before will  remain.  Moreover, new disproportions are added to existing ones, forming  a market economy of a very specific type. The outcome can hardly  be called a more effective economic system, not to mention one  providing greater fairness as compared to the old one.    3) It is impossible to achieve either macroeconomic  stabilization or correct market behavior without creating  conditions for economic growth, and on top of that on a basis  completely different from the one that existed in the planned  economy.    The success of the stabilization program in Japan in  1949--one of the most outstanding successes of standard  macroeconomic policy in modern history--was predetermined by the  restructuring of production, as well as of demand and supply,  that had taken place during the years preceding the  stabilization program--from 1946 to 1949. All this had been  taking place in an environment of considerable, sometimes even  galloping, inflation. Also, we should not forget that the Korean  War, which broke out soon after implementation of this program  had begun, practically removed the overheating of the economy by  opening up greatly needed opportunities on the side of external  demand. Moreover, for two more decades after the success of this  program, state interference at both the macroeconomic and  microeconomic level remained quite considerable.    4) A model intended for small open economies is unsuitable  for the Russian economy.    Until now the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and other  advisers mainly had to deal with exactly this--small countries,  including in East Europe. This is their first attempt to help a  country that is so large, and it is quite natural that a  different approach is needed here. For instance, the Russian  economy cannot be based on only one export sector (for instance,  fuel and power engineering), leaving all other industrial  sectors to the mercy of fate. And external demand will never be  able to make up for the collapse of domestic demand; in other  words, a "Keynesian" type of decline represents a much more  serious problem here than in a small country.    5) We cannot disregard political and geopolitical factors.    Russia is part of the former Union. Fourteen republics of  this former Union have declared their independence, but most of  them will never be able to achieve real economic independence,  at least in the foreseeable future. On the other hand, Russia  cannot remain indifferent to this aspect--if for no other reason  than because 25 million Russians live in the CIS republics.    In addition, Russia itself is a grandiose conglomerate of  heterogeneous regions, including many that used to consist of  ethnic minorities [sentence as published]. No economic reform  can be successful unless it takes this reality into account.    The topic of the correct political design for further  transformations requires time and space exceeding what we are  allotted for this article. Therefore we will outline only  briefly what, in our opinion, can be done in order to channel  the process underway in the right direction; how to give a boost  to those transformations that promise an effective market  economy in the future and at the same time erect high defensive  barriers against those trends that carry the inherent danger of  leading the economy astray.  <H5>  2. The Effective Proprietor </H5>   The main argument of supporters of self-development in  privatization may be summarized this way: All state property  must be transferred into private hands as quickly as possible.  It is unimportant who gets this property initially; all that is  needed is to enable free trading of newly acquired property  rights, and in the end more effective proprietors will gain  possession of this property.    Needless to say, there is an enormous distance between this  theoretical construction and real market conditions, since the  market is always replete with all sorts of imperfections.  However, the Russian Government's faith in this liberalistic  dogma was so great that a whole system of so-called voucher  privatization was specially constructed to accommodate this  concept.    We have already commented on the results of the  privatization  scheme. As to the vouchers, the only thing we could add here is  that capital asset prices have multiplied tens of times over  during the past few years even at the level of book value, let  alone market prices. At the same time, the voucher's market  price has just reached twice its face value (R20,000). We have  to remember, however, that the face value of the voucher should  have been correlated with the total value of capital assets  measured in the prices of the 1970's-1980's.    Thus, the total value of vouchers distributed to the  population, a considerable part of which still had not been  invested in anything, currently corresponds to only several  percent of the total wealth they were supposed to represent. Of  course, the price of a voucher, like that of any other capital,  is never determined by its real or perceived share in some  wealth, since the price of any capital is nothing other than a  discounted sum of the future income flow expected from this  capital.    Income flow is controlled by directors of post-state  enterprises, for whom the vouchers are nothing but a headache,  since they do not help to attract additional capital but require  that dividends be paid on them. In this sense the entire idea of  "people's privatization" is false from beginning to end.    The concept of privatization in the environment of  purposeful  transformation must be completely different. A democratic  government must for the last time truly act as a proprietor of  state enterprises and resources. And in this role it must do  everything possible to transfer this property into reliable (to  the extent possible) private hands.    There were 23,766 enterprises in Russian industry in 1992,  of  which 20,757 were the property of the state or of local bodies  of authority. Many have already been converted into joint-stock  companies in 1993, but this is actually collective property with  a great share of stock still in the hands of federal  authorities. It is not that easy to make the directors of all  state and post-state enterprises submit to government short- and  medium-term plans for enterprise reconstruction so that the  state, having studied these plans, could decide whether to leave  these directors where they are or replace them.    It is not easy, but it has to be done. If the Russian  Government currently does not have enough resources to carry it  out, then it may be just the area where technical aid on the  part of developed countries could be best applied. In the  process of putting together and studying these plans, the most  important task is to prepare an outline for the break-up of a  score of technological monopolies. But even more importantly,  from the standpoint of the "proprietor--director" problem, it is  necessary to ensure an atmosphere in which directors are  answerable to proprietors. First to the reformist government;  then, as privatization progresses, to the stockholders that will  come with it. Naturally, directors themselves may become these  new owners-stockholders, if the government is satisfied with  their activities in managing the enterprise reconstruction after  a certain period of time, during which they will be monitored.    Keeping in mind the confusion in the privatization  situation,  we have attempted to present our proposals in the form of  consecutive steps (this scheme was proposed by my EPIcenter  [Center for Economic and Political Research] colleague S.I.  Ivanenko):    1. It is, of course, necessary to fulfill the obligations  already undertaken--complete the exchange of privatization  checks for stock. After that, announce no future use of vouchers  for purposes of further privatization.    2. On a mandatory basis, sign contracts with managers of  state enterprises. The contract should envisage only two points:  the manager's obligation not to allow the enterprise to go  bankrupt and the obligation to submit and implement a plan of  enterprise reconstruction and its preparation for real  privatization.    3. Provide incentives in the form of tax and other  preferences to transfer the controlling share of stock from  enterprise employees to large institutional investors.    4. Revise the entire legislation, including administrative  acts, in the direction of establishing the priority of private  law. Draft and adopt the laws (the Civil and Trade Codes, etc.)  that are absent and repeal those that are obsolete. Laws should  be primarily of the direct action kind, with a clear mechanism  of implementation and concrete sanctions in the event of  violation.    5. Conduct privatization of state property only through  auctions (the factor mentioned in the past was lack of money;  now there is money and it is sitting in Western banks).    Expand the privatization front: Rights of limited  availability, which the state grants to commercial companies,  must be sold, and only at open auctions and only publicly. For  instance, the rights to lease land in the central part of major  cities, export licenses, etc.    6. Organize a system of antitrust bodies' control over the  activities of local authorities. It is necessary, through the  use administrative methods, to protect and develop competition  in the market of goods, capital, and labor: the allocation of  facilities and control over wholesale and retail markets;  increasing the number of stores; the sale of housing and  allocation of land; squeezing out the mafia; and so on.    7. Dramatically cut state procurement in the agro-industrial  and fuel and power generation sectors (sectors that receive the  largest subsidies): accelerated denationalization, phased  reduction of subsidies (time frame should be officially  announced), organization of a market in agricultural commodities  futures, and privatization of the main elements of distribution  systems.    8. Set up a system of voluntary reorganization of  enterprises  ("voluntary bankruptcy") with state support: investment,  credits, preferences, managerial cadres.    To encourage the voluntary bankruptcy of chronically  insolvent enterprises (50-100 enterprises over three years),  develop individual packages for voluntary bankrupts, which will  include clear points of reference:    --reorganization of production and management;    --assessment of the enterprise's financial and economic  prospects;    --appraisal of the enterprise's (property) market value;    --search for investors;    --placement of stock in the securities market.    Another urgent task in the area of privatization is the  development of a secondary market of privatized assets. The dual  system of prices for most capital assets must be liquidated as  quickly as possible. In those instances when for certain reasons  it is not desirable to sell capital assets and capital to those  who offer the highest price (keeping in mind the already  developed very uneven distribution of financial resources,  caused to a considerable extent by the ineffectiveness of the  1992-1993 policy and "mafia-ization"), public auctions should be  held, with clearly defined and widely publicized decisionmaking  criteria and mechanisms.  <H5>  3. Industrial Policy and State Investment </H5>   The "government of reform" was not only the first  post-Soviet  government but also the first government that was knowledgeable  in economics, at least in theory. To employ a chess analogy, we  had for the first time a government that knew how to move the  pieces on a chess board. But in order to win the game it is not  enough to know how to move the pieces. The chess player must  have a strategy. At the time the government said that the  situation was so urgent that at least some kind of game had to  be started immediately, and then the necessary moves would pop  up on their own as the situation developed. But even a chess  genius is unlikely to win a game by merely responding to his  opponent's moves, without understanding the game design as a  whole. In this particular case, events themselves handed down  judgment on the quality of the players.    The net result of the reform plan (if there was one at all)  implemented in Russia in 1992 was a further exacerbation of  distortions in relative prices and preservation of the  inefficient structure of industry. The share of sectors  producing intermediate products in the GDP, already high in the  Russian economy, has grown even more over the past two years  since wholesale prices increased most in the primary sectors (in  the fuel and power generation sector, including due to high  external demand); followed to a lesser extent by intermediate  sectors (such as metallurgy, chemical and petrochemical  production); even less in machine building; and least of all in  light industry, with the exception of the food processing  industry where they increased somewhat more. At the same time,  the rate of retail price increases continuously lagged behind  that in wholesale prices, and the difference between these two  indices since 1990 has exceeded 3,000 percent.    The post-price liberalization cause-and-effect chain that  has  produced this paradoxical situation may be described as follows.  The persisting sellers market and technological monopolies  resulted in price rises for primary resources and intermediate  products. At the stage of final demand the government attempted,  albeit unsuccessfully, to introduce strict budget restrictions,  constraining monetary income and cutting back on state  procurement of armaments. In this area a buyers market began to  emerge, but only for the final product. This began to exert  downward pressure on retail prices and wholesale prices in those  sectors that are positioned closest to the final consumer. The  latter could not sustain their costs and sharply cut back on the  level of production.    At this stage the government and local bodies of authority  had to interfere. Especially local bodies of authority, which  now have the responsibility for subsidizing retail prices, and  which implemented their own system of subsidies, which lead,  among other things, to sharp regional price differentiation. For  instance, in June 1993 a kilogram of bread cost R56 in Nizhniy  Novgorod, R32 in Samara, and R18.67 in Ulyanovsk. These three  cities are in the same geographic region and their populations'  income level is approximately the same. The central government  had to compensate for the losses of suppliers producing for the  final consumer. The system of subsidies, which in the past was  more or less evenly distributed throughout the economy, is  currently skewed toward production and sales of foodstuffs,  light industry, and the defense sector. The government also was  forced to considerably subsidize imports of consumer goods. The  share of subsidies in the GDP is at the level of about 30  percent, while preferential credits that went mostly to the  state-controlled agrarian sector and the fuel and power  generation complex topped 12 percent of GDP in 1992. This is a  serious failure of the economic program, which basically was  envisaged as one founded on a liberalistic approach.    Instead of these self-destructive measures, which do not  lead  to real structural technological restructuring of relative  prices, we propose a different approach, the cornerstone of  which is a carefully thought-through industrial policy.    A task of enormous importance is to get rid of technological  monopolies. However, in most cases this is constrained by the  fact that giant state (post-state) enterprises, whose labor  force in some instances numbers in the hundreds of thousands,  maintain the entire life support system of large cities:  housing, medical services, child care facilities, recreation  facilities, and even education are dependent to a considerable  degree on state enterprises, whose directors frequently behave  like feudal lords in their fiefdoms. However, by now this system  already represents an unsustainable burden for post-state  enterprises.    The results of our research in Nizhniy Novgorod have  revealed  the following picture. A considerable number of state and  post-state enterprises directed up to 80 percent of their  profits to support of social infrastructure. Therefore, the  first step on the road of structural restructuring, conversion  in the military-industrial complex, and breaking up monopolies  should consist of separating social infrastructures from state  and post-state enterprises. Many things, including breaking up  industrial giants into several parts, simply cannot be carried  out without it (see "Nizhniy Novgorod Prologue," Moscow, 1993).    The next task of industrial policy is to create a mechanism  for the redistribution of resources between sectors. This  mechanism currently practically does not exist. The structure of  production is rapidly changing in current prices. But profits  and losses in different sectors of the economy practically do  not lead to a situation whereby new companies open in some  sectors and old ones close in others. And the reason is that  there is no true market in any of the three production factors:  labor, land, and capital. Therefore redistribution of resources  will be possible only when these markets are created and  organized, and also when they have financial resources  available. The state should play a most active role in carrying  out this task.    The formation of the labor market will be partly achieved  when social infrastructure, including housing, is separated from  enterprises. Other steps in this direction should include state  support for part-time training while continuing work, and  creating a support system for small and medium-size businesses,  especially in agriculture, the service sector, etc.    A market in land cannot be created with land reform.  Although  some progress has been achieved in the area of limiting state  kolkhozes' monopoly on agricultural land, nevertheless the legal  situation in this respect remains very confusing, and land  reform remains an item on the agenda.    A market in urban and industrial land also should be  developing under appropriate political guidance on the part of  the government. As to fixed assets and other capital goods, the  privatization scheme described above should create the  conditions for this market.    As soon as these funds find their new owners vested with all  rights--whether they are the current managers of post-state  enterprises or someone else--their true capital value based on  the expected future income flow can be determined. This will  root out the current dual price system, in which one is  laughably low, while the other also is in many instances  inadequate since it includes the elements of a purely  speculative market.    And, finally, the government should play an active role in  determining priority sectors in industry and forming the future  industrial structure. The solution to this task must first and  foremost include laying a foundation for a substantial economic  growth built on these priorities, which represents in the final  analysis the main condition for achieving macroeconomic  stabilization.    An approach from the position of vulgar liberalism currently  leads to hypertrophied growth in the primary sector and a  gradual washout of the processing industry. We are convinced  that this trend should be halted. Russia, with its resources and  human potential, can and should be a modern industrial country.  But vulgar liberalism will not lead us there even in the most  distant future. Instead of simply relying on market forces, the  government should create a serious program for development of  the processing industry on a new basis, and one of the  priorities on the part of the government should be in the sphere  of basic infrastructure--construction of auto and rail roads,  means of communications, and housing. One may consider this  utopian given the current crisis in the budget sphere, but we  will try to show that this not the case.    There are currently many plants or, for instance, mines that  are so obsolete in terms of technology and equipment that it is  cheaper to close them than modernize them.    They are still being artificially kept afloat by direct or  indirect government subsidies. It would be possible, for  instance, to use labor resources engaged at such enterprises in,  for instance, public housing construction, where an incentive  for workers themselves would be a share in the ownership of the  newly constructed housing. This can be done without increasing  the budget deficit.    This logic is even more universal. It is true that by  manipulating the figures the government has been able to reduce  the federal budget's statistical deficit to 7-8 percent of GDP,  but the all-inclusive deficit as calculated by the IMF still  amounts to 20-25 percent, and the difference mainly consists of  subsidies that do not go through the budget, and preferential  credits. What is really bad in all this is that the greater part  of the deficit is used almost fully for consumption and issuance  of credits to settle current accounts between enterprises. The  banks use the money in enterprises' accounts for short-term  lending, earning enormous profits. Thus, the current system of  combating the budget deficit has practically replaced long-term  government state investment by short-term credits for current  operations, to which on top of that the banks in practice add  their own "tax." If the government returns to long-term  investment in the development of basic production infrastructure  and support of modernization of priority sectors in industry,  while simultaneously reducing the availability of current  capital (which only serves to perpetuate economic inefficiency),  it will not increase the correctly calculated budget deficit as  such, and at the same time at least will provide a ray of hope  that this deficit will bear some fruit in the future rather than  leading to ruin.    The next important priority should be conversion of the  military-industrial complex [VPK]. Much has already been said  about this, but little has been achieved. Freeing state-owned  VPK enterprises from their social infrastructure is one step;  another should consist of a state investment program, in this  instance based on attracting credits. Finally, as to selection  of other priority sectors in industry, politicians may use the  following dual criterion used by Japanese politicians in  1950's-1960's, namely, the sectors selected should have, first,  the highest potential for labor productivity increase, and  second, the highest income-related demand elasticity.    It is interesting to note that the primary sector is  excluded  by both criteria even without any special research. Taking into  account also a Keynesian-type depression, we can currently add  another criterion--that of a high multiplicative effect.    Of course, an acute need for foreign currency will force the  government to pay attention to oil production and other resource  sectors. Nevertheless, the role of these sectors in the  government's strategic industrial policy (we are not talking  here about the realities of the current Russian economy as a  whole) must be limited to simply ensuring sufficient export  earnings to cover the most acute state needs. If the government  succeeds in implementing such an industrial strategy, in the  final analysis it will also be able to achieve a change in a  real market situation, that is, the processing industry will  displace the primary sector in its role as Russia's main export  potential.  <H5>  [15 Feb p 4] </H5>   [Text]  <H5>  4. The Banking System, Money, and Savings </H5>   We have already noted several times that economic growth is  needed in order to stabilize the national financial system and  its currency. But there is also a very important reverse  influence of financial system on growth. It will be impossible  to achieve growth and structural restructuring, especially in  the current Russian conditions, unless the policy in the sphere  of the real economy outlined above is supplemented by adequate  measures in the financial sphere.    We are not talking here about a standard stabilization  program. It has already failed, and I think it is now clear to  everybody why. In what follows I want to use the logic presented  for the first time by Schumpeter in his famous "Theory of  Economic Development." His concept of economic growth was based  of the notion of "innovator," one who is capable of utilizing  some new combination of resources in order to produce more  efficiently than the current technology of general equilibrium  permits. In utilizing these new combinations, innovators earn  profit, which is then offset because scores of emulators emerge,  but it is offset only to finish its cycle as higher payment for  "primary production factors," that is, in increased net economic  wealth. However, in order to utilize these new combinations,  entrepreneurs need liquid resources in order to initially offer  "production factors" higher prices and lure them away from less  efficient producers.    The general logic of monetarist theory usually looks at the  process of money creation and the functioning of the banking  system at the macroeconomic, that is, aggregated level. For  Schumpeter, on the other hand, the role of banks consisted  mainly in their enabling a fast transfer of resources between  sectors and making liquid resources available to potential  innovators. In other words, banks do not merely make money. In  making money, they at the same time accomplish the needed  redistribution of resources in the economy. This point of view  is practically completely lost in the current general logic of  macroeconomic analysis, which still (following Irving Fisher)  believes that "monetary inflation cannot increase the production  of farms and factories, cannot speed up the movement of trains  or vessels. The flow of business depends on natural resources  and technical conditions, not on the amount of money" (I.  Fisher. "The Purchasing Capacity of Money," 1912. p 155). There  is a case, however, where this contention does not stand: When  "monetary inflation" is accompanied by redistribution of money  from some users to others, especially in conditions of enormous  potential, in order to improve economic efficiency. This is  precisely the situation that is characteristic of the Russian  economy today.    Commercial banks, of which there are currently about 2,000  in  Russia, lend money only short-term. One cannot expect anything  else of them in an economy where the annual inflation rate is  measured in four-digit figures. Real interest rates rose  substantially in 1993 but remain negative. At the same time, the  banking system maintains high profitability, which is achieved  in the following three ways:    --first, many loans are issued for an extremely short  term--between one and three months--and a considerably higher  interest rate is applied in this type of lending;    --second, interest rates on deposits are naturally lower  than  interest rates on loans, while the banking system has a legal  monopoly of clearing transactions between enterprises.  Therefore, it is quite enough to simply issue loans with a  mark-up on the interest rate paid on enterprises' clearing  accounts (perhaps the widespread intercompany credit--the  nonpayments problem--may be partially explained by enterprises'  desire to avoid this de facto taxation by the banks);    --third, many major banks effectively combine ruble and  dollar loans, thus raising the effective interest rate. There  are known instances where enterprises in need of rubles received  bank loans in which 50 percent were made up of dollars. For  instance, during the second half of 1993, when the ruble  exchange rate to the dollar was stable, and the interest rate on  loans in rubles stood at 200 percent, this meant that the  200-percent interest rate was also applied to loans in dollars.    All these means serve any goal except the one, the main one,  that the banking system should serve in the current Russian  economy. Therefore, the government must absolutely urgently  create a system of state and private banks that will provide  long-term financing. Long-term loans currently are provided by  the Central Bank and are distributed mainly through the group of  banks that are in fact former government banks commercialized in  1991, which makes them very political in nature and does not  guarantee efficient research and monitoring. This system must be  replaced by a system of state and private long-term financial  institutions that would operate with government support and  coordinate their activities with the World Bank, the European  Bank for Reconstruction, and other international financial  institutions that wish to help Russia finance its long-term  economic restructuring. Again, the know-how of the Japanese  financial system in this respect could be very helpful. Western  financial aid to long-term development and conversion could be  channeled through these long-term loan institutions, with the  compulsory participation of experts from the donor countries in  the selection of projects and monitoring of their realization.    Another task, which is very important if we want to have  these long-term projects financed in the final analysis not by a  budget deficit but from private sources, is to increase personal  savings. The Savings Bank traditionally held and to a  considerable extent continues to hold a monopoly in the  accumulation of small personal, "individual" capital. However,  the interest rate on deposits is low. If we direct the money  accumulated through the Savings Bank into long-term investment  loans, it will not be possible to increase these interest rates.  Social savings deposits, with repayment in kind (for instance,  in the form of automobiles), were tried during the last years of  the Soviet Union, but what amounted to a default on the part of  the state on its obligation sharply decreased confidence in  them. Nevertheless, perhaps a new government should try to  introduce them again, this time providing complete state  guarantees against deception.    The experience of Russia itself in the 1920's can perhaps be  used as a means of stabilizing the currency and stimulation of  savings. This experience consisted of introducing a new parallel  currency completely backed up by liquid reserves, precious  metals, and hard currencies. We have already mentioned that the  need for a stable monetary unit is very broadly felt in the  emerging market economy in Russia today.    This vacuum is partially filled today by the American dollar  and German mark, but it would be much more sensible to have a  national currency that would be stable in international terms  and fully convertible. The right to issue such currency should  not be granted to any of the currently existing central banks of  the former USSR, including the Bank of Russia--it should be  vested with a specially created bank managed by a group of  absolutely politically independent professionals.    The new money should be introduced into the economy very  carefully and gradually in order the preserve a fixed exchange  rate between it and an individual hard currency or basket of  currencies. Initial means may be drawn from the ruble  stabilization fund, which is so widely discussed but is doomed  to remain no more than a phantom in an environment where the  ruble is used practically without limit to simply cover the  current state budget deficit and Central Bank credits to provide  working capital. This new money, because of its stability, will  gradually but surely displace all soft currencies, probably  including the current Russian ruble itself, while simultaneously  easing repatriation of money from abroad. This effect was  achieved in the 1920's in less than two years.  <H5>  5. The Russian Federation and the CIS </H5>   In conclusion we would like to dwell on the problems of the  Russian Federation and the CIS. The task is to replace the  chaotic and destructive disintegration of organized  decentralized authority, supplemented by coordinated regulation  in the spheres that must be regulated.    It is clear that true systemic and structural changes must  mainly and first and foremost develop from below. But the role  of political leadership is to organize these changes and give  them a certain direction. This includes not only economic  problems but also first and foremost problems of the political  organization of the state. What is currently happening in this  sphere by general admission constitutes one of the main  obstacles to the path of economic reform, although, as our  economic analysis shows, the importance of this sphere is indeed  being somewhat exaggerated.    The first Soviet reformist regime of President Mikhail  Gorbachev began a deep-reaching political transformation but had  to leave the scene because it had never really began true  economic reform. The new reformist regime of President Boris  Yeltsin fell victim to another extreme. His government has not  taken a single step in two years to continue the process of  political transformation. As a result, the reform process has  again rolled into a dead end, the attempt to get out of which  resulted in bloodshed in October 1993. I have already on  occasion compared the process of transforming postsocialist  societies with riding a bicycle. The left pedal is political  reform, the right pedal--economic. If you stop pushing, that is,  apply the brake to one of the pedals, the bicycle immediately  overturns.    The topic of political reform is on the whole outside the  scope of this article, but some political initiatives are  absolutely necessary in order for the transformation process  described in the preceding subsections to begin to take place.    First, a much more effective decision must be made on the  form of the Federation. This includes not merely separation of  authority but, more important, the distribution of authority  between the center and the regions. It is meaningless to resist  decentralization--it is needed both politically and  economically. The fact that with respect to many aspects of  privatization, pricing policy, and social programs power has  been delegated to local authorities is a step in the right  direction, but the paradox of the current legal situation is in  that too many important matters are under "joint jurisdiction."  In our view, the central government should retain enough  authority and levers with respect to heterogeneous Russian  regions to enable it to effectively block chaotic  disintegration, which in the final count will be dangerous for  all the regions comprising the Russian Federation--without  exception. Of course, for a certain time period the south, rich  in grain, or Siberia, rich in oil, will be able to ignore the  industrial centers in the Volgo-Vyatka region or the North  Urals, but disarray in Arzamas-16 or Chelyabinsk-5, situated in  precisely these regions, may destroy the entire country and a  considerable part of Europe.    The realities of Russian industry and infrastructure are  such  that they, much like the Russian military machine, will continue  to call for a strong coordinating and controlling role of the  state for many years to come.    As to purely economic aspects of the transformation process,  our opinion is that coordination must be carried on not only in  Russia but in the entire CIS. The economies of all the newly  independent states are still so much intertwined that,  especially bearing in mind industry's low capacity for charge,  it is much cheaper to gradually phase out the existing system of  division of labor than to destroy it overnight. This simple  truth is currently gaining understanding all over the territory  of the former Soviet Union.    Border control between former Soviet republics is  practically  nonexistent, and therefore it is important not to get carried  away by attempts to set up customs controls at borders but  instead to set up a Customs Union, using the borders of the  former Soviet Union that are well-equipped for that purpose.    Economic ties between enterprises situated in different  newly  independent states should not be subjected to any regulation or  restrictions; the same goes for movement of goods, labor, and  capital. A common currency area is in the interests of all the  republics, including Russia. How to form this area, however, is  a delicate problem. The economic potential of the Russian  Federation is so overwhelmingly great that it will still de  facto play a leading role in any multilateral agreement, but if  other newly independent states begin to suspect foul play or  encounter direct diktat on the part of the Russian Government,  as occurred in some recent proposals regarding the ruble zone,  the problems of the common currency will be sharply politicized  and will become practically unresolvable.    In addition, it is completely unclear, no matter from which  angle we look at it, why it is that the Russian Government and  its Central Bank--which allowed inflation to reach 2,600 percent  the year before last and 1,000 percent last year--should be  entrusted with the task of maintaining the value of the common  currency.    In this respect our proposals for the introduction of a new  convertible currency controlled by an Independent Reserve Bank  and a Banking Union, for instance, may offer one way to avoid  these difficulties. A special bank for mutual clearing between  CIS countries also may be set up on the basis of Western credits  convertible into this new currency. Simplifying clearing  procedures between CIS countries could become an important step  on the path to economic revival.    In 1991 we proposed and prepared the Economic Union Treaty,  which was signed in October by the heads of 10 republics-newly  independent states. At the beginning of December 1991 the  leaders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus met in Minsk and decided  to take another road. They were so overcome by enthusiasm on the  subject of the new agreement they had just happened to think of  that they even without hesitation renounced their signatures on  the previous agreement. Actually, this was only one of this kind  of action in a chain of endless reneging on previous promises  and political statements. Unfortunately, all this did not start  then and did not end there.    The very course of history over the past two years has  proven  that we were right to insist on an economic union. Now those  same politicians are beginning to speak differently. It is  becoming obvious even to them that it is impossible to implement  an effective reform policy in countries without borders and  customs, without a currency and financial system, without law  and order, with ties disrupted both internally and between  sectors; on top of this now dozens of self-proclaimed regional  sovereignties, presidents of small regions, and ethnic and civil  conflicts in many parts of what was recently one country and  remains to a considerable extent a whole entity as a territory  of habitation.    An economic treaty between the republics of the former USSR  was signed in September 1993 for the second time, two years  later. It is clear that without it, reforms cannot succeed. Will  the current politicians want it to work? I do not know; I am not  sure.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   Both we and our opponents of substance support  liberalization. But there are two different kinds of  liberalization. Vulgar liberalization has set free  supermonopolistic monsters and let go of traditions, relations,  systems, and the ties of the command economy. What we want is  for society to be free of such an economy.    How the history of our country will look in the 21st century  depends to a great extent on whether we give a free hand to the  mafiosi monster of the totalitarian economy or whether we are  able to overpower it this time. This is the angle from which we  view the processes currently underway and the criterion by which  we measure our political decisions.</p>

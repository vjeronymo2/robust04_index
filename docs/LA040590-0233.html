			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NEW YORK OVERNIGHT;  </P> <P> BELAFONTE WEIGHS MANDELA-POITIER MINISERIES  </P> <P> MANDELA TV STORY TO STAR SIDNEY POITIER?: It's a story that would ring up Big  Numbers on TV. And, we hear, that's just what Harry Belafonte and ABC-TV also  believe.  </P> <P> According to our Hollywood spies, network moguls are supposed to be "seriously  discussing" a miniseries on the life of Nelson A. Mandela that would be  produced by Belafonte. Bill Cosby's wife, Camille, who is also a producer,  likewise has been mentioned as one of the brains behind the project.  </P> <P> According to a top source, the film would star Oscar-winner Sidney Poitier as  the South African hero, with other roles reportedly being offered to Jane Fonda  and Marlon Brando. Harry Belafonte also would make an appearance in the movie  as Archbishop Desmond Tutu.  </P> <P> While the entire project is cloaked in secrecy, with the Poitier and Cosby  offices refusing to return repeated phone calls, a spokesperson for ABC-TV did  confirm Wednesday that "a Mandela miniseries property is presently in the  development stage."  </P> <P> "But for competitive reasons that's all we're going to say on the subject."  </P> <P> Poitier is currently doing a two-part series for ABC-TV on the life of Supreme  Court Justice Thurgood Marshall for the 1990-91 season.  </P> <P> SYD MAKES A PITCH: This time last year, Syd Thrift was gearing up to open the  baseball season as Yankee owner George Steinbrenner's main man. Well, you know  how things are with George. It didn't last.  </P> <P> So now Thrift is Down South managing his company and making plans to launch his  book, "The Game According to Syd." But don't get the idea this will be a knock  on George.  </P> <P> "This was written to have a positive impact on baseball. It's for the fan and  to improve what he sees at the game," Syd said. Still, Syd does have a  paragraph or two on The Boss.  </P> <P> As for the lockout's affect on this season, Thrift sees few problems. "We'll  have quality baseball because most of the players stay in condition all year,"  he said. "If you have a young team, the entire spring training season is a  necessity. But the set teams will get off the blocks all right."  </P> <P> And the Yankees? "They're a much better team than last year. They've improved  the pitching significantly."  </P> <P> HARMONY?: Show biz folk will be paying close attention to the interaction  between Dorothy Loudon and Martin Charnin when Dot takes in Marty's cabaret  show at Rainbow &amp; Stars tonight.  </P> <P> Friends say they haven't been on the warmest of terms since "Annie 2" crashed  in Washington. Warm? Try frigid.  </P> <P> "They had a misunderstanding," is the way an acquaintance of the two put it  Wednesday. "Maybe this signals a thaw."  </P> <P> Loudon, of course, won a Tony for portraying Miss Hannigan in Charnin's  original production. But even though the show's being reworked at Goodspeed in  Connecticut, Dot's not a part of it.  </P></p>

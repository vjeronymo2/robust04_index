			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F> Ya'el Dan and Mikha Friedman -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Dan] We have just heard of a  breakthrough, of some contacts and agreements between the PLO  and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], of these two parties  discussing coexistence for the sake of the Palestinian people.  Are you encouraged by this development? Do you believe Hamas  will join the peace process?    [Peres] There is a lot of pretense in these matters and in  the relationship among the Arabs, quite a lot of embellishment  and not enough substance. All I can say is that if Hamas  emulates the PLO by abandoning terror and sanctioning peace, it  will be the surprise of the century. I doubt that.    [Dan] Can their coexistence be negative from our point of  view?    [Peres] If the coexistence is negative, there will be no  agreement. We must not forget that peace is not an agreement on  reciprocal favors. Peace serves each side, first and foremost.    [Friedman] Mr. Peres, this week we read reports emanating  from the top echelons of your ministry to the effect that the  outlines of the arrangement with Syria are absolutely clear to  you: In return for full peace, there will be full Israeli  withdrawal on the Golan Heights, which will not happen gradually  over 20 years, but rather within a much shorter period. Is that  the master plan of peace with Syria?    [Peres] No, I do not think so. You can put anything on  paper, and there can be as many position papers as you like. No  such stand has been embraced by the Israeli Government, and  hence, not by the Foreign Ministry either. The Foreign Ministry  is an integral part of the government. I think what the paper  intended was mainly to emphasize the positive aspect -- the need  for a comprehensive agreement with all the Arab countries on all  the disputed issues. They may have meant to indicate the price  exacted by al-Asad. In any event, it is not a binding paper,  and there are lots of papers and lots of archives in the State  of Israel.    [Dan] The truth, Mr. Peres, is that unless you tell us that  there is truth in the reports about secret agreements with  Syria, we have been hearing more reports about increased Syrian  military buildup than of peace negotiations.    [Peres] There is nothing secret with the Syrians. It is  true, the Syrian Army is making buildup attempts, which is  certainly a problem we cannot discount. In the fundamental,  profoundly historic sense, however, Syria has no option other  than peace. Even if it purchases weapons from  Russia....[pauses] Russia as it was known exists no longer, not  even in terms of weapon production and terms of supply.    [Friedman] When you say there is nothing secret with Syria,  are you saying it with regret, because in view of the stalemate,  it would have been better....    [Peres, interrupting] I was definitely speaking regretfully,  because I think the negotiations should be more open on the one  hand and more clandestine on the other. They should be more  open in order to show each nation that the other side desires  peace explicitly and unwaveringly.    [Friedman] Then what holds the Syrians back from promoting  the peace process with us?    [Peres] Old habits, including a regime which is not open, a  regime which does not openly face its public, a very  uncommunicative regime in a universe in which television and  other electronic media, newspapers, and radio networks all  participate in the negotiations. It should be clear that  negotiations cannot be conducted by officials or ministers  alone, they have to be conducted by nations. They should be  negotiations that look and sound good, and they should be  plausible. The details can be negotiated at a site not lit up  by the sun.    [Dan] Have we made attempts to hold contacts away from the  sun, and were these attempts snubbed by the Syrians? Is that  the reason....?    [Peres, interrupting] No. I mean, attempts were made, we  did suggest that as in any other negotiations, one segment  should be more exposed, more public, and the other more  technical and more confidential to enable us to conduct  negotiations without encountering daily criticism over some  leaked details.    [Dan] Mr. Peres, when do you anticipate peace with Syria?    [Peres] It is very difficult to tell, because the Syrians  are very obstinate, and their march forward is very sluggish.  They are extremely slow. I hope it will happen this year, but  I can make no guarantees. [passage omitted]</p>

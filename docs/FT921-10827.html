			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Barclaycard claims market share victory over Access FOR the first time in two decades Barclaycard, with 8m cardholders, says it has overtaken Access, which has more than 10.04m cardholders, in its share of turnover in the UK credit card market. Mr Richard Reay-Smith, chief executive of Barclays central retail services division, said yesterday: 'This is the first time since 1979 that we have been able to nose ahead of the four Access banks. We are gaining market share for the first time in 20 years.' He said that Barclaycard had 34.1 per cent of turnover in the credit card market in the last two months of 1991, while Access, a UK MasterCard subsidiary brand name jointly owned by National Westminster, Midland, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland, slipped back to 33.3 per cent. Barclays has been wooing Access customers for two years by offering a rival Barclaycard MasterCard alongside its traditional Visa products. Mr Reay-Smith said that the introduction of an annual fee by Barclaycard had not affected its market share. 'Strangely enough, Barclaycard has been gaining market share since it introduced annual charges,' he said. Access yesterday declined to comment on the figures, saying: 'We don't believe in discussing matters affecting Barclaycard.' It added: 'Our turnover was Pounds 11.8bn last year.' The number of Access cards in the market has shrunk since the introduction of charges over the past two years. Lloyds, the first bank to introduce credit card charges, is believed to have only 1.6m Access cards compared with about 2.8m two years ago. With credit card profitability sharply down, all the large banks are focusing on developing their debit card operations, and some smaller credit card issuers have been forced to withdraw from the market. Potential buyers are being sought for the credit card business of Town &amp; Country Building Society after its merger with Woolwich Building Society. Access's card processing operations were sold to First Data Resources, an offshoot of American Express, last year. However, the four Access banks continue to own the brand name and so far have shown no signs of dropping it in favour of their own individual MasterCard branding.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Pru urges single regulator PRUDENTIAL, Britain's largest life insurance group, has called for the creation of a single regulator for all occupational pensions schemes. The call was made in Prudential's submission to the Goode committee, which was established to look into occupational pension law after the Maxwell affair. Mr David Linnell, Prudential's group actuary and compliance officer, said: 'What we need is a set of principles which apply to all occupational schemes; clarification of the roles and responsibilities of everyone involved; and a single pensions regulator responsible for investigating any breaches, with powers to intervene where necessary.' Prudential added that 'particular efforts should also be made to improve communication to all pension scheme members'. It favours a restricted compensation fund, limited to schemes where there has been fraud and theft, and it has proved impossible to use other means to recover the stolen money. UK investment firms have criticised the recommendation that there should be 30 individuals on the board of the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed regulator for the retail investment industry. The PIA's formation committee has received views from 253 groups and individuals.</p>

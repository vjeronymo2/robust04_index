			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Race for the White House: Wall Street convinced Clinton will triumph - Picking out likely winners and losers if the Democrats are elected IT may have taken them a long time to come round to the idea of a President Clinton, but Wall Street's economists, analysts and fund managers are now convinced that the Democrat governor from Arkansas will triumph on November 3. According to a survey published this week in Barron's, the US business newspaper, a remarkable 70 per cent of the investment fund managers it surveyed believe the Democrat would win the presidency next month. There is an equally firm consensus among economists and analysts about the election's outcome. Now that Wall Street believes Mr Clinton will win, there has been a scramble to identify the financial assets that could benefit most from a Democratic-controlled White House. On a macro level, economists expect that the economic pendulum will swing from deflation to higher growth and inflation under Mr Clinton, and are warning investors to be ready to make a significant asset-allocation decision; to switch from bonds to stocks. Mr Steven Resnick, senior investment strategist at Cowen, a New York securities firm, believes strongly that stocks will do better than bonds: 'Clinton means more reflation than we would have got with Bush - it will be the turning point in the bull market for bonds.' Few doubt that stocks would outperform bonds in a reflationary climate, especially given the bond market's aversion to any policy that might widen the budget deficit. Most economists on Wall Street mistrust the calculations behind Mr Clinton's formula for halving the deficit over four years - a formula based on increasing spending, cutting middle class taxes, raising taxes on the rich, closing corporate tax loopholes, cutting defence spending and reducing government waste. To bond investors, the formula spells higher interest rates and higher inflation. To some extent, these fears have already been priced into bonds, which have fallen recently on concerns about Clintonomics. Most observers, however, believe the market would drop further after the election on a Democratic victory, and forecasters talk of long-term bond yields rising from 7.5 per cent levels to well above 8 per cent. The stock market has already been shedding some fat in anticipation of a Clinton win, based primarily on the instinctive judgment that Republicans are better for equities than Democrats. Political discounting was partly to blame for the 120-point drop in the Dow over six trading days last week. Apart from this the market appears to be approaching the idea of a Clinton presidency calmly. As with the voters, the mood among many investors is more anti-Bush than pro-Clinton. 'There's a high degree of frustration with Bush  -he's not exactly beloved in the market,' says Mr David Shulman, senior equity strategist at Salomon Brothers. Despite that frustration Wall Street's underlying sympathies remain with the Republicans. If Mr Bush did manage to come back off the ropes to win there would be a collective sigh of relief at the survival of the status quo. If Mr Clinton wins, Wall Street assumes that the new administration, probably supported by a Democrat-controlled Congress, will try to accomplish its main goal - kick-starting the stalled economic recovery  - in its first 100 days. That would involve giving early priority to boosting public expenditure. In such an environment, with Mr Clinton proposing spending an extra Dollars 133bn (Pounds 77.3bn) over four years on roads, bridges and trains, analysts recommend investing in companies that benefit from infrastructure spending. Likely beneficiaries of increased spending on public works at federal and state level include big machinery makers such as Caterpillar and Ingersoll Rand, and steel companies. Road builders such as Trinity Industries, Granite Construction and Kasler could also benefit, as could Manitowoc, which makes cranes used in the building of bridges, tunnels and port facilities. Telecommunications companies would gain if the Democrats go ahead with their plans to establish a 'fibre-optic super-highway' across the US to link homes, business, laboratories and classrooms in a national information network. DSC Communications, the country's leading supplier of signalling equipment and the preferred vendor to both local and long distance telecommunications companies, has been widely mentioned by analysts. Wall Street believes the educational infrastructure should benefit from Mr Clinton's plans to spend Dollars 63bn over four years. Analysts recommendations have included McGraw-Hill and Paramount Communications (owner of Simon &amp; Schuster), two big textbook publishers, and Apple Computer, which dominates the educational computer market. The sorry state of the nation's health-care system has been a big issue in the campaign, and healthcare companies and hospital management companies, such as US Healthcare and Hospital Staffing Services, should benefit from Democratic plans for more comprehensive healthcare provision. Among retailers, those that service lower- and middle-income shoppers are expected to gain from middle-class tax cuts. Wal-Mart, Kmart, Costco and Woolworths are three such stocks. Conversely, higher taxes on the rich might adversely affect the likes of Tiffany's and Nieman Marcus, which is owned by General Cinema. Environmental stocks are widely regarded as good buys with Mr Albert Gore, one of the most environmentally-savvy politicians in the US, as vice-president. Groundwater Technology and Handex Environmental Recovery have been singled out, as have natural gas suppliers such as Global Marine and Oceaneering International. But what about the stocks to avoid if Mr Clinton wins? In the most obvious cases, such as the pharmaceutical companies like Merck, Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson that could suffer from controls on pharmaceutical prices, heavy selling in recent weeks has already taken the sting out of a possible Clinton victory. Defence stocks, in the light of the Democrat's more aggressive defence cuts plans, have also been discounted, hitting names like Lockheed, Northrop and Rockwell International. One other stock singled out by many as a Clinton loser is Tyco Toys. Mr Clinton has hinted he may remove the 'most-favoured nation' trade status accorded to China if its human rights record is not improved. Tyco is vulnerable because 40 per cent of its products are reported to be made in China.</p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on the dollar AFTER THE recent debacle in the European exchange rate mechanism, there are signs that the market's attention could focus more intensely on the dollar, writes James Blitz. The US currency appeared to be at a turning point against the D-Mark on Friday night. For the second day running, it closed below the DM1.67 level against the German currency. Some analysts have seen that as an important level. The dollar spent the first six months of this year trying to break through that chart point. Two sets of data in the US will determine whether the dollar chooses the upside or downside from this level. Tomorrow's National Association of Purchasing Managers' survey could point to only moderate output growth. An even more significant indicator will be the August non-farm payroll, with the market expecting a rise of 150,000 on the month. This is regularly seen as the most important indicator for the dollar in the US market. Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency strategist at UBS, believes a strong figure will give the US currency strong support. The research team at Swiss Bank is more sceptical about the dollar. In its new weekly bulletin on investment strategy, Swiss Bank forecasts that a break towards or below its year-end target of DM1.60 will take place next month. Much will depend, of course, on data coming out of Germany. The Bundesbank has given a very strong indication that it intends to keep policy on hold for some time. However, the industrial output indicator for July is due out this week. This is expected to show an 8 per cent drop on the year, adding to pressure on the Bundesbank to stimulate the German economy by easing interest rates.</p>

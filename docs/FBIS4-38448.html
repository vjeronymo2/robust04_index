			<p>BFN     [Text] An Evrazia [Eurasia] news agency correspondent  reports that last night and this morning, exchanges of artillery  fire were continuing near the Lata tunnels in the Kodori gorge.  The opposing force did not attempt to launch an attack. The  Georgian home guard retains its positions.    Let me remind you that for several days heavy fighting has  been going on near the Lata tunnels. Our correspondents report  from [word indistinct] that Georgian home guards have managed to  improve the situation and take the initiative.    Another round of quadripartite talks on a settlement of the  Georgian-Abkhaz conflict is to open in Sochi tomorrow, 30 May.

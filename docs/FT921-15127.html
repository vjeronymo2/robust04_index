			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Interest charges hold back Jennings Bros Higher interest payments offset to a large extent a 71 per cent advance in trading profits at Jennings Brothers, the Cumbria-based brewer. Pre-tax profits for the year ended September 28 rose 18 per cent to Pounds 395,000 (Pounds 335,000). Profit on the disposal of properties of Pounds 215,000 (Pounds 177,000) and exceptional credits of Pounds 67,000 (debits Pounds 47,000) benefited the pre-tax figure. Mr Tom Bushby, chairman, said that, in spite of a difficult trading background, turnover rose to Pounds 8.57m (Pounds 6.94m) with own products showing a volume increase of 21 per cent. Earnings per share were 12p (8.8p). The final dividend is a proposed 3p for a total of 4.8p (4.65p).</p>

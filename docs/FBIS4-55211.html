			<p>BFN     [Text] There already exists a public admission of this  cabinet's inability to act, and the quarrels in the  parliamentary majority aggravate the situation even more. This  was pointed out by Filip Dimitrov, chairman of the National  Coordinating Council of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], at  a news conference on 10 May following a meeting of the SDS  National Coordinating Council. The SDS is not sure that the  prime minister will really present his plan for personnel and  structural changes in the cabinet at the 11 May National  Assembly session, but it hopes that the parliamentary majority  will express its opinion on the draft decision on the cabinet's  policy submitted by the SDS deputies.    The SDS National Conference will be a closed forum. This  also  was decided today by the SDS National Coordinating Council.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Thatcher fails to sink ship of state WITH HER Exocet already fired on to the front pages of the national press, Baroness Thatcher steamed in to the Conservatives' Brighton conference yesterday to gauge the damage. Her reconnaissance mission must have reached painful conclusions. For while her fiercely derisory attack on Mr John Major's European policy - ironically in The European newspaper - had clearly holed the Tory ship of state, it had equally plainly failed to sink it. As she swept imperiously to the platform, those of her supporters capable of objective analysis must have detected subtle changes in her reception. The standing ovation she received roughly matched the decibels of last year, but its duration was a paltry three minutes - a 60 per cent devaluation of the nine she recorded in Blackpool. A good third of the hall - most ostentatiously the bulk of the platform - remained seated. It was clear too that the wily choreographers of conference management had also learnt some tricks. Lady Thatcher arrived at the start of a lacklustre debate on the environment and was placed between the uncharismatic Leader of the Commons, Mr Tony Newton, and the all-but-unknown Lord Strathclyde: well below the salt. Mr Major, meanwhile, was nowhere in sight. When the cries of 'speech' started up, Sir Norman Fowler was swiftly at her side to record the ritual modest refusal. Equally rapidly, the conference chairman relayed her decision to the hall. Token resistance was manifest in the waving of the odd Union Jack, a hastily scribbled banner labelled 'Come Back' and another, more apposite perhaps, inscribed simply: 'Help.' But it was quickly over. Pitting her own fiercely loyal personal following against the Tories' time-honoured obsession with unity before ideology, Lady Thatcher was playing a high-risk game. And while she has yet to pass her sell-by date, the reception she received must have served as a stark reminder that even the best-known political brand names have a limited shelf life. Furthermore, the conference was plainly keen to communicate its own message to the former leader. When Mr Michael Howard offered Mr Major a compliment - 'If ever a man has earned our loyalty, he has' - the applause was out of all proportion to the blandness of the sentiment. Just before the economy debate, Mr Major's arrival was greeted with exaggerated effusiveness. A token kiss was exchanged. Yet it was a doughty lady delegate from Cornwall who tapped the conference's soul when she warned, to thunderous applause: 'There are enough speculators and media commentators rocking the boat, we do not expect the elders of our own party to do so, too.' Unchastened, she may have been. But Lady Thatcher, nonetheless, felt obliged to offer a token clap.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: G Wood provides new platform for Bristol MR PAUL Bristol, who sold out of Brompton Holdings a year ago, is re-entering the UK stock market through the refinancing of Graham Wood, a structural engineer. He said that, after making the group safe, he would use it to make acquisitions. This might take him back into the oil services sector. He used to be involved in Oilfield Inspection Services and Bristol Oil and Minerals. More recently he built up Brompton, a USM-quoted safety inspection and testing group, which was taken over by Adia of Switzerland, last June in an Pounds 11.7m deal. Mr Bristol had a 16 per cent stake. Graham Wood announced yesterday that Mr Bristol was proposing a significant cash injection and had become executive chairman. The shares were suspended at 16p after receivers were appointed to Blight &amp; White, a structural steel subsidiary. Although it had completed work on such prestige projects as Euro-Disney and the centre court at Wimbledon, its latest big contract was for Olympia &amp; York at Canary Wharf. Mr Bristol said it seemed unlikely to get payments of up to Pounds 400,000 and that was the last straw. Its debts amounted to about Pounds 2.5m. The remainder of the group, including its main Graham Wood Structural subsidiary, was unaffected by the receivership as there were no cross-guarantees. However, borrowings of Pounds 5m remained and discussions about the refinancing were taking place with the Royal Bank of Scotland.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Middle East peace talks reopen amid uncertainty ARAB-ISRAELI peace talks resumed yesterday overshadowed by new violence in Lebanon and uncertainty over the transition of power from President George Bush to President-elect Bill Clinton, Reuter reports from Washington. The seventh round of talks since last year's Madrid peace conference reconvened after a 12-day pause for the US presidential election and is due to continue until November 19. Mr Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's chief negotiator in talks with Syria, was in tough mood, seeking a statement that Damascus was not involved in weekend clashes in Lebanon. Pro-Iranian guerrillas had fired salvos of Katyusha rockets into northern Israel and Israel's south Lebanon security zone late on Sunday in apparent retaliation for an Israeli air raid that killed four guerrillas. Mr Rabinovich said Israel had not changed its positions in this round despite a deadlock with the Syrians on their demand for a total withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights and Israel's counter-demand for a Syrian commitment to sign a peace treaty. Israel is negotiating with Jordan, Lebanon and Palestinians from the occupied territories, as well as Syria. Few people expect breakthroughs before the Clinton team is in place. If they are contemplating any significant concessions, the parties might want to keep them up their sleeves until then. By the same token, it is in nobody's interest to annoy the new US leader by provoking a crisis.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: Quebecor Printing raises CDollars 220m with 14m share sale QUEBECOR Printing, North America's second-biggest commercial printer, has raised CDollars 220.5m (Dollars 185.2m) by selling 14m shares to a group of underwriters led by RBC Dominion Securities for distribution in Canada, Europe and the US. Proceeds of the issue, comprising subordinate voting shares at CDollars 15.75 a share, are being used to reduce debt and put the company in a position to seize acquisition opportunities, said Mr Charles Cavell, president. Analysts believe the company might expand next into Europe. Quebecor Printing, until now, has been fully owned by Quebecor, the Montreal-based publishing and printing group. It more than doubled in size two years ago by taking over the late Mr Robert Maxwell's Maxwell Graphics in the US for more than CDollars 500m. Later Quebecor bought out the remaining 20 per cent Maxwell minority holding. As a result of the new issue, Quebecor Printing will be about 20 per cent publicly held on a fully diluted basis. Western Canada's family owned Bentall property group has sold a 23.5 per cent equity interest for CDollars 40m to Prudential of America and a British Columbia government pension fund. Direct public participation will follow within the next few years. The Bentall portfolio is valued at CDollars 1.1bn and expansion is planned in British Columbia, Washington State and California. Four Seasons Hotels plan to raise CDollars 45m by the sale of 25m shares at CDollars 18.75 each to underwriters. The proceeds are to reduce debt.</p>

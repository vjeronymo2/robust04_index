			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie again dips below 2,500 level FADING HOPES for interest rate cuts, together with underlying fears of further rights issues from leading UK companies, drove the UK stock market well below FT-SE 2,500 yesterday. Once again it was lack of support that undermined share prices rather than selling pressure. ICI gave ground on nervousness that today's trading statement for the first quarter could include a rights issue. Other international blue chips were unsettled by currency concern as central banks continued to sell the dollar. Optimism on interest rates continued to melt away, discouraged further by the view of Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, that current inflation levels do not justify further cuts in US rates. Equities opened higher in London and struggled forward briefly until the premium on the Footsie futures contract began to fade. Then the hints of impending rights issues, ranging widely across the market sectors, turned share prices downwards. The Footsie, already more than 15 points off, extended its fall when Wall Street opened the new session on an uncertain note. London rallied when Wall Street reversed early weakness to show a gain of 9 Dow points in UK hours. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,488.6, a fall on the day of 15.2 points. Seaq volume fell to 436.7m shares from the 520.6m of the previous session, both figures making a poor comparison with the 700m-share daily averages achieved during the market advance in February and March. The latest daily figure for retail or customer interest in equities was only Pounds 751.4m, a return to the unprofitable levels which have concerned the UK market for much of the past four years. Rights issue hints were refuelled yesterday by two more relatively small fund-raising moves; Hardy Oil &amp; Gas called for Pounds 27.6m and Ashtead for Pounds 5.8m. The list of rights issues continues to lengthen, but this month has yet to produce the large scale funding move said in the market to be planned by a leading Footsie company. Glaxo, the pharmaceutical group, provided a lonely firm feature among blue chip internationals, helped by a recommendation from a London securities house. The rest of the sector slipped lower, often in thinnish trading. Reuters, the global reporting agency, came under pressure from US selling as soon as Wall Street opened. The focus on Glaxo took the heart out of SmithKline Beecham. There was no further support for retail stocks, which brightened briefly at the beginning of the week on a report from the Confederation of British Industry that high street spending improved last month. Among the sector leaders, Marks and Spencer and Kingfisher shaded easier. Strategists commented that the London market appears to have lost confidence for the short term outlook, which is now clouded by political as well as economic uncertainties. Hopes for an early reduction in base rates have been put on hold, in spite of the confident comments this week by the UK chancellor of the exchequer at a conference of senior UK business executives. The City is also nervous ahead of the UK local government elections to be held early next month. These could hold the key to the timing of the next General Election, which the governing Conservative party must hold by July 1992. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew believes that any prospective economic recovery may not be enough to help the government's re-election next year.</p>

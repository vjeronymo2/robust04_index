			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, January 3 -- Estonian business community  expressed support to Economics Minister Toomas Sildmae over  assumed plans to replace him in the government.    The Estonian Association of Small Enterprises (EVEA) and the  Estonian Chamber of Trade and Commerce held an emergency meeting  at the end of last year to discuss reports on his possible  dismissal and sent a letter to President Lennart Meri and Prime  Minister saying that replacing Sildmae at the present stage of  economic reform is premature and dangerous to the country.    Sildmae as a competent minister has done a lot to overcome  economic crisis and has launched an effective restructuring of  state-owned business, the letter said. The two organisations  unite over 1,500 Estonian companies.    EVEA awarded Sildmae 1993 "Entrepreneur's Friend" prize.    Estonian media has recently reported that Sildmae would be  replaced on political grounds. Sildmae, a former member of the  communist party, does not belong to any political parties.</p>

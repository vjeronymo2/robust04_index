			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Platinum went in to retreat on the London bullion market after Tuesday's confusion over the new Corning catalytic converter, which turned out to be an additional pollution control device for cars. London dealers said that positions being unwound on Nymex were pushing platinum lower while proving supportive for gold. Strong chart support was pegged at Dollars 350 and at the parity level with gold. In addition, downward pressure was mounting on platinum on fears US that the economic recovery is faltering after Tuesday's lowest consumer confidence index figures for 17 years. However, on Nymex platinum futures were firmer at midday as support levels survived early tests. Comex gold prices were easier at midday as investors continued to shun the market and turn to stocks. 'People are making money in the stock market. That, more than any other reason, is why gold is dead in the water,' one analyst said. On the LME copper backtracked from earlier 2 1/2 -month highs in reaction to talk that Codelco unions had postponed strike action. But after the close, a union official said that the protest plan was still on at El Teniente. Aluminium retreated from earlier seven-month highs in the afternoon on profit taking.

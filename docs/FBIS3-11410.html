Minutes before Robaina's visit,  Nguyen Manh Cam told PRENSA LATINA that the traditional ties of  friendship between Cuba and Vietnam have received a significant  boost in the last 18 months.    Robaina said that his trip to Vietnam was not only an  unavoidable duty, but an enormous satisfaction because of the  existing friendship between the two peoples and the desire to  improve on cooperative trade and all other possible areas.    Tomorrow, the Cuban delegation will hold a series of  meetings  with Dau Ngoc Xuan, chairman of the state Cooperation and  Investment Committee, and the ministers of agriculture, the food  industry, and commerce and tourism.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Straightening Out the Grain Price Control System"] </F>   [Text] Government's macropolicy on prices powerfully  affects the macroclimate for market reform of the grain system.  Therefore, in the process of carrying out reforms whereby the  market regulates the buying and selling of grain, corresponding  changes must be made in the macroeconomic price system. Reforms  must be made to straighten out the overall price system and  grain production, transportation and marketing, and relations  among microeconomic consumption systems, as well as to reduce  frictions between the macroeconomic system and microeconomic  systems, and to stimulate smooth market reform of the grain  system.  <H5>  Grain Prices </H5>   Grain prices hold a key position in the overall price  system.  They are the most important tool that the government can use to  guide the national economy toward intended development goals.  Once grain markets are deregulated, prices are determined by  market supply and demand; hence, overall prices, including  exchange rates, profit rates, wage rates, and tax rates should  be decided by the market supply and demand mechanism. Using the  market mechanism as the orientation, the following two things  must be done to straighten out the relationship between the  grain system and overall prices.    1) Raise the Relative Price Level of Grain    It is the relative price level of grain that determines the  rate of return from peasant grain farming. This is to say that  given a set grain price, if the prices of things need for grain  production are low, returns from the growing of grain are large.  Conversely, they are small. Before the deregulation of grain  markets, the relative prices of grain and products other than  grain were government regulated and controlled. Despite the low  price that the government paid for grain, prices of products  other than grain were also relatively low, so the difference in  the price ratio was still not too large. Following deregulation  of the grain markets, the relative price level of grain will be  determined by the market mechanism. Then, the price of grain may  decline relative to the price of products other than grain.    The reasons for this are, first, grain supply and demand  elasticity is less than the elasticity of supply and demand for  products other than grain. When market supply and demand  determines the price of grain and products other than grain, the  relative price of grain may steadily decline. Second, the  production cycle for grain is longer than for industrial goods,  funds turn over more slowly, the fixed assets utilization rate  is lower, and prices change much more slowly. Grain production  is prone to disastrous weather conditions, diseases, and insect  pest infestations. Sometimes a devastating natural disaster  occurs that results in no output from all the inputs. Grain  production technology also advances much more slowly than for  industrial production. All these factors cause an increase in  grain production costs.    Third, grain prices rise more slowly than prices of  industrial goods. This is mostly because of the numerous  industrial production links in which products go through  multiple processing by industrial concerns, each processing  increasing the price. This causes a steady rise in prices.  Grain, however, is purchased from the peasants for shipment to  grain shops. Its original state is not changed. Even if it is  processed, the number of processing steps is relatively small.  Consequently, the price changes slowly, the relative price of  grain steadily falling.    The drop in the relative price of grain will lead to a  steady  worsening of trading conditions between industry and  agriculture, and a steady decrease in peasant earnings. This  will have an extremely adverse effect on the macroeconomy.  Therefore, following grain market deregulation, decline in the  relative price of grain must be prevented to increase the  peasants' income.    2) Straighten Out Relationships in the Overall Price System    The relative price of grain is the key element in the  overall  price system. Once the relative price of grain is increased, a  portion of government fiscal and consumers income will be  transferred to the grain producers. This will necessitate a rise  in consumer wage rates for otherwise the standard of living of  urban staff members and workers will fall. Hidden taxes must be  made open. If the peasants' unreasonable burdens can be halted,  the grain tax rate may be correspondingly increased.  <H5>  Raise Interest Rates </H5>   Once grain markets have been deregulated and a market  mechanism has been largely established throughout the country,  interest rates will have to be increased for the following  reasons:    1) The need for capital will increase tremendously. Take  grain production, for example. Ministry of Finance plans show  expenditures for agriculture of 250 billion yuan by 2000. Such  expenditures are needed to attain the goal of increasing grain  output from 300 million tons to 520 million tons by 2000. They  include an anticipated expenditure of 26.7 billion yuan renminbi  for investment each year.    This plan calls for 60 percent of this money to come from  peasants savings, only 10 percent being provided by the state.  Realization of this magnificent goal will require raising  interest rates in order to induce the peasants to increase  savings.    2) Low interest rates lead to banks diverting to other  purposes credit that should be used for grain procurement. Loans  are provided to urban industries or township and town  enterprises in order to earn better interest. This leads, in  turn, to grain enterprises diverting credit to operate tertiary  industries, to build dwellings, and to buy bonds.</p>

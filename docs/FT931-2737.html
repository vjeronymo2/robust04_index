			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / People: Non-executive directors - Yorkshire Food Yorkshire Food Group, the Bradford-based food processor which was successfully floated this month, has enhanced its already strong Yorkshire identity by appointing as a non-executive director Sir Marcus Fox, the Conservative MP for Shipley who chairs the backbench 1922 committee. Mike Firth, 46, the com-pany's forceful chairman, says he was eight years old when he heard the future Tory MP being praised by his father, who worked with him on Dewsbury council. He says of Sir Marcus: 'He's a great Yorkshireman, who is obviously well connected as chairman of the 1922. That's obviously useful, as food can be a bit of a political football.' But the chairman says the main reason for appointing the blunt-speaking Sir Marcus was to help to guide the board, which has ambitious expansion plans: 'If you want putting in line, you want people who can do it.' Yorkshire Food expanded through buying from Berisford International businesses which process dried fruit and nuts. Its shares started trading at 110p on March 9, valuing the group at Pounds 37.5m, and have since risen to 132p. Sir Marcus, 65, last month became a non-executive director of Illingworth Morris, the wool and fibre processors.</p>

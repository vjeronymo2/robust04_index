			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Arts: Gounod's souffle - Opera The French appetite for light opera has left a fascinating legacy from the 19th century. Although the major composers wrote operas as grand as any, it is remarkable how many of them also found the ability to turn their hand, when they fancied, to a musical souffle. Gounod's La Colombe, being given a rare staging by the Guildhall School of Music, is one of those. It is loosely based on a story from Boccaccio and La Fontaine. Their original tale tells of a pet dove which gets eaten unawares by its lady owner when it is roasted for dinner by her near-starving suitor. The opera, however, dispenses with the moral: Gounod gives the dove a reprieve and serves up a lighter and sweeter ending. As so often in these little-heard French scores, the music is beautifully crafted. In less than an hour's music (allowing for the dialogue) Gounod packs in a delightful series of musical solos and ensembles, which make up in sparkle what they lack in the way of memorable tunes. In the role of the Countess Sylvie, the soprano Diane Charlesworth showed exactly how to sing this music, all silvery, bubbling, chic appeal - quite delectable. The Guildhall School had boldly decided to tackle the piece in French. This was a gamble that paid off, for even those who were not fluent in the language managed to sound as if they were. As Matre Jean, giving a cookery lesson on how to prepare pheasant (or dove) for dinner, Simon Thorpe caught the intonation of a French comic spot-on. A typically awkward French tenor part was also sung with some style by Ivan Sharpe. This divertissement left time for a companion piece. The choice fell on Ravel's L'Heure espagnole, the composer's opera-bouffe set in a clock shop, which demands second by second precision from all concerned. David Lloyd-Jones led a reliable performance from the pit, although the contribution from that department can never be too razor-sharp in this score. Jennifer Akhurst played a nicely frustrated Concepcon; Nathan Berg was the resonantly-sung Don Inigo Gomez. The pair of productions, both by Francisco Negrin with designs by Tony Baker, had an arty look, without being distressingly trendy. It is probably hoping for too much to give Gounod's weak scenario wit and point, but the Ravel - its comic mechanism neatly balanced by suppressed emotions below the surface, as here - always makes the time tick away rewardingly. La Colombe and L'Heure espagnole, sponsored by Bacon &amp; Woodrow. Further performances November 16 and 18 (Box Office 071-638 8891)</p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MURPHY GETS HIT IN PHILLIE DEBUT, BUT PIRATES WIN  </P> <P> After making a tearful departure from Atlanta after 15 years with the Braves,  Dale Murphy said he was excited about joining the Philadelphia Phillies.  </P> <P> Murphy, once one of the most feared hitters in baseball, had a single in four  at-bats in his debut in right field Saturday night at Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Don Slaught doubled home two runs in the 10th inning to give the Pittsburgh  Pirates a 3-1 victory and a tie for first place with the New York Mets in the  National League East.  </P> <P> A leadoff home run by Von Hayes in the bottom of the ninth sent the game into  extra innings.  </P> <P> "I've always been impressed with the way things are run here," Murphy said. "I  think there's a bright future here."  </P> <P> Murphy was robbed of a hit in the first when shortstop Jay Bell made a diving  catch of his line drive.  </P> <P> "I was a little nervous," Murphy said. "After all, I was with the Braves a long  time." DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

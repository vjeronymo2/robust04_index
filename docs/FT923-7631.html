			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Arts: Today's Television In Live From The Proms (7.30) BBC2 broadcasts an all-Bach programme given by the period instrument ensemble The Academy of Ancient Music. The pieces include the Suite No 4 in D, the Double Violin Concerto (soloists Simon Standage and Micaela Comberti) and the Magnificat in D. Radio 3's new controller, Nicholas Kenyon, a great proponent of period music played on authentic instruments, introduces the concert. ITV's 90-minute drama The Lilac Bus (8.30), based on Maeve Binchy's book, stars Stephanie Beacham as Judy, one of the regular passengers on a bus running between Dublin and Rathdoon. Channel 4's variable series Secret History investigates the assassination of Robert Kennedy in 1968, claiming there has been a cover-up ever since by the CIA and the police (9.00). BBC2 repeats one of the most memorable single dramas of the last 20 years: An Englishman Abroad (9.30), Alan Bennett's wonderful account of the bizarre meeting in Moscow between actress Coral Browne and spy Guy Burgess.

It  has attained this position in a record short time: Just two  months ago poppy straw was discovered for the first time on one  of the trains crossing the republic's border. It was as though  a dam had burst. By the end of the year staffers of the customs  office's passenger department had confiscated 574 kg of poppy  straw.</p>

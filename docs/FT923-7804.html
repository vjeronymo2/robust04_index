			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Where schools are going wrong: Andrew Adonis takes issue with a Godly prescription for education THE ALMIGHTY, it seems, has a key role in English education policy. A chapter of last month's education White Paper is devoted to 'spiritual and moral development.' Religious education and collective worship, it argues, have a crucial role in promoting 'the spiritual and moral dimension in schools.' From them will come a 'clear vision' of community values, 'respect for people and property; honesty and consideration for others; trust, fairness and politeness.' It is the Christian - nay, Catholic - God that John Patten has in mind. The education secretary's views on the importance of eternal damnation in promoting discipline and obedience among the young were outlined while he was minister for law and order. 'Dwindling belief in redemption and damnation has led to a loss of fear of the eternal consequences of goodness and badness,' he wrote. 'It has a profound effect on personal morality, especially on criminality.' The White Paper is more low key. 'Proper regard should continue to be paid to the nation's Christian heritage and traditions,' is the most bureaucrats can muster. Lady Blatch, schools minister, followed that by telling local authorities to produce religious education syllabuses which 'reflect Christian traditions while taking account of the teaching and practices of the other principal religions.' Now, crime is crime, whatever its causes; and Christian leaders ought to condemn wrongdoing, even if they think more should be done for the under-privileged. No corner should be allowed to the moral relativism so prevalent among our comfortable literati. Although uncomfortable with hell-fire and damnation, I am even among the small band of Anglicans who attend church and am at one with Housman: since, my soul, we cannot fly To Saturn nor to Mercury, Keep we must, if keep we can, These foreign laws of God and man. For all that, Patten's policy is flawed. It confuses ethics and Christianity. (In Germany, pupils study one or the other). It will offend the non-Christian communities comprising many of Britain's most troubled districts. It is also based on the dubious assumption that formal worship and religious instruction in schools have much effect on belief in society. In the US, levels of Christian observance are three to five times higher than in Britain. Yet, the constitution prohibits worship in state schools and urban crime levels make Bristol and Birmingham seem havens of peace. What is the cause? There is no empirical evidence that goodness and fear of the Lord go hand-in-hand. Belief in God, or heaven and hell, is not a pre-requisite for living a moral life. Many Christians are 'good,' but enforcing Christian worship and instruction among rebellious adolescents is unlikely to slash crime figures. It will, however, create problems in the state's relations with non-Christian minorities. If there are Catholic schools with tough regulations on school worship and RE, why not Moslem schools with compulsory Koran and selective admission based on observance? The government is right to feature high standards of behaviour and community values in its education policy. But compulsory prayers and RE will not promote them where they are lacking: what is needed is a greater sense of responsibility among some parents, and a stronger involvement by state schools in extra-curricular and community activities. The education system cannot reform neglectful parents but it could do more, with local agencies, to help those unable to cope and to shield children at risk. One priority is a national policy for children who need, or would benefit from, boarding education. Most of Britain's boarding sector is only for the wealthy. The assisted places scheme does not cater for boarding, and social service departments rarely can afford to pay for children to board. What does the white paper say about this? Nothing. It is hardly more forthcoming about extra-curricular school life - the sport, drama, music, travel, voluntary work and societies which used to play so large a part in schools and did so much to foster 'community values.' In New Zealand, these are dubbed not extra- but co-curricular activities. The biggest disaster in British education in the past 15 years has been the shrivelling of that side of state schools. How many comprehensives still field sports teams on Saturday mornings? Even music is under threat because of shortages of funds and teachers. Strikes by teachers in the mid-1980s, plus ill-judged ministerial onslaughts upon the profession, are the main culprits. But whoever is to blame, the consequences are clear: too many state schools now shut with the last bell, their co-curricular activities minimal or non-existent. Reviving them should be a priority. When you compare Britain's independent and state sectors, the greatest contrast lies in how much more goes on outside classrooms in the private sector. And, no, it is not all done by the chaplain.</p>

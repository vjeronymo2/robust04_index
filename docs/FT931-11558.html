			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / World Bank lends Dollars 175m to Lebanon THE WORLD Bank is to lend Lebanon Dollars 175m for rebuilding the country's infrastructure, devastated by 15 years of civil war, Reuter reports from Beirut. Officials said yesterday an initial agreement was signed in Washington last week and the loan would be granted after parliamentary approval. The loan agreement, the first between Lebanon and the World Bank in 14 years, was reached after months of negotiations. Lebanon would pay back the loan over 17 years, with a five-year exemption and at an interest rate of 7.5 per cent. Lebanon managed to limit foreign debts to about Dollars 800m despite the 1975-90 civil war. Its internal debt is estimated at more than Dollars 2.4bn. Officials said the loan reflected growing international confidence in the government of Mr Rafik al-Hariri, the billionaire prime minister. Economists and bankers said that although the loan was significant it was only a small step in the right direction. According to the agreement, Lebanon would use Dollars 35m to rebuild its power grid, Dollars 60m on water and sewage systems, Dollars 25m on housing, Dollars 30m on garbage incineration, Dollars 15m on vocational schools, and Dollars 10m on technical aid.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Electric Power Development Company (EPDC) has  begun looking into exporters of heavy water for the  demonstration advanced thermal reactor (ATR), which is in the  planning stage in Oma-machi, Aomori Prefecture. Unlike the light  water reactor used by the electric power companies, heavy water  is used as a neutron modifier in the ATR. There is little merit  to producing heavy water domestically because the ATR is almost  the only way it is used in Japan. That is why a reliable  exporter must be ensured. EPDC's survey probably will cover  Canada and China. The value of the commercial transaction will  be in the order of &yen;10 billion, and will contribute to  increased international procurement by the electric power  industry.    EPDC plans to begin construction of the demonstration ATR in  Oma-machi in 1996, and begin operation in 2002, and it will load  deuterium as a modifier 2 years before the start of operation.  Once 350 tons are loaded initially, only a small amount per year  will be needed as supplements. For the prototype ATR ``Fugen,''  which is being operated by the Power Reactor and Nuclear  Development Corporation in Tsuruga City, Fukui Prefecture, heavy  water was purchased from Norway, the former West Germany and  China.    Canada, China, Norway and Germany have put in bids for  EPDC's  heavy water contract. Canada was considered the strongest  candidate because it has a large heavy water production  facility. It is used by the CANDU heavy water reactor, which was  developed independently by Canada. There is talk, however, that  the heavy water plant will be closed when the Darlinton Number 4  plant (Ontario Province) is completed and the current project is  concluded. That is why candidates other than Canada must be  considered.    China has said that it has heavy water manufacturing  equipment for its nuclear weapon development program and it can  supply Japan with heavy water in 10 - 100 ton units. It could  provide the amount needed for the ATR over a period of several  years. The difficulty with Norway and Germany is that their  supplying capability is even less than that of China. India,  which incorporated Canada's CANDU reactor technology, also has a  heavy water manufacturing facility, but it is not considered  reliable enough at this time.    A few years ago, the price of heavy water was &yen;10,000 to  &yen;30,000 per liter. Recently, however, this has dropped to  &yen;2,000 to &yen;5,000, when the effect of the high yen is  factored in. The heavy water for the initial loading of the ATR  alone will be a million yen transaction. EPDC will be watching  trends in the yen exchange rate as it negotiates a procurement  contract.</p>

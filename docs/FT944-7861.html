			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Armscor finds a place in new South Africa: The close relationship has surprised most defence analysts President Nelson Mandela, one of the world's most respected statesmen, yesterday officially opened South Africa's first international defence show, a display of armour from an industry once aimed at thwarting the political movement he leads. The show is the first the country has held since the ending of the UN arms embargo in May. As air force aircraft and helicopters thundered overhead in honour of their Commander in Chief, Mr Johan Moolman, chairman of state-owned South African arms procurer Armscor, praised the government for its 'supportive role' in helping promote the domestic industry's aim of boosting its 0.4 per cent of the global arms market, worth about R800m (Pounds 144m), to 1-2 per cent. Mr Mandela was equally enthusiastic. Armscor, he said, had developed a strategic, home-grown technological base that would use its weapons sales to 'serve peace and security' rather than 'death and destruction'. The close relationship between the industry and Mr Mandela's African National Congress government has surprised most defence analysts, who had predicted the political movement would seek to dismantle or at least cut an industry that seems both incongruous and unnecessary in a post-apartheid South Africa. But Armscor has waged a successful public relations battle to win over the new administration, in part using a national advertising blitz that portrays it as a mainstay of South African industrial technology and an important foreign-exchange earner for the South African economy. 'A bee has a sting for its protection,' reads one typical ad caption, superimposed on a painting of a cuddly bee gathering pollen from a green and sunny hillside, 'South Africa has one too: Armscor'. Even the company's new slogan - 'Creating wealth, Protecting the Nation' - is adroitly designed to highlight both the industry's financial solvency and its strategic role. Mr Moolman claimed the industry, South Africa's largest manufacturing exporter, contributed R3bn a year to the economy and employed 70,000 people. Mr Joe Modise, defence minister, has long been a supporter of domestic arms manufacturers, but the government has until recently remained uncertain about backing them wholeheartedly. Mr Joe Slovo, housing minister, has reportedly urging they be scaled down. Now with Mr Mandela's official backing, Mr Modise appears to have won the day. Helping persuade the president is the fact that the industry has some genuinely competitive products to sell. Armscor was only formally created in 1977, just six months before the UN imposed its embargo, but has developed the successful G-5 and G-6 artillery pieces, generally regarded as among the world's best, as well as a range of sophisticated smaller arms and armoured vehicles. Responding to the changing political climate, in 1992 it was divided into two companies, with the rump Armscor becoming primarily a procurement agency and its manufacturing arm spun off as Denel. A Denel subsidiary, Atlas Aviation, has recently garnered much international interest with its Rooivalk attack helicopter. In line with South Africa's new international image as a model global citizen, the new Armscor has published a set of ethical principles under which its arms trade will be conducted. At the same time it has undertaken to make the trade more transparent by drawing up a list of all approved countries to which the South African industry will be permitted to sell. But even with official government support, it is not yet plain sailing. Already implicated in having sold arms to Iraq, Rwanda and the rebel Unita movement in Angola, Armscor is the subject of a judicial commission of inquiry following claims in September that it had sold 15,000 AK-47 rifles to a Lebanese arms dealer allegedly trans-shipping them to Yemen, a proscribed country because of its civil war. At the same time, officials in the defence and foreign ministries are unwilling to testify to the commission in open court about Armscor's past military relationships for fear disclosures about its secret dealings during the apartheid era will alienate many of South Africa's new allies. More important, because of an indictment served on Armscor and several other South African defence companies in 1991 by a Philadelphia grand jury on charges of illegal purchase of American defence technology during the 1980s, Denel is legally barred from doing any business with the US government or any American defence companies. This is a constraint proving costly in the European market where equipment compatibility with American norms is frequently a requirement in new weapons acquisition. But while the industry may not become the guarantor of peace Mr Mandela hopes, optimism is widespread that the exposition will boost the industry's international profile, and ethical controversies notwithstanding, Armscor's financial goals at least may prove achievable.</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Greece snowbound While airports on the east coast of the US are back to normal despite continuing cold weather, Greece's transport system was heavily disrupted over the weekend by a cold snap. The bad weather caused extensive power cuts and flooded Athens streets as temperatures sank to their lowest level this year and snow blanketed much of the country. In Athens temperatures went down to minus 3'C (26'F) over the weekend and authorities advised people to stay indoors. Few tourists and cars ventured onto the usually busy streets. Sea travel to all islands was suspended.</p>

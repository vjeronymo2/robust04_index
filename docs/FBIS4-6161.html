			<p>CSO     [Text] KDD-Developed Multiplexer Increases Digital  Circuit Capacity 8.5 Times    Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD) has developed a multiplexer used  to efficiently transmit signals over a single dedicated digital  circuit. The device is designed for use by small-scale  businesses which have a limited number of dedicated circuits and  is capable of priority transmission of compressed voice signals,  while using blank spaces among voice signals to transmit image  data via facsimile. Compared with pulse code modulation (PCM)  methods of communication, it is said that channel volume can be  increased 8.5-fold.    The newly developed multiplexer will be installed on the  output side of private branch exchanges (PBX) and digital  signals will be transmitted through the device over dedicated  circuits.    Since only about 40 percent of the time consumed for voice  communications is used for actual transmission of voice signals,  a separate set of call signals will be transmitted using the  blank spaces. Additionally, voice signals will be compressed to  a maximum of one-fifth of their original volume. This procedure  resulted in a modest drop in the quality of the voice  communication, but enabled an 8.5-fold increase in channel  volume.    Image signals are handled so that they are first accumulated  in the multiplexer and transmitted in small increments in packet  format when circuits are not congested with voice  communications. The system provides for consolidated output via  PBX, when a complete package of image data reaches the receiving  multiplexer.    Further, at the time the sending multiplexer receives an  input signal for image data, a signal is sent to the receiving  number to confirm the availability of a facsimile machine. Image  data is accumulated only when a confirmation is received and a  data receipt message is sent to the facsimile machine handling  the data input.    Whenever the multiplexer is not used, blank spaces between  signals do not occur during image data transmission and circuits  are subject to exclusive use. This being the case, businesses  with a limited number of dedicated circuits would at times be  unable to engage in voice communications during transmission of  images.    Experimental devices made by KDD have been confirmed to have  the capability to simultaneously transmit 17 types of voice  communications on one dedicated circuit assuming the capacity to  transmit at the rate of 128 kilobits per second. In the future,  KDD hopes to increase the number of terminals that can be  serviced and commercialize the device for use in international  communications directed at businesses with a limited number of  dedicated circuits.</p>

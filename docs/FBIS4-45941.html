			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi -- An overwhelming majority of the  Capital's residents believes that the USA is pro-Pakistan, that  Washington is fuelling an arms race on the sub-continent, and  that India should make the nuclear bomb.    These are some of the findings of an opinion poll conducted  over Tuesday and Wednesday among informed, regular readers of  newspapers in New Delhi by MRAS-Burke on behalf of THE PIONEER.    Asked whether in their view the USA is pro-Pakistan,  pro-India or neutral, a whopping 91 per cent of the respondents  declared that America is pro-Pakistan. More men than women feel  strongly about this. An insignificant three per cent of the  respondents said that the USA is pro-lndia and an equally small  number, four per cent, said that it is neutral.    More than four-fifths of the respondents, 84 per cent, said  that India should go ahead and make the nuclear bomb. The number  of people opposed to the bomb is just above a tenth of the  respondents. Once again, a greater proportion of men (88 per  cent) want the bomb, compared to women (74 per cent).    The poll also shows that 85 per cent of the respondents  believe that America is fuelling an arms race on the  sub-continent by supplying Pakistan with the F-16 air craft.  Those who differ with this view comprise a minuscule 11 per cent.    As for America's attempts to force India into abandoning its  missile programme, 82 per cent of the respondents said that New  Delhi should stand up and oppose Washington. Less than a fifth  of them felt that India should give in to American pressure.    While the majority of the respondents felt that India was  standing up to American pressures on nuclear and Kashmir related  issues, they were not that sure about New Delhi resisting  Washington's line on economic affairs.    For instance, while 64 per cent of the respondents said that  India was standing up to America on nuclear issues, less than 50  per cent were willing to say the same about economic affairs. In  fact as many as 45 per cent of the respondents felt that India  has not resisted American pressures on the economic front.    The support for the Government's stand on Kashmir vis-a-vis  American pressure is less than that for its stand on nuclear  issues. While 58 per cent of the respondents said that New Delhi  has resisted Washington's pressure tactics on Kashmir more than  a third rejected this view.    Interestingly. the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State. Ms  Robin Raphel's comments on Kashmir are seen as the single  biggest contributor towards upsetting Indo-American relations.  Next on the list is the U.S.-inspired dispute over India's  missile programme. followed by America's attempt to arm-twist  India at the secret London talks.    But despite their view that America is pro-Pakistan, that it  is fuelling an arms race on the subcontinent and that India  should resist all pressures and make the nuclear bomb, a vast  majority or the respondents said that Prime Minister P V  Narasimha Rao should visit the U.S.    Mr Narasimha Rao's upcoming visit was endorsed by as many as  81 per cent of the respondents, compared to 17 per cent who said  that he should abandon the trip. Interestingly, more women (88  per cent) endorsed the visit than men (77 per cent).    These findings are based on personal interviews with 307 men  and women conducted in office complexes and residential areas,  ensuring geographical spread. It was also ensured that the  respondents have a monthly household income of more than Rs  [rupees] 2,000 and read newspapers at least five days a week.  Quotas were maintained for age, sex and income to represent all  categories of people in the Capital.</p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Serb Leader Karadzic leaves Bosnian peace talks in US BOSNIAN Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said last night he was leaving the US and the latest Bosnian peace talks at the United Nations because Bosnia's Moslem president has refused to attend the talks, Reuter reports. He said he would return once all three parties - Serbs, Moslems and Croats - sat down together to negotiate. His announcement comes after Moslem forces launched an offensive to break the 10-month Serbian siege of the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. UN troops took to shelters but four French UN peacekeepers and two journalists were injured. The airport was caught in crossfire and UN humanitarian aid flights were suspended.</p>

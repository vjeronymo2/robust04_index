This was done in an emergency session of the  Saudi Cabinet, chaired by the king and held on 1 January 1994.  The 1994 budget was allocated 160 billion Saudi riyals [R]  (approximately $42.66 billion).    The substantial reduction in the Saudi budget is due to the  sharp decline in oil prices during the past three months. The  price per barrel is less than $13, and this has affected the  amount of Saudi revenues. King Fahd referred to this in his  speech on the occasion of issuing the budget. He said that the  oil economic situation and the drop in world oil prices,  resulting from increased supply, has affected Saudi income,  which has been reduced from what it used to be.    However, the Saudi king expressed his expectations that the  present oil situation would not continue as it is now and that  "this situation will change at a not far distant time, God  willing, if all oil producing countries sincerely cooperate. We  hope that this will be achieved."    King Fahd stressed the importance of maintaining the  strength  of the Saudi economy "within the bounds of available resources."  He gave support to the value of the Saudi riyal, when he  stressed the commitment to preserving its value, which has not  changed since 1986.    It was noted in the Saudi budget decrees that no reference  was made to the true volume of estimated state financial  revenues during 1994. On the contrary, the Ministry of Finance's  statement was content to say that "estimated revenue for  governmental expenditure is R160 billion." This means that the  Saudi Government will achieve a balance between estimated income  and spending in the new budget by borrowing, and that the value  of the deficit that the Saudi budget will experience has not  been determined because of the fluctuating oil prices. This has  prevented many countries that are dependent on oil for their  revenue from determining the size of their financial income. It  is said that Saudi Arabia depends on oil profits for 75 percent  of its income.    Last year's budget, totalling R197 billion or $52.5 billion,  had a deficit of R28 billion ($7.4 billion). The Saudi  Government was forced to borrow from local banks by using  development bonds to cover last year's deficit.    It was noted in the decrees for the new Saudi budget that  they did not refer to details of expenditures scheduled for each  sector, such as the education, health, military, or security  sectors. They only referred to expenditures allocated for  certain governmental organizations, such as Saudi Airlines, and  to expenditures for organizations of higher education and  research centers, which totalled R6.3 billion.    Despite the reduced spending in this year's general budget,  Saudi financial and economic circles have expressed satisfaction  with its numbers, pointing out that it continues spending for  operating contracts and construction projects authorized in the  past. The sum of R43 billion was allocated for them. This shows  governmental satisfaction vis-a-vis developing and increasing  the role played by the private sector in local economic  activity, since this sector has achieved a 5.1-percent growth.  This means that the reduction of governmental spending in this  year's budget will be compensated for by the growing economic  activity of the private sector which, during the past two years,  has proved its ability to play an important role in economic  development in the Kingdom. This is especially true since the  Saudi private sector has high liquidity capable of domestic  investment, particularly in industry, agriculture, and real  estate. Unofficial statistics estimate the private sector's  liquidity at between $14 billion and $20 billion.    Immediately after the Gulf war ended in 1991, Saudi markets  experienced a significant influx into the private sector of  Saudi capital. This capital had been abroad. This contributed  considerably to the attainment of reasonable economic growth  rates in Saudi Arabia which, last year, amounted to 1 percent,  despite world economic circumstances and the decline in oil  revenues.    In the report of the Saudi Ministry of Finance concerning  the  fiscal situation with regard to the 1994 budget, it stated: "The  1993 fiscal year saw a significant drop in world oil prices. Oil  represents the state's main financial resource, constituting 75  percent of total government income. This decline in the rate of  growth of the gross national product has affected all local  economic sectors. The growth rate during the past year was 1  percent, as it was the year before that. This is the first  report that will be audited and amended in light of final  figures, after last year's accounts are closed out. However, if  we look closely at one of the gross domestic product sectors,  the domestic sector, we find that during 1993, and according to  initial estimates, its growth was satisfactory, and was  estimated at 5.1 percent compared with last year's rate.    "This rate assures continuation of domestic sector expansion  and its increased effectiveness. It also proves the continuing  growth of the national economy's absorbing capacity, as a result  of domestic investments during the past few years.    "It is said that one of the main reasons for this  improvement  is price stability, because statistics measuring the costs of  living show that they continued to be low. The annual increase  in the last month of 1993 did not exceed 1.8 percent, compared  with the same month last year. This is a very low percentage  compared with prevailing rates in most world countries.  Statistics measuring living costs are obtained by compiling and  recording the prices of all kinds of necessities of life,  including housing, food, clothing, and any other requirements  for life. This measuring statistic represents the rate of  increase in all these sectors."    Saudi financial circles are hopeful that during the second  half of this year there will be an improvement in world oil  prices, if all producing states comply with the Gulf initiative  announced during the Riyadh summit last month. In this  initiative the Gulf states declared their willingness to reduce  their oil production levels, if producer nations will also  comply with that.</p>

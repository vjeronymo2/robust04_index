			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Manufacturing investment shows surprise fall The level of investment by British manufacturers showed a surprise fall in the third quarter of the year, official figures yesterday showed. The drop disappointed industry groups and surprised economists who had been predicting that investment, which has lagged behind the rest of the economic recovery, would pick up sharply in the coming months. Nevertheless, analysts yesterday pointed out that the quarterly investment figures were volatile and prone to revision. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that total capital spending of manufacturing industry was Pounds 2.736bn in the third quarter of this year, measured at seasonally adjusted 1990 prices. This was 1 per cent lower than the second quarter and broadly unchanged from the same period a year ago. Most of the quarterly fall stemmed from a drop in the level of investment in buildings and vehicles. New building work fell 7.3 per cent between the second and third quarters, although it remains 11 per cent higher than the third quarter of last year. Spending on vehicles fell 12 per cent in the third quarter compared with the second quarter, and remains 16 per cent below the third quarter last year. Spending on plant and machinery, which accounts for three-quarters of manufacturing investment, rose 0.8 per cent. It was barely different from the levels seen a year ago. On a sectoral basis, the main increase in investment in the quarter was in the engineering, electronic, optical and transport sectors. Investment by chemicals, metals and non-metallic mineral products companies fell. Economists had expected that investment would rise sharply, given that the corporate sector is increasingly cash rich and that recent surveys have suggested that the recent strong manufacturing growth has started to create capacity problems in some sectors. The Engineering Employers Federation, which had been predicting that a surge in investment would boost the UK engineering sector, yesterday admitted that it was 'disappointed' by the figures. Mr Ian Thompson, economist at the federation, said the figures could be affected by the system of seasonal adjustment used, which reduced the third quarter's real investment spending by about a tenth. He said: 'The published figures are disappointing but it doesn't necessarily mean that the upward trend in investment has run out of steam.' Separate indicators yesterday suggested that companies were relatively upbeat about future demand. Stocks held by manufacturers rose Pounds 181m at seasonally adjusted 1990 prices in the third quarter, compared with a Pounds 26m in the second quarter.</p>

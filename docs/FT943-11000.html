			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Arts: 'The Wreckers' resuscitated - Promenade concert Dame Ethel Smyth (1858-1944) was almost as old as Elgar, and outlived him by a decade. In this retrospective Proms centennial year, it was an excellent thing to remember this daughter of Marylebone: besides being a composer, a suffragette and a number of other interesting things she was an occasional Prom conductor. At Sunday's Prom, Odaline de la Martinez conducted her 1906 opera The Wreckers, by which she wanted 'to stand or fall'. The 'wreckers' are a poor Cornish village tribe who take it as their God-given right not only to pillage any ship wrecked on their picturesque coast (and murder any survivors), but to increase the divine bounty by putting out the lighthouse lamp whenever there is a promising storm. Their headman is a fiery pastor; his young wife and her secret lover Mark are the only moral dissidents in town. The lighthouse keeper and his daughter - Mark's rejected sweetheart - along with the tavern landlord and his young son (a breeches-role) are the remaining principals. The action is expertly contrived, with extraordinarily pungent pre-echoes of Peter Grimes. Act 1 introduces the variously troubled characters, and climaxes with the villagers' feral excitement at the prospect of another wreck; in Act 2 the dissidents light a warning beacon (rather than extinguishing it, as in Tristan) and swear eternal love, thus inviting catastrophe; in Act 3 the village condemns them to elemental death in a cavern (as in Aida, but wet instead of dry). When Dame Ethel wrote The Wreckers with her devoted Henry Brewster - in French originally, because the American Brewster had been raised there - she was already a mature, experienced composer, essentially German-trained. She could boast the friendship and approval of Clara Schumann, Brahms, Nikisch, Grieg, Tchaikovsky; the excellent programme-note by Ronald Crichton, who edited her Memoirs recently, ascribed The Wreckers' lively, colourful orchestration (hardly German at all) to Tchaikovsky's guidance. For her time, she was a determined progressive who knew - up to a point - what was going on. Sunday's performance revealed a well-made, well varied opera, original in much of its detail, eminently worth putting on. Pretty good, in short; but 'pretty good' is what many other forgotten operas are too: operas which have not entered the repertoire because they are neither quite first-class music, nor exhibits whose strongest moments outweigh the dross around them. In the music and the dramatic action alike, Dame Ethel was too sensitive to what had already been done. She understood the point of other composers' best strokes, and emulated them - very professionally, not copying - where possible. But the result lacks integral conviction: we get a first act in which some of the characters establish themselves in uncomplicated ballads, in old number-opera style (once with a sudden flash of Carmen), and a second in which the fated lovers go into Tristan mode. There I disagree with Crichton, who hears Wagner in The Wreckers only in the overture (Flying Dutchman) and in a few Ring-ish bits later. But if the long duet is not a steal from Wagner, it is clearly the work of someone who has listened hard and thoughtfully to the Tristan duet and produced her own variant of it. That sits awkwardly: it is like introducing a character as Little Bobby Shaftoe and later turning him into Tristan. In another place again, where the sea suddenly gurgles in woodwinds, Dame Ethel was surely cultivating recent memories of Pelleas. And yet it all flows creditably, and carries some passion. The flow was sometimes sluggish under Martinez's direction, but in fixed tempi the orchestral sound was balanced and bright. The anguished pastor was Peter Sidhom, the lighthouse keeper and his daughter David Wilson-Johnson and Judith Howarth, the taverner and his son Anthony Roden and Annemarie Sand: all excellent, and in a smaller role Brian Bannatyne-Scott displayed a superlative bass. The leads were more problematic. Though Anne-Marie Owens sang beautifully as the pastor's wife, her gift for invincible dignity and sobriety is not quite what that unhappy creature - intense, prickly, finally exultant - requires. As her lover, Justin Lavender needed to be a full-blooded junior Tristan; but that was not what he was built for, with his lightly elegant, objective style. It is just possible that better-cast lovers and a more fluent conductor might persuade us that The Wreckers is a Class B opera, not Class C. I doubt it, though.</p>

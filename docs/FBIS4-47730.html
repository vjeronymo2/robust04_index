			<p>BFN     [Text] Mohamed Farah Aidid, the chairman of the Somali  National Alliance, SNA, and of the United Somali Congress, today  said in a press release that the SNA welcomed the Somali  National Movement's [SNM] decision to fully participate in  meetings, conferences, and consultations aimed at reconciling  the Somali people.    Aidid said in the press release that the SNA and SNM  leadership had been meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for a  week. The SNA chairman added that the two sides had reached an  understanding to the effect that Somalia's sovereignty and  dignity was sacred. He said the SNA highly valued and welcomed  the SNM's participation in the reconciliation conferences and  consultations. Aidid further said in his press release that the  SNM's move would restore lasting peace and help the formation of  a single government and nation and the reconstruction of the  country. Aidid expressed the hope that very soon we would be  able to overcome our internal problems. In the light of the new  political initiative, he urged the international community,  particularly the donor countries, to continue to have confidence  in the Somali people's abilities to resolve their internal  differences through dialogue.</p>

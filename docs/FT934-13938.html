			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: New faces hint at WH Smith IMMINENT executive changes at WH Smith were being strongly tipped in the market ahead of the retailer's agm tomorrow. The shares advanced on the talk, which was further encouraged by a company progress report on plans to rationalise Do It All, the home improvement joint venture with Boots. The latter slipped 3 to 511p, while Smith 'A' added 9 at 469p. Most interest was stirred by suggestions that Smith will appoint a heavyweight director to beef up aspects of the company's retail operations. There was also some speculation that chairman Sir Simon Hornby will announce his retirement, although analysts were mostly sceptical. Meanwhile, Boots and Smith said that talks were continuing over how many DIY stores are to be closed as part of its review of their loss-making Do It All business. The venture has around 220 stores, of which 82 are being converted to a new format which it is claimed produces higher sales. Of the remaining 138, market sources suggest around 60 will be axed. Boots and Smith are said to be confident that up to two-thirds of those under threat of closure will be sold to other retailers. However, many stores analysts, who are pencilling in losses this year of more than Pounds 30m for Do It All, remain unconvinced of the venture's long-term future.</p>

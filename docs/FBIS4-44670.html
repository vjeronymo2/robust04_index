			<p>CSO     [Text] Aerospatiale-Missiles' new facility for testing  air-breathing engines is now up and running in Bourges. The  facility was constructed as part of France's "PREPHA" hypersonic  propulsion research program, and rounds out the three, already  existing lines for testing ramjet missile applications. The  facility will be used to validate the operation of large  engines--up to flight Mach numbers of nearly 7--on the ground.  The first tests of the PREPHA program scramjet will be conducted  there in May 1994. The new test line can now compete with the  best of those in the United States and Russia, and will be a  driving force in future European efforts to work together on  hypersonic propulsion.</p>

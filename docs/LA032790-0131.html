			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PORT DENIES SPECIFIC INTEREST IN ACQUIRING DAVE WINFIELD  </P> <P> Although Angel General Manager Mike Port acknowledged that he has had trade  talks with the New York Yankees, Port denied that he is particularly interested  in -- or close to -- acquiring outfielder Dave Winfield.  </P> <P> Port said he has spoken with the Yankees "along with six other clubs."  </P> <P> He said the presence of Angel special assignment scout Cookie Rojas at the  Yankees' camp in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., did not signify anything besides a  normal preseason evaluation of an opposing team's talent. He said Rojas was not  sent specifically to monitor the progress of Winfield, who missed last season  after undergoing surgery for back problems.  </P> <P> The Angels' need for a power hitter is obvious, and Port has said that he would  prefer a power-hitting right fielder. Port's bargaining chips are pitchers Mike  Witt and Kirk McCaskill, who are vying for the fifth spot in the starting  rotation.  </P> <P> "So far, we have nothing particular going on with the Yankees more than any  other club, and anything we have with anybody is preliminary and  investigative," Port said.  </P> <P> Port said Rojas was in Fort Lauderdale because Rojas lives in Florida and began  his trip at the Yankees' camp before working his way to other teams' camps  throughout the state.  </P> <P> "If Rich Schlenker (another special assignment scout) passes through Plant City  and happens by Cincinnati's camp and has occasion to see Eric Davis, will that  start Eric Davis rumors?" Port said. "Right now I can't tell you that we  necessarily have anything going with anyone."  </P></p>

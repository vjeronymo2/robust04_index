			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Leaders of Britain's Jewish community on Monday criticized a musical comedy  spoofing Adolf Hitler that opens this month in a London fringe theater to  coincide with the 100th anniversary of the dictator's birth. "The Adolf Hitler  Show," with actor Brian McDermott in the title role, gives a camp portrayal of  the Nazi leader appearing in an assortment of swastikas, black stockings and  suspenders. The show, scheduled to open at the Old Swan Cabaret Bar on April  27, is said to be a loosely based follow-up to the Mel Brooks' film "The  Producers," about a madcap impresario putting on a musical called "Springtime  for Hitler."

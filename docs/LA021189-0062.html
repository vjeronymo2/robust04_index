			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CARTER LEADS, BUT 66 PLAYERS FAIL TO FINISH  </P> <P> Jim Carter shot a 66 moments before darkness halted play and took a two-stroke  lead Friday in the rain-delayed and uncompleted second round of the $750,000  Hawaiian Open at Honolulu.  </P> <P> The start of play was delayed three hours by overnight rains that flooded  portions of the Waialae Country Club course.  </P> <P> Sixty-six players did not finish. They marked their positions and were set to  return at daylight this morning to complete second-round play. The third round  is scheduled to follow.  </P> <P> Carter, seeking his first victory in a tour career that started in 1987, is at  130, 14 under par.  </P> <P> Of the non-finishers, Scott Simpson appeared to be in the best position.  </P> <P> Simpson was 10 under par for the tournament with seven holes to go in  second-round play. David Ogrin also was 10 under, but he had only three holes  to play. Chip Beck was nine under with three to play.  </P> <P> At the overnight break, Gene Sauers held second place at 132 after a 67.  </P> <P> Mike Hill, who turned 50 two weeks ago and is playing in his first tournament  shot one-under-par 71 and weathered a challenge from Al Geiberger to hold on to  a one-stroke lead after two rounds of the 50th PGA Seniors Championship at Palm  Beach Gardens, Fla.  </P> <P> Hill birdied the first two holes and made par on 15 of the next 16 to finish  with a 36-hole total of six-under 138 on the windy Champion course at PGA  National.  </P> <P> Geiberger, who led by one shot after 11 holes, followed at 139 after posting a  70 that featured four birdies and bogeys on the 12th and 13th holes that  enabled Hill to regain the lead.  </P></p>

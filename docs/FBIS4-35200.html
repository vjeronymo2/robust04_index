			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza, Jerusalem Press -- For the first time since  its inception outside the occupied territories on 1 January  1965, Fatah -- the Palestinian National Liberation Movement --  has publicly opened the door of membership to its ranks.    In a statement, Fatah said the need to rebuild its  structures  is the main reason why it is inviting the Palestinians in the  Gaza Strip to join up. Fatah operated as a secret organization  until the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of  Principles on 13 September 1993.    The statement, which was signed by the Fatah Mobilization  and  Reorganization Department, announced the opening of several  offices in the Gaza Strip to enable Palestinians to join the  movement.</p>

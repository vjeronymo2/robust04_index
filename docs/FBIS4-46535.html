			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pavel Felgengauer, under rubric "Partnership": </F> "Conflict in the Atlantic: Politicians Cannot Resolve the Fate  of Russo-American Exercises"]    [Text] In the summer of 1994 the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division  and the 27th Russian Motorized Rifle Division were supposed to  have acted jointly to stop a "conflict on the island of  Atlantida [the Atlantic]," where the inhabitants of two states  (the "agrarian" one and the "industrial" one) had come to grips  because of disputed territory. It had been proposed to find  "Atlantida" on the territory of the vast Totskiy Firing Range in  the Southern Urals.    But in April the Duma enacted a special decree, "proposing"  to President Yeltsin that he cancel or transfer abroad the joint  peacekeeping Russo-American exercises. On the threshold of  signing the Treaty of Public Consent, the president shared the  fears of the Duma members and ordered the interested departments  to reconsider the need for the exercises and the time for  holding them.    However, among the country's highest military leadership the  politicians' actions caused irritation. If the peacekeeping  exercises at the Totskiy Firing Range actually threaten Russia's  national interests, then, as a result, the Russian generals who  agreed to conducting the exercise automatically fall into the  category of traitors. And, naturally, the generals did not like  that.    In the discussion concerning the Totskiy exercises, Russia's  higher and higher military leadership acted as a single front.  Defense Minister General Pavel Grachev: "The attempt is being  made to disrupt the peacekeeping exercises, but if we want to  remove the image of the enemy and to proceed toward partnership,  the exercises must be conducted." Chief of General Staff General  Kolesnikov: "Public opinion is being specially heated up by  people who do not know, or who pretend not to know, what a  command post exercise is."    However, the influence of the Ministry of Defense in the  Duma, the Kremlin, and the White House is limited. Therefore no  one has yet made any intelligible decision concerning whether to  conduct the exercises, and, if so, where and when. The American  partners are also perplexed. Last week 3rd Division commander  General Holder was supposed to arrive in Moscow (with a  delegation), in order to carry out the final coordination of the  exercise details, but our military men were forced to "recommend  the cancellation of the trip," inasmuch as, properly speaking,  there was not yet anything to coordinate.    On 27 May General Schroeder, deputy commander of U.S. troops  in Europe and the chief coordinator of the exercises on the  American side, met on his own initiative with Colonel-General  Eduard Vorobyev, who is responsible for the exercises on the  Russian side, in the hope of ascertaining at least something  definite. But General Vorobyev was able only to express the hope  that the exercises would indeed by held, perhaps even in  August-September of this year. In the autumn or winter it will  be difficult for American infantry to survive in Totskiy. In the  opinion of the military, 15 September is the extreme date for  holding exercises in 1994. At the same time the proposal to  conduct Russo-American exercises in the United States or on  neutral territory will, obviously, be "brought down" in one form  or another. Our generals will scarcely agree to expend the  limited funds in the defense budget to transfer troops to  conduct a symbolic operation.    During the next few weeks Russian politicians will have to  make the final decision about whether or not to hold the  exercises this summer. Incidentally, an official representative  of the U. S. Defense Department expressed to a SEGODNYA  correspondent his satisfaction with the work that has already  been done: in the course of preparation for the exercises, the  military of the two countries have been able to prepare a joint  manual for the holding of peacekeeping operations, which may  prove to be useful in the future.</p>

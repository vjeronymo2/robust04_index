The treaty will take effect once the two  countries' congresses ratify it.    The treaty was an idea proposed during the last OAS General  Assembly in Managua. It was signed by Chilean Foreign Minister  Enrique Silva Cimma and Nicaraguan Ambassador to Santiago  Roberto Ferrey.    Chilean Justice Minister Francisco Cumplido characterized  the  ceremony as "very important," adding that the agreement is a  step forward in the fight against crimes whose effect go beyond  national borders, such as terrorism and drug trafficking.    Cumplido made it clear that the new treaty will have no  effect on the extradition petition for Chilean ultra-leftist  leader Sergio Bushman that Chile presented to Nicaragua months  ago.    Bushman, a high-ranking Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front  (FPMR) leader, has been sought by Chilean justice since 1987  when he broke out of a Valparaiso jailhouse while standing trial  for the contraband of weapons for use against General Augusto  Pinochet's military regime (1973-90).    Bushman lived a few years in Sweden and then moved to  Nicaragua, where he lives as a political refugee spending his  time dedicated to the theater, according to what he told  journalists.    Francisco Cumplido said he hoped the Bushman case will be  resolved before the new treaty takes effect following its  ratification by the Chilean and Nicaraguan Congresses.    Foreign Ministry Legal Department sources said Bushman's  extradition petition currently is being studied by the  Nicaraguan Supreme Court.</p>

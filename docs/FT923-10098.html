			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Complex reopens after bombing THE MAIN shopping centre at Milton Keynes was reopened in stages yesterday after more than 100 police and bomb disposal officers had worked through the night to deal with firebombs, John Thornhill writes. Two of the bombs exploded in Habitat and BHS, causing only localised damage. Five others were defused and one was let off under controlled conditions. The police condemned the attack as 'horrific and callous' and called in the anti-terrorist branch. No one has yet claimed responsibility. There have been similar incidents in recent months at shopping centres in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, and Brent Cross, north London. The IRA admitted responsibility for the attacks at the Gateshead MetroCentre in May and Brent Cross last December, saying that it wanted to increase the 'economic cost of disruption'.</p>

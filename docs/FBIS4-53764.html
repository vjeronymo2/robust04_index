			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, May 22 (ANTARA) -- Visiting South Korean  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu here Sunday confirmed that Seoul  is expecting Indonesia's support for its plan to apply for a UN  Security Council [UNSC] non-permanent membership for 1996-1997.    "We are expecting that South Korea and Indonesia will be  able  to get seats at the UNSC. And we are expecting that Indonesia  will fully support our plan," said Han on arrival at Cengkareng  International Airport.    Indonesia is also planning to apply for a seat at UNSC for  the same period.    The visiting minister said that his country's expectation to  have full support from Indonesia is on the grounds that  Indonesia as chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement plays  important roles in world affairs.    "Indonesia plays important roles not only in United Nations  affairs but also in maintaining peace in the eastern Asia  region," he stressed. He termed Indonesia's role in maintaining  peace in the eastern Asia region crucial and helpful. Han said  that he had also conveyed his country's expectation to other  countries such as Thailand and Vietnam.    Asked about issues he would discuss with President Suharto,  he revealed that one of the topics would be the problem of  nuclear weapon in the Korean peninsula.    On the occasion, the minister also confirmed that South  Korea's President Kim Yong-sam will attend the forthcoming Asia  Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders meeting in November  this year in Jakarta.    Han is scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Alatas on  Monday and President Suharto the following day. He said that  the two sides would discuss ways to deepen, strengthen and  expand ties between Indonesia and South Korea.    Han's visit to Indonesia is the first made by a South Korean  minister since the establishment of a civilian government in the  northeastern Asian country in 1992.</p>

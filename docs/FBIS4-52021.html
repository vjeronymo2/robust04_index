			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hideo Tamura; from the "The Hata Administration: </F> Mounting Problems" series; part two of a three-part series:  "Japan Should Open Its Market and Give Priority to Consumers:  Politicians' Leadership of Bureaucrats Indispensable"]    [Text] Although the domestic "political vacuum" is to be  dissolved with the formation of the Hata administration, there  is no prospect of filling the vacuum which has existed in  Japan-U.S. economic relations since the February summit was  broken off.  <H5>  Japan and the United States Are in a State of Drift </H5>   It is attributable to the bureaucrats that Japan did not  compromise at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. Noticing  this, the Clinton administration is assuming an attitude "of  neglect" toward Japanese bureaucrats. U.S. Trade Representative  (USTR) Kantor has given strict orders to Under Secretary of  State Joan Spero, Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten,  and other members of under secretary-class in charge of  negotiations with Japan "not to meet with Japanese bureaucrats."    On the other hand, Japan has not changed its principle that  "numerical targets should never be accepted" (Ministry of  Foreign Affairs). An uncompromising argument is spreading  within the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI]  that "for at least the next two years, while President Clinton  is in power, it will be impossible to have serious talks with  the U.S. Government." Sources in the U.S. State Department say  without doubt that "Japan-U.S. relations are in a state of  drift."    Presently, Japan-U.S. relations are similar to the "game of  chicken" performed by James Dean and his rival in the movie  Rebel Without a Cause. In the game, the one who  takes the most risks becomes the winner. In the movie, a tough  guy who was supposed to be the winner dies in an accident. In  the game of chicken there is no real winner.    The United States has come through difficult international  negotiations such as arms reductions with the former USSR, and  with the end of the Cold War is focusing its attention on the  Japanese market. Japan has undertaken a policy of concentrating  authority with the economic bureaucrats. We have now entered an  era when the two countries, Japan and the United States, compete  with one another in "economic" field.    In the United States, business circles and Congress, which  are asking that Japan open its market and show objective  criteria to ensure that its trade surplus is being reduced, are  also putting pressure on the Clinton administration. In Japan,  political leaders have been entrusting negotiations to the  bureaucrats who claim "it is suicidal for Japan to introduce  macroeconomics and establish numerical targets in an individual  sector."    Anxiety exists in both Japan and the United States. Even  within the Clinton administration, which has been saying  positively that "the lack of success in the economic talks does  not affect Japan-U.S. relations as a whole," a voice is  beginning to be raised that, "if no agreement is reached at the  next summit, we are not sure what will become of Japan-U.S.  relations".    According to this logic, the Japan-U.S. summit to be held in  Naples in July during the G-7 meeting will be the time limit to  avoid the crisis.  <H5>  Japanese Politicians Rely on Bureaucrats' Judgment </H5>   Japanese bureaucrats of the Ministry of Finance and MITI do  feel anxiety that Asia and the world may be affected should  discord arise between Japan and the United States, which both  possess 40 percent of the world's gross national product and  which are both deepening their interdependent relations in  international finance and industry.    Despite the potential crisis, the United States maintains  its  request that numerical targets be established, and the Japanese  bureaucrats refuse this request. Together with Prime Minister  Hosokawa, Hata has relied totally on the judgment of the  bureaucrats since he was foreign minister.    The U.S. strategy toward Japan is clear. The United States  intends to drag down from negotiations those bureaucrats who are  causing delays in deregulating the Japanese market, who are  asking that the prime minister increase rather than reduce  taxes, and who negotiate directly with political leaders. The  real intention of the United States is to negotiate directly  with Prime Minister Hata and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]  Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who is an embarrassment to the  Japanese bureaucrats with his "ready-to-compromise" attitude  toward the United States, and by all means to attain visible  results.    However, leading Foreign Ministry officials seem to be  confident, saying, "Hata even argued down USTR Kantor when  Kantor claimed that past commercial negotiations were not  fruitful. It is impossible for Hata to accept numerical  targets."    Ozawa played the role of mediator at the recent cellular  phone talks, bringing about this political solution. Criticism  was raised in the United States that "the USTR had cooperated in  clearing Motorola's outdated analog mobile phone stock." It has  become necessary for Japan Mobile Communication Co., Ltd. to  make double capital investments in order to introduce digital  mobile phones. Bureaucrats claim a "political solution" is not  necessarily the best solution.    Even if the economic framework talks were reopened in a  similar style, the result would be fruitless and there would be  no winner. There would be left only a feeling of distrust, and  Japan-U.S. relations would be further aggravated. It would be  for the worst if discord is created between Japan and the United  States, especially in light of the nuclear suspicions involving  the DPRK, which is likely to require much time to solve, and the  increasing tensions on the Korean peninsula.  <H5>  To Open Its Market Is Japan's International Responsibility </H5>   What is required of the new administration is to neither  compromise one-sidedly nor refuse totally. Aside from numerical  targets requested by the United States, it is Japan's own  international responsibility to "open the Japanese market." It  is beneficial if government institutions purchase U.S.-made  supercomputers and medical instruments which are based on fair  appraisals and which are more competitive than Japanese  products. It is moral for automobile manufacturers doing  business in a free market to voluntarily open their network to  foreign automobile manufacturers and to purchase foreign-made  parts at a lower price.    The United States is asking Japan to open its pension  market.  The Pension Welfare Service Public Corporation and investment  advisory companies also admit that the pension burden of the  people and enterprises will be reduced if the regulations placed  by the Ministry of Finance are removed, and if they can freely  entrust the operation of their public pensions and private  enterprise annuities to European and American investment  advisory companies and financial institutions which can earn  higher returns through investment in assets. In short, the  capability of the political leaders is to be tested by whether  or not they can direct the bureaucrats to "give priority to  consumers," which is a matter of course.    Though the Hata coalition government claims it will follow  the lines of the Hosokawa administration, it is also possible  that the new administration might adopt an easygoing manner,  thinking "it is merely playing the role of a transitional  government." If the new administration follows the same style  in dealing with the United States, it could cause a calamity.  The leadership is in a serious position to take responsibility.</p>

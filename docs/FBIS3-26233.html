			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shanghai, 31 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) --  Statistics recently published by relevant authorities here  indicate that over 47,000 foreign exchange dealings were  conducted at Shanghai Foreign Exchange Regulation Center in  1993, the total volume of these transactions being $5.294  billion, both figures representing over 30 percent increases  when compared with the previous year.    Analysts in the monetary sector observed the following  characteristics of the foreign exchange transactions in Shanghai  last year:    1. There was a boom of member brokers at the foreign  exchange  regulation center, from 15 at the time of founding to more than  40. Half of them are foreign financial institutions. A number  of foreign banks carried out transactions at the center.    2. The volume of transactions in which Chinese and foreign  member brokers represent clients to participate in foreign  exchange trading exceeded the volume of transactions conducted  between dealers themselves, thus playing a mainstay role in the  exchange market.    3. Spot exchange dealings took up a large proportion in the  total volume of transactions.    4. Though the exchange market price experienced big  fluctuations, the rate stabilized at around one U.S. dollar to  8.70 yuan starting last August. According to statistics, last  year's weighted mean was one U.S. dollar to 8.7207 yuan.    5. Investing enterprises from abroad sold more exchange than  they bought.    6. The foreign exchange regulation market supplied 85  percent of the exchange used for import and export nationwide.  Shanghai had a 20 percent share of this market.    Members of the monetary sector pointed out: In a short space  of five years after the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Regulation  Center was founded, its annual transaction volume rose from $730  million to nearly 5.3 billion. This shows a strong growth  momentum. They were convinced that with the opening of China  Foreign Exchange Transaction Center in Shanghai in the near  future, Shanghai's foreign exchange dealings will be more active  and mature.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Raidi, executive deputy secretary of the Tibet </F> Autonomous Regional CPC Committee, at a regional meeting on 22  May; place not given: "Tibet's Current Antisplittist Struggle  Situation and Task To Stabilize the Situation"]    [Text] Comrades:    Today, the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee and  Government are holding a special meeting of leading cadres with  party membership at the provincial and prefectural levels. I  would like to take this opportunity to brief you on some current  developments in Tibet's antisplittist struggle, to analyze the  current antisplittist struggle situation, and to lay down a plan  for our next-step work. My purpose is to enable party and  government organizations and leading cadres at all levels to  gain an in-depth understanding of the antisplittist struggle  situation currently facing Tibet, to further unify their  thinking, to increase their initiative and enhance their  self-consciousness in carrying out the antisplittist struggle,  and to strengthen their confidence that we will win the  struggle, in order to further stabilize Tibet's situation and to  ensure that our reform, opening up, and economic construction  are carried out smoothly. Comrade Zicheng just briefed you on  the new developments in Tibet's current antisplittist struggle.  According to the guidelines of a study conducted by the  regional CPC committee, I would like to offer a few opinions on  Tibet's current antisplittist struggle situation and our task of  stabilizing the situation.  <H5>  1. An Analysis of Tibet's Current Antisplittist Struggle </H5> Situation    This year is a critical one for the country to take an  important step toward building a socialist market economic  system, to achieve breakthrough progress in attaining reform,  and to further speed up economic development. This year also is  one for Tibet to raise its reform, opening up, and economic  development to a new level. The central authorities have  decided to hold this year the third meeting on work related to  Tibet to study important principles and policies on Tibet's  economic and social development and stability in the new  situation. The meeting will have extremely great significance  for maintaining Tibet's long-term stability. Next year marks  the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the Tibet  Autonomous Region; starting in the second half of this year, the  party Central Committee and the State Council will assist Tibet  in building a number of key projects to accelerate Tibet's  economic development. All in all, a new climax will emerge this  year in Tibet's economic construction and socialist development  -- Tibet's development prospects are encouraging.    As for Tibet's antisplittist struggle situation, over the  years, the CPC Committee, the government, military, police, and  people of Tibet, under the correct leadership of and the timely  guidance provided by the party Central Committee, the State  Council, and the Central Military Commission, have done a great  deal of antisplittist work and have won important victories.  Currently, Tibet's antisplittist struggle situation is good in  general -- the whole region is enjoying political stability,  social stability, and nationalities unity; people feel assured,  and our border defenses are strong, thus providing a good social  climate for smoothly carrying out the region's reform, opening  up, and economic construction and for continuing to improve the  people's living standards. Nevertheless, the hostile  international forces and splittists both inside and outside the  country, due to their class nature, will never take their defeat  lying down. They have done everything they can to step up their  splittist and sabotage activities; therefore, the antisplittist  struggle situation facing us is severe, and the task is quite  arduous. The main reasons for this are:    The hostile international forces have adopted a hostile  attitude toward the socialist system and consider China's  unification and power to be threats to themselves. Splittists  outside the country have stepped up their collusion with Western  hostile forces, have distorted the facts, have spread rumors to  mislead people, and have attacked China's domestic and foreign  policy, vainly attempting to exert international pressure on us.    Splittist elements at home have colluded with the splittist  forces outside the country and have stepped up their splittist  activities in cities, agricultural and pastoral areas, and  temples in some localities in Tibet. Some localities have  opposed slogans and handbills, the numbers of witches and  sorcerers have increased in some localities, and rumors of  various sorts have been spread widely, causing anxiety for  people in some grass-roots areas.    Due to infiltrations and instigations by splittist elements  outside the country, a small number of our cadres and workers  have wavered in their political stand. Party and government  organizations and leading cadres at all levels should be  prepared for danger in times of peace and should have a sober  understanding of the problems and the intense and complicated  antisplittist struggle we are facing. We should have a clear  understanding of the situation and our tasks, do our work well,  and stand in combat readiness, in order to foil possible  dangers. Being indifferent and in a state of inertia will bring  serious and unmendable damage to the party's work and the  nation's interests.  <H5>  II. It is Necessary To Look Squarely at Tibet's Weak Links </H5> in Stabilizing the Situation    In recent years, party and government organizations at  various levels in Tibet, particularly the broad masses of cadres  and policemen on the judicial, procuratorial, and public  security fronts including public security organs and armed  police, and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet have  always upheld the principle of "promoting economic construction,  reform, and opening up, as well as engaging in antisplittist  struggle and stabilizing the situation." They have vigorously  and actively launched the antisplittist struggle, forcefully  dealt a blow at the swollen arrogance of the splittist forces  inside and outside the region, and made fruitful contributions  to consolidating the frontier defense, maintaining the  unification of the motherland, enhancing national unity,  maintaining a stable situation in Tibet, and ensuring the smooth  progress of economic construction, reform, and opening up. While  fully confirming these achievements, however, we should also  have a clear understanding that there are still some problems  and inconsistencies in our work for combating splittism and  stabilizing the situation. They are mainly the inconsistencies  in ideology and work which are not suitable to the situation and  remain to be further settled and corrected, so that we may  better gain the initiative in the antisplittist struggle and  more effectively intensify the work in stabilizing the situation.    First of all, we should look into the inconsistencies in  ideology. We have talked about the importance and significance  of a stable situation for years and it should be confirmed that  the vast majority of our leading cadres have a fairly clear  understanding of this issue and have attached more importance to  the work in stabilizing the situation. However, we should also  be aware that there are, actually, some comrades who do not pay  enough attention to this issue. Upon hearing the regional party  committee's repeated emphasis on the work in stabilizing the  situation, some comrades believed it was just an exaggeration to  raise an alarm and took exception to it. They lowered their  guard and became careless in ideology, paid no attention to  their work, did nothing to implement measures, and paid lip  service only; even if they did do something, they did it in a  perfunctory way, just enough to satisfy the demand of the higher  authorities. Some people even showed disgust at and turned a  deaf ear to the talk about launching antisplittist struggle and  stabilizing the situation. Some comrades also maintained: "We  should concentrate our strength on economic construction at  present; repeated emphasis on the work for stabilizing the  situation will affect the economic work; stability and unity  will naturally be achieved once the economy is developed." Such  a perception that antagonizes the stable situation against  economic development and that simply stresses economic work is  untenable in theory and very harmful, even dangerous, in  practice. In Tibet, the party's central work is economic  construction; strengthening a stable situation is exactly the  work to offer a powerful guarantee for economic construction,  reform, opening up, and the creation of a good milieu. Stability  is the premise, reform is the driving force, and development is  the foundation; the relations among the three should not be  ignored at any time. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping put it: "China's  problem is the need for stability, which overrides everything  else. Without a stable environment, we would achieve nothing  and lose the achievements we have made. The key to our  promotion of four modernizations, reform, and opening up lies in  stability." These expositions of Comrade Xiaoping's have  incisively expounded the dialectical relations among stability,  development, and reform. The splittist activities and sabotage  conducted by splittists inside and outside Tibet are a reality  independent of our will; only through conducting a firm  antisplittist struggle and incessant work in strengthening a  stable situation can we guarantee and promote economic  development. Meanwhile, only by doing a good job in reform and  development can we create a material foundation for social  stability and enhance the cohesiveness among the people. General  Secretary Jiang Zemin has noted: "Everybody must understand the  importance of social and political stability in an attitude that  he or she is highly responsible to the party, the state, and the  nation, uphold the principle of promoting material civilization  and socialist ethics at the same time, eliminate the factors  causing instability in a timely manner, continue to maintain the  stability of milieu, and ensure the smooth progress of the  reform, opening up, and modernization drive." Party,  government, military, and police leaders at various levels  should all treat deepening reform, accelerating development, and  maintaining stability as the overall interest of the entire  party's work.    Next, we must be aware of the problems existing in our work  and measures. Due to subjective and objective reasons, a number  of problems still exist in our antisplittist struggle and in our  work to maintain stability. Some of them are comparatively  serious. For instance, comparatively serious problems exist in  the propaganda of public opinion and border control. They are  extremely serious in smoothly waging the struggle against  splittism, maintaining stability, safeguarding the unification  of the motherland, and strengthening unity among nationalities.  Therefore, we must on no account drop our guard against these  problems or become insensitive to them; we must take strong  measures to solve them; we must guard against recurrence of  similar phenomenon.    Third, we must be aware of some problems concerning impurity  and ineffective work on the part of our party members and  cadres. Because the splittist forces inside and outside Tibet  use religion to conduct infiltration, some of our party members  and cadres have lost the ideological consciousness that a  communist should have. They make concessions and become weak in  the antisplittist struggle. We must deal with the problem in  earnest and make vigorous efforts to successfully solve the  problem existing within the contingents of cadres, staff, and  workers, so as to ensure their purity, and to guarantee that our  contingents are invincible in the antisplittist struggle.  <H5>  III. Take Effective Measures and Practically Improve the </H5> Work To Maintain Stability    At a work conference held by the regional party committee  and  the regional people's government in August last year, I proposed  measures for and raised requirements on improving our  understanding of the protractedness, complicatedness, and  arduousness of the antisplittist struggle; improving education  as well as our ideological and political work; promoting  development of the party and government organizations at the  grass-roots level; stepping up propaganda to the outside world;  improving comprehensive management of public security; giving  full play to the dictatorship functions of judicial and public  security departments; strengthening control over temples and  religious activities; and strengthening leadership over the work  to maintain stability. These measures and requirements are  still suitable now. It is necessary for us to further  practically pay close attention to their implementation. Based  on these measures and requirements, I would like to express my  views as follows which are directed against the new situation of  antisplittist struggle in Tibet.    We must further have a clear understanding of the situation,  seek unity of thinking, and enhance our initiative for the  antisplittist struggle. So long as the international hostile  forces and splittists inside and outside Tibet exist, the  antisplittist struggle shall be carried on for a protracted  period of time to come. This is an objective law independent of  our will. Our struggle against splittists inside and outside  Tibet is, in essence, a class struggle under the new situation.  The reactionary forces they represent will never resign  themselves to stepping down from the stage of history. They  vainly attempt to regain the dominant position they have lost.  We must keep a clear head against this; we must not, in the  slightest degree, lower our guard or tend to underestimate the  enemy. All our party and government organizations at all levels  must continue to implement in depth the principle of "grasping  two links at the same time"; always treat the work to maintain  stability as an important matter and handle it earnestly and  painstakingly; conscientiously shoulder the political  responsibility of maintaining stability; and pay close attention  to doing a good job of waging the antisplittist struggle and  maintaining stability in a down-to-earth manner while  successfully carrying out economic construction. The key to the  success of our work to maintain stability lies in leadership.  The regional party committee requires party and government  leaders in all prefectures, cities, and units to personally  concern themselves with the work to maintain stability; to  constantly study the situation and problems confronting their  respective localities and units; to draw up plans; and to lead  the broad masses of cadres, staff, and workers to vigorously  wage the antisplittist struggle. In the face of cardinal issues  of right and wrong, leading cadres must take a clear-cut stand  and adopt a resolute attitude. The attitude of leading cadres  to the antisplittist struggle is the fundamental political  criterion for judging whether they are qualified or not.    It is necessary to strengthen ideological and educational  work for the masses. Splittist elements at home and abroad are  good at covering up their real face, confusing and poisoning  people's minds, and influencing public opinion by flaunting the  national and religious banners and by making a pretense of  so-called "human rights," "democracy," and "freedom." They are  notoriously deceitful and inflammatory. We must use various  public opinion tools and propaganda techniques to make the  following points clear: the people of Tibetan nationality can  enjoy happiness today and glory tomorrow only under the  leadership of the party and inside the great family of the  motherland; the splittist elements at home and abroad are old  Tibet's ruling clique who represent the interests of a few serf  owners and exploiting class; they cruelly oppressed and  exploited the Tibetan people in the past; they try in every  possible way to resume their ruling position of the past by  advocating "Tibet independence"; and the activities engaged in  by splittist elements at home and abroad will bring about damage  to the Tibetan people and the development in Tibet. We must  help the broad masses of the people obtain a better  understanding of the true class nature and political motivation  of these people. Resolute efforts should be made to fight  against their attempts to split the motherland. Tibet is under  the rule of the Communist Party and will stay that way forever.    We must resolutely foil splittist elements' attempts to  infiltrate into the region through various channels. All  reactionary propaganda materials brought into the region by  splittist elements at home and abroad through various channels  should be confiscated in accordance with law. Any one who  brings, sells, disseminates, and spreads reactionary propaganda  materials should be severely dealt with in accordance with law.  We should take quick action to crack down on severe criminal  activities. It is necessary to strengthen investigations into  severe criminal cases such as murders, robberies, drug  trafficking, and thefts in a bid to increase the case-solving  percentage, and deal out quick and severe punishment to the  offenders in accordance with law. We should comprehensively  consolidate public security and order, and conscientiously carry  out the principle of "those who are in charge of the affairs  should be held responsible." Each department should perform  its own functions well and make sure that all of its personnel  are honest and integrated. We should conscientiously improve  the social security order in our region.    All localities and units should strengthen ideological and  political work under their jurisdiction, improve inner  management, and plug all loopholes. In the light of ideological  problems existing among workers and staff members, proper  efforts should be made to conduct, in a timely and thoroughgoing  fashion, an ideological and political campaign among them.  Before introducing a reform measure which has great bearing on  the interests of the people, all departments concerned should  conduct a propaganda campaign to explain the necessity of the  measure. No measures should be introduced to the public and put  into force unless they are approved by the regional CPC  committee and the government. Under no circumstances shall we  allow any department or unit to take selfish actions at the  expense of the people's interests. It is necessary to  strengthen price supervision so as to invigorate circulation and  safeguard the interests of the people. We should provide more  employment opportunities for youths, improve business  management, enhance economic performance, and increase the  income of workers, staff members, and residents. Departments  concerned and governments at all levels should make efforts to  show their concern about the enterprises experiencing financial  losses and about workers, staff members, residents, and retired  personnel with difficulties in their livelihood. These  organizations should try their best to help them. They should  try in every possible way to help poverty-stricken households in  agricultural and pastoral areas, and the people who cannot  afford to buy grain or medicine. Relevant departments and units  should try to solve the problems which the people complain about  strongly, as well as reasonable requests put forward by them.  If such problems and requests cannot be solved immediately,  these departments and units should explain this to the people  and, at the same time, report them to higher authorities.    Comrades, we are facing a grim situation in the fight  against  splittism, and the arduous task of promoting stability, reform,  and development. For each and every member of the communist  party, and leading cadres in particular, this is a severe  challenge. It is also a test of our party spirit. Every member  of the Communist Party should take a firm and clear-cut stand in  the front line of the struggle against splittism. They should  bring into full play the vanguard and model role as a member of  the Communist Party by carrying out resolute struggle against  all moves that try to split the motherland and sabotage the  unity among all nationalities. We should unite with all the  forces that can be united, mobilize the enthusiasm of all social  sectors, strengthen the patriotic united front work on the basis  of closely relying on the people, and bring into full play the  special role of patriotic personages of all nationalities and  all circles, as well as personages in religious circles, in the  work of fighting against splittism and maintaining stability so  as to guarantee the healthy and smooth development of reform,  opening, and economic construction.</p>

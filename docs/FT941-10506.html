			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Observer: Fly in Jo'burg soup A private lunch in Johannesburg yesterday offered an intriguing insight into both the African National Congress and one of South Africa's leading newspaper groups. Host was David Kovarsky, chief executive of Times Media, whose publications include Business Day, the Sunday Times and the Financial Mail. Guest of honour was ANC president Nelson Mandela. Surprisingly absent, as a result of ANC objections, was Nigel Bruce, editor of the Financial Mail. Bruce was paying the price for having offended Pallo Jordan, a member of the ANC executive and the organisation's information supremo; Jordan was invited to the lunch. Three years ago Bruce, in an article on South Africa's service sector, referred to Johannesburg waiters as 'truculent tribesmen with a thumb in the soup and an eye on the clock'. When the ANC received Kovarsky's invitation to lunch, Jordan made clear that he and Mandela would only attend if the author of this slur was not present. Two weeks ago Bruce wrote to Jordan accepting that the comment might have been in poor taste, expressing 'sincere regret' if it had caused offence, but saying that he did not deserve to be branded a racist on this account. Jordan spurned the olive branch and, with Kovarsky's reluctant approval, Bruce withdrew from the lunch, saying to Jordan: 'I do not wish to force my company on you or anyone else.' What's for dessert?</p>

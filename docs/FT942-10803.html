			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Management: Old soldiers do not fade away - It's time to put an end to age discrimination Stereotypes about older employees give rise to a great deal of prejudice. That is obvious to the middle-aged manager who becomes unemployed and has to start applying for jobs. Invalid negative stereotypes, though, also determine what happens to people who are still in work. These have been reinforced in recent years by the widespread encouragement of early retirement for many managers. Those individuals are thereby publicly defined as 'too old', and as a result negative attitudes to other people of the same age become even more fixed. Research has indicated that the stereotypes applied in decision-making about older workers are widely incorrect. The mental decline that takes place up to the mid-60s is very small, and is limited to only a few types of information- processing. In most activities, there is no overall difference between the work performance of older and younger staff. Furthermore, older employees have available depths of knowledge and expertise built up over years of relevant experience. Prejudice against older staff is often seen in decisions taken about the provision of training at different ages. Many companies restrict learning opportunities at older ages, for instance by emphasising that individuals cannot be spared from their immediate work activities. Two surveys by the London School of Economics have found that the amount of training declines rapidly as a manager gets older. This is despite the belief (expressed by nearly 90 per cent) that 'the business environment is changing so rapidly that managers need more training than in the past'. As a result of this age-imbalance, older managers can become out of practice as learners, and they sometimes feel uneasy about entering new training situations. But that is not to say that they cannot learn. Other research has shown that older individuals can acquire new skills and knowledge, especially when learning involves practical activities rather than being merely abstract and unused. Older learners, in particular, benefit from opportunities to turn into action the general principles and specific facts which need to be acquired. So what to do? First, throw out the overall negative stereotype. Look at the person, not at his or her age. Second, if some staff changes are essential, ensure that early retirement or age-based redundancy are not automatically viewed as the primary option. Think initially about other routes to competitiveness, through job redesign, lateral transfers, training and other procedures which can utilise important expertise and knowledge. Third, if a number of older managers have to be asked to leave, seek to retain their skills through some form of subsequent contract, perhaps intermittent or part-time, or perhaps as a consultant. Fourth, and most fundamentally, work towards a culture of adaptability at all ages. Current levels of competition and the pace of change mean that new ideas, procedures and products must be sought all the time. The best way to develop adaptability is to keep people learning. It often makes sense to plan the movement of managers sideways to different jobs, where new demands will be placed upon them. It is clear that flatter organisations will require career ladders to be shorter. In a corporate culture of continued learning, the strengths of the older manager can be a foundation for company success. At present, too many organisations are responding to a socially-fashionable idea that youth is best. Research makes it clear that neither youth nor age is in fact best: it all depends on the individual. The author is a research professor at the Centre for Economic Performance, LSE.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ECOLOGY SURVEY: AT THE CROSSROADS  </P> <P> At the Crossroads was a very well-written and researched summary of the  environmental problems which ail Southern California and of the hard choices we  will face in the near future.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, a glaring omission in the discussion of the causes and proposed  solutions was made. Nowhere it was mentioned that the rapid local immigration  and population growth are among the underlying causes of the disruption of  Southern California's environment, and so population control must figure high  in the solution list of our problems.  </P> <P> In Moscow the press can openly debate the old communist taboos. Will The Times  be able to do the same with the obsolete cliches of unbridled immigration and  population growth?  </P> <P> CLAUDIO PARAZZOLI  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

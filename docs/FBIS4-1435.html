			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with ANC President Nelson Mandela by Shaun </F> Johnson, Kaizer Nyatsumba, Esther Waugh, and Chris Whitfield at  Mandela's Houghton home on 23 April]    [Text]  <H5>  On prospects for a peaceful election </H5>   [Mandela] I have assurances from both the SAP [South African  Police] and SADF [South African Defense Force] that they are  going to be ruthless against anybody who tries to interfere with  the elections. They have briefed me on detailed plans which  they are adopting. That does not mean that there will not be  areas where it will be difficult to (have a free and fair vote),  because the country is very big. The SADF and SAP may not be  strong enough to deploy men throughout the country, to cover  every area. There many be isolated cases where it will not be  possible for people to vote at all, but generally speaking I am  convinced from the plans I have seen that we have taken all the  precautions that are necessary.  <H5>  On F.W. de Klerk </H5>   [Mandela] In spite of all the quarrels we've had with Mr. de  Klerk, he remains quite an interesting chap. He is big. Some  of our most unpleasant quarrels have been on a one-on-one basis  -- we've said very cruel things to each other. One of the  things that (angered) me was the fact that he did not use his  capacity to stop the violence, when he could do so. This was  the major cause of conflict between us, but he has the capacity  of quarreling with you, and the next moment shaking hands and  sitting down to coffee. I don't think we're going to have  trouble from Mr. de Klerk. I think we're going to work with him  very smoothly.  <H5>  On the mood of the country </H5>   [Mandela] The people have high expectations and though we  have warned them repeatedly that to address their basic needs is  going to take years, nevertheless there are those expectations.  It is something we must warn against. But the dominating thing  is that we are entering a very exciting period and we are  approaching that with real enthusiasm -- spirits are high.  There's been a shift in the country's mood from fear to  excitement. My impression is of a feeling of hope.  <H5>  On fears of post-election anarchy </H5>   [Mandela] There have been prophets of doom suggesting that  after April 29, our people are going to run riot attacking  property and individuals and that there is going to be chaos. I  don't think so. I've been warning against that. People must  not concentrate very much on what happened in Bophuthatswana. I  condemned that in the strongest terms. I said if we find any  member of the ANC to be involved in such activities, we will  expel him because we don't want criminals in our organisation.  So now we are taking precautions to ensure that our people are  properly informed as to how to behave if we manage to be  victorious in this election. Our people have written to all the  regional executive committees indicating programmes in which our  people should be involved, so they should not think in terms of  looting and other forms of lawlessness.  <H5>  On the future of whites </H5>   [Mandela] We attach a great deal of importance to whites. In  spite of all the criticism we have made about apartheid, the  reality is that whites have had opportunities we have not had.  They have had education, they have got knowledge, skills and  expertise. We want that knowledge and expertise now that we are  building our country. That is why I have appealed to them  repeatedly not to leave the country at this particular moment,  and even to ask those who have left to come back. Because we  are going to need them, we are gong to rely on them.  <H5>  On the Government of National Unity [GNU] </H5>   [Mandela] We bring different approaches. De Klerk is brining  the approach of an Afrikaner whose community has been dominant,  specially since 1948. I bring into the GNU the tradition of a  freedom fighter who has struggled against apartheid. I think we  will be able to resolve the gap between the two of us.  Especially because we will not be alone. We have a very good  team from the ANC and from the NP [National Party]. There are  men in the NP who are prepared to serve South Africa, very  sincerely. So we must not concentrate on two people.    Organisations are not run by individuals, they are run by a  team of men and women. We've got highly talented people like  Thabo Mbeki and Cyril Ramaphosa. And strangely enough, in spite  of the perceptions, a chap like Kobie Coetsee, people like Roelf  Meyer -- what their record has been in the past. I don't think  there are going to be such sharp differences as to paralyse  government.  <H5>  On the toughest challenges ahead </H5>   [Mandela] We are faced with two problems. We are committed  to form a Government of National Unity which brings in those  people who for 46 years applied apartheid. We are bringing  their conservatism into the GNU. That is one problem.    We have another coming from the liberation movement -- our  people who have been brought up against the legacy of resistance  and who, at a time when they should now be upfront in addressing  the problems of the country (and be) preparing to govern, still  think in terms of resistance, and oppose everything that comes  from the other side. They are not yet attuned to addressing  problems.  <H5>  On national reconciliation </H5>   [Mandela] The leadership should not now be engaged in  fighting talk. We have made the breakthrough (with the IFP) and  it is hoped that leaders...will have a better chance of uniting  the country. What is encouraging is the emergence of men and  women from all racial groups who are bound in their common  loyalty and common love for their common fatherland. That is  what we should be emphasising. Healing the wounds of the past,  not opening wounds at this critical moment. I have been saying  (to my followers) throughout this election: do not disrupt the  meetings of other political organisations. Remember that these  men, although we are fighting an election, we are going to work  with them in the GNU.  <H5>  On his acceptance speech </H5>   [Mandela] It is of course difficult to know what form the  (acceptance) speech would take, but the question of lawlessness  is one that should be uppermost in our minds. Because what has  concerned me throughout are the concerns of the minorities.  Whenever there is a transformation in any country, the  minorities are worried about their positions, what is going to  happen to them and their families. It is worse in this country,  and it is the duty of the leadership to address those fears and  to make sure that the minorities feel they are involved in the  transformation, that they are needed and that they will play  their role in ensuring that we build the new South Africa.  There's not going to be any discrimination against any groups.  It's our task to make sure of that.  <H5>  On criticism of ANC/SACP [South African Communist Party] </H5> links    [Mandela] It is of course difficult to convince people of  the reality of our alliance with the Communist Party. The  alliance between the ANC and SACP is based on mutual respect and  some of the most important contributions have actually been  made by members of the SACP, people like Joe Slovo and the late  Chris Hani. They have been so productive in addressing  problems that the whole question of an alliance between the ANC  and SACP is a non-issue to us.  <H5>  On amnesty for security force members </H5>   [Mandela] This is a very sensitive question. A form of  indemnity is unavoidable. At the moment here is a great deal of  insecurity in the SADF, SAP and the civil service. Now we  cannot even have free and fair elections if we do not get the  support of the SAP and SADF. It is absolutely necessary for us  to remove this state of insecurity.    I am discussing with (SAP commissioner General Johan van der  Merwe) this question of indemnity and the question of making  sure that we have the support of the police, because the people  who have committed crimes before October 8, 1990, are really  worried that a new government is going to put them on trial. We  have gone further to say Parliament will have a discretion to  grant an indemnity to people who have committed crimes between  October 8, 1990 and December 6, 1993. We are saying let's  forget the past, let's think in terms of the present and the  future. (But) what we cannot do is give indemnity to people who  after December 1993, have been killing people...We are working  out details. In Chile for example, people were able to come  forward and say we did so and so, without publishing their  names. We (could) then look at what they have done and decide  whether we should give indemnity.  <H5>  On amnesty for Chris Hani's killers </H5>   [Mandela] We have made a statement that we will abolish the  death sentence, but this is a matter that has to be considered  very, very carefully. I, as an individual, am against death  sentence, but the feelings among the people are very strong.  This is a highly sensitive matter. Our people are very angry,  especially because of the arrogant statements that were made by  the wife of (Clive) Derby- Lewis and his attitude in court --  that of gloating.  <H5>  On Chief Buthelezi </H5>   [Mandela] We have been able to get him to take decisions  which he never thought he would take. He has (now) made a  statement in which he said he will respect the result of an  election. It is a very good statement.  <H5>  On the ANC's election prospects </H5>   [Mandela] I have said to our people that our greatest enemy  is not the NP, it is the ANC itself. Because for us to proceed  as if we are going to have a landslide victory is more dangerous  than the opposition from the NP. And we have many problems. A  surprising number of our people do not have IDs.  <H5>  On his possible successor </H5>   [Mandela] We have a lot talent in the ANC. People like Thabo  Mbeki, Cyril Ramaphosa, Valli Moosa, Joe Slovo and Mac Maharaj.  These are very capable people who stand head and shoulders above  everybody else. Leaders will come and go but the policy of the  organisation will continue. It is set in the Freedom Charter.  It is not individuals that are crucial, it is the organisation.  I have not the slightest doubt that if the president resigns  either because of old age, or something happens to him, the  policies of the organisation will continue.  <H5>  On the ANC deputy presidency </H5>   [Mandela] This is a question I have to decide. I have to set  up the Cabinet and from the angle, I am not going to consult  anybody. If I am elected, if my party emerges with a majority,  I will decide who should fill what position. We have a wide  choice. I can't go into the matter now, but I have an idea of  who should be the first deputy president, if the ANC wins. It  is not an easy thing to decide because we have people who have  so many talents, who deserve that position. My problem is the  talent that we have. I like all our people.  <H5>  On possible volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] </H5>   [Mandela] We have said we will not accept a volkstaat. But  we have made a concession that, after the election, there can  be referendum on the question because we would like to hear the  views of the community on behalf of whom these people say they  are speaking. We are convinced that they are in a minority but  we would like that to be demonstrated by democratic means.  <H5>  On General Viljoen for Cabinet </H5>   [Mandela] Oh yes. General Viljoen is a very honest man, and  I would welcome him in a Government of National Unity. It would  strengthen the government. He may not be so astute politically  -- he is a soldier -- but he is man of integrity and in all the  meetings I have had with him I have come out feeling that this  is a man with whom we can work and solve problems. And the fact  that he has broken away from the Afrikaner Volksfront [National  Front] indicates what a strong personality he is. I have a lot  of confidence in him.  <H5>  On his finger-pointing habit </H5>   [Mandela] Well, I've got this habit of finger-pointing. I  was warned very strictly that I should avoid that in the debate.  But a habit that you've had for 75 years is not easy to get rid  of! And I hope people will accept it in the way in which I mean  it. I use it not to make a threat, but to emphasise a point.  When I use the finger, I use it innocently. I regret that I  reminded people of P.W. Botha.</p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Russian Elections: Soldiers look for leadership in fulfilling their democratic duty Amid snow-topped tanks mounted on pedestals, between statues of Lenin and prominent Bolsheviks, beneath Soviet slogans praising their valour, the men, officers, wives and pensioners of the Taman Guards division yesterday voted for a new parliament. It was 10 weeks to the day since some of them were preparing to go to Moscow to shell the old one. 'How are we to vote, sergeant, how are we to vote?' one recruit shouted cheekily to his platoon leader as he and his comrades marched into the Stalin-era officers' club turned into voting station 1527 yesterday morning. It seemed to be a joke. But inside the crowded little hall, where queues of servicemen and service families waited for their turn in the two little booths, the window ledges and table edges were grabbed by anxious men and women turning over the multi-layered papers, asking the officers in charge what to do. Mr Robert Porogov ('my first name came from your famous socialist Robert Owen') was in no doubt how he had voted. 'I'll tell you quite openly,' he said loudly in the crowded hall. 'I'm a Communist and glad to be so, an internationalist, what's more. These elections are a bit of a sham, and the constitution is written just to give Yeltsin all the power. I think we'll do well', he said, greeting other, largely elderly, tovarishchi (comrades). The Taman men, who came to Mr Yeltsin's aid during the August putsch of 1991 and did so again in October, would not speak of their role. Questions to one recruit who seemed willing to talk were politely cut short by an officer. Most of the voters, asked how they had completed their papers, replied with similar courtesy that we should mind our own business. 'It's secret now,' said one lady with a tight smile. Apart from Mr Prorogov and his Communist comrades there was an unsteadypensioner who had voted 'completely democratic' and a widow who had voted for the nationalist Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky. The unannounced arrival of Mr Quentin Davies, a British Conservative MP and one of the international observers, caused a flurry. He had broken away from his prescribed route to tour military bases in order to check if all was well in an area where control and corruption could flourish in secret. Maj Kovalov, president of the voting commission, smart in a civilian suit, anxiously demonstrated the orderly nature of the process, saying 'we had two big problems - one, too little time to prepare, and two, overcomplex voting papers. No, we had no meetings here, no agitation. No one seemed too interested. Many, many questions; everyone wants to know what to do. Of course we help them, but not on how to vote, that's their own business.' Mr Davies, a former diplomat (in Moscow in the 1970s) and a Russian speaker, objected to the fact that several voters were filling out their large voting slips papers in the open, and that the two small boxes into which the slips were being stuffed would not hold the possible volume of paper without being changed. But he said: 'It seems a lot of care is being taken to ensure that it's done fairly.' Later, at an air base some 20km further on (where Migs instead of tanks stood on pedestals), Lt-Col Alexei Kubinka, head of the election committee on the base, said that more than half of his electorate had voted by 1pm. Col Kubinka's view was that Mr Zhirinovsky was probably doing well. When people thought about voting for Mr Yegor Gaidar's Russia's Choice party, he said, they would first ask themselves - what have they done for Russia so far? Not much, was the unstated implication.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Sterling's plight not our fault, Bonn insists GERMANY reacted yesterday to British charges of complicity in the plight of the pound, more in sorrow - or in silence - than in anger. A thunderous silence was the reaction of the Bundesbank itself, an ironic answer to the charge from Downing Street that top German officials had precipitated the currency collapse with their loose talk. Off the record, the charge was politely rejected. On the record, it only said the latest exchange rate realignments in the Exchange Rate Mechanism were 'an appropriate answer to the previous tensions'. Mr Theo Waigel, minister of finance, was the most forthright in his response: 'To put the blame on Germany is not fair. I do not think that apportioning blame is right. I think everyone should consider what the cause is in their own area of responsibility.' Indeed the instant reaction to the bitterness of British officials, who had spelt out a series of occasions on which the Bundesbank's alleged 'whispering campaign' had undermined the pound, was to talk of 'the very natural desire of the British government to find a scapegoat'. 'The anger of the moment is always understandable,' said one well-placed official in Bonn. 'But we must distinguish very clearly between immediate irritation and a sober consideration of our long-term relations. Of course we understand that one needs a whipping boy at such a moment, and it is easy to look abroad to find one.' He insisted personal relations between Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl and British prime minister John Major remained 'really close', which could never be said of the chancellor's relations with Mr Major's predecessor, Lady Thatcher. And he listed the occasions on which Germany acted as honest broker for Britain in the Maastricht negotiations, helping push through the 'opt-out' clause on economic and monetary union, and the similar British exclusion from EC social policy. In spite of the oil pouring on troubled waters, immediate difficulties remain. There is some doubt over the plans for a bilateral summit on November 11, and who will attend. Germany's determination not to go ahead with production of the European Fighter Aircraft is a big bone of contention, and has badly soured relations between Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, his British counterpart. There has also been grumbling about British 'high-handedness' in the EC presidency, directed above all at Mr Norman Lamont, the British Chancellor. His obvious delight in the isolation of Germany at the Bath meeting of finance ministers two weeks ago has caused lasting bitterness. That comes back to the currency questions, which remain the most explosive of all. The German attitude remains that if the Bundesbank and Mr Helmut Schlesinger, its president, were talking down the pound, they were only telling the truth. Bankers and economists in Frankfurt yesterday closed ranks to defend him. 'I cannot imagine that Mr Schlesinger brought about the sterling crisis single-handed,' said Mr Peter Pietsch, Commerzbank economist, yesterday. 'On Monday they got a lot of approval for what they did in cutting interest rates. How come that has all been forgotten now?'</p>

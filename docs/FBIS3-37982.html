			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: by Sergey </F> Logachev, Andrey Petrovsky]    [Text] Colonel General Boris Pyankov, commander of the  coalition peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan, reconfirmed to  Interfax that during his recent visit to Moscow he met with  several opposition leaders who were also staying there. In his  words, the meetings were held at the request of representatives  of Tajik political opposition which expressed readiness to start  negotiations with the Dushanbe leadership.    In Pyankov's words, the fear of the opposition to go to  Dushanbe is the major difficulty in the negotiations. For his  part, Pyankov expressed readiness to ensure their security in  case negotiations are held in Dushanbe.    Otakhon Latifi, one of the representatives of the  opposition,  declared that negotiations with the Dushanbe authorities will  take place in case they are held under the UN auspices and with  the participation of Iranian and Pakistani representatives and  Russia's mediation.    Pyankov reaffirmed that the UN plans to hold negotiations  but  he has still no information about their time and place. "In my  opinion, this decision is still far away."    As Pyankov said, the Tajik opposition understands that the  coalition peacekeeping forces represent a real force which  substantially affects stabilization of the situation in the  republic. As he said, representatives of the opposition  expressed a request not to withdraw the coalition peacekeeping  forces from Tajikistan as they are the major guarantor of civil  peace in the country.    At the same time Pyankov believes that the negotiations in  Moscow have been "actually fruitless."</p>

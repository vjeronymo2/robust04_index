			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa pledged on Thursday [7 April] to lend Kazakhstan up to  12.98 billion yen to help it improve railroad transportation and  tackle pollution from thermal power stations, Foreign Ministry  officials said. Hosokawa made the pledge in a meeting with  Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, the officials said.    Japan will extend the loan to support the central Asian  nation's economic reform efforts and to help its environmental  preservation measures, they said.    Of the total, 7.23 billion yen will be set aside for a  project to improve railroad transportation. The project aims at  supplying equipment necessary to expand Druzhba station at the  border with China which serves as the base for material  transportation, and to repair and improve the track.    Another 5.74 billion yen will be for a project to tackle air  pollution from the Ekibastuz thermal power station in northern  Kazakhstan, the officials said.    The project aims at installing electric dust collectors and  denitrification and desulfurization equipment at the power  station. Despite the use of coal for thermal power generation,  sufficient environmental preservation measures have not been  taken in Kazakhstan since it became independent with the breakup  of the Soviet Union, they said.</p>

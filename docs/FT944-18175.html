			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / World Trade News: India to set up cellular phone system Eight telecom groups, each with a foreign partner, have been awarded licences to operate cellular telephones in India's main cities from April next year. After two years of legal and bureaucratic argument, Mr Sukh Ram, communications minister, announced the award of licences for Bombay, Delhi, Madras and Calcutta. He ordered his officials to ensure all formalities were completed by March 1995, so that services could start in April. The decision, following the announcement of rules for the entry of private companies into basic telephone services, indicates that Mr Sukh Ram and his civil servants are ready to implement market-oriented reforms in an industry monopolised by the state. In addition to the licences for the four cities, the government plans to award licences for a further 18 regions, roughly corresponding to India's states, in the next few months. Fifteen private groups have also been given permission to operate radio paging services in 27 cities. With some reluctance, the ministry has admitted that the government, with its limited resources, cannot provide the huge investment needed in Indian telecommunications. In basic services alone, the government is seeking up to Rs230bn (Dollars 7.3bn) investment from private companies. In cellular networks, the total could run to Rs50bn. The most sought-after cellular telephone licences, for Bombay, have been awarded to Hutchison Max Telecom, a company backed by Hutchison Telecom of Hong Kong, and to BPL Systems and Projects, a venture supported by France Telecom, the French carrier. Contract winners in other cities, with the names of overseas partners in brackets are: Delhi: Bharti Cellular (SFR of France) and Sterling Cellular (Cellular Communications International of the US); Calcutta: Usha Martin Telecom (Malaysia Telecom, the Malaysian carrier), and Indian Telecom (OTC of Australia); Madras: Skycell (Bell South of the US) and Mobile Telephone (the UK's Vodaphone). The big loser is Tata Cellular, a venture promoted by Tata, India's largest industrial grouping, and Bell Canada of Canada, which has not succeeded in securing any licences. Mr Sukh Ram said Tata had failed to meet the ministry's technical and financial conditions. The winning bidders expect to start placing orders soon. 'It's been a long and bitter battle to get the contracts. Most of us expect to begin services in April or May,' Mr Sunil Mittal, managing director of Bharti Telecom, said. Businessmen are delighted that India finally looks likely to get the benefits of cellular telephones. A bank executive in Delhi yesterday said: 'It will make life much easier.' Cellular telephones in developing countries are especially useful because they can by-pass the inefficient basic network. In Pakistan, for example, cellular telephones have virtually become a substitute for basic services among those who can afford them. In India, handsets will be imported and will cost about Rs25,000 (Dollars 796) each. India said yesterday its dispute with US over an American ban on imports of Indian rayon chiffon skirts had been resolved, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi. The Indian government said it had established a testing and certification programme to ensure that all rayon chiffon skirts exported to the US complied with US flammability standards. India exported more than Rs1bn worth of the skirts to the US last year.</p>

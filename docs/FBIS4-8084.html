			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, April 11 (AFP) -- Nato forces dropped five  250-kilo (550-lb) bombs in their attack on Serb artillery  positions around the embattled town of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia  on Sunday [10 April], NATO officials said here Monday.    Two United States Air Force F-16 aircraft were involved in  Sunday's strike. One dropped three Mark 82 bombs at 16.22 GMT  Sunday and the other dropped two more four minutes later, the  officials said.    Late Sunday, NATO forces attempted an air reconnaissance  mission to evaluate damage done to the Serb positions, but bad  weather prevented them carrying this out successfully, a  diplomat said.    U.S. military officials at the Aviano base in Italy said  Monday that three 250-kilo bombs had been dropped on Serb  positions by the two F-16s.</p>

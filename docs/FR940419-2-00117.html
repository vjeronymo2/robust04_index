			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC recognizes that the RSO was summoned back from vacation and initiated an investigation within a few days of the request for his return, that the technologist at fault was counseled, and that the NRC was notified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the NRC maintains that the Licensee's investigation was not adequate as defined in the NRC regulations. Section 35.21 of 10 CFR part 35, requires, in part, that a Licensee investigate misadministrations and other deviations from approved radiation safety practices and ``*&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> implement corrective actions as necessary <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> '' (emphasis added). The NRC does expect, and the regulations do require, that such investigations be adequate to meet the purpose of the investigations_the implementation of effective corrective actions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The investigation conducted by the Licensee was not adequate to determine the root cause of the problems and thus, the Licensee's corrective actions were ineffective, as evidenced by the technologist's continual failures to record the administered radiopharmaceutical activity and volume and the lack of supervisory oversight (see pages 75 and 76 of the transcribed enforcement conference). During the enforcement conference referenced in the Licensee's response, the NRC pointed out that the Licensee did not perform an adequate investigation (P 75 and 76). The two specific issues contained in the Notice, failure to review the letter that described the possible misadministration and failure to interview individuals who had first-hand knowledge of this matter, are examples of inadequacies in the investigation that led to the Licensee's inability to determine the root cause and take effective corrective actions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to Mr. Ebneter's statement that there was no regulation that tells the Licensee what has to be included in investigations, it is true that the NRC regulations do not prescribe the exact methodology for conducting investigations. As discussed above in this section and by Mr. Ebneter during the enforcement conference, however, the investigation results are important and the regulations do prescribe that the investigation must be adequate to implement effective corrective actions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concerning Dr. Mallett's statement that he was comfortable with the Licensee's review of the count rates, the NRC notes that Dr. Mallett's statement was not intended to suggest that the NRC considered the investigation adequate; the statement was limited to what it said_that Dr. Mallett was comfortable with that one aspect of the investigation (i.e., the Licensee's review of the count rates). The Licensee's assertion that this meant Dr. Mallett was satisfied with the investigation as a whole appears to have been taken out of context. Within the context of the full meeting, it is clear the NRC did not conclude that the investigation had been adequate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC concludes that the violation did occur as stated in the Notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Licensee's Request for Mitigation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Licensee stated that Violation B and Violation C.2 did not occur. The Licensee stated that there is no evidence of harm to any patient or member of the public, even of a minor nature. The Licensee further stated that the evidence does not demonstrate a misadministration of dosages on July 22, 1991 and that the technologist who administered the doses denied administering excessive doses to patients on July 22, 1991. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Licensee further contended that the errors were essentially record-keeping errors of the Severity Level IV or V type that might be aggregated to Severity Level III or IV but are not Severity Level II violations. In addition, the Licensee stated that its performance has improved over the past year as demonstrated by the last two NRC inspections. Thus, the Licensee argues, in accordance with the Enforcement Policy, the NRC should not have escalated the penalty 50 percent for poor past performance because its performance is improving. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> NRC Evaluation of Licensee's Request Mitigation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The arguments made by the Licensee concerning the acceptability of the doses and the lack of evidence of harm to patients or members of the general public do not relate to the requirement to measure dosages prior to administration or to the requirements to perform adequate investigation of possible misadministrations. Further, the Licensee's contention that the evidence does not demonstrate misadministration of doses, or excessive or inadequate doses, is not pertinent to the violation cited. The Licensee was not cited for administering excessive or inadequate doses, or misadministrations. These arguments only provide information that the Licensee believes that excessive dosages were not administered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the Licensee's request to reduce the severity level from a Severity Level II to a Severity Level III or Severity Level IV, the NRC notes that Section IV of the Enforcement Policy (i.e., 10 CFR part 2, Appendix C) states, in part, that ``Supplements I through VIII provide examples and serve as guidance in determining the severity level for violations in each of the eight activity areas. However, the examples are neither exhaustive nor controlling *&blank;*&blank;*. The NRC reviews each case being considered for enforcement action on its own merits to ensure that the severity of the violation is characterized at the level best suited to the significance of the particular violation. In some cases special circumstances may warrant an adjustment to the severity level characterization.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

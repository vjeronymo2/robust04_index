			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Salvador amnesty for war criminals EL SALVADOR'S congress is set to amnesty all those named by a special United Nations commission as responsible for war crimes and other human rights abuses during the country's decade-long civil war. The commission said the vast majority of abuses were committed by the army, or death squads linked to it. An ally of the right-wing Arena party is expected to introduce the legislation today. Arena and its allies control the congress. Opposition parties are linking support for the amnesty to implementation of the main UN recommendations, such as dismissal of the Supreme Court, and removal of military officers responsible for abuses. In Washington, Congressman Robert Torricelli, chairman of the sub-committee on the western hemisphere, accused the Reagan administration of lying about the role of the Salvadoran army in the atrocities, and he would consider whether Reagan officials committed perjury in testimony on El Salvador before the US Congress. El Salvador's government received Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4.2bn) in US aid in the 1980s. The UN Commission catalogued numerous crimes committed by the army, including that there was substantial proof that General Emilio Ponce, the defence minister who resigned on Friday, and other senior officers planned the murder of six Jesuit priests in 1989.</p>

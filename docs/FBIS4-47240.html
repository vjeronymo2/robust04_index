			<p>Situation   <F P=102>   944K1441A Moscow SEGODNYA in Russian 3 Jun 94 p 5 </F> <F P=103> 944K1441A </F> <F P=104>  Moscow SEGODNYA </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Golotyuk: "There Will Be No Demographic </F> Catastrophe: The Women of Nagorno-Karabakh Are Giving Birth to a  New Generation"]    [Text] Estimates by certain experts who predict that after  slightly more than five and a half years of warfare  Nagorno-Karabakh is just about on the brink of a demographic  catastrophe seem excessively pessimistic. To losses which are  serious for such a small population, the Karabakh are filled  with determination to respond with "adequate measures" for  surviving and preserving their gene pool.    According to data provided by the Stepanakert ZAGS [Civil  Registrar's Office], at the end of May 1994 the birth  rate--although continuing to lag behind the death rate--is  already gradually overtaking the latter. Since 1 January, 404  deaths have been registered (according to ZAGS Inspector Elmira  Grigoryan, 90 percent of them perished at the front) and 320  births. Whereas during the prewar years men in Karabakh used to  marry--as a rule--after reaching the age of 24 or 25, nowadays  they are marrying at much younger ages, i.e., 18 or even 17, so  as to leave an heir behind before going off to the front.  "Karabakhians have now come to understand that having  traditionally small families with one or two children was our  biggest mistake." So states Boris Arushanyan, first deputy  chairman of the NKR Council of Ministers. "Every family should  have a minimum of four or five children. The leaders of this  republic are attempting to provide a personal example. For  example, my youngest daughter is three months old, and the  chairman of the NKR Supreme Soviet had a boy two and a half  months ago. We understand that things will be hard for these  children; those who are now two or three years old were mostly  born and grew up in cellars under shelling and bombing. However,  we must give life to a new generation of Karabakhians."    As noted by Mr. Arushanyan, the protectionist policy of the  NKR leadership will proceed along two principal lines: one  prohibitive and the other providing incentives. The former  provides for introducing a ban on abortions in the NKR in the  very near future. According to a law--the draft of which is now  being considered and amended--it will clearly be forbidden for  women under the age of 45 to have abortions, unless there are  medical grounds. As to providing incentives for having many  children, the government is introducing a system of benefits and  creating privileged conditions. It will give families having  three or more children considerable humanitarian assistance, to  be obtained from charitable funds.    An unprecedented method of providing social protection for  children who have been deprived of a breadwinner is the  institution of "posthumous marriages"--an institution that has  been officially legitimized in the NKR. By a special edict of  the NKR State Committee for Defense it has been decreed that in  the case of a soldier of the Karabakh Army living in a  common-law type of marriage before leaving for the front but not  getting around to registering this marriage, and in the event he  is killed, his widow--on a court decision--may be recognized as  such in full accordance with the law. Accordingly, she--together  with the children of the deceased--may receive the appropriate  pension. Moreover, such cases cannot be called isolated  instances. According to data provided by the Stepanakert ZAGS,  of the 173 marriages entered into since the beginning of this  year, one out of every 10 has been "posthumous."    Measures have been undertaken to prevent the mass killing of  children and youths during shelling and air raids. Specifically  in connection with the April bombings by ground-attack aircraft  of the Azerbaijani Air Force, secondary schools in Stepanakert  were closed down for about a month. "We do not have enough  children to risk having scores of them wiped out by a single  bomb," the Karabakhians explain. Finally, attempts are being  made to recall minors from combat units of the Karabakh Army of  Defense. Whereas just a year ago the Army Staff Headquarters  mentioned with pride a battalion made up entirely of 15- and  16-year old volunteers fighting in the Mardakert Region,  nowadays Major Murad Petrosyan, the chief of the Army's  Political Section, assures us that it is strictly forbidden to  accept youths under the age of 18 for service and that the Staff  has ordered the Finance Unit to exclude all minors from the  lists of combat units.    As of today, the exact number of Nagorno-Karabakh's  inhabitants is unknown, but as a rule the approximate figure of  150,000 persons is cited. Nor has there been an official report  of the total number of losses suffered by the NKR during the  years of the conflict (unofficial sources proceed on the basis  that the number of persons killed among the civilian population  as well as among the combatants amounts to something like  5,000). Be that as it may, Boris Arushunyan, first deputy  chairman of the NKR Council of Ministers, asserts the following:  "The losses incurred by Nagorno-Karabakh during the years of the  Great Patriotic War were much greater than they have been during  the course of the present conflict. Therefore, even if we are  now compelled to continue this war, I am confident that this  will not bring our people to the brink of extinction."</p>

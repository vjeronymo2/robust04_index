			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: SIB finds fault with tied agents WHAT consumers have long suspected about insurance sales agents is true, a new study shows. Those sales agents working exclusively for a single company are more likely to try to sell you an inappropriate policy than an independent agent who can offer you the best product from a group of companies. Research commissioned by the Securities and Investments Board, the UK's chief regulatory watchdog, examined termination rates of life and pensions policies of 61 major UK companies for 1990. The study, which was not given wide circulation by the SIB, found that up to 45 per cent of policies sold via 'direct' or 'tied' sales agents are terminated within the first two years of the contract - but only 22 to 32 per cent of policies sold through independent financial advisers. While the number of early terminations of policies sold by IFAs is still troublingly high, the data suggests that sales agents working for one company are even more likely to encourage consumers to sign up for unsuitable products. Meanwhile, the SIB appears to be backing down from a proposal which would make it harder for direct or tied sales agents to pass themselves off as IFAs. The SIB had considered prohibiting these agents from describing themselves as 'advisers' or 'consultants.' But in a speech to a life assurance industry group last week, outgoing SIB chairman Sir David Walker signalled that a ban on that title is unlikely, although agents may be discouraged from using it on their business cards or stationery. The SIB has not theorised in public about what could account for different termination rates among categories of sales agent. But because the life industry typically offers higher commissions to exclusive sales agents than to IFAs, consumers must ask themselves whether tied or direct sales agents are rewarded for pushing products, regardless of suitability. Walker has said that high termination rates are a sign of 'unsuitability.' Because policies are a long-term commitment, often as much as 25 years, they should not be sold to those who are uncertain that they can keep up premium payments for that long. Too often, termination in the first two years of a contract ends in tears for the consumer. Commission payments to sales agents are 'front ended,' which means that the life company devotes the initial months - if not years  -of premium payments to paying off the sales agent and reimbursing itself for the costs of establishing a new policy. Consumers can lose up to 100 percent of their initial premium payments, and earn very little return on the portion that has been invested. The SIB's data - which showed that, overall, a quarter to a third of policies are cancelled within two years - adds fuel to the debate over what sales agents should be required to tell prospective customers about their products and about themselves. The SIB is considering new disclosure rules that would require sales agents to spell out for prospective customers how much they would get back if they cancelled early. It is also considering the best way to tell consumers how much of their investment return will be eaten up by the cost of operating the policy.</p>

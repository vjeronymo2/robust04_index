			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Conservative party raises record funds in spite of recession THE CONSERVATIVE party has raised more funds in the past 12 months than in any previous pre-election year, according to Central Office officials. The party does not disclose total funds nor their source, but a survey by the Financial Times revealed contributions from business supporters have remained virtually unchanged in the face of severe recession. The survey of 40 top corporate contributors to the party found that they contributed Pounds 1.345m last year, down only Pounds 36,000 from 1990. Most companies are planning to maintain or increase their payments this year, providing the Tory party with a steady flow of contributions to underpin its election effort. Party coffers have also been swelled by some large, personal contributions. Last year, for example, it emerged that Mr John Latsis, the Greek shipping tycoon, gave Pounds 2m to the party organisation. Although a number of companies such as British Airways and Taylor Woodrow, the construction group, have made well-publicised cuts in their contributions, they have been largely offset by some big donations. T &amp; N, the motor components group, last week sent the party Pounds 25,000 after suspending its contribution last year. General Accident, the insurance company, which has paid Pounds 35,000 to the party in each of the past four years, said it normally increases its payment in an election year. Other companies which have increased their contributions or are considering doing so include United Biscuits, Hanson and Foreign and Colonial Investment Trust. Taylor Woodrow will soon disclose it has decided to increase contributions following its 1990 cut. However, some large contributors, which are either disenchanted with government economic policy or under financial pressure, have reduced their donations. These include BA, which said last week its decision to suspend payments was unchanged; Wimpey, the construction group which is almost certain at least to halve its normal Pounds 40,000 contribution; and Western United Investment, part of the financially troubled Vestey empire.

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: VW may cut payout as domestic market tumbles VOLKSWAGEN, western Europe's leading car supplier, yesterday hinted that it may cut its dividend this year after a sharp downturn in the three months to September 30. Group net profit had risen almost 3 per cent in the first half. The fall in the third quarter, however, left the nine-month profits figure at DM549m (Dollars 342.69m), 13 per cent lower than in the same period last year. The main source of the setback was a 27 per cent drop in earnings at the German parent company, which has suffered, in common with other companies reporting in the past week, from depression in the domestic market. VW said prospects for fourth-quarter profits would be 'drastically worsened' by recent European devaluations against the D-Mark and deteriorating conditions in almost all markets. 'This development will also have a negative influence on our dividend payment for 1992,' it added. The group last year paid DM11 on ordinary shares and DM12 on preference stock. Last weekend's 6 per cent devaluation of the peseta and escudo - not taken into account in the report - can be expected to reduce translated profits from Spain and Portugal, which have recently recorded marked sales increases, according to the company. The slump in profits came despite an increase in group turnover for the period under review of 12 per cent to DM63.6bn and a 7.5 per cent increase in deliveries. Group output rose more than 9 per cent to 2.6m vehicles. Seat, VW's Spanish subsidiary, produced 17 per cent more vehicles, and Audi, the quality car division, increased output by 13 per cent. The group, which is already implementing a plan to reduce its payroll by 12,500 over the next five years, said two plants, employing around 11 per cent of the workforce, would work short-time for two weeks around the end of the year because of falling orders. Depressed international conditions have also prompted VW to slow its ambitious investment programme. Spending of DM6.7bn at the nine-month mark was almost 9 per cent lower than a year earlier and most of that was invested in Seat. Separately yesterday, VW's 125,000 German workers accepted a two-stage pay deal which will give them a 4.9 per cent rise for the 12 months from November 1, to be followed by a 3.5 per cent increase for the next nine months.</p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Business Travel (6): Ready to take off in a big way - Asia-Pacific WHILE the airline business travel markets in Europe and the US have had to face up to the impact of recession, the Asia-Pacific region has suffered relatively less from the west's economic problems and is regarded as one of the crucial growth markets of the 1990s. Even the economic problems in Japan has not seemed to blight this demand, though a number of Japanese companies are following their western counterparts by seeking to downgrade the class of travel in an effort to cut travel costs. But the buoyancy of other parts of the region, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, is keeping the airlines busy. The region's potential has inevitably led to extra capacity being put on all routes by airlines eager to capture a bigger share of a growing market. The extra capacity, however, is still some way ahead of the market - which has helped to keep prices in the premium cabins stable and led to discounts at the back of the aircraft. Asia's largest international carrier is JAL which is developing its route network with Europe, such as a twice-weekly flight planned for next year between Tokyo and Milan. JAL is also increasing its capacity on its Asian routes with, for example, extra Boeing 747s being used on its China services. JAL's supremacy on the international routes is increasingly being challenged by All Nippon Airlines which has benefited from the switch to Heathrow from Gatwick. The problem for both airlines, however, remains the shortage of airport capacity within Japan. Big expansion projects at the Narita and Haneda terminals serving Tokyo, along with the new Kansai International airport off the coast of Osaka which is due to come on stream in mid 1994, will double capacity by the mid 1990s. The Japanese carriers also face a strong challenge from other airlines in the region, especially Korean Air, which has carved out a niche for business traffic into Seoul from Europe and the US and has made inroads into the Japanese market. What makes it difficult for western carriers in the region is the traditionally high level of service from Asian carriers such as Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways International. All three have well-deserved reputations for the quality of their first and business class services and are constantly upgrading them to keep ahead. Cathay Pacific, for example, earlier this year revamped its first class product and is understood to have similar plans for its Marco Polo club class service next year. Readers of Business Traveller magazine, moreover, recently voted Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, and Thai International as the second, fourth, and sixth best airlines in the world for business class services. Singapore's Changi airport was also voted the best airport in the world for business travellers.</p>

The actual scope of the environmental problem is now becoming  clear. A company located at the wild coasts of northern  Scotland is offering a solution.    "After World War II alone, 65,000 tons of chemical weapons  from German, British, American, Italian, Hungarian, and Russian  origin were dumped into the Baltic Sea," says Bill Batey from  the heavily protected nuclear facility of the British Atomic  Energy Authority (AEA) at Dounreay, a privatized nuclear  technology company. "Ammunitions were dumped also in the waters  surrounding the UK and the Bay of Biscay. Now, after nearly 50  years, the shells start decaying and the release of highly toxic  materials into the atmosphere is becoming a real threat."  <H5>  Electrolysis </H5>   Batey's team of scientists have filed an international  patent  application for an environment-friendly chemical degradation  process that can be applied to all explosives and chemical  weapons such as mustard and nerve gases. They claim that the  process destroys these substances without having to incinerate  or detonate them. Incineration and detonation are unacceptable  methods for environmental and cost reasons.    Batey is heading a division responsible for decommissioning  nuclear reactors and managing radioactive wastes. Initially,  the process was developed as an environment-friendly way to  degrade low-level liquid radioactive waste. It is based on  electrolysis and decomposes hazardous materials into the  harmless substances CO2, water, NOx, and a small amount of  acids, without any side effects. Batey: "We use silver as  catalyzer for degrading organic phosphor compounds, which are  found in explosives as well as in the nerve gases VX, Tabun,  Sarin, and Soman. These are the gases mostly used by the United  States, Russia, and the UK. To destroy chlorine compounds used  in mustard gases, we use ruthenium as catalyzer."    The AEA entered into a joint venture with the Aberdeen-based  company SubSea Offshore, which will implement its experience and  specialist techniques to track and haul up the dumped ammunition  and degrade it on board of a special vessel using the Dounreay  method. According to Mark Vorenkamp, an American of Netherlands  origin and director of the subsidiary SubSea Survey, "the AEA  process is still in the laboratory stage, but plans are to  integrate the electrolysis unit into mobile equipment which can  be taken to the site of operations. It will be called  `Electrochemical Oxidation System,' abbreviated ECOS."  <H5>  Billion-Dollar Market </H5>   In the meantime, SubSea has already acquired an advanced  sea-bed research ship from the British Navy. The disposal of  the gigantic military "inheritance" from the past century  constitutes an $8-billion market over the next 10 years. This  market is more or less evenly divided between Europe, North  America, and the former USSR.    Not only old ammunition will have to be destroyed. According  to the Chemical Weapons Convention, all chemical weapons will  have to disappear worldwide. This will be done under the  auspices of a UN organization to be established in The Hague.  Together with SubSea, AEA has contacted the Chemical Warfare  Center of the British Ministry of Defense in Porton Down, which  will conduct further tests with the ECOS installation. Another  British military center had already proved its efficiency with  explosives.  <H5>  Conferences </H5>   The large number of conferences and symposiums on the  disposal of ammunition organized primarily in Germany indicates  that it is becoming a pressing problem. This week, for  instance, the northern German city of Muenster held a seminar on  "Crossborder Environmental Problems Caused by Military  Activities" of NATO and former Warsaw-Pact countries. Last  month, the same city of Muenster hosted another conference on  old chemical ammunition organized by the German Army and the  Swedish SIPRI [Stockholm International Peace Research  Institute]. In Munich, Deutsche Aerospace and an American  interest group [not further identified] sponsored a conference  on the removal of military pollution.</p>

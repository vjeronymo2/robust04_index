			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> CMS ENHANCEMENTS PLANNING TO BUILD PLANT IN PAKISTAN  </P> <P> While many U.S. high-tech companies are looking to Europe or the Pacific Rim as  the hot spots for doing business overseas, CMS Enhancements President Jim  Farooquee is casting a glance toward the Indian subcontinent.  </P> <P> The Tustin computer company is completing plans to set up a manufacturing plant  in Pakistan, Farooquee's native country.  </P> <P> CMS officials say the company is negotiating a lease on a building and hopes to  have a production line running early this year.  </P> <P> Farooquee won't say exactly what CMS plans to manufacture in Pakistan, citing  competitive reasons. But he says the operation will involve simple  manufacturing assembly work. CMS is a supplier of computer disk drives, tape  backup systems and other products for personal computers.  </P> <P> CMS, which had sales of $200 million for the year ended June 30, doesn't  actually manufacture most of its products. It primarily buys disk drives from  other manufacturers, customizes them for certain PCs, then distributes them  under the CMS brand name.  </P> <P> The Tustin firm's only other manufacturing facility is in Singapore, where the  company produces tape systems used to copy data stored on computer hard disk  drives.  </P> <P> Farooquee says his Pakistani heritage should be an advantage in doing business  in that country. The CMS chief moved to the United States in 1976 after  receiving a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from Karachi Technical  College.  </P> <P> He said many U.S. high technology firms have been reluctant to invest in  Pakistan because, until the past few years, they have viewed the political  situation as too unstable.  </P> <P> One of Pakistan's attractions is low-cost labor. The average Pakistani worker  earns just $30 per month, Farooquee says.  </P> <P> Moreover, Pakistan is near the developing computer markets in three huge  countries: India, China and the Soviet Union. And, Farooquee says, products  manufactured in Pakistan could be transported to the European market cheaper  than from the United States or the Far East.

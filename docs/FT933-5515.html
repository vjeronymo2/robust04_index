			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / British Gas faces curb on expansion: Ofgas says UK customers must not pay for any losses abroad BRITISH GAS'S ambitious overseas expansion programme would be severely curtailed under controversial plans put forward by the industry regulator. Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, wants to put a 'ring-fence' around the Pounds 1.2bn profits that British Gas makes from supplying household customers to protect them from any costs associated with high-risk overseas projects. The regulator, which has presented draft proposals to the company, is worried that UK domestic customers could end up paying for project failures abroad. 'Rather than success abroad keeping the home fires burning, we're worried that disaster abroad could put the home fires out,' said Mr Greg McGregor, director of competition and tariffs at Ofgas, echoing British Gas's current advertising campaign. But Mr McGregor stressed that he had no reason to believe British Gas's overseas projects would fail. If agreed by the government, the move would deal a significant blow to the company, which has looked to growth abroad as a way of increasing its profits at a time when its UK business is being eroded by increased competition. The company has invested Pounds 1.5bn in other countries since its privatisation in 1986 and plans to spend a similar amount over the next few years. British Gas said recently that the outcome of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry would force the company to put greater emphasis on its overseas interests. The commission recommended in its conclusions last month that the company sell off its trading arm by 1997 and lose its monopoly over household supply by 2002. Mr Philip Rogerson, British Gas's finance director, said he had not seen any Ofgas proposals. 'But if they're saying the whole of our UK cashflow should be ring-fenced that would be the cause of grave concern to us,' he said. The issue is likely to exacerbate the already tense relationship between British Gas and Ofgas which resulted in the monopolies inquiry last year. The publication of the monopolies commission's full 2,000 page report on Monday will show that British Gas called for a complete revamp of regulation. Ofgas says its ring-fence plans, which were presented to British Gas in draft form at the end of last week, are a direct result of the monopolies commission report. The commission recommended that the company separate all 'treasury functions' between its respective divisions. Mr McGregor said the company had nothing to fear from the ring-fence proposals as long as its projects overseas were on a secure and viable footing. British Gas could continue to invest in overseas businesses if Ofgas's proposals were adopted but it would need to fund more investment on a project finance basis which could involve taking on more debt. British Gas is involved in negotiating a giant gas project in Kazakhstan which would involve investment of Dollars 3bn over 10 years. Mr Rogerson said the company's overall cash exposure would be less than Dollars 3bn and expected it could be provided on a project finance basis.</p>

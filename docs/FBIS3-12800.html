			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a statement distributed on 14 February, the  Supreme Islamic Committee [SIC] in Jerusalem rejected Israeli  proposals to discuss the future supervision of the Islamic holy  shrines in the occupied territories, such as the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque in Hebron, al-Nabi Yusuf Tomb in Nabulus, al-Nabi Samuil  Mosque in Jerusalem, and Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem, on the  basis that these holy places are sacred to both Muslims and Jews.    The statement said: The Islamic mosques should not be a  place of worship for non-Muslims. The mosques to which the  proposals refer and that are mentioned in the statement are  Islamic mosques built by Muslims.    The statement added: The current practices in the mosques  are based on the force of the occupation. From the beginning,  the SIC has objected to these practices, stressing its adherence  to the Muslim holy shrines and mosques.</p>

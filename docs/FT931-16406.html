			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / The Braer Disaster: Islanders see fears fulfilled 'A DISASTER like this has been on everyone's mind for the last 20 years,' says Mr James Moncrieff, a Shetlander. 'It's ironic that it turned out to be a passing tanker that caused it.' The Shetland islands have had a tempestuous relationship with the oil industry since North Sea oil was discovered in the 1970s and it was decided to bring it ashore at Sullom Voe at the north end of the main island. For years the Shetlanders negotiated arrangements with the oil companies that would make them one of the more prosperous parts of Britain, and which would guard against the destruction of their environment. The Shetlanders were concerned not just that their gaunt scenery should be disfigured as little as possible by the oil industry's installations. They were also deeply worried that at some stage there would be an environmental catastrophe involving tankers using Sullom Voe. In the event, there has been only one serious spillage, in an accident involving a tanker at the oil and gas terminal, which opened in 1981. That was not on anything like the scale of the Braer disaster, but because of the constant awareness of the threat of an environmental tragedy, Shetland, which has a population of 22,000, has always been prepared and well equipped to deal with oil pollution. As disaster has been a lingering nightmare, many people in Shetland have reacted with resignation to the fact that it has now struck, albeit from an unexpected quarter. But there has also been anger that the Braer was travelling close to the islands and questions have been raised about the standards of seamanship of the tanker's crew. That surfaced at a press conference yesterday morning when Mr Willie Tait, the Shetland Islands councillor for the Sumburgh area, blamed the crew of the Braer for the disaster and said that a British crew would not have abandoned its ship while it was in such danger of crashing with devastating effect on to the rocks. While many Shetlanders are dismayed by the threat to the birds and sealife caused by the pollution, and by the casualties they have already suffered, the biggest economic threat is to the fishing and fish farming industries. In spite of oil wealth, Shetland still makes much of its living from fish. Almost a third of the islands' 10,000-strong labour force works in the fish industry, including fishermen, fish processors and salmon farmers. Mr John Goodlad, secretary of the Shetland Fishermen's Association, said: 'We are more dependent on fish than any other part of the EC. Without fishing, the future of this community is doubtful.' Fortunately, with the oil slick so far confined to a fairly small area around the wreck of the Braer, there has been no impact on the fishing grounds and the islands' salmon farms have not been affected. Salmon farming became an important industry in Shetland in the 1980s and Shetland produces about a quarter of the 40,000 tonnes of salmon reared by salmon farms in Scotland. The Shetland salmon farming industry is reckoned to account for about Pounds 35m of the Pounds 80m turnover of the islands' fishing industry. Mr Moncrieff, who is chief executive of the Shetland Salmon Farmers' Association, said: 'We are very afraid of what would happen if the oil slick entered the voes (inlets) on the west coast where most of the salmon farms are.' The cages in which the salmon are reared would be highly vulnerable to oil pollution. The nearest voe containing fish farms is at East Burra, only 13 miles from the scene of the disaster. The salmon farmers hope the emergency teams will erect booms to prevent the oil entering the voes, but until it is clear where the oil will go there is little to be done than prepare the booms. Two small booms have been erected near the wreck so far. About 1,500 metres of boom material is on the islands and a further 5,000 to 7,000 metres is arriving early today by ferry from Aberdeen, having been rushed from England. A more immediate worry for the fishermen and fish farmers is the chemical dispersants that are being sprayed on the oil at and around the wrecked tanker. Mr Moncrieff said: 'The mixture of oil and dispersant creates an emulsion which goes right down through the water, whereas without dispersant the oil stays on the surface. This means that with the dispersant the oil may cause more damage than if it had been left.' Both he and Mr Goodlad believe that with Shetland being at the confluence of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, the best action to take where the oil slick is outside confined waters is to leave the forces of nature to disperse the oil.</p>

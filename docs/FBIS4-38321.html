			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Khrekov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 30 TASS -- Russian foreign intelligence  has denied involvement in attack on Chechen President Dzhokhar  Dudayev this past weekend.    Foreign intelligence spokeswoman Tatyana Samolis described  as  groundless a statement by head of the Chechen department of the  press and information Movladi Udugov made in an interview with  FRANCE PRESSE that "local experts made an attempt on Dzhokhar  Dudayev's life on the order from (Russian foreign intelligence  chief) Yevgeniy Primakov."    In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Samolis said that  such allegations are a "fabrication bordering on nonsense and  absurdity." She said the Russian foreign intelligence abandoned  terroristic methods long ago and does not even have structures  which could carry out such activity.    The foreign intelligence service only collects information,  she said.</p>

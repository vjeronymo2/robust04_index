			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Management: Godfathers get control - Andrew Baxter and Andrew Bolger investigate the steps BTR is taking to integrate Hawker Siddeley into its operations What should managers expect to face if they are taken over by BTR, the acquisitive UK industrial conglomerate? Executives of Hawker Siddeley have been finding out since BTR won a bitterly contested Pounds 1.55bn takeover battle for one of the most famous names in British engineering. Within days of the bid victory last November, every Hawker managing director and finance director in Europe was summoned to a hotel at Heathrow airport to hear about BTR, and its plans for Hawker. Robert Faircloth, recently appointed as BTR's chief operating officer, has been supervising the integration. 'A key is to create a sense of urgency very quickly,' he says. Although BTR executives are careful not to criticise their counterparts at Hawker, Faircloth says this approach was a change for Hawker, where there 'was not the highest or greatest sense of urgency'. But BTR admits that it is learning a few lessons as well as dishing them out. Its proposal to create a global electrical engineering business, revealed in the final stages of the bid, has been dropped - suggesting that Hawker knows more about its businesses than BTR supposed. For Faircloth and Alan Jackson, BTR's chief executive, the change of plan shows that during their first 100 days at Hawker, speed has been tempered by a determination not to jump to conclusions about any part of the engineering group's sprawling empire. The past few months have been a testing time for Hawker's managers. Their first hurdle was to come to grips with BTR's strict financial planning and controls system. At the Heathrow meeting, they were shown what Faircloth describes as 'the real bible of BTR, our profit planning programme - in the form of a written manual and computer disk'. 'We simply said 'OK, get familiar with our plan technically and philosophically, take your plan, put it on to our forms and we'll take a look at it'.' At the same meeting, BTR rammed home the importance of discipline in the monthly financial reporting that underpins the group's profit planning. Faircloth says Hawker's month-end reporting lacked such discipline: 'They probably reported on the fifth day after the month-end: but if you were out someplace, so what, you didn't do it until later'. In contrast, by the third working day after every month ends, senior executives in BTR's worldwide operations have figures for orders, sales, profits, and return on sales for every operation. By January both groups were reporting on a common basis. At the same Heathrow meeting, Hawker's managers were introduced to BTR's 'A-team' - a group of about 30 senior managers who had been studying Hawker intensively for months. In the weeks before BTR's victory, the A-team had been allocated to follow Hawker's seven business divisions and were now paired with their counterparts. Faircloth told the Hawker managers: 'Here is the person to be your minder, godfather, counsellor. Not your boss, we'll keep the structure virtually in place, but this is the man who's going to acquaint you with BTR. However, he has one authority - he's going to control the purse strings.' Most expenditures above Pounds 20,000 needed the approval of the minders. Faircloth, a tough, no-nonsense American, says: 'We would say 'You can't buy an automobile', just so we could get a handle on the automobile policy.' However, BTR says several important items of capital expenditure were approved during this clampdown, which has now been lifted. The next stage was a programme of worldwide factory visits to allay uncertainty. By Christmas, BTR had visited 96 per cent of all Hawker's facilities. 'There was a remoteness existing in the company - our style is to meet people and show an interest in the business,' says Faircloth. BTR had a form which its managers and Hawker's would fill out as they walked through a plant: were there leaky roofs, what was the general appearance? At the same time, the BTR teams were making simple appraisals of the Hawker managers, giving them scores of one to 10. Between 75 and 80 per cent of the 100 or so people who were assessed had their management skills scored as average to above average. BTR is full of praise for how Hawker managers responded to what Faircloth describes as a 'pretty horrendous drill' in terms of 60-70 hour weeks. All this data started flowing back to BTR's 'war room' in Wokingham, Berkshire. Faircloth personally visited Hawker's perceived problem areas such as instruments and controls, and general engineering. The initial phase of the takeover came to a climax in mid-January, when BTR revealed its management structure for the enlarged group. Some of the integration team assumed management control of Hawker businesses, while others went back to their former jobs. Several Hawker men retained control of their businesses, and some were given increased responsibility. The entire exercise has been useful in a number of ways to BTR. Information collected during the 100 days has identified those Hawker businesses - such as rail - which are likely to need strategic partners to survive. Not that Hawker managers have finished jumping through hoops - or being assessed. Faircloth said the scoring exercise will be repeated at the end of March, but this time the standards are going to be higher. 'Without showing my hand, it is going to be a different result.'</p>

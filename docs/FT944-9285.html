			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Inflation is not dead but has moved elsewhere Is long-run price stability here at last? HSBC's London chief economist Roger Bootle is celebrating with a 70-page study called The End of the Inflationary Era. Because HSBC Greenwell is one of London's leading bond houses he can be excused for trumpeting favourable news for fixed income investors. But his arguments may be in some respects misleading. He seems to be overimpressed by the recent inflationary slowdown in the UK and in one or two other former black spots for price stability such as Australia and Italy. But looking more broadly at western economies the real breakthrough was achieved in the mid-1980s, when average consumer price inflation in the Group of Ten countries fell to 2.3 per cent in 1986. Only this year has inflation declined to that level. German inflation has deteriorated and that in the US has barely improved, although in countries such as Japan and Canada, inflation has fallen to levels where it is effectively non-existent. With the global economy now growing rapidly there is a risk of another cyclical upswing in inflation. Last time the UK and Sweden led the way with inflation of around 10 per cent in 1990, and even Switzerland spoiled its image with 6 per cent. Elsewhere in the world inflation is as prevalent as ever. It is running at 27 per cent in China, and at hyper-inflationary rates in parts of eastern Europe and Latin America. How can we be sure that the infection will not spread, perhaps stimulated by rising commodity prices? Bootle cites various powerful economic trends, such as rapid technological progress, growing competition from Third World manufacturers and chronic labour surpluses in the western economies. These are all interesting themes. But are they really responsible for eliminating persistent postwar inflation? Bootle surely underplays the monetary indicators which in the past have been crucial in signalling inflationary risks. It was the link with gold that kept the value of money steady over the centuries. After the second world war inflation was persistent rather than rapid, despite the significant inflationary potential of the post-gold Bretton Woods system. The main reason for the moderation was that credit creation was firmly controlled in most countries. Once that changed in the 1970s the genie of inflation was out of the bottle. Recessions in the mid-1970s and early 1980s cooled the fever, but countries that subsequently suffered renewed credit binges let the side down: the UK, the Nordic countries, at one stage the US, also Japan; and eventually post-unification Germany lost its grip, too, in the early 1990s. Most of these later credit excesses have boosted financial asset prices rather than general inflation. Asset price surges are readily reversible, so there has been a painful banking hangover and private sector indebtedness remains high. In 1986, when general inflation was low, broad money growth in the US, Japan and the UK was surging at between 9 and 16 per cent. Now the money growth is 2 to 5 per cent. This is the clearest pointer that low inflation is here to stay. Any worries now focus on Germany. Both borrowers and lenders have learned expensive lessons from the excessive reliance upon short-term credit during the 1970s and 1980s. There has been a increase in the role of the long-term capital markets, both by governments and industry. In the US, in particular, sections of banking activity - such as mortgage lending - have been extensively securitised. It is these trends which inflation-watchers need to track, rather than developments in technology or inflows of cheap goods. Capital markets are restricted, however, by their reliance on finite flows of savings, whereas banking systems can create new credit almost without limit. The global recovery has therefore quickly come up against resistance from high real interest rates. The danger signals will come if bond market financing is seen to have become too expensive, in which case there may be increasing resort to banks and in particular to the monetisation of public sector debt.</p>

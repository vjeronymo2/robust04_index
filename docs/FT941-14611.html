			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei dips as Taiwan tumbles 2.9 per cent Share prices fluctuated in a narrow range amid arbitrage selling and profit-taking by corporations, and the Nikkei average finally closed lower in spite of buying by foreign investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average finished 210.82, or 1.1 per cent, down at the day's low of 18,514.55. The session's high was 18,810.28. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 4.52 at 1,511.39, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 4.31 at 1,251.07. After opening firmer, the Nikkei soon lost steam on selling for arbitrage unwinding. The index rebounded in mid-morning trading in line with a stronger futures market, before falling on selling by corporate investors wanting to realise profits ahead of the March book closing. Losers outnumbered gainers by 583 to 399, with 178 issues unchanged. Volume remained flat, at 280m shares. Investors remained cautious ahead of the upper house vote on the political reform bill today. Overseas investors, who have supported the recent rally, also scaled back their purchases. But in spite of the Nikkei's decline, traders took comfort in advances in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and East Japan Railway, both considered important benchmarks for market sentiment. NTT gained Y6,000 at Y839,000, rising for the 14th consecutive day on a report that the government will invest in next generation telecom networks using optical fibres. JR East climbed Y7,000 to Y483,000 on buying by financial institutions. Construction companies were weak following the arrest of executives at Ohbayashi due to their alleged involvement in a bribery scandal. Obayashi dropped Y25 to Y618 and Shimizu retreated Y28 to Y815. Profit-taking depressed high-technology issues. Matsushita Electric Industrial fell Y20 to Y1,560 and Sony Y100 to Y5,830. Automobile shares were also weak, Toyota Motor losing Y30 at Y1,830 and Honda Motor slipping Y10 to Y1,620. Japan Airlines firmed Y10 to Y640 as investors were encouraged by its restructuring programme, which includes staff cuts through attrition and transfers. All Nippon Airways moved up Y10 to Y1,100. Oki Electric, which also announced a restructuring plan, appreciated Y5 to Y584. In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 110.86 to 20,601.00 in volume of 45.8m shares. Roundup Pacific Rim markets took divergent routes. TAIWAN finished with a 2.9 per cent fall on a late wave of heavy selling after the market failed to sustain early gains. The weighted index, which scored an intraday high of 6,179, ended a net 178.50 off at 5,876.43. Turnover was again high, totalling TDollars 98.83bn against Monday's TDollars 105.02bn. The market remains vulnerable to profit-taking as sentiment has been dampened by the weekend news that authorities had shelved a proposal to raise the Dollars 5bn ceiling on foreign investment in the market. Investors were also worried by growing market talk that the central bank might tighten monetary policy slightly after the Chinese New Year in early February. HONG KONG moved sharply higher after news of a Sino-US textile accord and on anticipation of strong corporate results, although profit-taking dragged prices off their peaks. The Hang Seng index closed 224.77, or 2.1 per cent, higher at 11,017.69, but off a late-afternoon peak of 11,218.24. AUSTRALIA slipped off its early highs to finish lower on the day on profit-taking, leaving the All Ordinaries index 6.1 down at 2,232.1. SEOUL saw a technical rebound, as blue chip manufacturing issues and shares with low p/e ratios pushed the market up. The composite index rose 9.81 to 873.06. SINGAPORE closed mixed in tepid trading as the market consolidated last week's sharp volatility. Malaysian shares traded over the counter continued to be weak, still reeling from last week's sell-offs. The Straits Times Industrial index edged forward 3.37 to 2,280.41. KUALA LUMPUR recovered from the day's lows to close slightly higher on balance as investors picked up stocks made cheaper by the recent correction. The composite index was finally 6.08 points up at 1,110.22, after touching 1,085.56 in the morning. BOMBAY finished lower on unsubstantiated rumours of an impending rise in petroleum prices, and continuing settlement problems in the Ahmedabad stock exchange. The BSE 30-share index receded 69.85 to 3,951.02. NEW ZEALAND continued to move ahead, reassured by the December quarter consumer price index, which proved in line with expectations. The NZSE-40 capital index ended 6.43 higher at 2,248.40. BANGKOK edged higher as investors consolidated their positions. The SET index put on 2.92 at 1,477.03. MANILA rose slightly as selling pressure eased and buyers sought shares at the lower prices. The market index added 0.44 at 2,910.97.</p>

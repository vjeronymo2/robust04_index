			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Attention centres on D-Mark issues A handful of D-Mark issues were the main focus of an otherwise quiet day in the eurobond market. Chemical Bank lead-managed two floating-rate note issues, DM150m for Union Bank of Finland and DM80m for Landsvirkjun, Iceland's national power company. The Landsvirkjun issue, which has a five-year maturity, pays a coupon of three-month Libor plus 22 1/2 basis points and was priced at a discounted margin of 28 basis points over Libor. According to the lead manager, the notes saw demand from banks and non-bank investors, mainly in Europe. The Union Bank of Finland issue, however, was widely criticised as being too tightly priced. It pays a coupon of three-month Libor plus 15 basis points and was offered at a discounted margin of 18 basis points over Libor. 'Why should I buy a BBB/A3-rated Finnish name when I can get Italy at around the same level?' asked one syndicate official. The establishment of money market funds in Germany, which have been permitted since August 1, has created increased demand for money-market paper. However, according to one Frankfurt dealer, the funds so far have been buying mainly domestic paper. Still, 'once they've exhausted the domestic market, they'll start buying sovereign names', he said, adding that he expects to see increased issuance of D-Mark FRNs in coming months. In the dollar sector, dealers are looking to a wave of Japanese government-guaranteed issues in coming weeks. Japan Highway is expected to lead the way today or tomorrow with a Dollars 500m 10-year offering priced to yield around 30-35 basis points above US Treasuries. It is expected to be followed by deals from Japan Finance Corp for Municipal Enterprises, the Japan Development Bank, the Metropolis of Tokyo and the Cities of Kobe and Yokohama. Argentina will borrow Dollars 500m from commercial banks for 18 months, according to the country's finance secretary Mr Roque Maccarone, Reuters reports. The loan, led by Credit Suisse and Chemical Bank, will cover a shortfall in government financing created by delays in privatisations of several state companies, he said. Meanwhile, Columbia is preparing a Dollars 150m sovereign eurobond issue for the end of September for offer principally in Asian markets, said deputy finance minister Mr Francisco Azuero. He said details were still being worked out, but the idea was to use Dollars 100m for early repayment of more expensive foreign debt and to employ the remaining Dollars 50m on government spending.</p>

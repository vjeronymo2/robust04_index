			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: Pioneer plans ADollars 178m share placement PIONEER International, the Australian building products and oil group, is to raise ADollars 178.5m (USDollars 139.4m) through a placement of 70m shares at ADollars 2.55 a share. In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange yesterday, Pioneer said the money would enable it 'to take advantage of potential expansion opportunities in south-East Asia and in Europe in building materials activity.' Pioneer said the money would also be used to reduce some debt. The placement is being fully underwritten by stockbroker J. B. Were and Sons. Pioneer's share price remained steady at ADollars 2.68 following the announcement. The group has building supplies businesses in Australia, the UK, US, Germany, Spain, Hong Kong and Singapore. It reported a 40 per cent rise in net profit for the six months to December 31, to ADollars 88m, helped by rising oil prices during the recent Gulf conflict.</p>

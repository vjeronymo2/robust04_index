			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Sport: Smooth path for Seles - Tennis THE DEFENDING champions and top seeds, Jim Courier and Monica Seles, were treated kindly in yesterday's draw at Flinders Park, Melbourne, for the ADollars 7m (Pounds 3.1m) Ford Australian Open which starts there on Monday. Courier can face no-one ranked higher than 69 en route to the fourth round where his seeded opponent would be the young Spaniard Sergi Bruguera. The remarkable Seles, 19 and already the holder of seven Grand Slam titles, has a quiet quarter with either Gabriela Sabatini or Jana Novotna cast as her likely semi-final opponent. Fortunately for Seles the lively Spaniard, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, who beat her last year in Montreal, is in the lower half. So is another 1992 conqueror, the teenage Olympic champion, Jennifer Capriati of the US. These two will form the chief challenge to the No 2 seed Steffi Graf who no longer seems troubled by the ankle injury which hampered her last week when she and Michael Stich won the Hopman Cup for Germany for the first time. It is impossible to look beyond Seles as the likely champion. She has lost only once in a Grand Slam final during the past two years - to Graf at last year's Wimbledon where her attempt to stifle the natural grunt she emits whenever she strikes the ball ruined any chance she might have had of beating an in-form opponent. Already the double-handed world champion has issued a plea for understanding about this vexed question. 'I said after Wimbledon that if I do grunt, great; if I don't grunt, great . . . I just can't stand everybody talking about it . . . it took so much away from my game, so I don't want to make an issue of it.' Martina Navratilova (ranked 5) is the only woman among the top 30 who is missing. At 36 one can understand Martina's desire to harbour her reserves for a determined attack on a 10th Wimbledon title. The most remarkable woman in Melbourne is not a player - at least, no longer a player. The former Bulgarian champion, Julia Maleeva (nee Berberian), is the mother of the three sisters Manuela, Katerina and Magdalena. All are seeded. This is a record. We should strike a medal in Julia's honour. No medals are due to the British women. Only American-born Monique Javer has bothered to challenge. A sad reminder of Britain's lowly place in the tennis firmament. The men's singles looks ominously strong with only Andre Agassi missing from the top 10. The enigmatic American has never played at the Australian Open and was a last-minute defector with a bronchial infection. If, as he should, Courier reaches the quarter-finals, he might find either the gifted Czech left-hander, Petr Korda, or the tall Dutchman, Richard Krajicek, as his opponent. Korda is one of the most exciting of the newcomers with hints of Rod Laver about his game, but Krajicek, who was prevented by injury from playing his semi-final last year, is going through a slump. In the semi-finals, Courier should play Boris Becker or Michael Chang. Courier has not won a tournament since successfully defending his French Open title in June. An early loss would probably cost him the world No 1 ranking, either to his old friend and rival from their days at the Nick Bollettieri Academy, Pete Sampras, seeded No 3, or to Stefan Edberg, the No 2 seed. It is a subject Courier does not like to dwell on. 'As long as I am comfortable with the way I am playing, the ranking will take care of itself. It took a while to absorb all the pressures but I don't put extra pressure on myself by thinking too much about it' he says. He has certainly looked comfortable enough in Adelaide this week in the Rio Slazenger Challenge, an eight man special event which he won last year. This sort of pressure-free match play on the same Rebound Ace surface and with the same balls provides excellent practice for Melbourne. Edberg, is also in Adelaide with his wife Annette and his British coach Tony Pickard, but not yet completely free of the cold he picked up in Qatar last week where he lost in the semi-finals to Becker. Pickard said he was content with Stefan's draw which suggests a quarter-final against Ivan Lendl, recovered at last from a groin injury, or Wayne Ferreira of South Africa, a semi-finalist last year. Either Sampras or Goran Ivanisevic, the fifth seed, should be lying in wait in the semi-finals. Becker's prospective fourth round match against fellow German Stich is a tantalising prospect for it was a loss to Stich in Hamburg last year that prompted Becker to seek help from Gunther Bresnick to improve his fitness. Anyone who saw Becker's superb form in winning the ATP Tour Championship last November will know just how successful their work together has been. Both Becker and Stich crave recognition as the leading player in Germany so every meeting between them has a special significance. The lone British man in the draw is Wimbledon hero Jeremy Bates. He plays Heath Denman, a 22-year-old wild card from Queensland.</p>

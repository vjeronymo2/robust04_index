			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANALYZING PSYCHIATRISTS' KIDS;  </P> <P> IN A NEW BOOK, SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF ANALYSTS SOUND OFF ON THE PERILS OF LIFE  WITH FREUD  </P> <P> Thomas Maeder's childhood was ruled by the minute hand. Between 10 minutes of  the hour and the hour, he could not leave his room to go downstairs because  that was when his parents' patients came and went.  </P> <P> Children of psychiatrists, like Maeder, often live in terror of violating  taboos surrounding their parents' in-home offices. One child has described her  analyst mother's office as "very much a sacred place, like a chapel."  </P> <P> But now, in Maeder's new book, "Children of Psychiatrists and Other  Psychotherapists" (Harper and Row), psychiatrists' kids finally get the chance  to symbolically storm these formerly off-limits sanctuaries.  </P> <P> Maeder invited 200 children of mental-health professionals to make themselves  at home on Dad's analytic couch, to flip through the pages of Mom's books by  that guy named "Frood," and -- ultimately -- to tell the world what was going  on up in the children's wing while the folks were sequestered in a sound-proof  room.  </P> <P> Maeder's subjects claim they suffered an assortment of childhood miseries  related to their parents' profession. Many report feeling over-analyzed,  emotionally invaded and intimidated by their parents' perceived omniscience.  They are confused by their parents' patients, the strangers who seem to want to  possess the mother or father that children think belong only to them.  </P> <P> High on their list of grievances also is the pressure these children felt to  appear emotionally healthy at all times. "Psychiatrists' kids are not supposed  to be a mess," said one woman who was interviewed for the book. "I was  constantly being told I was a very happy child."  </P> <P> Although the book has angered some in the psychiatric community, at least some  of the adults Maeder interviewed are grateful to him for giving them a chance  to compare notes with other children of psychiatrists.  </P> <P> "I used to think it was just the nature of childhood that parents had this  certain kind of authority in defining reality," said a Bay Area artist who  asked not to be named out of deference to her psychiatrist parents who are  still practicing. "I'm glad he (Maeder) brought this up. I think it's a service  to us."  </P> <P> Ben Little of Mill Valley, Calif., said: "It was very helpful to me to see  there were other people in the world who had experienced problems of a similar  nature." His father, now dead, was a Hollywood psychiatrist.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Myth About Psychiatrists' Kids  </P> <P> According to Maeder, there has been little written until now on the particular  problems of psychiatrists' children, although Maeder found that nearly everyone  he interviewed could cite the folk belief that psychiatrists' kids are crazy.  (When asked why this myth exists, 47% of Maeder's subjects said it was because  there was some factual basis to the assumption.)  </P> <P> Maeder, who lives with his wife and three children in Narberth, Penn., is the  son of a psychiatric social worker and a psychoanalyst. He started work on his  book, he said, because he thought it ironic that a segment of society that many  would consider best-equipped for child-rearing might actually be making a mess  of the job.  </P> <P> Maeder, 37, set out to find subjects for his study by contacting presidents of  regional psychiatric associations. Many of his subjects came to him by more  informal means; a friend, for example, scanned wedding announcements in the New  York Times for brides and bridegrooms who claimed a psychiatrist parent.  </P> <P> Other than a brief reference to his own parents in the introduction, Maeder  leaves himself out of book. "I didn't really feel like talking about myself  that much," he said in a telephone interview. That his parents are deceased  probably made it easier for him to write the book without feeling he was  betraying them, he said.  </P> <P> That response was shared by many of his subjects, who were willing to bare  their own psyches but were protective of their parents' privacy. Most of the  anecdotes in the book are anonymous, Maeder said, for that reason.  </P> <P> A believer in the "wounded healer" concept, Maeder says the shortcomings of  psychiatrist parents have much to do with the kind of people who take up the  profession in the first place. Thus, he writes: "The bad effects of therapist  parents are predominantly the result of flaws that afflict them as people  rather than by-products of their training."  </P> <P> One critic of Maeder's views, Dr. Harvey Ruben, public affairs chairman of the  American Psychiatric Assn. in Washington, finds the "wounded healer" stereotype  offensive and misleading.  </P> <P> "At best, Maeder's book is irrelevant and at worst it's damaging," said Ruben,  an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Yale University and the father  of three children.  </P> <P> Proceeding from a small, self-selected sample, Ruben said, Maeder makes  generalizations about 220,000 or more mental-health professionals nationwide,  condemning them in their roles as professionals and as parents.  </P> <P> "He's saying, 'If your parents are helpers, they're probably scarred,' " Ruben  said, adding that Maeder's conclusions are "skewed and lopsided."  </P> <P> Maeder himself uses the word lopsided to describe his book because, he said, he  was most interested in looking at the negative influences of psychiatrist  parents on their children. As he puts it in the book's introduction, "By  observing how things can go wrong, we are better equipped to perceive how they  might go right."  </P> <P> "I do not claim that most therapists harm their children more than other people  do, nor that therapists mostly do harm to their children," he writes. "Most  therapists, most of the time, act like anyone else, for better or worse."  </P> <P> But Ruben worries that, in reinforcing the commonly held belief that  psychiatrists are emotionally unbalanced, Maeder's book could dissuade troubled  people from seeking treatment.  </P> <P> It does seem that an anti-psychiatry bias exists in many of Maeder's subjects.  For instance, one son of a psychiatrist concludes, "Psychiatry is probably  nonsense."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Author Is Surprised  </P> <P> The author appears hurt and surprised by the critical reaction to his book. "I  didn't set out to trash psychotherapists, despite what many of them seem to  think now," said Maeder, who has written three previous nonfiction books,  including a history of the insanity defense.  </P> <P> Maeder said the first question everyone wants to ask of a psychiatrist's child  is: Did your parents analyze you?  </P> <P> Many of Maeder's subjects answer "Yes." They noted that the very language that  shaped daily interaction in their households tended to be analytical; one  subject remarked on the number of times the word hostile crept into ordinary  conversations.  </P> <P> The Bay Area artist said, "If I dropped my fork at dinner, my parents said:  'What's going on? What are you angry at?' when I may have just dropped my  fork."  </P> <P> Not only did the parents of his subjects often analyze their children, Maeder  found, but they fairly routinely subjected them to the analysis of others at an  early age. So entrenched is the expectation that all children go to therapy  that one psychiatrist's daughter said when she got married one of her first  thoughts was: "Now I have to start saving for my kids' analysis."  </P> <P> But Maeder said, "I got a lot of complaints from people who thought they had  been made much worse by being sent to therapy as children."  </P> <P> Being rushed to therapy prematurely can "magnify small problems," he added.  </P> <P> Little, for example, said that his parents, when he was a child, chose to send  him to a a psychiatrist; what he says he really needed, in retrospect, was help  with his homework.  </P> <P> Some of the complaints mentioned in the book are by no means exclusive to  therapists' children, Maeder said. Psychiatrists are not the only parents who  want to give people the impression their kids are perfect.  </P> <P> "Psychiatrists are just a little more invested in that," he said.  </P> <P> Similarly, Maeder's subjects describe a power imbalance that exists to a degree  in almost any parent-child relationship. But the situation is exacerbated,  Maeder said, when the parent belongs to an "implied priest class" believed to  possess rare and mysterious powers.  </P> <P> Psychiatrists come to parenting with an arsenal of intellectual theories and  jargon that can be used to silence children who are just beginning to trust  their own instincts. One man told Maeder that when he or his siblings rebelled,  "We got hit with a Freudian whip."  </P> <P> Children of psychiatrists reported that the infliction of psychoanalytic  punishment made them feel stripped of any privacy. "I was very scared by the  idea that (my mother) could know me better than I know myself," said a  psychoanalyst's daughter, who added that she is now "determined that nobody  know me better than myself."  </P> <P> Maeder's book does not advise young psychiatrists on ways to avoid making  mistakes common to psychiatrist parents. Yet the subjects of the book hope his  work will be the first step in improving the lot of "PsyKs" as Maeder calls  psychiatrists' children, a variation of the abbreviation for preachers' kids,  sometimes referred to as PKs.  </P> <P> Despite the bleak picture painted by his book, Maeder said psychiatrists'  children are really not so bad off when the full range of childhood trauma is  considered. "They're not sick. They just have certain problems," he said. "But  they're actually pretty privileged. Their problems are sort of ethereal  compared to some."  </P> <P> One advantage to being a psychiatrist's child is that they almost uniformly  feel they have been raised in a more enlightened, stimulating environment than  that of their peers. Maeder's subjects suffered no shortage of museum visits,  piano lessons or fascinating tales of strangers' troubles at the dinner table.  </P> <P> About a third of those Maeder interviewed went into the arts; another third  into mental health professions. The artist from the Bay Area said in a  telephone interview that she vacillated between both professions, but settled  on art. She said it allows her the "spontaneity of expression" she was denied  as a child.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yinchuan, April 4 (XINHUA) -- The Ningxia Hui  Autonomous Region, a major animal husbandry base in China, has  concentrated its strength on building ten animal husbandry  production bases.    The bases cover 144 townships and 214 villages. They produce  respectively 33.2 percent, 30 percent and 80 percent of the  total meat, eggs and milk of the region.    The per capita milk share in the region is three times the  average level of the country.    Ningxia, a Moslem province and one of the five autonomous  regions inhabited mainly by minority nationalities, also  attaches importance to relying on science and technology to  improve its production.    The region has put into application over 30 research  findings  and items of technology, and developed new breeds of chickens  and animals.    Its chicken-raising industry has a production value of 175  million yuan (about 21 million U.S. dollars), and milk  production is ranked among the top in the country.    At the same time, the region has invested over 30 million  yuan (about 3.6 million U.S. dollars) in 37 infrastructure  projects in the animal husbandry production bases.    According to statistics, more than 153,000 ha of grassland  have been improved.    Last year, the region's total output value of animal  husbandry was 750 million yuan, 4.65 percent up over the  previous year.</p>

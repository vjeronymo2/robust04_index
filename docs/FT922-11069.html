			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Robusta COFFEE prices fell to 20 year lows in London, but dealers feel that the market still has substantial downside potential. 'It's not looking too good. July was supposed to have support at Dollars 780 but that gave way right on opening,' one trader said. 'This continued selling pressure just reveals the weakness of the market. There are no buyers around.' It was unclear whether more origin selling of robusta coffee had taken place, but Cameroon was rumoured. COCOA recovered some ground in the afternoon on a technical short-covering rally after the July contract dropped earlier to within Pounds 3 of Pounds 588 a tonne - last year's low and now a major support level. But cocoa futures are expected to test support again over the next few days. On the LME ZINC backtracked from earlier 16-month highs while other metals drifted back in largely routine trading. Dealers said the run-up to a peak of Dollars 1,315 a tonne for three-month metal in the morning, underpinned by technical tightness, resulted in profit-taking in the afternoon. But the close is technically constructive with the market holding above Dollars 1,300. Traders expect a move towards Dollars 1,330. Compiled from Reuters</p>

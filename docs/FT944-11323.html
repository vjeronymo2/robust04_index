			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / A hard act to follow: John Ridding asks whether France's drive to privatise can sustain momentum As Renault, the motor group, enters the home straight on its journey to the stock market, the French government is weighing the next steps in its programme to dispose of much of the state's corporate assets. Individual investors have until Thursday to confirm orders for shares in the partial privatisation of Renault, but Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, is already plotting his next steps. He has lit the fuse for the privatisation of Seita, the state tobacco monopoly, by launching the process to select adviser banks for the sale. Mr Alphandery has also emphasised that the insurance companies Assurances Generales de France and the Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance are on the auction block, and that industrial partners are being invited to invest in Groupe Bull, the computer maker. The preparations reflect the government's strategy of having several irons in the fire. But they also demonstrate the need to maintain momentum in France's ambitious privatisation drive. For 1995, the centre-right administration of prime minister Edouard Balladur is banking on receipts of FFr55bn (Pounds 6.5bn) from the sale of state assets, the same target as for this year, and vital to its goal of cutting the budget deficit from FFr301bn in 1994 to FFr275bn. Maintaining such momentum could, however, prove tough. As the government moves down the list of 21 public-sector groups it selected for sale on taking office last year, the going may become more difficult. Part of the reason is that the government has set itself a hard act to follow. The first four privatisations - Banque Nationale de Paris, Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals group, Elf Aquitaine, the oil company, and the insurer Union des Assurances de Paris - involved stars of the public sector. Profitable, and familiar to investors through the existence of tradeable securities, they slipped smoothly into the hands of private investors. The combined receipts totalled FFr94.4bn, with Elf alone raising FFr34.9bn. The flotation of Renault, another of the state's prize assets, is also proceeding smoothly. Institutional investors have demanded 15 times as many shares as they had been allocated. Industry observers expect sufficient demand for the 60 per cent of the shares alloted to be sold to individual investors. It is after Renault, however, and the FFr8bn or so its flotation will bring the state that the challenges become more complex. This is partly because some of the next candidates for sale are in blighted market sectors and partly because the sale of profitable public-sector companies leaves the government with fewer large, attractive assets. Political sensitivities in the run-up to next spring's presidential elections and the depression looming over the stock market may further complicate the task. Mr Alphandery is keen that Assurances Generales de France should be dispatched as soon as possible and most industry analysts regard the insurer as an attractive company. But like other insurers, AGF has been hit hard by market conditions. Its shares have fallen by more than 35 per cent this year, as the value of its bond portfolio has plunged with rising long-term interest rates. CNP, the other insurance company on the block for partial privatisation, has been similarly affected. 'The government is ready to launch both operations,' says one insurance industry analyst, 'but it cannot be seen to be flogging off the state silverware too cheaply.' Such considerations are a factor in the decision to start work on Seita. Like AGF and CNP, the tobacco monopoly is potentially attractive, achieving net profits of FFr585m last year, against FFr447m in 1992. But privatisation may prove politically sensitive, since Seita's Gitanes and Gauloises brands are, for many, an important symbol of French culture. There is also opposition among trade unions at the company, which have started to mobilise against the sale. Seita, like several other companies near the top of the privatisation list, is a relatively small operation. Although the sale of AGF would bring more than FFr15bn, the tobacco group is valued at about FFr7bn, more than the expected receipts from the partial privatisation of CNP. Bull, still reporting losses, is unlikely to bring significant income, despite the FFr11bn in subsidies it has been granted over the past two years. The problem facing the government is that big does not mean beautiful. State-owned giants such as Air France and Credit Lyonnais are incurring big losses and undergoing radical recovery programmes that must be completed before they can be sold. There are several attractive large companies on the privatisation list. These include Thomson, the electronics group, Usinor Sacilor, the steel company, and Pechiney, the aluminium and packaging concern. But each has its complications. Thomson may merge its defence and consumer electronics activities before sale. Usinor Sacilor, although back in the black after losses of FFr5.7bn last year, must reduce its debt burden of FFr20bn. Mr Jean-Pierre Rodier, who took over as chairman at Pechiney in July, believes the need to return the group to profit and reduce borrowings suggests privatisation in 1996, rather than next year. If many of the privatisation candidates are not yet in a state of readiness, neither is the market. It is not just the insurance sector which has been hit this year. The CAC-40 index of leading shares has fallen by 19 per cent since its February peak, depressing the value of privatisation issues. With the exception of BNP, all the privatisation issues are trading below their issue price. 'Investors may have been disappointed,' says a broker at one French securities house. 'Renault should see strong demand, but less familiar and less profitable companies may experience a more cautious approach from the public.' Caution may be compounded by the increased competition for the savings of the French public. Last month, for example, the government launched a scheme to sell 10-year government bonds direct to the public: with a yield of about 7.5 per cent they are proving an attractive investment. Despite the array of challenges, the French government is sanguine. 'The success so far augurs well for the next stages,' says one official. He cites strong demand from institutional investors, and says that industrial partners have also shown a healthy appetite for privatisations. The planned investment in Renault by Lagardere group, the defence and communications company that helped develop the Renault Espace car, is one example. Officials play down talk of disenchantment among retail investors. 'Privatisation shares have fallen by less than the market as a whole, and investors are aware of the potential upswing,' says an aide at the economy ministry. At the industry ministry, the message is that the restructuring programmes necessary to prepare the next batch of privatisation candidates will bear fruit. 'If you look at Renault, not so long ago it was a sick man of the public sector. It is possible to get the loss-makers into shape and it will be helped by the strong revival in the domestic economy.' Such an assessment is supported by industry observers. 'They have the assets, and the political sensitivity of some of the sales will matter less after next spring's presidential elections,' says one merchant banker. One option is to sell a second tranche of shares in Renault, reducing the state's holding to below 50 per cent. Mr Alphandery has dismissed such a scenario. 'We have no plans for a second operation,' he says, reflecting official sensitivity concerning the company, a former stronghold of union power. But Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chairman, hinted at the possibility last week that the flotation represented a step rather than an end in his company's privatisation process. Should individual investors demonstrate the same appetite for Renault as their institutional counterparts, Mr Schweitzer's state shareholder may come to agree. As one Paris banker puts it: 'If other issues are proving tricky, then a further sale of Renault shares could prove an enticing way of easing a budgetary bind.'</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / People: Amzallag - pulling BNP together Robert Amzallag, 50, has been given the job of making BNP's presence felt in the UK. He has been appointed managing director of BNP UK Holdings which oversees the UK operations of the recently privatised French bank. BNP, one of the oldest-established French banks in the City, has assets of over Pounds 9bn in the UK and employs more than 800 staff. However, its various operations - ranging from its traditional bank branch, to BNP Capital Markets and BNP Mortgages - have tended to work independently of each other. The latest reshuffle is part of an effort to achieve greater synergy and co-operation between the group's financial and commercial banking activities in the UK. BNP says it wants to build on its traditional strengths in foreign exchange, lending and bonds. Following the French parent's decision to reorganise its worldwide management structure along product lines, responsibility for BNP's worldwide bond business has been delegated to London. Philippe Truffert, managing director of BNP Capital Markets, will head the operation. BNP says that it also intends to develop a significant presence in London in structured finance, international private banking and emerging markets. BNP is unusual among foreign banks in the City in having its own board of local UK directors chaired by Lord Hunt, 75, a former civil servant. Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman of Kingfisher, has been appointed a non-executive director of BNP UK Holdings.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Lessons of the Attack"] </F>   [Text] The murderous attack in 'Afula will be remembered,  first, and foremost, as an act of revenge for the Hebron  massacre. The people killed in 'Afula are as much the victims of  Dr. Baruch Goldstein as the Muslims praying at the Cave of the  Patriarchs.    The attack is also a signal from Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement] and the Islamic Jihad that the Oslo agreement has not  solved the problem of terror. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres  was right in saying that this was a deed committed by people who  want to murder the peace.    It is a pity that at such sad times, Likud leaders cannot  rise above narrow political considerations. Bibi Netanyahu, who  called for terminating the peace talks with the PLO in the wake  of the attack in 'Afula, would probably be at a loss to explain  why an attack designed to remonstrate against the talks with the  PLO is a reason to stop the talks.    Yitzhaq Shamir said it has once again been proven that  security exists only where the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is.  Should one infer from this statement that along with Jericho  and Gaza, the IDF is also pulling out of 'Afula?    Moreover, were there no terror attacks during the Likud's  term in office? And if the peace process were to stop, would  the attacks also cease? That is utter nonsense. We mourn the  death of innocent Jews, we share the pain of the wounded, and we  are committed to tread the path we set out for ourselves and not  the one that loathsome terrorists are trying to dictate to us.</p>

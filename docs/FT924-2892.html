			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Deal gives VW control of all four marques VOLKSWAGEN'S move to take over the importer/distributor operations for VW and Audi vehicles in Britain from Lonrho for about Pounds 124m finally gives the German car maker control of all its four marques in the UK. Seat, VW's Spanish subsidiary, took over its UK distributor Seat Concessionaires (UK) from Lonrho in early 1990, while Skoda, the Czech car maker in which VW acquired management control in early 1991, announced last month that it would take over its UK importer, Skoda GB, with effect from January 1. Lonrho said that it would receive Pounds 88m in cash, Pounds 31m through the repayment of inter-company loans, and about Pounds 5m in the form of a dividend for the final quarter of 1992. It said that VAG UK had made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 25.6m in the year to the end of September. The takeover is due to take effect from January 1, but is subject to approval by the European Community competition authorities and by the VW supervisory board. VW said last night that the acquisition of VAG United Kingdom, which was first disclosed in the Financial Times in January this year, represented the final step in its strategy to gain control of its distribution operations in all the main vehicle producing markets in Europe, Germany, Italy, France, the UK and Spain. VW's franchise agreement with Lonrho was due to expire at the end of 1993. The way was first cleared for the takeover of the Lonrho operation in late 1987, when VW changed the previous two-year rolling contract to a six-year agreement expiring at the end of 1993. The terms of the contract change were never disclosed to Lonrho shareholders, despite the fact that the business represented more than a fifth of Lonrho's worldwide turnover.</p>

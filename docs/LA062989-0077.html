			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: SOUTH GATE;  </P> <P> COUNCILMAN SNAVELY'S SENTENCING POSTPONED  </P> <P> Sentencing of South Gate Councilman Odell L. Snavely for harboring two teen-age  girls at his toy store when he knew they should have been in school has been  continued until July 28.  </P> <P> Municipal Court Commissioner J. Francis Spelman last week granted the  continuance after Snavely's attorney requested that his client be allowed to  seek advice from another lawyer.  </P> <P> Attorney Kenton E. Krogstad told the commissioner during a June 23 sentencing  hearing in Huntington Park Municipal Court that Snavely wanted to make a motion  before the court but he had counseled Snavely against it. Krogstad told the  court he had advised Snavely against making the motion until he had conferred  with another lawyer. Neither Snavely nor Krogstad said what the motion was.  </P> <P> In February, Snavely pleaded no contest to two misdemeanor charges of  contributing to the truancy of a minor. Each count is punishable by up to one  year in jail and a fine of up to $2,500.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth Freeman said he agreed to the continuance rather  than face the possibility later of having the outcome reversed on some  technicality.  </P> <P> Freeman has recommended that Snavely serve a one-year jail term and be placed  on five years probation.  </P> <P> Before the February plea, the Sheriff's Department conducted a six-month  investigation of Snavely after two South Gate Junior High School girls, ages 13  and 14, alleged that Snavely touched them on the breasts while they were  working at his business, Del's Gifts and Toys. Freeman has stated that the  investigation did not produce enough evidence to file molestation charges  against Snavely.  </P> <P> According to a Sheriff's Department report, which is part of Snavely's court  file, four girls claimed they had been molested by Snavely, who would pay them  to help clean up his store.  </P> <P> Snavely has denied molesting anyone and said the girls fabricated the  accusations to distract from the theft of some jewelry from his store. He said  he had threatened to report them for truancy unless they returned the jewelry.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by David Hearst in Moscow, Anna Tomforde in Bonn; </F> "Ukraine Fails Nuclear Safety Test"]    [Text] Ukraine is bracing itself for what is expected to  be a damning report on nuclear safety after two accidents at  Chernobyl's remaining reactors during a visit by an  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team.    The accidents, though relatively minor, will add to concern  about nuclear safety in the former Soviet Union, where it has  been compromised by ancient equipment, an exodus of staff and  the smuggling of dangerous materials.    In Germany yesterday, a spokesman for the federal criminal  office in Wiesbaden said there had been a sharp increase in the  illegal trading of radioactive material from eastern Europe, on  a black market dominated by Russians, Poles and Czechs.    The spokesman said nearly 200 cases of nuclear smuggling had  been registered in 1992 -- about two-thirds involving eastern  European suspects. The figure was certain to rise in 1993, and  in some cases, he said, there had been indications of a  "background of organised crime".    In Monday's accident at Chernobyl, an alarm was set off in  reactor unit three, which was triggered by falling water levels.  A cable short-circuited as officials tried to reconnect the  reactor to the grid after two weeks of maintenance.    On Tuesday, a robotic arm failed while moving nuclear fuel  rods in the oldest reactor unit, number one. The failure sent a  container banging into an adjacent installation. Although these  were minor incidents, the first rating one on the international  scale of nuclear incidents, they scarcely enhance international  confidence in the running of the plant.    "It could emotionally influence the inspectors who were  there," Tatiana Yagish, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian nuclear  authority, said.    The IAEA has already declared the plant, and reactor number  one in particular, to be unsafe to operate, and the United  States has demanded the plant's closure. Ukraine signed an  agreement with the US to shut down the plant once it found an  alternative energy source, but Ukraine's parliament reversed the  decision on the grounds that they were becoming too dependent on  expensive Russian fuel.    The problem of safety has been compounded by an exodus of  qualified staff to Russia. Most were trained in Russia, and  many are ethnic Russians. Wage levels in the Russian nuclear  industry are three to four times higher than in Ukraine.  Chernobyl itself, the site of many incidents since the  catastrophe affecting reactor number four in 1986, has a new  director.    Last year, there were 175 separate incidents recorded at  Ukraine's five nuclear power stations -- a 20 per cent increase  on the previous year.    Ukraine is still struggling with the consequences of the  1986  disaster, which it admits has caused some 8,000 deaths, and is  still costing about 12 per cent of the national budget.    The concrete casing around reactor four has developed  serious  cracks. Last year, Ukraine launched a competition to design and  build an alternative, but nothing has been done.    The impoverishment of nuclear installations in eastern  Europe  is increasingly making Germany a "special attraction" to  dealers. But there have been no indications so far that traders  have found profitable business from buyers with Germany as an  end destination.    Some of the material came to Germany aboard Russian military  transports from Siberia, and was "stored" in former Soviet  military installations in eastern Germany before being offered  to potential buyers. German middle men were cooperating with  what was described as a "Russian-Polish nuclear cartel".    Radioactive material suitable for the construction of  nuclear  bombs has so far not been confiscated, the police authorities  said. But the smuggling of uranium, and non-nuclear substances,  such as scandium and red mercury, none the less posed a  "considerable danger" to both dealers and the public.</p>

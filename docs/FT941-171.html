			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Rival expected to take over LBC LBC, the troubled London commercial radio station, is likely to be taken over by London News Network in the next few weeks if agreement can by reached with receivers Arthur Andersen. The station, which lost its two London licences to LNR and was then outbid in the battle for the third national commercial radio licence, is expected to continue broadcasting for the time being. Mr Murdoch McKillop, one of the joint receivers appointed on Monday, yesterday said he believed that LBC's audiences were increasing and that the company would carry on broadcasting while its future prospects were reviewed. LBC, which is believed to be trading profitably, will cease broadcasting in October when its licences run out. One reason for calling in the receivers was the prospect that contingent liabilities, including redundancy payments, would exceed assets. The other was to concentrate the minds of LNR after talks had failed to reach an agreement. It would be very damaging for LNR if LBC were to go off the air prematurely, dissipating both the audience and a 90-strong team of experienced journalists. LNR made clear yesterday that it wanted a 'seamless transition' from LBC to the new licence holder. The likeliest outcome is that LNR will buy the assets of LBC, including goodwill, from the receiver and, in effect, begin broadcasting more than six months early. Talks between Mr McKillop and LNR began last night. Talk Radio UK, the highest bidder for the national speech-based franchise, is also monitoring events at LBC. Yet if the company linked with LBC to try out some of its ideas in London, they would have to go off the air for three months. The national licence does not start until the beginning of next year.</p>

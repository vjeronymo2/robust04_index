That decisions on the establishment and elimination of  state enterprises regarded as federal property (hereinafter  called federal enterprises) are to be made by the Russian  Federation Government on the basis of a joint representation by  the State Committee on the Administration of State Property, the  Russian Federation Ministry of Economics, and the federal organ  of executive authority which has been charged with coordination  and regulation of activity in the sector (sphere of  administration) concerned in conformity with the laws in effect.    Decisions on the establishment and elimination of federal  enterprises are subject to coordination with the organs of  executive authority of Russian Federation subjects on whose  territory the enterprises are located with respect to matters  which require such coordination in conformity with laws of the  Russian Federation.    2. That the Russian Federation State Committee on the  Administration of State Property and the Russian Federal  Property Fund, in accordance with the Russian Federation  Government's decision, speak as founders on behalf of the state  at enterprises established with the participation of other  persons.    Representatives of the state at the enterprises cited are  appointed by the Russian Federation Government or on its behalf  by the Russian Federation State Committee on the Administration  of State Property and the Russian Federal Property Fund.    The competence of federal organs of executive authority to  manage state property which is regarded as federally-owned when  federal enterprises are changed into joint-stock companies and  privatized is defined by Russian Federation laws on  privatization.    3. In cases when establishment of a federal enterprise is  financed with funds from the federal budget, the decision on its  establishment is made by the Russian Federation Government on  the basis of a joint representation by the Russian Federation  State Committee on the Administration of State Property, the  Russian Federation Ministry of Economics and Ministry of  Finance, and the appropriate federal organ of executive  authority.    Decisions on the transfer of funds from the federal budget  to  the Russian Federation State Committee on the Administration of  State Property and the Russian Federal Property Fund for the  payment of contributions to the charter capital of enterprises  being established are made in the same procedure.    4. Decisions on the reorganization of federal enterprises  which do not provide for a change in their form of ownership are  made by the Russian Federation State Committee on the  Administration of State Property in coordination with the  federal organ of executive authority which has been charged with  coordination and regulation of activity in the sector (sphere of  administration) concerned, the Russian Federation Ministry of  Economics, and (or) the Russian Federation State Committee for  Antimonopoly Policy and Support of New Economic Structures.    5. The competence of the Russian Federation State Committee  on the Administration of State Property is to include, together  with the other powers granted to it by Russian Federation laws:    --implementation of juridical actions related to the  establishment, reorganization, and elimination of federal  enterprises, except for those whose right of implementation has  been delegated by the Russian Federation Government to other  federal organs of executive authority in conformity with this  decree;    --the transfer of state property considered as  federally-owned in the established procedure with full economic  jurisdiction and operations management, as well as under a  lease, for the use of juridical persons on the basis of  contracts concluded with them; and    --control over the designated use and safety of state  property considered to be federally-owned which is assigned to  federal enterprises with the right of full economic jurisdiction  and to federal state institutions with the right of operations  management, as well as the property transferred to other persons  in the established procedure.    The Russian Federation State Committee on the Administration  of State Property has the right to assign implementation of its  powers to other territorial agencies.    6. The federal organs of executive authority charged with  coordination and regulation of activity in the sectors (spheres  of administration) concerned are to be granted the right:    --to approve the charters of federal enterprises in  conformity with the standard charter approved by the Russian  Federation State Committee on the Administration of State  Property; and    --to appoint and dismiss the managers of federal enteprises  and to conclude, change, and cancel contracts with these  managers in the procedure established by laws in effect.    The organs cited are the legal successors with respect to  the  contracts concluded previously with the managers of federal  enterprises by the organs of state administration of the Russian  Federation, the former USSR, and the RSFSR, as well as by  concerns, associations, and other associations of enterprises  during the period when they were granted the powers concerned.    The conclusion of contracts with newly appointed managers,  as  well as the renewal of contracts upon the expiration of the  periods for which they were concluded, is to be based on the  model contract adopted by the Russian Federation State Committee  on the Administration of State Property.    7. A federal enterprise is to dispose of the property  assigned to it exclusively in conformity with the specific  assignment of property stipulated when it is transferred or the  enterprise charter.    A federal enterprise does not have the right to sell the  real  property assigned to it, to use it as payment for the charter  capital of other enterprises, to lease it, to transfer it as  security or to make use of this property by other means without  the consent of the Russian Federation State Committee on the  Administration of State Property or its territorial agency.    In the event that this property is lost by a federal  enterprise, it is not utilized in conformity with its specific  purpose, or established rules for its use are violated, the  Russian Federation State Committee on the Administration of  State Property has the right to confiscate the enterprise's  property to which the restrictions stated in this paragraph  apply or to reorganize the enterprise in the procedure  established by Russian Federation laws.    8. In order to monitor the specific use and safety of state  property considered as federally-owned which is assigned to  federal enterprises with the right of full economic jurisdiction  and to federal state institutions with the right of operations  administration, as well as property transferred in the  established procedure to other juridical persons, the Russian  Federation State Committee on the Administration of State  Property and its territorial agencies, as well as the federal  organs of executive authority cited in Paragraph 6 of this  decree which have coordinated with it, have the right to assign  and conduct documentary and actual checks (inspections,  inventories), and to assign audits.    9. Federal organs of executive authority have the right to  make decisions on the establishment, reorganization, and  elimination of federal state institutions under their  jurisdiction if these decisions are made within the limits of  their budgetary allocations and work force.    Federal organs of executive authority and the federal state  institutions subordinate to them are to own state property with  the right of operations management and have the right to dispose  of this property only with the consent of the Russian Federation  State Committee on the Administration of State Property.    The procedure for use of administration buildings and office  facilities intended for federal organs of executive authority  and state institutions is determined by the Russian Federation  Government.    10. Within 1 month, the Russian Federation State Committee  on  the Administration of State Property is to:    --draft, adopt, and record a standard charter for a federal  state enterprise and a model contract with its manager;    --submit for approval by the Russian Federation Government a  draft Statute on the Russian Federation State Committee on the  Administration of State Property, defining its powers in  conformity with this decree; and    --to draft a statute, jointly with the Russian Federation  Ministry of Economics and Ministry of Finance, on procedural  matters related to the establishment, elimination, and  reorganization of federal enterprises, as well as the  confiscation of their property which is not being used in  conformity with the specific assignment or charter objectives  for the enterprise's activity, and submit it for approval by the  Russian Federation Government.    11. The procedure for administration of federal property  located abroad is defined by special decrees issued by the  Russian Federation Government.    12. Decisions made by the Russian Federation State Committee  on the Administration of State Property and its territorial  agencies in the procedure established before this decree came  into effect by the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet decree of  27 December 1991 "On the Delimitation of State Property in the  Russian Federation to Federal Property, the State Property of  Republics in the Russian Federation, and Krays, Oblasts,  Autonomous Oblasts, Autonomous Okrugs, the Cities of Moscow and  St. Petersburg, and Municipal Property" retain their legal force.    13.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, April 7 -- Polish Defence Minister Piotr  Kolodziejczyk was received by President of Ukraine Leonid  Kravchuk on Thursday, the second day of his visit to Kiev.    During the meeting, the two discussed political problems in  Europe. Both sides stressed the importance of friendly contacts  between Poland and Ukraine.    Earlier in the day, Minister Kolodziejczyk and Deputy Prime  Minister Valeriy Shmarov agreed that the setting up of a joint  Polish-Ukrainian bank would make cooperation between the two  Defence Ministries easier.    The two also discussed U.N. peacekeeping missions and the  "Partnership for Peace" initiative. The Polish side was  informed that Ukraine is to send more of its soldiers in blue  helmets to former Yugoslavia in the near future.    Ukraine, it was stressed during the meeting, does not intend  to join any military bloc and thus treats "Partnership for  Peace" initiative as a factor increasing security in Europe  allowing for broader cooperation outside military alliances.    A group of Polish experts meeting with Ukrainian  counterparts  worked on details of technical cooperation. The Polish side is  interested in missiles while the Ukrainians in small arms. They  also discussed the possibility of establishing communication  links between Polish and Ukrainian General Staffs.</p>

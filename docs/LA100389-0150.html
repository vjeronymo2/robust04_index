			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> WILDCAT STRIKERS PERIL PEUGEOT PACT  </P> <P> A bid to end a damaging monthlong strike at Peugeot, France's biggest private  auto maker, appeared to be in jeopardy today after strikers refused to end  their occupation of a key foundry.  </P> <P> Trade union officials said one group of strikers voted to continue a sit-in at  the Mulhouse foundry in eastern France.  </P> <P> The strike by several hundred workers at the Sochaux and Mulhouse plants -- a  small minority of the work force -- has cut back production of Peugeot's  best-selling 205 model and cast a shadow over the launch of the luxury 605  model.  </P> <P> First deliveries were made to showrooms Monday morning and a Peugeot spokesman  said there were enough cars to meet initial orders.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the car maker, which employs 145,000 people in France, said  Peugeot will withdraw its offer of talks if the strikers failed to leave the  foundry by Wednesday.  </P></p>

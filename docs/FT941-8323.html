			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Dutch propose first tax on mobile phones The Netherlands is set to become the first country in the world to levy a special tax on mobile telephones. The Dutch government is proposing to impose a 7.5 per cent tax on the profits of companies operating new digital cellular networks, when licences are issued this year. The tax has been approved by the Dutch cabinet over objections from the business community, but it has still to be endorsed by parliament. If it passes, the two operators of networks built to the pan-European digital GSM standard will be obliged to pay the tax. The GSM tax may be taken as a precedent for similar levies elsewhere. The practice of auctioning cellular mobile licences is well established but, as mobile telephony moves into the mass consumer market, the medium-term revenue potential of a special tax is considerable. The Dutch government argues that the tax will be fair because it plans to allow only two GSM operators. These are KPN, the state post and telecommunications company which is slated for privatisation in June, and a second, private-sector operator which will be chosen in the second half of 1994. The government considered, but rejected, a proposal to charge each operator an up-front fee of about Fl 500m (Pounds 172m). Greece, with GDP barely a quarter that of the Netherlands, two years ago raised the equivalent of Pounds 110m each for two GSM licences. The US expects to raise more than Dollars 10bn next year in an auction of licences for Personal Communications Services, a new cellular technology. The Dutch levy would be on pre-tax profits. Payments would be tax-deductible, taking the effective rate down to about 5 per cent. There would be no immediate revenue because it would take operators a few years to achieve profitability. The proposed tax, devised by the Dutch Finance Ministry, has been attacked by KPN and business groups as a 'penalty on innovation' when the Netherlands is already behind other western European countries in the introduction of GSM networks. It has also been criticised by the Labour party, the junior partner in the governing coalition, and by the right-wing Liberals. However, the prospect of the tax does not appear to have deterred potential bidders. KPN expects to launch its network in July and competition for the second licence will be fierce. The three main Dutch banks - ABN Amro, ING and Rabobank - are expected to put in bids with local and international telecoms partners. The second operator is unlikely to get its own GSM network off the ground before 1995, but KPN will be required to open its network to its competitor while this second network is being built.

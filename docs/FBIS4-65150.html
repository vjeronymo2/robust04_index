			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- According to President Boris  Yeltsin, Russia wants to become a "member with equal rights" of  all European institutions. Immediately before the start of his  talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Yeltsin told journalists that  he hoped to get the chancellor's support for this. Yeltsin  announced that a new era of reconciliation will begin between  the two nations after the Russian troops depart.    Kohl welcomed Yeltsin as a "friend of our country and our  people." With reference to the dramatic changes in the world,  he said it is now important for Russia and Germany to make the  correct decisions with prudence and far-sightedness. He also  expressed the hope that the reforms in Russia will be successful  under Yeltsin's leadership. Kohl emphasized that there have  been terrible but also great chapters in the history of the two  states. They must learn from both the bad and the good things.</p>

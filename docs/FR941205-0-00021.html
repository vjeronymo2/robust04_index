			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments also criticized the proposed rule for barring persons with aggravated felony convictions from eligibility for withholding of deportation. The comments argued that the preclusion in section 243(h)(2)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1253(h)(2)(B), which bars a grant of withholding to a person who, ``having been convicted of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community,'' requires a two-pronged finding: that the alien was convicted of a particularly serious crime and that the alien constitutes a danger to the community. The comments stated that the INS should not presume that every aggravated felony is a particularly serious crime or that every person convicted of such a crime is also a danger to the community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response and Disposition: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  These provisions of the rule are mandated by the congressional enactments regarding limitations on the granting of relief to criminal aliens. The definition of ``aggravated felony'' in section 101(a)(43) of the Act was added by section 7342 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;690, 102 Stat. 4181, 4469 (November 18, 1988). The Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101&hyph;649, 104 Stat. 4978 (November 29, 1990) (1990 Act) defined additional crimes as aggravated felonies and added further disabling provisions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 1990 Act &sect;501, 104 Stat. at 5048. In addition, section 515(a)(1) of the 1990 Act created section 208(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1158(d), which states that an alien convicted of an aggravated felony ``may not apply for or be granted asylum.'' 104 Stat. at 5053. Section 515(a)(2) of the 1990 Act amended section 243(h)(2) of the Act, 8 USC 1253(h)(2), to require that, for purposes of the statutory bar to withholding of deportation, ``an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony shall be considered to have committed a particularly serious crime.'' 104 Stat. at 5053.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Neither section 208(d) nor section 243(h)(2) of the Act provides for a ``balancing test'' to be employed in the case of a person convicted of an aggravated felony. Such a person is barred from relief without regard to the merits of his or her claim. Inclusion of aggravated felonies as ``particularly serious crimes'' also is consistent with the long-standing administrative interpretation of the Act that crimes such as armed robbery, robbery, burglary, embezzlement, and possession for sale of cocaine and heroin are ``particularly serious crimes.'' Moreover, the Attorney General, through the Board of Immigration Appeals, consistently has held that section 243(h)(2)(B) compels the finding that an alien constitutes a danger to the community if he or she has been convicted of a particularly serious crime.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Matter of A&hyph;A&hyph;, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Interim Dec. 3176 (BIA 1992);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Matter of K&hyph; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Interim Dec. 3163 (BIA 1991);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Matter of Carballe, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  19 I&amp;N Dec. 357 (BIA 1986),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> modified on other grounds, Matter of Gonzalez, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  19 I&amp;N Dec. 682 (BIA 1988).

In enacting section 7342 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Congress defined certain crimes as aggravated felonies without regard to the date of conviction. Section 515(b) of the 1990 Act was amended by the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991, Pub. L. 102&hyph;232, December 12, 1991, 105 Stat. 1733, 1752, to mandate that the statutory bar in section 208(d) of the Act applies to convictions entered before, on, or after November 29, 1990, the effective date of the 1990 Act, and applies to all applications for asylum made on or after the same date. Congress also expressly limited the application of certain disabling provisions (e.g., the deportation ground under section 241(a)(4) of the Act and the ineligibility for voluntary departure under section 244(e) of the Act), to an alien ``convicted, on or after the date of enactment of [the 1988] Act, of an aggravated felony.'' Pub. L. 100&hyph;690 &sect;&sect;7343(c) and 7344(b), 102 Stat. at 4470, 4471. If the term ``aggravated felony'' were to be interpreted to apply only to convictions occurring on or after November 18, 1988, then the prospective language that placed limits on the retroactivity of specific sections of the 1988 Act would be redundant, in violation of the maxim that no provision of a law should be construed to render a word or clause surplus.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Matter of A&hyph;A&hyph;, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Interim Dec. 3176 (BIA 1992) at 8&hyph;10 and n.13.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is clear that Congress intended to prohibit an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony from applying for or being granted asylum or withholding of deportation.

One comment noted that the proposed rule would prevent ``country shopping'' and encourage potential refugees to seek protection in the first country of refuge. Another comment agreed that the proposed rule will be beneficial, provided that a treaty or other formal agreement designate the ``safe country.'' Another comment recommended that the proposed rule be amended to prohibit an asylum application from a person applying for admission at a Port of Entry and who departed for the United States or is coming from a country which is signatory to either the 1951 Convention or the 1967 United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, and in which the alien would not face harm or persecution and would have access to a full and fair procedure for determining his or her asylum claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, most comments opposed giving asylum officers and immigration judges the authority to deny asylum as a matter of discretion on this ground to an otherwise qualified applicant. Several comments claimed that these provisions do not establish acceptable standards for refugee safety or due process in the receiving country, and thus do not fulfill the requirements for a proposed rule under the Administrative Procedure Act. Another comment warned that the ability to determine what is a fair procedure for asylum should not be left to the discretion of governmental agencies where political considerations may play a large role.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, April 7, IRNA -- Majles Vice-Speaker  Hojjat ol-Eslam Hasan Ruhani discussed major regional issues and  international developments with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad  here today.    During the meeting which lasted more than two hours Hoj.  Ruhani also conveyed a verbal message from President Akbar  Hashemi- Rafsanjani to his Syrian counterpart.    Hoj. Ruhani described the Zionist regime as the "origin of  the unrests in the sensitive Middle East region" and said this  regime spoke of peace spuriously in an effort to take advantage  of the regional resources.    "Peace is in contradiction with the very nature of this  usurper regime," he added.    Referring to the massacre of the palestinian worshippers in  al-Khalil [Hebron], Ruhani regretted that some elements who  consider themselves as the representatives of the Palestinian  nation fell into humiliation by signing compromising deals, and  in fact committed treason against the holy Palestinian ideal.  He predicted that the Palestinian intifidah and Islamic  resistance in Lebanon which are supported by Iran and Syria and  the Islamic ummah at large, would bear fruit, and restore the  trampled rights of the Palestinian nation.    On the hajj pilgrimage, Ruhani said in the wake of the  agreement signed by the Iranian and Saudi Arabian foreign  ministers, the non-cooperation of the Saudi officials to provide  facilities for more Iranian pilgrims is "unjustifiable".    President al-Asad in reply said the similarity of the  Iranian  and Syrian positions concerning most of the important regional  issues as well as their resistance against the threats of the  Zionist regime were the root of the global arrogance hostilities  against the both countries. On the so-called Middle East peace  talks President al-Asad said the talks had not so far borne any  results. "Syria does not hope the talks to end in any just  results," he added.    Stressing that Syria would not overlook the trampled rights  of the brotherly Palestinian nation under any circumstances, the  president said his country was not ready to accept the planned  peace with the Zionist regime even if the talks lasted for  decades. He noted that Iran and Syria are targets of the  propaganda attacks by the global arrogance led by the U.S. due  to their independent and anti-Zionist stances.    "The accusations like violation of human rights and  terrorism  and the last one, i.e., anti-drug campaign will be removed, if  we step back from our righteous stances," the president said.    Expressing pleasure with the level of Tehran-Damascus  cooperation, President al-Asad expressed hope that he would  visit Iran in a near future.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / SFO 'knew Levitt would avoid jail' in fraud case The Serious Fraud Office knew Mr Roger Levitt would not go to jail when it accepted the offer of a guilty plea by the disgraced financial services salesman in return for all other charges against him being dropped. The SFO said on Friday Mr Levitt's sentence of 180 hours of community service was a matter for the judge. Mr Levitt pleaded guilty to deceiving Fimbra, the insurance industry regulator, over the collapse of the Levitt Group with debts of Pounds 34m. Fraudulent trading carries a maximum seven-year jail term. Senior sources at the SFO acknowledged yesterday they knew Mr Levitt would walk free. Its counsel, Mr David Cocks QC, was present in the judge's chambers on Monday when Mr Justice Laws indicated he did not intend to jail Mr Levitt. Mr Cocks then met Mr George Staple, SFO director, who came to the court in Chancery Lane before the final deal was struck after months of bargaining. The SFO did not feel at that point, however, it could either protest against the proposed leniency of the sentence or withdraw its offer to drop other charges. Privately the SFO is said to be very angry and disenchanted with the judge's decision. The SFO had been exploring a plea-bargain deal since May. A series of offers was made to Mr Levitt in an attempt to obtain his conviction while avoiding a trial. These were all rejected by Mr Levitt, who wanted a guarantee that he would not go to prison in return for pleading guilty. 'Levitt drove a very hard bargain and said 'no' to everything until he had to give away hardly anything at all. At the end of the day, the SFO just lost its bottle,' said a lawyer closely involved in the case. The disclosures will add to the controversy over the sentence passed by the judge on Mr Levitt and the SFO's handling of the high-profile prosecution. At issue is the pragmatic policy of the SFO, adopted after the failure of the Blue Arrow fraud trial, of seeking, when appropriate, to avoid trials by securing suitable convictions through plea-bargaining. The SFO's resort to plea-bargaining began in May this year after the judge, having already ordered that the case be split into two trials, ruled much of the prosecution evidence inadmissible in the first trial. However, lawyers are still confused over the SFO's decision to mount the fraudulent trading trial first. The second trial - involving a total of 21 charges including forgery and false accounting - would have lasted five to six weeks compared with three or four months. No action is to be taken on these charges which will lie on the file. The call by some MPs this weekend for the attorney-general to appeal against Mr Levitt's sentence on the grounds of leniency will prove fruitless. Such appeals cannot be made in cases where offences, such as fraudulent trading, can be tried either in a magistrates' court or a Crown Court.</p>

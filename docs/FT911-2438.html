			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / G7 divided by debt relief issue ATTEMPTS to find agreement among the Group of Seven industrialised countries at their Washington meeting over the limiting of official debt forgiveness have failed. As a result, the customary reference to the international debt strategy was absent from Sunday's G7 communique. Debate on the issue followed agreement by the Paris Club of creditor governments to write off at least 50 per cent of Poland's official debts. A similar deal is expected to be agreed for Egypt. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, said yesterday that he had 'categorically refused' to agree to a proposed statement on international debt. The statement would have attempted to 'ring fence' the Polish and Egyptian debts settlements. Forgiveness of government-to-government debt had previously only been available to the poorest countries, mainly in Africa. Poland and Egypt are both defined as lower middle-income debtors. Mr Beregovoy agreed that there should be no generalised debt forgiveness, but said that there were other lower middle-income countries - particularly those African countries aiming for more democracy - which might deserve such treatment on a case-by-case basis. French officials are thought to have four countries particularly in mind: Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Senegal and Gabon. Governments of some industrialised countries, in particular Japan, fear that debt forgiveness for Poland might create an awkward precedent. Japanese officials have said that states obtaining debt relief from Japan will find it hard to get new loans from their government. The US, which has pressed for debt relief for both Poland and Egypt, has distinguished the two as deserving cases by pointing out that they are burdened by the highest level of official debt per capita of any of the developing countries. The issue of further official debt forgiveness is unlikely to go away. Britain and others are pressing for deeper and more sustained alleviation for the poorest countries, mainly in Africa. The so-called Trinidad Terms suggested last autumn by Mr John Major, the prime minister and former chancellor, would relieve up to two-thirds of the debts of the poorest countries. This proposal is expected to be backed by a meeting today of the Development Committee, the joint group of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank which is concerned with development issues. The UK government would like to have agreement on the Trinidad Terms to announce in time for the London economic summit in July. Paving the way Page 8 Editorial Comment Page 20 Lex Page 22</p>

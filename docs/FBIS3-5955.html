The statement points out that this is not a mere  humanitarian  matter but a serious political problem of the Korean nation and  compatriots and, at the same time, an international human right  issue. It says the South Korean treacherous clique are  committing a crime by violating the dignity and interests of the  nation and human rights, hand in glove with the Japanese  Government, though it has yet to make apology and compensation.    The statement points out that the South Korean authorities,  under the mask of "humanitarianism," are trying to lay their  foothold against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in  the Far East of Russia, sow the seed of dissension within the  nation and foster confrontation, and thus perpetuate the  division of the country.    The statement demands that the South Korean authorities  promptly renounce the treacherous scheme and the Japanese  authorities think first of their compensation to the Koreans  overseas and no more do act obstructive to the reunification of  Korea.</p>

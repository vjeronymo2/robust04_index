			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Consumer credit growth slows CONSUMER borrowing rose only modestly in November, indicating that people are still cautious about taking on new debts. Official figures released yesterday showed that consumers borrowed a net Pounds 15m from lenders in November, substantially down from the Pounds 76m borrowed in October. The increase in the November figure disappointed economists' expectations of a more substantial rise. The latest figure took the total rise in credit in the three months to the end of November to Pounds 31m compared with net repayments of Pounds 13m in the three months to the end of August. The small rise in November supports evidence that interest rate cuts in September and October failed to stimulate a rapid recovery in consumer spending. Retail sales figures out last month showed that November was a poor month for retailers. The Treasury pointed out that the latest credit business figures do not reflect the most recent cut in interest rates - which took place in mid November. It added that consumers appeared to be borrowing at a 'steady rate' while making a 'prudent reduction' in their debts. The seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical Office also show that in November the amount of new credit advanced to consumers by finance houses, building societies and credit cards which are part of the Visa or Mastercard system was Pounds 4.01bn - slightly higher than in October when it was Pounds 3.83bn. The credit business figures do not include mortgages and account for only about 15 per cent of total private-sector debt. The sluggishness of consumer borrowing in recent months underlines expectations for a slow economic recovery as consumers, worried by rising unemployment, continue to make debt repayment a priority. A breakdown of the latest figures shows a sharp fall in net lending by finance houses, small net repayment on loans by building societies and no change in the amount of debt outstanding on credit cards. Commenting on the figures, Mr Michael Saunders, economist at Salomon Brothers said: 'In the coming months, consumer credit could rise slightly as the effects of recent mortgage rate cuts feed through to household budgets, but credit will remain sluggish compared with the surge in credit that occurred during the 1980s.'</p>

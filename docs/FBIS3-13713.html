The sources made these comments to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT after  the expiry of Hamas' deadline to the Jewish settlers and  occupation forces, after which it said it would deal painful  retaliatory blows to them. It is believed, however, that the  tightened measures and precautions have made it difficult to  carry out such operations, particularly as the Israeli  leadership has taken into consideration the possibility of such  operations by the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Squads -- the military  wing of Hamas -- to avenge the martyrs of al-Ibrahimi Mosque in  Hebron.</p>

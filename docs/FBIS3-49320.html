			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 10 (AFP) -- Bosnian Moslem and Croat  forces were locked in "heavy fighting" Monday in central Bosnia  even as peace talks between the two sides took place in Germany,  UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] and conference officials said.    The Moslem-led Bosnian forces Sunday tried to cut the road  linking the Croat-held enclaves of Vitez and Busovaca, but were  pushed back by Croat HVO [Croatian Defense Council] forces,  according to UNPROFOR spokesman Bill Aikman.    Clashes continued Monday with street fighting reported in  the  village of Buhine Kuce, on the southeastern outskirts of Vitez,  according to HVO officials in Zagreb. The officials, quoted by  HINA news agency, said the latest fighting had left at least  eight dead and 35 wounded.    Meanwhile, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and his  Croatian counterpart Franjo Tudjman held further talks near Bonn  Monday morning on the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The talks, which began Sunday evening, were being held  behind  closed doors amid strict security.    In Sarajevo, the airport remained closed to all but UNPROFOR  flights Monday after renewed shelling of the tarmac Sunday  morning. The shelling, attributed to the Serbs, delayed  Izetbegovic's departure for Bonn.    Speaking at the NATO summit in Brussels, US President Bill  Clinton warned Monday that the western alliance should be  prepared to implement threats of intervention in Bosnia if the  situation there did not improve.    Action and not rhetoric was needed to stop the  "strangulation" of Sarajevo and other UN-declared "safe areas"  in Bosnia, Clinton said on the first day of a two-day North  Atlantic Treaty Organisation summit.    "Those who attack Sarajevo must understand that we are  serious," he said, pointing the finger at the besieging Serb  forces.    France and other countries have been lobbying for NATO air  strikes on the Bosnian Serbs, as threatened in August, to stop  the shelling of Sarajevo.    Meanwhile, one of the French humanitarian organisations  engaged in providing relief aid to Sarajevo, Premiere Urgence,  said Monday it would stop sending convoys to the Bosnian capital  because besieging Serbs now demanded 50 percent of all aid  provided in exchange for allowing trucks through.    Speaking in Sarajevo, the new representative for the UN High  Commissioner for Refugees, Kris Janowski, Monday outlined the  plight of 75,000 Moslems trapped in another flashpoint --  Mostar, in the south of the country -- saying they were forced  to live "like rats" in cellars under constant bombardment.    Janowski, who had just returned from the city where Moslems  and Croats are engaged in fierce fighting, said the Moslem-held  city's eastern enclave had neither electricity nor drinking  water.    Inhabitants had to run a gauntlet of snipers to get water  from the Neretva River which divides the city and the two  warring sides, and it had so far proved impossible to get Croat  authorization to bring in a water-purification unit.    Food and medicine relief was getting through, but the Croats  were doing their best to prevent the Moslems from getting other  goods, including oil, the spokesman also said. Fortunately, the  winter had so far proved mild, he added.    Meanwhile, Sarajevo's OSLOBODJENJE newspaper Monday  published  an article praising the work done here by UN commander General  Francis Briquemont, who recently asked to be relieved of his  command after criticizing UN action.    The "upright officer," who has spend six months here, could  not agree to remain as a neutral observer, the paper said.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Democratic campaigners turn to a broader canvas: The race for the party's presidential nomination speeds up with a series of big primaries on the horizon AFTER weeks when candidates trod on each other's toes in the tiny state of New Hampshire, the nature of the campaign for the Democratic party's presidential nomination now changes. In New Hampshire, candidates could concentrate on a single state and 'retail politics,' meeting face to face with voters. Now, however, the race speeds up with two small votes in Maine and South Dakota followed by a series of big primaries on March 3, 7 and 10. 'You have got to campaign on March 3 in six states, and you cannot do that retail,' says Mr Bob Beckel, a Democratic campaign adviser. But Tuesday's primary has changed another element in the campaign. The strong showing of the two leading candidates - Mr Paul Tsongas, the former senator from Massachusetts, and Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas - has severely reduced the likelihood that a new candidate, such as Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas or Congressman Dick Gephardt of Missouri, might decide to run. Democratic party leaders have been voicing doubts about the quality of those now running and encouraged speculation that a heavyweight candidate might enter the race. But Mr Ron Brown, the party chairman, has made it clear he expects the nominee to be chosen from the current candidates, and several Democrat campaigners have scoffed at the theory that a late entry might still be possible. One party activist said: 'The thought has come up in every presidential election I can remember. The only time it worked was with Eugene McCarthy in 1968, and the rules have changed since then.' Mr Tsongas, looking his usual lugubrious self after winning in New Hampshire with 34 per cent of the vote, set off for New York yesterday to try to raise more campaign funds on the strength of his success. He is planning a whirlwind tour in the next few days which will include South Dakota and Georgia, but is expected to concentrate his efforts on the Maine caucuses this Sunday, on Maryland's March 3 primary, and on his home state of Massachusetts on March 10. Mr Clinton, by contrast, was beaming as he labelled himself 'the Comeback Kid' after shaking off a press assault over what he calls 'a woman I didn't sleep with and a draft I didn't dodge'. His 26 per cent vote gave him a strong second place that six weeks ago might have seemed a failure, but appeared a triumph when viewed in the light of his prospects last week. To kill the questions that have been raised about him, Mr Clinton needs to perform as strongly on March 3 and in March 10's 11-state Super Tuesday as he did in New Hampshire. That means outright victory in states like Georgia, Florida, and Texas, which should provide the natural political base for this moderate southern Democrat. For Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, with 12 and 10 per cent of New Hampshire votes respectively, the crucial test will be next Tuesday's primary in South Dakota, which borders both their home states. The sparsely populated state carries little electoral weight, but both candidates need a strong showing if they are to gain momentum for their fund-raising activities. 'People don't get out of this race because they don't think they can win some place down the road. They get out because the money dries up,' says Mr Beckel. In this respect, Mr Clinton is comfortably ahead of his rivals. Although he has had to spend more heavily than he had intended in New Hampshire to restore his battered fortunes, he still has a bigger campaign war-chest. If both the Tsongas and Clinton campaigns can emerge from this crucial period still leading the Democratic field, the scene could be set for a decisive contest in the big mid-western states of Illinois and Michigan, which both hold their primaries on March 17.</p>

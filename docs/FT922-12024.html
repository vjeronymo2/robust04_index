			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Yard concern over leaked document SCOTLAND Yard said yesterday it was concerned that a confidential report about intelligence on IRA activities in Great Britain had been leaked in the Republic of Ireland. The Irish Times reported that the document showed the Metropolitan police had 'little intelligence' on IRA active service units said to be behind the recent bombing campaign in London. The newspaper claimed the document said that the level of threat remained high and that an attempt at a 'spectacular' incident could not be discounted.</p>

			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Race for second place ONE OF the fashionable City sayings of the moment is that whoever wins this election will be in power for years to come. The theory is simple: the recovery may be a bit late, but it is bound to come soon enough for the incoming government to steal all the credit. This is not quite straightforward, because the same people are likely to say that if Labour wins, there will be such a crisis of confidence in the City that the recovery may not happen after all. However, the saving clause sounds like rightwing wishful thinking. Portfolio managers know that Labour governments have usually been pretty good for markets after an initial hiccup, and most will regard any early setback as a buying opportunity. Whatever they say, they believe in the coming recovery. This suggests a touching faith that the market's in-house forecasters, of whom about half projected a recovery in 1991, were simply a bit premature. The underlying model, they seem to be implying, is sound. But is it? The fact that no City guru went even half way to foreseeing the fall we actually experienced suggests a more radical mistake. This is underlined by what looks at first sight like a triumph for the City: poor as the City's desktop efforts were, the professionals with large economics staffs and big models performed even worse. Only one academic team (at Oxford) so much as got the sign right; one of the worst, suggestively, was the London Business School, which produced the whole Treasury top economics team. The really big battalions fell on their faces in a row. In rising order of disgrace, the Treasury, the EC and OECD, the National Institute and the IMF all got it wildly wrong. All these professionals are very good at modelling  - the art of getting a computer to find a suitable bit of history to repeat. The commonsense conclusion from their errors is that history - or at least recent history - is not repeating itself. Half of the problem is that private debt has reached levels in relation to income not seen for some 60 years. The professionals know this, and are busily trying to model debt deflation. But the other half concerns the relation of debt not to income, but to asset values; and we still don't know the half of it. Last week's announcements from Olympia &amp; York and Heron offer a grim reminder of how debt crises work: the really bad news may not appear until you thought it was all over. There are two reasons for this. First, both banks and property companies feel compelled to conceal some ugly truths as long as they can, because to do otherwise would mean admitting heavy and sometimes insupportable losses. If you are a developer, an empty building can still be valued on the rent you are asking, but a rent cut to win a tenant reveals the truth. If you are a banker, lending good money after bad can put off the day of provisioning. Confession in these circumstances can be a sign of strength. But it can also be a sign of weakness. Canary Wharf is a sad example. The potential losses on this and other London property developments have inspired the banks to prodigies of economy, closing branches and reducing staff. But each economy by the banks has further weakened the City property market, and so increased the potential losses. Now the banks, trying to push up their margins, have imposed charges that discourage borrowing; and so troubles which may seem restricted to one asset market can infect the whole economy. This kind of vicious spiral repeats itself again and again in a shrinking economy. Repossessions delay a housing recovery, bankrupt sales undermine retail markets, rising insurance premiums mop up part of rising incomes, falling government revenues push up long-term interest rates. At its worst, as 60 years ago, this process can lead to a self-feeding cycle of economic and market weakness, the kind of thing which wiped 90 per cent off Wall Street equity values in a collapse punctuated by a whole series of 'recoveries'. In its milder form - and although I may sound like a pessimist, I do not believe we face anything remotely like the 1930s - it means simply that the disappointments we suffered in 1991 do not make recovery more probable, as the govern-for-ever school seems to believe. Delay makes recovery less likely, and likely to be weaker than previously expected. As for self-starting recovery, that begins to look like Catch 22. The CBI says recovery depends on consumer spending; but consumer surveys show that willingness to spend depends on recovery. Repeat, altering where necessary, for investment. As for an export-led recovery, forget it unless you also expect devaluation (now tipped in the City as possible from the Tories, but unlikely from Labour). You may regard all this as typical Harris gloom, and ignore it; but there are signs that the big modellers are belatedly beginning to think gloomily, too. As recently as Budget day, the chancellor was suspected of having cunningly inflated his borrowing forecast, to leave the less room for Labour's promises. Now, rumour has it, Labour has learned that the chancellor understated borrowing to leave room for Tory promises; and that the estimate is still rising, as the end of the rainbow recedes. Indeed, Labour's scouts may well have got the message which the late Lord Kaldor brought back from some Treasury scouting on the eve of the 1974 election. As he emerged from a grim session with the forecasters he met Stuart Holland, an old pupil and then a rising hope of the radical left. 'Stuart,' he said, 'this is an election we have to lose]' That was one of Kaldor's sounder pronouncements; and judging from the way both the main parties are mismanaging their election campaigns, they may have taken it to heart. Or one of them, at any rate. Labour could buy itself some political time by blaming the whole mess on the Conservatives - but seems to have little idea how to use that time. The Conservatives seem equally bereft of ideas and excuses. Suggestive, that.</p>

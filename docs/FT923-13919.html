			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy demand for Glaxo DRUGS GROUP Glaxo saw unusually heavy turnover as buyers moved back into the stock. US investment bank Goldman Sachs raised its short-term recommendation to 'market outperformance' and the shares jumped 25 to 707p with more than 14m traded. The turnover was boosted by three large blocks of shares, totalling 5.8m, traded between 700p and 703p; Goldman was believed to the source of much of the business. The US house argues that the shares have slumped far enough and that worries about the timing of the general economic recovery are likely to encourage investors to return to relatively recession proof stocks. The enthusiasm also follows a recommendation on Monday from another US house, Wertheim Schroder. Meanwhile, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew has raised questions about the launch of injectable Imigran, the anti-migraine treatment, in the US. UBS says new data has been handed to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the drug has had to lose its fast-track approval status. The house says the approval could be delayed until the first quarter of 1993. However, Glaxo is believed to be disparaging about the research; insiders apparently refuse to accept that such information could leak from the FDA. Fisher slide A profits warning from Albert Fisher sent the shares tumbling and analysts rushing to cut forecasts for the fresh food group. Turnover was a hectic 29m shares - easily the heaviest traded stock of the day. Fisher blamed a glut in the produce market, caused by early harvests and low sales, for a drop in produce prices. Although analysts downgrades were not severe, the heavy fall in the shares - down 25 at 41p - was blamed on general anxiety among investors; this has followed trading problems previously signalled by the company, including stiff competition in the US and in the mushroom canning business in Holland. Yesterday's warning also raised worries that the dividend could be under threat. Among the welter of downgrades, Smith New Court and Nomura, both on Pounds 77m for this year, reduced forecasts to Pounds 60m and Pounds 63m respectively. Worries over Fisher hit other fresh food producers. Hazlewood Food lost 3 at 139p, Hillsdown 2 at 145p and Perkins Foods 2 at 95p. Rank active Interim results at the top end of market forecasts sent Rank Organisation shooting forward in early trading, at one stage to a gain of 18 at 649p. However, in discussions with the leisure group afterwards, analysts returned with their enthusiasm dented and ready to revise forecasts downwards. Most attention was focused on comments by Rank executives that there would be little new earnings growth this year, and profits would be eked from existing business through cost cutting. The shares closed a net 7 off at 624p in busy trading of 1.7m. There was some switching from Rank into Thorn EMI, the latter also benefiting from County NatWest support. The shares put on 15 to 788p. A Nomura buy note helped Forte, up 4 at 173p. British Aerospace was volatile, jumping 18 to 260p, early in the session on news that Airbus Industrie, in which BAe has a 20 per cent stake, had won a Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.61bn) order from United Airlines. However the shares retreated sharply, reaching 232p at the day's worst, after hints that a leading broker had raised doubts about the financial health of GPA, an important Airbus customer. Bargain hunting later in the session helped the shares rally off the bottom and they eventually closed 3 up at 245p on turnover of 2.7m. Kleinwort Benson cut estimates for the top stocks, including BP, Shell, Enterprise and Lasmo. Mr Paul Spedding, Kleinwort's oil specialist blamed the downgrades on 'purely and simply the dollar', but felt the sector would outperform in the medium term. He has lowered current year historic cost net income figure for BP from Pounds 600m to Pounds 450m and that for Shell from Pounds 3.12bn to Pounds 2.9bn. For Lasmo, Kleinwort expects net income to drop from Pounds 15m to Pounds 5m while, for Enterprise, the broker is now looking for Pounds 70m against a previous figure of Pounds 85m. Smith New Court was also said to have downgraded BP estimates, as was Nomura. Hoare Govett described the recent performance of the dollar and crude oil prices as 'a pretty hostile combination', while Mr Keith Morris, at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, warned that the exploration and production 'may not have yet found a floor - watch out for net asset value downgrades'. Mr John Toalster, oil specialist at Strauss Turnbull and a long-time bear of the oil sector, said confidence level in the sector was evaporating and that 'the next stop for BP is 180p'. BP shares, under pressure following the ousting of Mr Robert Horton, previous chairman and chief executive, eased 1 1/2 to 209 1/2 p in London on turnover of 16m, but were said to have come under sustained downward pressure on Wall Street after London closed. Shell fell 3 to 492p on 3.4m and Enterprise 9 to 385p. Lasmomanaged a 3 gain at 165p. Buying ahead of the share split on Monday helped SmithKline Beecham jump sharply. The registered shares, which are to be halved in price and doubled in number rose 30 to 912p. Cellular phone group Vodafone continued to suffer from the shift of sentiment towards Cellnet. This began with news of the latter's increase in market share and profitability and became more marked when Securicor revealed a big jump in profits earlier this week. Vodafone dropped 10 more to 310p yesterday on good turnover of 3.3m. Merrill Lynch said yesterday that Cellnet 'has taken the initative from Vodafone on the product, marketing and sales front and that Vodafone 'appears to have lost its way.' Vague bid talk helped GKN add 9 to 389p. Lucas Industries moved 9 ahead 124p, boosted by the talk in GKN and the increasing belief that the company is likely to maintain its dividend. Smiths Industries retreated 9 to 284p. Figures showing a 5 per cent first-half sales growth for LVMH helped lift parent company Guinness, the shares climbing 29 to 557p. The group also benefited from a large research note from Lehman Brothers. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (17).

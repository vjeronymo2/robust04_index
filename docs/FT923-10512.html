			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: First half rise for Union Bank of Switzerland UNION Bank of Switzerland said in a preliminary interim statement that business in the first half of 1992 developed positively both for the parent bank and the group, compared with the same period in 1991. But the bank, Switzerland's largest, said business had slowed in recent months because of the slow economic recovery and the caution investors were showing in forex and securities markets. Group cash flow was up and off balance sheet business made a much stronger contribution to income growth than interest related operations. Total assets of the parent bank at the end of June stood at SFr201.98bn (Dollars 154.95bn) against SFr199.67bn at the end of March. UBS said it would publish for the first time a full consolidated interim statement at the end of August.</p>

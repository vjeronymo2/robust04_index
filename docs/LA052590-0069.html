			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KIM IL SUNG KEEPS POWER IN N. KOREA; SON STILL WAITING  </P> <P> North Korea's "Great Leader," Kim Il Sung, began a new four-year presidential  term Thursday, defiantly lauding communism as he kept his iron grip on power.  </P> <P> Kim, now 78 and the world's longest surviving autocratic ruler, quashed  speculation that after 42 years at the top, he was ready to hand over power to  his son.  </P> <P> The son, Kim Jong Il, 48, has long been groomed to take over in what would be  the Communist world's first dynastic succession. The state propaganda organs  even named a flower after him.  </P> <P> But his father made it clear Thursday that the time is not yet ripe.  </P> <P> With communism crumbling throughout Eastern Europe, Korea watchers said, the  veteran revolutionary clearly decided that his isolated, reclusive state still  needs his experienced hand at the helm.  </P> <P> The official Korean Central News Agency, reporting on Thursday's special  session of the Supreme People's Assembly, said deputies rose as one to hail  Kim's reelection.  </P> <P> Other KCNA reports showed that Kim Jong Il did move up in the official  hierarchy, to his first senior state post as vice president of the National  Defense Commission. His father is the panel's president.  </P></p>

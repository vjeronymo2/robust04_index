			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Coca-Cola Enterprises: The Atlanta bottler said third-quarter profit fell 68.2%  due to increased marketing costs, reduced sales volume and the repurchase of  stock. Earnings totaled $12.7 million on revenue of $1.022 billion, compared to  $39.9 million on revenue of $1.025 billion in the same period a year ago. The  bottling company, which was spun off from Coca-Cola Co. in 1986, said volume  fell about 3%, reflecting the sale of the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of  Mid-America. The firm also repurchased about 1.2 million shares of common stock  during the quarter.  </P></p>

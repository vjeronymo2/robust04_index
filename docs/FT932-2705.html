			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Kuhne &amp; Nagel income advances to SFr38.6m KUHNE &amp; Nagel, the private Swiss-based forwarding group, said consolidated net income last year nearly doubled to a record SFr38.6m (Dollars 27.6m), but it anticipated a flat performance this year. The group, in which Lonhro sold a 50 per cent stake for DM340m (Dollars 212m) last year, said the remarkably strong result was due to the elimination of special spending, a considerable improvement in the business structure and profitability of its west European countries and the consolidation of its position in North America and Asia Pacific. Mr Klaus-Michael Kuhne, the chairman, said at the group's annual press conference that the first four months of the current year were above budget but trading conditions were deteriorating and he was sceptical about further profit growth in the full year.</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Observer: Where's the beef? With the dollar plunging daily against the seemingly impregnable yen, a leading Tokyo hotel - the Akasaka Prince - has a dish to help dollar-denominated travellers look after both appetite and wallet. It is called, rather unenticingly: 'Dollars 10 beef bowl with cup soup'. More temptingly, it's also 'calculated on today's rate of exchange'. Last week the dish cost Y958, before tax and service. The week before the price was Y1,020. Sure, Y62 gets you little more than a used matchstick in today's Japan; but even a toothpick has its place - with, say, the beef bowl soup.</p>

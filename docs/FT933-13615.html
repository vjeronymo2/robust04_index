			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / US to report on Pyongyang soon THE US yesterday promised a 'substantive' announcement next week on its talks with North Korea over two suspect nuclear sites and Pyongyang officials said the negotiations were making good progress, Reuter reports from Geneva. Mr Robert Gallucci, the assistant secretary of state and the US delegation leader, said the talks, which opened on Wednesday and had been expected to end on yesterday, would be extended to next Monday. 'We expect that we will have something substantive to share with you after Monday's meeting,' Mr Gallucci said in a three-line statement issued by the US mission in Geneva. Following his statement, Mr Pak Chang Rim, a spokesman for the North Korean mission told reporters the decision to continue until Monday 'shows that the negotiations are going well'. The talks concern US demands that North Korea open up two sites near its Yongbyon nuclear reactor north of the capital to inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), something the North Koreans have so far refused to do. Washington, worried that North Korea may develop a nuclear weapon and spark a crisis in Asia, has threatened to seek United Nations sanctions against Pyongyang unless it agrees to IAEA inspections. North Korea denies it is developing nuclear arms but caused alarm in March by announcing that it was pulling out of the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty, which bans non-nuclear states from acquiring atomic weapons. Negotiations with the US in New York last month led to North Korea suspending that threat. Western officials say the dispute centres on two buildings at Yongbyon which they suspect could be storing plutonium  - a basic ingredient of nuclear weapons - that North Korea has not declared to the IAEA. Neither side has given details of the Geneva talks, but an important theme is believed to be what Pyongyang calls the need for 'impartiality' by the IAEA, a Vienna-based agency which checks that nuclear fuel is not being diverted for military purposes.</p>

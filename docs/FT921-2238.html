			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Apex Trust chief made redundant MR BILL MATHER, chief executive of Apex Trust, the charity for ex-offenders, has been made redundant by Cork Gully, the joint court-appointed administrator of the troubled charity. The post of chief executive will be advertised if the trust, which has agreed terms with creditors, comes out of administration. Apex Trust said the Home Office, an unsecured creditor, was not enthusiastic about negotiating with the trust to increase its core funding if Mr Mather stayed in an executive position. Mr Mather will be retained by the trust as a consultant.</p>

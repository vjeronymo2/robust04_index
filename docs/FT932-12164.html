			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Trinity Holdings makes Pounds 7.07m - Maiden full-year performance slightly above flotation forecast TRINITY HOLDINGS, the specialist vehicle manufacturer which came to the market last October, produced maiden pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.07m for the year to end-January. The outcome - slightly higher than the flotation forecast - compared with Pounds 3.39m last time. Earnings per share of 10.7p, against 5.2p, provided ample cover for the dividend which, as promised, is 1.5p. Turnover rose 34 per cent to Pounds 109.9m and is expected to rise again in the current year on the back of, as Mr Geoff Hollyhead, chairman, said, 'a record order book and with increased registrations in our major markets.' Although the devaluation of sterling has made Trinity more competitive overseas - over a third of its output is exported - the rise in turnover this year will be less marked than during the previous 12 months. The turnover total included a first-time contribution of Pounds 12.6m from the acquisitions of Reliance Mercury Vehicles and Carmichael International, respectively producers of specialist tractors for use in docks and airports and specialist fire fighting vehicles. Mr Hollyhead said that Dennis Specialist Vehicles, which is both the largest division in the group and the leader of the UK bus market, is budgeting for further growth but not at the same rate as in 1992-93 when sales climbed to Pounds 48.7m against Pounds 36.9m. Trinity had cash of Pounds 5.1m at the year-end, the flotation having cleared borrowings and redeemed the group's preference shares. Of the Pounds 1.42m interest charges, Pounds 1.3m was incurred before flotation. With this background, the group is looking both to finance organic growth and to expand through further acquisition. Noting that opportunities had been examined in both the UK and abroad, Mr Hollyhead said: 'We are not averse to an overseas manufacturing base,' but added that Trinity is not prepared to push gearing above 30 per cent.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nelli Shmakova: "Foreign Trade Firms' Contracts </F> Are Being Broken: Russia Will Get Back the Debts--If the  Departments Agree"]    [Text] Of all the existing methods for paying off  credits granted by the former Soviet Union to countries of Asia,  Africa, and Latin America, specialists consider the most  realistic to be paying a debt with commodity deliveries. But the  numerous changes in Russian legislation have turned this  possibility into a utopia too. Yesterday the administration of  the Mashinoimport VO [foreign trade organization]--one of the  organizations which handles deliveries of commodities to pay off  debts--received a letter from the RF Ministry of Finance which  imposed work conditions which can be considered nothing but  enslavement.    The method of paying off the indebtedness of the developing  countries with deliveries of goods, despite all its flaws, in  principle could at least partially eliminate the difficult  problem of paying the debt. On the one hand, Russia was supposed  to receive various types of raw and processed materials,  technological equipment, and consumer goods, thereby satisfying  the most acute needs of our consumers in this sphere. On the  other, the budget would have received a considerable amount of  money. This practice gave perfectly positive results until 1993,  but then the situation changed drastically. Among other things,  the system of subsidizing imports was abolished and the term for  transferring money earned from selling goods to the budget was  limited to one month (according to specialists' calculations,  this operation can sometimes take up to 6 months). In response  to these measures, foreign trade organizations stopped  fulfilling contracts concluded. And this year the situation  involving paying off credits with commodity deliveries was  aggravated even more by the March increase in import duty rates.    In accordance with the new letter from the Ministry of  Finance, the term for settling accounts with the budget is in  fact increased--up to two months. But now firms must present the  so-called guarantee obligation when Vneshekonombank (which, as  everyone knows, services transactions on debt obligations of  other countries) receives the shipping documents or a letter of  credit is opened there. With this obligation, after two months  time has elapsed, the associations grant the bank the right to  deduct, on a nonacceptance basis, the shortfall from their own  accounts, and if there are insufficient funds in the accounts,  the organization is responsible with its fixed and working  capital.    In this way, when fulfilling a state order, the associations  are inevitably threatened with bankruptcy. The Ministry of  Finance undoubtedly had good intentions--increasing budget  revenue, but the conditions it proposed on deliveries do not  suit anyone, and that, in turn, in no way helps replenish the  Russian treasury. For example, last year as a result of stopping  deliveries of goods to pay off credits, according to rough  estimates the budget had a shortfall of several tens of millions  of dollars just from the unpaid customs charges and taxes from  trade organizations engaged in importing these types of goods.    As a result of the actions of departmental bureaucrats, not  only is the fulfillment of intergovernmental agreements being  disrupted, but the very possibility of credits issued by the  former Soviet Union being returned is called into question.</p>

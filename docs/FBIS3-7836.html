The  head of the anti-KGB section of the CIA, Aldrich Hazen Ames, was  arrested on Monday [21 February] afternoon. He is accused of  spying for the KGB. The information revealed to the press about  this sensational affair seems to have been taken from police  movies and novels. Aldrich Hazen Ames has worked for the KGB  for several years. He was at the head of a team that was in  charge of discovering KGB spies in the United States. It is  easy to imagine how good the KGB agents felt after Aldrich Hazen  Ames was recruited. It is also easy to imagine -- from what one  learned from police movies and spy novels -- how much disaster  his betrayal must have caused to honest CIA agents. It is also  thrilling to think of how he was being followed by the FBI from  the moment when his foolish expenditures became suspicious. His  house was discretely searched, all rooms bugged, and he was put  under constant surveillance. And with this, the spy novel has  ended. However, a political novel begins now, and this will  last for quite some time. This will happen because this  espionage affair, that is, the Washington sensation, is also a  political affair. From this point of view, we should first note  that Aldrich Hazen Ames' arrest is a revelation for the whole  world, but mostly for Eastern Europe. Among several illusions  created by the dissolution of the Soviet Union was the belief  that the KGB has reduced its power in the world and in Eastern  Europe. However, the Monday afternoon event shows us that the  dismantlement of the Soviet empire has by no means weakened the  force of the KGB. On the contrary, if we were to judge by the  blow given to the CIA, the KGB seems to have become even more  powerful. It is true, Aldrich Hazen Ames was recruited during  the Cold War. However, he also continued to work for them  successfully after increasingly more frequent talk in the world  about the Russian-American friendship. For the Americans and  for the West in general, the arrest of the high CIA official  might have the positive effect of an alarm clock. Whoever is  still dozing, seduced by the pro-American smiles of the leaders  in Kremlin, will certainly wake up for good. The disclosure in  Washington proved that in a more thorough plan than that  required by protocol -- and intensely publicized -- Moscow's  current policy toward the United States and the West does not  differ much from the policy promoted by Moscow in the past. If  Aldrich Hazen Ames' arrest is important for the West, for  Eastern Europe and for us Romanians it is crucial. With our  sharp awareness of scenarios, we suspected that the KGB has not  meanwhile become a charity institution. We had the feeling  that, after December 1989, the KGB has not only not weakened its  activity in Romania, but more than that, it has strengthened its  activity. Likewise, we had the feeling that behind many of the  puzzling events that have taken place during the past four  years, one could sense the shadow of an institution for which  the December 1989 events were an excellent opportunity to  recover and expand its network in Romania. However, all this  was simple suspicion. Now, after the sensational discovery in  Washington, we have confirmation. The KGB had a man infiltrated  in the vital core of the CIA and, through this, the vital core  of the United States. The agent of the Moscow institution  worked intensively for quite a long time, without any of the CIA  suspicion-machinery having realized that the CIA is undermined  from the inside. What can we say about Romania's poor secret  services?! What can we say about all the other institutions of  our current leadership?! The KGB succeeded in penetrating the  CIA leadership. Can we believe so easily that it did not  similarly succeed in the case of Romania? Romania, a country  where the secret services have been established only recently.  Romania, a country where certain people can be bought, not with  one and a half million dollars, as was the case of the high CIA  official, but with a thousand times less. People might say that  I am not fair. That I do not take Romanian patriotism into  consideration. These would be valid objections, had there not  been a certain reality that every sensible person in Romania  noticed. After December 1989, every time our country was about  to take a decisive step toward the West, something cropped up in  the domestic arena to stop it. Something that continued to keep  Romania in a state of isolation that was wished by Moscow and  thus by the KGB. Such events were: the miners' incursion in  Bucharest, anti-Semitic attacks, and the distrust of certain  dignitaries who viewed our integration in European structures  favorably. Can anybody be really certain that, behind these  bizarre facts, there are no people like Aldrich Hazen Ames?</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by TRUD correspondent Nikolay Kishkin: "The First </F> Test of Strength"]    [Text] Over the past week the State Duma has generally  completed its internal self-organizing. Eight factions and one  deputy group, made up of slightly more than 400 deputies, have  been formed. Some remained "on the loose"--those who could not  form their own groups because of the high "threshold"  requirement but did not want to join the existing ones. Russia's  Choice became the largest faction, with 76 deputies;  interestingly, Zhirinovskiy's faction was pushed back to third  place by the New Regional Policy group of 65 deputies elected  from one-seat districts. The LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of  Russia] was two deputies behind in numbers. Now the faction and  group leaders together with the speaker form the Duma Council.    The setting up of parliamentary committees also proceeded  without particular cataclysms. Actually, all the struggles took  place behind the scenes: Even before the session the factions  divided the portfolios by striking deals as to who would get  which committee, and then took to the plenary session a  coordinated draft distribution of responsibilities to be adopted  as a package. Which it was. Zhirinovskiy's dream of becoming  chairman of the International Affairs Committee did not  materialize--the chairmanship went to V. Lukin. Two  committees--defense and national security--attracted special  attention. S. Yushenkov (Russia's Choice) and V. Ilyukhin  (Communist Party of Russia), respectively, were elected  chairmen. M. Zadornov (Yavlinskiy's bloc) took charge of the  Budget, Taxation, Banking, and Finance Committee. V. Isakov, a  former Supreme Soviet deputy and one of the leaders of the  irreconcilable opposition, on the other hand, essentially kept  his old job as chairman of one of the key committees--on  legislation and judicial and legal reform.    So what is the current disposition of forces? There will be  a  total of 23 committees in the Duma. Five of them are headed by  LDPR representatives; four by Russia's Choice; three each by  representatives of the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord]  and New Regional Policy; two each went to the APR [Agrarian  Party of Russia], KPR [Communist Party of Russia], and YaBL  [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc]; and one each to Women of  Russia and the DPR [Democratic Party of Russia]. This  distribution more or less corresponds to the proportional weight  of Duma factions, which did not keep one group of deputies,  among whom the best known was S. Baburin, from lodging a  protest. They did not like the fact that nine committees went to  representatives of reformist blocs. Overall there is a  perceptible desire on the part of a certain group of deputies  who brought to the Duma their old confrontational attitudes to  push these blocs aside. Although it is quite obvious that with  the current disposition of forces only an effort to work  together and take into consideration the opinion of others will  enable the Duma to function normally.    At the same time the first votes showed that three  factions--APR, KPR, and LDPR (165 votes)--clearly form a bloc,  at least when it comes to personnel appointments. It is hard at  this point to judge the leanings of the New Regional Policy  group--they will become clear only when political and economic  problems come up for substantive discussion. In any case, the  reformist blocs (which are not all that united among  themselves), which account for only 133 votes, should be  interested in cooperation with these factions, as well as with  Women of Russia faction.</p>

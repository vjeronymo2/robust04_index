			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bernhard Lichte] </F>   [Excerpts] Croatia is burning -- Serbian conquerors on the  march: Vukovar in October 1991; pictures that went around the  world. Soldiers had given vent to their fury. The results were  mass murders, destruction, and deportation. Vukovar is a  synonym for incredible human suffering. The streams of refugees  are witnesses and victims of innumerable crimes against humanity.    Tomislav Mercep at that time was responsible for Vukovar. He  had been brought to power during the confusions of the founding  of the independent state. Today he is an adviser to the  Croatian interior minister.    A confidential letter to President Tudjman states that  Tomislav Mercep was responsible for attacks on private  apartments, looting, torture during interrogations, and even  executions. The person who wrote this in August 1991 is the  Croatian Government's representative in Vukovar. Who is this  Tomislav Mercep? The construction engineer first drew attention  to himself with his militant speeches. Anyone who does not want  to live in the Croatian homeland can look for a new one  tomorrow, he grandly stated in the election campaign in 1990,  addressing the Serbian population in eastern Slavonia. Croatia,  Croatia, the enthusiastic crowd chanted.    One year later, Mercep formed the first unit of volunteers  at  the order of Tudjman's party, the Croatian Democratic Community  [HDZ]. In Bogdanovci, a small village near Vukovar, he gathers  2,000 men around him, whom he swears to the common cause. It is  10 March 1991, the state of Yugoslavia still exists. The  gathering is secret and illegal. Mercep announces that certain  equipment is available and will be distributed soon. Then the  territorial defense forces have to learn how to use them.  Everyone here understands what he means. The arming of the  secessionists begins.    Months later it is primarily Mercep's volunteers who fight  against the Yugoslav People's Army and are equipped with the  powers of a special police force. Subsequently, more and more  excesses are committed, for example in Gospic. The masters  changed several times in the town at the front line. Serbian  troops in December 1991 discover 24 bodies in the orthodox  cemetery -- executed, hardly buried, some of them charred. It  turns out that most of them are Serbs. However, the Croatian  public prosecutor of Gospic is also among the victims -- a  declared opponent to Tudjman's regime. Only Tomislav Mercep's  special units can be the killers. Some of them later boasted  that they had killed 150 Serbian snipers in Gospic -- this is  hardly possible without the knowledge and support of their  commander.    The Zagreb mass-circulation paper GLOBUS publicized several  other cases. Mercep's death squadrons, the paper's headline  stated, had killed a Serbian family in Zagreb and arbitrarily  shot people in Pakracka Poljana. UN investigators did find 19  bodies there.    Asked about the accusations, Mercep denies any guilt. But he  says:    [Begin Mercep recording, in Serbo-Croatian with superimposed  German translation] What are 19 dead Serbs compared with what  was done to Croats? By the way, if one wages war, one does that  to kill as many enemies as possible. After all, one does not go  to the front to sell ice cream. [end recording]    As I said before, this man is an adviser to the interior  minister, dealing with matters of the rule-of-law state and  responsible for the establishment of the police forces.    In the offices of Helsinki Watch in Zagreb, all cases of war  crimes are painstakingly collected. For the employees of the  organization, this is sometimes a dangerous job. One of them  has been shot at. Chairman Cicak has been repeatedly attacked.  Publicizing crimes and dealing with one's own guilt is not  particularly popular in today's Croatia, since it means to  finally pay farewell to the long -- perhaps too long --  cultivated role of the victim.    [Begin Cicak recording, in English with superimposed German  translation] The fact that we were attacked by Serbian  aggressors cannot mean that we keep silent about what Croats  have done to the Serbian minority in Croatia. Here, too, war  crimes have been committed and it is absolutely necessary that  Croatia itself punishes them with the means of a rule-of-law  state. We must not brush that off to the international  community. [end recording] [passage omitted]    Tough words also come from Stipe Mesic, president of the  Croatian Parliament. He has recently parted with Tudjman and  his party.    [Begin Mesic recording, in Serbo-Croatian with superimposed  German translation] The rule-of-law state in this Croatia does  not work. There is a lot of corruption and Mafia-like  connections, even with the highest places of the state. Those  who are guilty are not prosecuted, civic rights are in massive  danger. [end recording]    Does he believe that things will change in Tudjman's era,  that war crimes will be punished?    [Begin Mesic recording] No, absolutely not. There is no  chance.

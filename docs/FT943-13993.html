			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Rebounding with bonds The UK equity market has had an impressive week, with the FT-SE 100 index putting on over 100 points. Since the trough at the end of June, the index has recouped about a third of the loss it had suffered from the peak in early February. The big questions are whether current share prices are sustainable and, indeed, whether the change in mood will be strong enough to carry the market back to its previous peak. The main factor behind the market's bounce has been the recovery in European bond markets. Time and again economic statistics have reinforced the view that there is so far no sign of inflation. This week's news on UK retail prices and wage inflation was positive. European markets even took in their stride the dollar mini-crisis which subsided in mid-week. It was possible to argue that, with the dollar on a slide, European assets provided a safe haven. And, following the depreciation of sterling against the D-Mark, UK assets have started to look particularly cheap to continental investors. If bonds maintain their poise, equities should have little problem holding current levels. The market could even regain its previous peak if corporate earnings shoot ahead when the reporting season begins in the autumn. But bears see clouds on the horizon. Though inflation has not yet reared its ugly head, it could just be hiding. Moreover, the dollar's recent recovery still seems fragile. If its downward slide resumes, European asset markets might have to review their recent indifference to what happens on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>

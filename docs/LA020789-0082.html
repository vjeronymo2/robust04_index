			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LARROQUETTES FIND LIFE IMITATES 'JACK'  </P> <P> When they first met, John and Elizabeth Larroquette were toiling in Equity  Waiver theater. Now, 14 years, one hit series, four Emmys, three kids and a  Malibu house later, they're back in a similar setting, starring in the  two-character play "Happy Jack" by John Godber ("Bouncers," "Shakers"). It  opens tonight at the Coast Playhouse in West Hollywood.  </P> <P> "In those (early) days, the only obligation I had was to show up at the  unemployment office on time," the "Night Court" star recalled wryly. "Now it's  not nearly as easy. The rest of what's going on -- the series, remodeling a  house, a 2-year-old baby -- it's cacophony. The only time I was thinking about  the play was when I was on stage, and that's not good. But I think we're past  the hump now. We know the play; it's there. Now we can start getting some fun  out of it."  </P> <P> At first, the British-born Elizabeth (she's been in the United States for 20  years) wasn't sure she wanted to do it. "I hadn't been near acting in 10  years," she admitted. "I mean, I loved the piece, I loved the idea of working  with John again -- and wanted to rekindle that experience. But the prospect was  terrifying to me. A couple times I almost didn't do it. But I'm very glad I  did."  </P> <P> The piece, which tells the story of Jack and Liz, a British miner and his wife,  over the length of their marriage, affected both immediately. "You can see what  a (difficult time) they had," noted John, 41. "But the upside of that is that  they trudged through it and found whatever pleasure and joy they could in a  relatively mundane and -- in some ways -- suffering life.  </P> <P> "There is humor," he added. "There's also a facet of sadness to it. But they  never feel sorry for themselves. You don't see them going, 'Oh, what a  horrible, horrible life.' It's just, 'This is what I had to do and I did it.' I  can identify my grandfather in that. He was a longshoreman in New Orleans all  his life, working five or six days without coming home, sleeping in his truck  or on the wharves, trying to keep going and grabbing what he could of life --  just like Jack does."  </P> <P> Elizabeth felt the connection instantly: "It's not from my experience. But  there are touches in it that ring very true. My father was from Yorkshire. He  wasn't a miner and he didn't work as hard as Jack. But there are certain  locations that are very familiar to me. Some of the things (my character) says  -- I've heard them before. For Liz, it's the acceptance of what is, and finding  the joy in that."  </P> <P> As for the experience of working with each other, "It's better now," Elizabeth,  40, said firmly, "because we're older. Life contributes to your work. There's  no way we could have tackled these roles 10 years ago, because we didn't have  the life experience, the process, the understanding -- what we hope is the  understanding -- of the work."  </P> <P> John, a thoughtful and low-key antithesis to his unctuous television persona,  nodded in agreement.  </P> <P> "I think the difference is that I would have been more cynical of these people  10 years ago. When you're 30, you feel like, 'Hey, you live your life -- and if  it's not working, you change it.' I would have also said that my dreams and  aspirations were more admirable than these people's. But as time passes, you  realize the honor of being able to do what these two people did. I mean, they  just got in the harness and lived their lives."  </P> <P> Playing those lives is also rigorous. "Being on a television series for as long  as I have, I felt a need to exercise this particular muscle," said the actor,  who also has appeared in the films "Blind Date," "Star Trek III" and "Stripes."  </P> <P> "After six years, you sort of fall into a mode of operation. It's wonderful and  funny, the material's there, it's extremely satisfying in all aspects. But  you're not hanging on. I felt, as an actor, it was necessary for me to find  that feeling again -- that fear."  </P> <P> He shook his head. "I don't think it was complacency, because I work real hard  on 'Night Court,' trying to be as inventive as possible. But it's like doing  bench presses for three years, then deciding you have to run a race; you  haven't used your legs in three years. That's not to denigrate the experience  of being on television. But if I consider myself an actor and not just a  celebrity, then there are other things I have to fulfill."  </P> <P> Unfortunately, celebrity isn't something one can check at the door. "I doubt  we're going to be able to just hide here and do our little play," he agreed.  "There may be a little more attention than is warranted -- just because I  happen to be on a television series. So maybe the critics will come slightly  like that (poised to attack)."  </P> <P> And if they do judge him more harshly? "What are they going to do?," he asked.  "Say that I should stay on TV? Fine, I will. Hopefully, they'll be able to  judge it for what it is -- you know, 'Is it a good piece? Did they work well  together?' The worst thing they can do is say, 'He stinks.' Big deal. I've been  called a lot worse things than 'He stinks.' "  </P> <P> In that confident mode, Larroquette is already planning his next stage project  -- a production of Beckett's solo piece "Krapp's Last Tape," about a man  sitting in a room listening to tapes of himself talking.  </P> <P> "I was a disc jockey for many years," he explained, "so the idea of being able  to sit in a recording studio for weeks and just create the younger Krapp really  appeals to me. And it's something I can do by myself. That's why this ("Happy  Jack") appealed to me: It's just her and me. We get in the same car, go to the  theater. Then we race home at 11 and go to bed, because we know that at 5:30  there's going to be a 2-year-old sticking airplanes in our mouths, saying,  'It's time for me to get up!' "  </P> <P> Elizabeth (who segued from acting to five years in casting at Lorimar) believes  her husband's success hasn't gone to his head.  </P> <P> "Of everyone I know, John is the most suited to celebrity," she said. "I think  it's something he always assumed would happen, and he's very comfortable with  it. Actually, he deals with it much better than I do. I forget that we can't  just go to the mall and everything will be fine. And I'm still surprised at the  attention he gets. When it happens, I just want to pull back and sink into the  background. But he deals with it very graciously."  </P> <P> As he does acting with his mate.  </P> <P> "I can be very egotistical about acting with other people," John acknowledged,  "having an idea about how it should be done, making sure they give me what I  need and I give them what they need. So the only difference -- and it wasn't  even conscious -- is that I'd adapt more readily to something that worked for  Elizabeth than I would for a stranger. Not from the standpoint of the little  woman needs some help. I just found myself being a lot more receptive."  </P> <P> And vice versa.  </P> <P> "Of course, working with him is a lot safer for me," Elizabeth nodded. "I don't  know that I would have done this if it had not been with John -- although at  one point I did say to Ron (Link, the director), 'If John's not going to do it,  I still want to.' The other wonderful thing about doing this is that I don't  give a damn what I look like. This woman is no glamour-puss; it's not even a  consideration. It's been lovely having that out of the way."  </P></p>

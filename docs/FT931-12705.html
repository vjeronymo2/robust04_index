			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / US alters view of Angola THE Clinton administration is 'actively reviewing' US policy towards Angola, and diplomats believe it could soon establish full diplomatic relations with the Luanda government for the first time since the civil war that followed independence from Portugal in 1975. Mr Venacio da Moura, Angola's foreign minister, is expected to meet senior State Department officials in Washington this week, although the precise level of the meeting has not yet been arranged. Under the Bush administration, US patience with its long-time ally, the Unita resistance movement led by Mr Jonas Savimbi, was already wearing thin. US officials were irritated by Mr Savimbi's refusal to accept the results of last year's elections, which they viewed as broadly fair. Democrats in Congress have never been as convinced as Republicans that Mr Savimbi was a heroic fighter against communism, and the new administration is expected to have few qualms about abandoning Unita.</p>

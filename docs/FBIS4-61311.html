			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tallinn, May 04, BNS -- The head of the Estonian  Border Guard Department and the Russian embassy's military  attache in Tallinn at a private meeting this week decided that  the border- related departments of both countries will  themselves try to find out who is responsible for letting  illegal Kurdish immigrants across the border and whether Russia  should take back the Kurds.    The departments in Estonia and Russia must resolve the issue  of the Kurds without creating a strife between themselves or  interference by the world community, Tarmo Kouts, the head of  the Estonian border department said.    Kouts at the meeting requested from Russian Military Attache  Anatoli Tschizhikov that Russia answer to letters by the  Estonian department concerning the Kurds' illegal crossing of  the border.    Kouts told BNS he hopes to get an answer by Friday [6 May].    "From that answer we will be able to conclude whether the  issue can be settled at our departments' level or has to be  referred to the Foreign Ministry and the broader public."

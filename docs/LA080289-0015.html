			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIRLINE CRASH IN SIOUX CITY  </P> <P> The reason for this letter is to express my sorrow and grief for all the  passengers and families of United Airlines Flight 232. I am presently a police  officer for the city of Los Angeles, but I grew up and graduated high school in  Sioux City, Iowa. When I heard about the residents of Sioux City lining up to  donate blood, opening their homes to survivors, helping with the search for  those unfortunate not to have made it and the many other tasks that needed to  be done, a knot grew in my stomach. It made me proud to be from that city and  state.  </P> <P> SCOTT NAGLE  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach  </P></p>

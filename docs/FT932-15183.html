			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Japanese bank chief cautious over package THE Japanese economy will start to recover only gradually towards the end of the year, in spite of the Y13,200bn (Pounds 76bn) emergency spending programme announced by the government on Tuesday, Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan's governor, warned yesterday. His remarks came as retailers confirmed the depth of the slump in consumer spending, with an 11.4 per cent fall in sales at Tokyo's 27 main department stores last month. Mr Mieno's cautious assessment of the special package's impact on the economy, which is mired in the worst downturn for two decades, sharply contrasts with the government's view that it will pave the way for a sustained recovery. Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the finance minister, in a speech to executives from trust banks said the Y13,200bn package, mainly made up of public works spending, would promote sustained recovery in the second half of the 1993 financial year. Mr Mieno said that recent increases in car sales, industrial shipments and the surge in the Tokyo stock marketmight indicate that the decline in business confidence was coming to a halt. However, he cautioned that it was too early to say the economy was ready to recover given the depth of the slump in consumer spending and corporate investment. The March fall in Tokyo department store sales was the sharpest monthly drop recorded since the Japan Department Stores Association started collecting statistics in 1965. Sales of clothes, furniture and household appliances were particularly hard hit.</p>

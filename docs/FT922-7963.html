			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Thomson incurs hefty deficit THOMSON, the Canadian-owned travel and publishing group, has blamed the continued slump in advertising in its North American and UK regional newspapers for a substantial first-quarter loss. A 37 per cent drop in the North American newspaper division's operating profit virtually wiped out improvements in earnings from the UK travel business and lower interest charges. The net loss, before preferred share dividends, was USDollars 47m, or 9 cents a common share, compared with a Dollars 48m loss, or 10 cents, last year. The figures include charges of Dollars 17m this year and Dollars 16m in 1991 for amortisation of publishing rights and circulation. Total sales rose to Dollars 1.14bn from Dollars 1.08bn, with most of the improvement coming from the travel and professional publishing divisions. The company said North American newspaper results were hit by a 1.9 per cent drop in advertising lineage in the US, and a 6.4 per cent slump in Canada. Margins were also eroded by continued spending on product improvements. The travel business has recovered strongly from the setback of the Gulf war. The company reported a 24 per cent jump in packaged holiday sales last winter, compared with 1990-91. Sales of summer holidays are 8 per cent ahead of last year. The pick up in traffic benefited Britannia Airways, Thomson's charter airline subsidiary, and Lunn Poly, the UK's largest chain of travel shops. The airline has found a buyer for all five of its Boeing 737-300s over the next 12 months. They will be replaced by operating leases on four larger Boeing 757s in 1993 and 1994. Thomson said earnings from the North American professional publishing group were below expectations, but should be largely recovered later in the year when delays in product shipments were overcome. Poor advertising hit the group's UK regional newspapers, but sales and profits of UK-based professional, business and academic publications have been encouraging.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Stepanov under the "Political Zodiac" </F> rubric: "Split in the Movement"]    [Text] This last time around, the annual conference of the  Movement for Democratic Reforms -- Democratic Belarus [MDBDR]  was held behind closed doors. While discussing program goals  and tasks, the conference split in two. A group of participants  and MDBDR Cochairman Leonid Zlotnikov found their further  participation in the conference, as well as in the MDBDR,  impossible.    The discord was provoked both by ideological concerns and,  according to those who left the conference room, a breach of the  agreed-upon time limit. One MDBDR leader, Olga Abramova, who  shares the ideas and approaches of the Civic Union in Russia,  thinks that the Movement should learn from Volski [leader of the  Civic Union in Russia], while Leonid Zlotnikov and his adherents  are more inclined to follow the Gaydar line. It is possible,  according to a BELAPAN correspondent, that the former members of  the MDBDR will join the United Democratic Party of Belarus.</p>

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Wrong crimes, wrong remedy: The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice Runciman is clearly not the last word on reforming the investigation, prosecution and trial of serious fraud. Indeed, a half decade after the changes inspired by the Roskill report, why was serious fraud even on the agenda? The answer lies in the curious way we have of responding to perceived shortcomings in the criminal justice system. When our confidence in it is punctured, we resort to a quick-fix patch of reform without first asking whether it might not be better to replace the whole inner tube. It was just such a response in the mid-1980s that led to the setting up of the Roskill committee to reconsider the prosecution of fraud. It also explains how its recommendations, or at least some of them, came to be implemented. Before turning to Runciman's gloss on Roskill, the following questions should be considered. Why, when it now handles only a handful of cases, was it necessary to set up the Serious Fraud Office as a separate high-profile agency at all? The Crown Prosecution Service could have been better resourced nationally, with access to accounting and other assistance, and have dealt with all fraud. Where is the evidence that the Crown Prosecution Service, Customs or the Inland Revenue are hampered by the fact that they lack the SFO's Section 2 powers removing the right to silence? How is it that the whole of the US manages to prosecute white-collar crime effectively while still preserving the Fifth Amendment right to silence and without requiring advanced defence disclosure? How is the performance of the SFO to be judged? Surely not by either media campaigns or its conviction rate. Judged by convictions, it is doing well. Only the tabloids suggest the SFO should ensure all suspects remain in jail on remand and that it should deliver a 100 per cent conviction rate. The best way to monitor the SFO would be to set up a Fraud Commission, one of Lord Roskill's recommendations which was not implemented. It is regrettable that Lord Runciman and his colleagues should not have not thought fit to make this essential recommendation, so that in future we would not have to appoint Royal Commissions to discover what is wrong in this area. What needs to be stressed about the Royal Commission's proposals is that much caution should be shown before the SFO's powers are enhanced. The commission recommends that the Section 2 powers of questioning and evidence gathering should be given to the police as well as the SFO's lawyers and accountants. The argument for this recommendation in the commission's report is that it finds the present situation anomalous. The commission does not say how the anomaly arises. It arose after the Roskill Committee had recommended that the police should, indeed, have these powers. But the government concluded those powers would sit uncomfortably with what were then the recently introduced safeguards of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. One may ask now what has occurred in the past seven years which makes this judgment invalid? If the commission's recommendations are introduced, what is to prevent the same police officer interviewing a suspect under Section 2 and then subsequently interviewing that suspect under caution? How is one to safeguard the suspect then? Indeed, if the SFO and CPS are merged we are looking at Section 2 powers being delegated to possibly thousands of police officers nation-wide. One of the commission's recommendations which appears to have received wide public support is that proposing greater pre-trial disclosure by the defence. Put that way, it seems a perfectly sensible, unobjectionable proposal. However, one has to consider to what extent the Crown is no longer to bear the burden of proving an accused guilty and to what extent an accused is now being asked to provide as much evidence as possible for his own personal damnation. Consider a situation where an accused, having fully met in a defence case statement the prosecution's case, finds that the prosecution decides, quite oppressively and on the basis of the accused's own disclosures, to change tack and confront him with a completely new allegation. One could envisage an absurd situation where the accused and the prosecution are engaged in some co-operative effort whose object is not to achieve fairness and justice, but to make certain that no person accused of serious fraud is ever acquitted. Perhaps even more worrying, however, is the recommendation that, just when the Judith Ward case and others have secured for the defence access to all the material in the prosecution's hands so that future miscarriages of justice resulting from non-disclosure might be avoided, there is a recommendation that this right be severely curtailed. The commission recommends that the prosecution need disclose only that material which it deems relevant following the revelation of the defence. What about those cases, and I have experienced several, where hidden away in the unused material there is a defence of which the accused knows nothing? Are we now going further down the totally irrational path of saying that our civil liberties must be preserved, if not enhanced, for those accused of crime, but the one exception being made is for those accused of white-collar crime? Does society really believe they pose a greater threat than is posed by those accused of murder, terrorism, robbery or rape?

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Plans for social fund under fire MOVES BY the European Commission to broaden the remit of the European Social Fund will reduce the amount of money spent on training the long-term unemployed, the government says. The Department of Employment is opposed to the proposal, which would affect the distribution of the Pounds 250m a year received by the UK for the unemployed. Brussels wants to reform objectives three and four of the social fund, devoted to training the young, the long-term unemployed, women with disabilities and women returning to the labour market. It wants its funding to provide added value to labour-market measures rather than to provide a subsidy to national unemployment schemes. And it wants to direct money to the retraining needs of industries in decline or change. The aim is to reskill workers before they become unemployed and smooth their transition into alternative employment - a move seen by the UK government as a disguised industrial policy. The department said in a consultation document issued to bodies including local authorities and training and enterprise councils that the government was opposed to the new objective four - which was 'to facilitate the adaptation of workers to industrial change and to changes in production systems.' This was unlikely to yield good value for money, as in the UK about two thirds of the unemployed left the unemployment register within six months, it said.</p>

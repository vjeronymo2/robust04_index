			<p>BFN     [Text] French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin said late  yesterday afternoon that French troops would not remain in  Rwanda after the evacuation operation. Last night he was at  Roissy airport, near Paris, where he welcomed the first French  evacuees. He declared that the operation could already be  considered a success.    [Begin Roussin recording] I would like to use this occasion  to thank the troops and the crews of the military transport  units who made the necessary planes available and made it  possible to evacuate French nationals to Bujumbura and Bangui.  We were helped by the people of the Central African Republic  [CAR] and of Burundi: This has to be mentioned. Both in Bangui  and in Burundi, we were welcomed by our friends. [end recording]</p>

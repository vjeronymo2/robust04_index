			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Chairman of the Party of Russian Unity and  Concord Konstantin Zatulin regretted the form in which the last  reshuffling in the government had taken place, for instance the  dismissal of Minister for Nationalities and Regional Policies  Sergey Shakhray and appointment of Nikolay Yegorov to this post.  Zatulin stated this in an interview with Interfax today.    Earlier, Shakhray had announced his resignation as the  Russian Vice Premier at a briefing in Moscow explaining this by  the fact that the appointment of the new minister had not been  even formally discussed with him.    Zatulin (who is also Chairman of the State Duma Committee on  CIS) suggested that Shakhray had been caught in a trap.    "It is no secret that the president's administration and the  government are fighting between them for powers and authority.  It is not by chance that the rough dismissal of Sergey Shakhray  in the best traditions of the Russian bureaucracy was announced  when implementation of the ideas of Shakhray and the Party of  Russian Integrity and Concord started -- the one on the Civic  Accord Pact and on settlement of inter-ethnic relations,"  Zatulin pointed out.    On the question whether the positions of the party in the  government would be weakened after the dismissal of Shakhray,  Zatulin suggested that for the time-being any party better be  outside the government than participate in it. Zatulin said his  party aimed to serve Russia rather than the president or the  premier.    From this point of view the party has supported the  activities of Shakhray in the government which are continued by  Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin, Minister of Justice Yuriy  Kalmykov and Labor Minister Gennadiy Melikyan who are members of  the Party of Russian Integrity and Concord, Zatulin stressed.</p>

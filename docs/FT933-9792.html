			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / International Company News: Whitmore resigns as Kodak chief INDEPENDENT directors of Eastman Kodak, the troubled photographic equipment company, have forced the resignation of Mr Kay Whitmore, its embattled chairman, president and chief executive. The move comes after weeks of turmoil at the Rochester, New York-based group  -beginning with the resignation of Mr Christopher Steffen, Kodak's chief financial officer, in April, and leading up to an uneasy meeting with institutional shareholders last month. At the heart of the debate is the question of how Kodak should restructure to improve its performance and counter the threat from 'own brand' film manufacturers. Critics of Mr Whitmore have claimed he was moving too cautiously in addressing these issues. But the resignation also emphasises the more active role being taken in the US by independent board directors and some of the largest institutional shareholders, and mimics similar top-level management changes forced recently at General Motors and International Business Machines. Kodak's independent directors - who include Mr Roberto Goizueta, chairman of Coca-Cola, Mr John Phelan, the former head of the New York Stock Exchange, and Mr Richard Zimmerman, head of Hershey - said they had decided to call in a executive search firm to find a replacement for Mr Whitmore. 'This action . . . is a logical extension of our previous commitment . . . to ensure that the performance of the company is significantly improved,' the statement said bluntly. Mr Whitmore, who has been at Kodak for 35 years, will remain as chairman while the search goes ahead. But Kodak said it would not now unveil its 'turnaround' plan - which Mr Whitmore had promised to deliver in September - on schedule. 'Over the next several months, enhanced plans for cash flow generation and debt reduction will be executed and continuing work will go forwards at an accelerated pace on efforts to reduce costs,' said the directors. But they added the 'complete plan' would need input from Mr Whitmore's successor. Instead, Mr Whitmore will write to shareholders and employees, 'commenting on current progress', after a board meeting on August 13. Most analysts assumed the directors' action means the company will move much more decisively to address its problems, and that redundancies and asset sales could be on the way. In addition to replacing Mr Whitmore, Kodak still needs a new finance director, a post which has been vacant since the departure of Mr Steffen after only 11 weeks in the job. That departure, which came shortly before Kodak's annual meeting, was the catalyst for the current turmoil. It quickly became apparent that Mr Steffen - who has since joined Citicorp - wanted to revive Kodak's fortunes by large-scale lay-offs, cuts in corporate spending and by shedding a large non-core business. In April, Mr Whitmore said he and Mr Steffen could not agree on 'the process for making . . . change happen', although the chairman later added he was 'stunned' by Mr Steffen's departure. Mr Whitmore subsequently survived the difficult annual meeting, and seemed to regain some confidence from investors when he announced last month that Kodak would spin off its large Eastman Chemical unit. However, some analysts and investors have questioned whether the 'turnaround' plan would go far enough.</p>

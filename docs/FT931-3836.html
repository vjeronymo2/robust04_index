			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Lump sums, the case for caution - Living with redundancy POOLS WINNERS are usually advised to put their winnings in the bank and take a holiday before doing anything with their money. If you have been made redundant you may feel like anything but a pools winner - but the advice still applies: do not do rush into anything with your redundancy lump sum. What you finally do depends on your financial circumstances, but it is not a good idea to tie up money when facing an uncertain future. David Harris, of Chantry Financial Services, fee-based advisers, says: 'For the first one to three months you should do nothing from an investment point of view until you are in a situation to make long-term plans.' Put the money in an instant access building society account in preference to a bank account, since interest rates are likely to be higher. Postal accounts, which give reasonable access, pay some of the highest interest because of their low overheads. If your spouse is a non-taxpayer, depositing the money in their name will reduce the overall tax burden. Even if your redundancy pay-off is sizeable, many will find it is insufficient to live off for the rest of their lives. It is therefore essential to draw up a personal budget in order to make financial planning easier. Write down all sources of income and expenditure for the next six months, including income from equity investments and financial commitments such as a mortgage. Do not forget direct debits. You must also contact creditors to tell them that you have been made redundant: even if you do not need their goodwill immediately, you may need it eventually, and unless they know of your changed financial circumstances they cannot make allowances for them. Although it is unwise to make financial investments immediately, do not ignore essential insurance. If you no longer have life or health insurance cover because these had been provided by your employer you should consider taking on a new policy, especially if you have children. Some insurance companies will agree to continue health cover for an individual who had been in a company scheme without requiring a new medical examination. This will have to be arranged soon after leaving the company. It is also important to maintain existing pension levels. If you had a company scheme, you could leave the pension with the company, or transfer it to a personal scheme or your new employer's company scheme if you find employment. This subject will be addressed in a later article. You should cut unnecessary expenditure by using your lump sum to pay off expensive debts, such as credit card bills. Most cards charge an annual percentage rate of between 21 and 26 per cent. If you need to borrow, it may be cheaper to arrange a personal loan with your bank. If your redundancy pay was not substantial it would be unwise to use all of it to pay off debts, since you will need money to live on. It is therefore important to get financial advice. 'Tied' agents, who can only sell the products of one company, should be avoided in favour of an independent financial adviser, preferably one who charges fees. Most IFAs are remunerated by commission from insurance and other companies to encourage them to recommend their products. This cost is borne by the consumer through high 'front-end' charges.' Although many commission-charging advisers are scrupulous about their recommendations, fee-based advisers - who charge for advice directly - do not face the same potential conflict of interest when giving advice. The adviser should be registered under the Financial Services Act - check by telephoning the Securities and Investments Board's central register on 071-929-3652. If you have share options in a save-as-you-earn share option scheme operated by your former employer, check the scheme rules. Most company schemes allow an employee who is made redundant to exercise their share options within six months of leaving the company, regardless of the original option date. The disadvantage for those who leave a scheme early is that they lose the bonus payable towards the end of the contract. This increases the final interest payment and therefore the amount available to buy shares. The alternative, if you can afford it, is to continue the scheme until it ends and take out the cash. If your redundancy payoff is small and you need access to cash, you should start by liquidating those investments with the smallest penalties. Taking out the cash saved in the share option scheme is one option, as is selling shares, but watch for any potential capital gains tax liability. Raiding a Tessa is another solution - you simply pay tax on the interest instead of receiving it gross at the end of its five year period. You can make savings by stopping a unit trust or investment trust savings scheme; this is penalty-free and the scheme can be revived once you have a new job. Long-term investments you should avoid cashing-in include endowments and whole-of-life or similar plans because the return for early surrender is so low. 'You are stuck with the policy anyway and you will not be able to stop premiums without losing money,' says Peter Smith, of financial advisers Hill Martin. If you have no choice, check the surrender value with the insurance company and compare it with what you would get by selling the policy to a marketmaker or at auction. If you find it difficult to keep up your mortgage payments, see if your lender is prepared to suspend capital repayments or to defer interest if the mortgage is on a repayment basis. Remember that these interest payments will mount up. The lender might also be prepared to extend the term of the loan, thereby reducing your monthly outlay. In last week's article, the figure for unemployment benefit payable for a dependent adult is Pounds 26.60, not Pounds 25.55, according to the DSS. Unemployment benefit is not affected by statutory redundancy pay.</p>

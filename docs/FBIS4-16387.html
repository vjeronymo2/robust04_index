			<p>BFN     [Text] Dushanbe 14 April, TASS -- Russian border guards  detained two Tajik opposition militants who tried to cross into  Tajikistan from neighbouring Afghanistan on Wednesday, military  sources in Dushanbe said today.    Two days earlier Afghanistan-based militants opened gunfire  on one of the border villages. No casualties among villagers or  border guards were reported.    On 11 April opposition fighters attacked an ambulance  belonging to the local hospital. A doctor who was travelling in  it was wounded.    The Tajik Government is preparing a note of protest to  Afghan  authorities over these incidents.    At the same time, independent observers report that over the  last six months three such notes were sent to the Afghan  Government, but none of them has been answered yet.</p>

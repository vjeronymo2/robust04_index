			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Earprint could help beat credit card fraud The human ear is at the centre of the latest system designed to combat credit card fraud, writes Anna Kochan. The shape, size and contours of the ear are as individual as the fingerprint, says Rouen-based inventor Patrick Macron. The personal identity system he has developed is based on a smart card (which stores data about the shape of the ear on a built-in chip) and a telephone with a miniature video camera, sensors and electronics built into the earpiece. Macron envisages cash dispensers of the future being equipped with these telephones. Customers will put their smart card into the dispenser while holding the telephone to their ear. The dispenser will compare the telephone 'image' to the details stored on the card, and customers will be cleared to proceed - or not - within about four seconds. Macron: France, 35 73 01 99.</p>

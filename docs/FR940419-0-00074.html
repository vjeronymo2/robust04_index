			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPAAR 1552.209&hyph;74, Limitation of Future Contracting <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , is added for Superfund contracts to ensure that contractors do not perform work that may conflict with work performed for EPA and jeopardize Superfund enforcement actions. The clause identifies work which poses a high risk of conflict of interest and requires contractors to request approval from EPA prior to entering into such contracts. Alternates are provided that are tailored to specific types of Superfund contracts. The basic Limitation of Future Contracting (LOFC) clause is for Alternative Remedial Contracting Strategy (ARCS) contracts, and alternates are for Time Critical Rapid Response (TCRR), Technical Assistance Team (TAT), Environmental Services Assistant Team (ESAT), Technical Enforcement Support (TES), Headquarters Support, and Site Specific contracts. Depending on the type of EPA work performed, this limitation may extend for the period of the contract or from three to seven years after completion of a work assignment. The clause does not prevent contractors from submitting bids/proposals for outside work prior to receiving Contracting Officer approval. However, the clause provides that any bids/proposals are submitted at the contractor's own risk and expense. This clause must also be placed in subcontract and consultant agreements except for specific types of services listed in the clause unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of public comment, including recommendations that the applicability of the LOFC clause and its alternates be clarified, the following changes have been made:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _The prescription to this clause, paragraph (c)(3) of EPAAR 1509.508, Solicitation provision and contract clauses, has been redesignated as paragraph (c), EPAAR 1509.507&hyph;2, Contract clause, to conform with recent numbering changes to FAR Subpart 9.5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The prescription to this clause has also been changed to be consistent with the prescription for the Organizational Conflict of Interest Clause. The final prescription, paragraph (c), EPAAR 1509.507&hyph;2, Contract clause, includes a small purchase limitation threshold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _In the basic LOFC clause (ARCS) and all alternates except Alternative VI, two additional paragraphs have been added to set forth procedures for an expedited response to an initial LOFC request and for review of an adverse determination. For Alternative VI, three additional paragraphs have been added to set forth procedures for a request for waiver or modification of the clause, for an expedited response to an initial future contracting request, and for review of an LOFC adverse determination. This responds to recommendations that we identify a review process available for contractors who may question an EPA Contracting Officer's decision on an LOFC request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _In the basic LOFC clause (ARCS) and all alternates, all references to ``zone'' have been changed to ``assigned geographical area.'' This adds clarity by reflecting the new terminology in the Superfund program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _In the basic LOFC Clause (ARCS) and all alternates, the type of Superfund contract covered by each clause is now added at the top of each clause. This reduces confusion in reading the text.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Alternate I has been renamed ``Time Critical Rapid Response'' (TCRR), and we have noted in the clause prescription that this term includes TCRR, Emergency Response Cleanup Services (ERCS) and other emergency type solicitations and contracts. This change has been made to clarify the clause's applicability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _In Alternate I (TCRR), Alternate II (TAT) and Alternate V (Headquarters Support), all references to ERCS have been changed to TCRR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The Field Investigative Team (FIT) Alternate LOFC clause has been removed since such work is to be included in the ARCS Superfund contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _All alternates to this clause have been renumbered to reflect the removal of the FIT Alternate. All further references will be to the new numbers of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) has been changed to reflect the inclusion of FIT work in ARCS contracts. Since the proposed rule's FIT LOFC clause is less restrictive than the basic LOFC clause (ARCS), language specifically tailored to FIT work in ARCS contracts is added to minimize contractor burden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) paragraph (a) has been changed in accordance with comments recommending it be consistent with paragraph (a) of its alternates, which include ``free to compete for contracts on an equal basis'' language. All further references will be to the new paragraph (a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) paragraphs have been relettered to reflect the change in paragraph (a) and the inclusion of a paragraph addressing FIT work. Paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) are redesignated as paragraphs (b) and (c). The new FIT paragraph is designated as paragraph (d). Paragraphs previously designated as (b), (c) and (d) have been redesignated as paragraphs (e), (f), and (g). All further references will be to the new lettering of the final clause.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _In the basic LOFC clause (ARCS) and all alternates, paragraph (a) language has been changed from ``It is agreed by the parties to this contract*&blank;*&blank;*'' to ``The parties to this contract agree*&blank;*&blank;*'' This minor change was made so the LOFC clause language conforms with the use of the active voice in other EPAAR clauses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) paragraphs (c) and (d), parallel paragraphs (c) of Alternates I (TCRR) and II (TAT) and (d) of Alternate IV (TES), and similar paragraph (c) of Alternate VI (Site Specific) have been changed as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Insider trading comes under Commons scrutiny TOUGHER RULES on insider dealing should move a step nearer the statute book tomorrow when they are due to receive their second Commons reading as part of a wider ranging criminal justice bill, David Owen writes. The measure, intended to align UK law with the European Community's insider dealing directive, would define an 'insider' as anyone who has inside information as a result of their employment, profession or duties. The bill has triggered some disquiet in the City, and the government has indicated it will consider amendments to its proposals where these are deemed necessary. The areas in which changes are most likely should emerge during the committee stage which will follow tomorrow's vote.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Merry-go-round at Laporte and ICI The appointment merry-go-round at Laporte, the UK's second largest chemical group, continues, following the departure of two directors from Solvay, the Belgian chemicals group. The two companies recently dissolved their Interox joint venture. Laporte's board meets today to confirm the appointment of Errol Menke (left) to the main board. The 38-year-old American will leave the US where he was chief executive of the hygiene and process chemicals division and take charge of the construction chemicals division. Menke, who joined the company in 1982, will be based in Luton and report to David Wilbraham, the chief operating officer. At the same time, the board will also confirm the appointment of Ray Knowland, president of the UK-based Chemicals Industry Association, as a non-executive. The appointments also follow the resignation from Laporte's board last month of Hans Seidl, who is to become chairman of Laporte GmbH in Germany, and chief executive of the organic chemicals division. Christopher Beasley was appointed last month as company secretary to replace Andrew Berkeley who is taking up private practice. ***** Meanwhile at ICI, Paul Drechsler (right) has been appointed to the new post of regional vice-president of Imperial Chemical Industries' international operations in Latin America South. He also becomes president of ICI Brasil. Drechsler was previously a senior business manager at ICI's films business. Adrian Bromley, Drechsler's predecessor, returns to the UK as business general manager of the chemical products operations.</p>

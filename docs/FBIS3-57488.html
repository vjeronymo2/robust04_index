			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Aleksandr Sisnev and Viktor </F> Solomin]    [Text] London January 27 TASS--Russia must continue its  policy of economic reforms and go ahead on this path as fast as  it can, British Secretary of state for Foreign Affairs Douglas  Hogg said in an interview with ITAR-TASS. A speedy  reorganization of the Russian industry and further development  of the privatization process are the most important tasks at the  moment. This is a question of vital importance. There will be  no investments without privatization, and without privatization  it will be impossible to transform the Russian industry, make it  more competitive and give it an opportunity to win new markets,  the foreign secretary emphasised. Difficulties, which the  Russian economy is facing, are not caused by reforms, they are a  result of the policy pursued in the past years, he said.    Assessing the situation in Russia, Douglas Hogg said that he  would be concerned if the pace of reforms in Russia slows down,  if signs of "weakening of the political will" to conduct reforms  appear which will endanger this whole process.    Speaking about the specific aid which the West could provide  to Russia, Hogg emphasised that first of all it is necessary to  open western markets to Russian exports. This is not an easy  task, he noted, taking into consideration that a large part of  the products, which Russian enterprises make for export, is  already available in plenty on the western market. But trade  and opening of markets are important conditions for the economic  development of Russia, he said.    Speaking of activities of the "know-how" fund which was set  up by the British Government to provide technical assistance in  the sphere of economic reforms to East European countries,  including Russia, Great Britain was the first country to begin  providing such aid, Hogg emphasised. We concentrated our  activities in such key spheres as finance system, employment,  support of small business, production and distribution of food  products, power generation and a number of other spheres, he  said.    The secretary of state for foreign affairs said that the  total financial resources of the fund, meant to provide  assistance to Russia, were doubled to reach 120 million pound  sterling in 1993.    The experience of the past years has shown and we are glad  to  ascertain that the "know-how" fund is an effective body to  provide aid to Russian reforms. Unlike certain other programmes  it is not so bureaucratic, and more capable of quickly reacting  to individual demands, Douglas Hogg said.</p>

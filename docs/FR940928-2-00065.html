			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A separate trust will be used for each series of securities. A Trustee of proven reliability and competence must ensure that amounts owed to the trust are collected by it, that the correct amounts are distributed in a timely manner to the right persons, and that accurate records and reports are prepared and furnished to security holders, auditors, the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS), GNMA and its agents. Rules and procedures governing the trust and its operation, including detailed rules about the timing and amounts to be distributed to security holders will be spelled out in trust documents drafted by experienced trust counsel based on documents prepared by GNMA and its legal advisor (the ``LA''), and incorporated in the GNMA Multiclass Securities program Guide. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The sponsor will guarantee to GNMA that payments on the MBS held by a trust will be sufficient to support all amounts due on the securities under all circumstances (assuming no default on the MBS themselves). The sponsor's guarantee of ``structural integrity'' will be confirmed by an approved accounting firm and GNMA's financial advisor (the ``FA''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> The GNMA Strips Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> GNMA anticipates a Grantor Trust (Strip) securities program. For each Strip securities transaction, a grantor trust would be formed to issue the Strip securities. The sponsor would provide the MBS collateral which was combined into a larger GNMA Platinum security (a mega MBS), which in turn is the collateral for the Strip securities. Interest Only (IO), Principal Only (PO) classes (completely stripped) and partially stripped classes (synthetics) would be issued by the grantor trust. The Strip securities would be sold directly to investors or may be used as collateral for REMICs. An investor would combine an IO and PO and swap the recombined IO/OP for an interest in the Platinum security that has the same aggregate principal balance and same interest payment. Various other recombinations may also be allowed as the program progresses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The GNMA Strip program in general will work the same way as a GNMA REMIC trust. The transfer agent, Chemical Bank and PTC will perform the same functions except that provisions will have to be made for the recombinations and exchanges. An accounting firm must provide a comfort letter and trust counsel must opine on the validity of the securities and that the transaction will not be subject to double taxation because it qualifies as a grantor trust under the Tax Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Other GNMA Multiclass Securities Programs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> From time to time, GNMA may introduce additional multiclass products for which the Trustee would provide similar services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Fees and Expenses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> GNMA will have no liability for payment of any fees or expenses, such as those of the FA, trust counsel and accounting firms. These will be payable by the sponsor. Trustee's fees will be payable as provided in Section IV, below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> III. Scope of Services To Be Provided By Trustee <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Trustee functions are critical to the successful operation of the GNMA Multiclass Securities program. Therefore, the selected trust firms will provide general Trustee services in accordance with the GNMA Multiclass Securities guide and other operative documents. This guide may be obtained by calling (800) 2341&hyph;REX. These guidelines and documents are subject to amendment and modification. The equivalent documents for the Grantor Trust (Strips) program are not available at this time. The general Trustee functions include, but are not limited to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. For each Multiclass Securities transaction to which a Trustee is retained by a Sponsor, that Trustee shall provide all services and documents customarily provided by Trustees in similar transactions and necessary or helpful to establish the trust and issue the Multiclass Securities, including: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Execute the documents under which the trust shall receive GNMA MBS from the sponsor in exchange for Multiclass Securities and under which the trust shall operate for its term, and fulfill all appropriate responsibilities thereunder. Enclosed as exhibits are the Operational Guidelines (Exhibit I), the current form of Trust Agreement (Exhibit II), the Trust Provisions (Exhibit III), and the Tax Administration Guidelines (Exhibit IV). These exhibits are for information purposes and are subject to change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Verify ownership of the MBS backing the multiclass securities and ensure that all of the MBS meet the requirements of the relevant Multiclass Securities program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Setting up a trust My husband and I are in our early 60s. We have two daughters, who are married. One daughter has two young children. Our house, and the bulk of our assets, are owned jointly. Each of us has a pension in our own right. Our wills were made some years ago and leave all to the survivor. On the survivor's death, the estate would be divided between our daughters or, if they died first, to their children. But if things were to be left like that, then, on the second death, our daughters would have a substantial inheritance tax bill. I am told it is possible to reduce IHT by each of us making a will in which the first Pounds 150,000 is left to our children in a discretionary trust that allows the income from this capital to be paid to the surviving spouse until death. The remainder of each estate would otherwise pass directly to the survivor. The same source says that, for this to be permitted by the Inland Revenue, each of us needs to hold assets of Pounds 150,000 in our own name, rather than jointly, as now. Is this advice correct? If so, how do you go about setting up such a trust? It is possible for a husband and wife each to leave wills so that the first Pounds 150,000 is left to the children upon discretionary trusts with the balance being left to the surviving spouse. The trustees could exercise their discretion in favour of the surviving spouse should the need arise. You would need to ensure that the surviving spouse does not have a right to the income as it arises as, in tax terms, this would effectively be treated as an outright gift of the assets to that spouse. This would render nugatory the planning undertaken. It is also correct that, if you own assets jointly, then theywill pass to the surviving spouse by law. To avoid this, it would be advisable for assets to be owned in your individual names or jointly as tenants in common. Given the care with which the trust needs to be drafted, I should advise that you seek professional help. The fees incurred would be small relative to the tax saved.

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Arts: Abbado on white-hot form In retrospect the 1960s and 1970s look a remarkably settled time for most orchestras. The senior conductors of the day tended to stay with their own orchestras for a long period, creating stable relationships which were generally seen to be a good thing. The next generation of maestros is facing all sorts of criticism, as a revealing BBC documentary last week showed. Even those trying to follow the same path find themselves ambushed. Perhaps the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra always was going to be a special case, but that does not explain the hostility of a recent attack in the German press against Claudio Abbado, accusing him of not being another Herbert von Karajan. Abbado is known not to enjoy musical politics and has been keeping his eyes down on the music-stand. This season he is conducting an impressive list of concerts in Berlin, including two lavishly-cast concert performances of Musorgsky's Boris Godunov at the weekend. This opera has long been among Abbado's key works. The Royal Opera's production has been his outstanding collaboration with the company to date; and if his interpretation has changed over the years, he still recaptured in the warm and generous ambience of Berlin's Philharmonie much of the intensity of those stage performances. By the time the performance reached the final scene, the playing was white-hot. The swirling string figures as the crowd gathers tingled with the frenzy of a Russian populace in open revolt. It is claimed that the Berlin Philharmonic does not sound the same under Abbado. That may be true. Whichever the orchestra, Karajan's Boris Godunov was a grandly-unfolding epic, woven in a rich tapestry of sound; Abbado's is swifter, leaner, more urgent, seething with tensions public and private below the surface. It did not seem to me any less well played or sung. The choral singing, from the Slovak Philharmonic Choir of Bratislava and the Berlin Radio Choir, was especially effective. The weakest link in the cast was probably Boris himself, Anatoly Kotcherga, who has plenty of force in his voluminous (not always well-focused) bass voice, but not the same force of personality. He did the obvious things without making them fresh and personal. It is unlikely that the Polish act has ever been more gloriously sung than it was by this trio of Olga Borodina, Sergey Larin and Sergey Leiferkus, who brought a splendid combination of vocal glamour and subtlety of character to their three schemers. Philip Langridge got a vivid grip on Shuisky's slippery personality. Gleb Nikolsky and Helmut Wildhaber were a wickedly matched comic duo as Varlaam and Missail, every bit a present-day Laurel and Hardy. Elena Zaremba was their young, vocally voluptuous hostess. There are certainly other cities which have more pressing problems with their orchestras than Berlin. Concerts sponsored by Deutsche Bank and Sony Classical.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 19 Mar (XINHUA) -- Since the opening of the  Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC],  many leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee, the NPC  Standing Committee, and the State Council have separately  participated in discussions held by various provincial,  autonomous regional, municipal, and People's Liberation Army  [PLA] delegations. They attentively listened to deputies' views  and suggestions on work in various fields and gave their views  on many issues of concern to the deputies.    Tian Jiyun, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member  and  vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, took part in the  Guizhou delegation's discussions. He said: In the course of  establishing a socialist market economic structure, the NPC's  legislative responsibility has become heavier and heavier. In  conducting legislative work, it is necessary to take into  consideration China's conditions and foreign experience as well  as the question of compatibility with international practice.    He said: We have been carrying out construction and  legislation under a social condition where the sense of the  legal system is weak and the legal system is not very  comprehensive and sound. Because of this, not only do we  shoulder a very heavy legislative responsibility, but we also  shoulder an even heavier responsibility in supervising law  enforcement. We must do a tremendous amount of hard work for an  extended period to ensure that our people and cadres have a  higher sense of the legal system and that laws are adhered to  and strictly enforced in administering state affairs. Only when  we have done so can we ensure the establishment of a socialist  market economy, the irreversibility of our reform and opening  up, and the success of socialist modernization.    During discussions with the Jiangxi delegation, Li Lanqing,  CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member and vice premier,  said: Reform provides the fundamental solution to education.  First, we must readjust education's macro structure,  concentrating our principal energy on basic education. Second,  we must not impose uniformity in promoting nine-year compulsory  education. We must not demand uniform education, ignoring  differences between urban and rural areas and between developed  and underdeveloped areas. Third, we must step up reform with  the goal of improving educational standards and increasing the  beneficial results of higher education. We must encourage people  to pool their resources to set up and operate schools. Fourth,  we must strengthen moral education.    During a discussion with the Shandong delegation, Jiang  Chunyun, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member, said:  To ensure the smooth progress of reform in all fields, we must  firmly cultivate an overall point of view; correctly handle  relations between partial and overall interests and between  immediate and long-term interests; stress discipline and the  overall situation; consciously safeguard the authority of the  CPC Central Committee and the State Council and take concerted  steps with them. We must fully arouse and bring into play the  initiatives and creativity of the broad masses of people. Reform  is an undertaking involving the broad masses of people. We must  channel their initiatives to reform so that they will concern  themselves with reform, support it, and successfully carry it  out.    During a discussion with the Ningxia delegation, Qian  Qichen, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member and vice  premier, said: Helping the poor involves a transitional period.  We must earnestly implement the state's program to support the  poor, make concentrated efforts to make full use of the  program's funds, work hard to improve the production conditions  in poor areas, and help them vigorously develop village and town  enterprises and intensive processing industries. He stressed:  Stability is a major issue. Because national minority regions  lag behind in economic, educational, and cultural development,  strengthening unity among nationalities and properly resolving  ethnic and religious issues have become all the more important.  Only in this way can we have a stable foundation to develop the  economy in national minority regions and gradually narrow the  difference between national minority regions and developed areas.    During a discussion with the Guangdong delegation, Xie Fei,  CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member, said: The state  has announced a series of reform measures related to finance,  taxation, banking, foreign trade, and enterprises since the  beginning of this year. We must make efforts to implement these  measures, promptly resolve new problems discovered in the course  of implementation, and take steps to improve the measures and  gradually develop a mechanism for operating a socialist market  economy. At the same time, we must step up our efforts to  establish a mechanism for rule of law and democratic  supervision. This will be a main focus of Guangdong's political  structural reform, which will be undertaken simultaneously with  its economic structural reform so that political structural  reform will support economic reform and ensure the healthy  development of the socialist market economy.    In discussions with the Shanxi delegation, Ren Jianxin,  member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat, said:  Currently, China enjoys economic development, political  stability, national unity, and social progress. The situation  is generally good. However, we must also realize that  safeguarding social stability and public order is an arduous  long-term task. We must mentally prepare to take all realistic  and effective measures to go all out to safeguard social  stability. We must uphold the policy of doing two types of work  at the same time, attaching equal importance to both. We must  handle the work of safeguarding social stability in the same way  we handle the economy.    Speaking at a discussion held by the Hubei delegation, Ni  Zhifu, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, said: In  building a legal system for the socialist market economy, we  must use Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the guide,  use the Constitution as the basis, proceed from reality, and  vigorously but prudently carry out the work in a spirit of  reform. He said: We have achieved remarkable results in the  legislative field in the last few years. However, law  enforcement remains a weak link. Failure to observe the law  strictly is still quite serious, and this has led to complaints  from many quarters. We must place as much importance on  supervising and monitoring law enforcement as on legislation.  Only by doing so can we safeguard the authoritativeness of the  law.    During a discussion with the Hebei delegation, Wang  Bingqian,  vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, said: In  developing the economy, we must pay attention to both quantity  and quality, that is, to the unity between speed and efficiency.  We must pay closer attention to economic efficiency, without  which speed is not only worthless, but may even be harmful. We  must pay attention to resolving "bottlenecks" and promote  short-term as well as long-term development. We must pay  attention to mobilizing positive factors in various economic  sectors and jointly develop social productive forces to make  people rich and the country strong. We must give equal emphasis  to development and conservation to achieve greater, faster,  better, and more economic results in production and construction.    During a discussion with the Inner Mongolia delegation,  Buhe,  vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, said: There is a  gap between national minority regions and advanced areas in  economic development. Doing a good job in national minority  work has a positive impact on the stability, development, and  prosperity of the entire society. Equality, unity, and mutual  assistance among different nationalities serve as a guarantee  for economic development and social progress in national  minority areas. We must use the Marxist outlook on  nationalities to educate the masses of people and to codify and  institionalize our national minority work along a correct path.  We must comprehensively and correctly implement the policy  toward religion and strengthen management of religious affairs  according to the law.    Taking part in discussions with the Jiangxi delegation,  Vice Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Li Peiyao noted that  this year's economic targets are not set very high. He said:  This has created relatively good conditions for reform. In  administering macrocontrol last year, we found a successful  experience, that is we must carry out macrocontrol through  financial means instead of administrative means. He also said:  On the issue of safe production, we learned some lessons last  year. The Government Work Report stresses the importance of  safe production more than in the past. Due to the change from  the old system to a new one, safe production is particularly  important and we must pay good attention to the matter.    Vice Chairman of the NPC Stannding Committee Wu Jieping took  part in the Shanghai delegation's discussions. He said: The  achievements of our country's reform, opening up, and economic  development have attracted worldwide attention. However, there  are still some problems and contradictions which must be solved  by further carrying out reform. At present, we are  strengthening macrocontrol, and we must carry forward the spirit  of taking the situation as a whole into consideration and  "firmly implement the central guidelines and unified planning  without exception." We should work with concerted efforts and  take the interests of the whole into consideration. We should  firmly and truly implement the principle of seizing the  opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting  development and maintaining stability.    State Councillor Chen Junsheng said during discussions with  deputies of the Guangdong delegation: Judging from the  situation of the whole country, total grain output in 1993  increased and set an all-time record. Nevertheless, there are  shortages in the supply of food grain in some locales. This is  mainly due to the imbalance in supply and demand. Take the  situation in Guangdong for example, the annual grain output was  more than 30 billion jin, but the total demand is more than 40  billion jin. Guangdong must buy 10 billion jin of grain from  other provinces to make up for its shortage. Moreover, there are  many migrants in Guangdong who must also eat. Guangdong must be  determined to ensure adequate acreage of land sown in grain  crops and raise grain output. We should not only pay attention  to economic results, but also pay attention to social benefits.  We must strive to raise the level of reliance in the supply of  food grain.    State Councillor Ismail Amat took part in discussions with  the Tianjin delegation. He pointed out: We are establishing a  socialist market economic structure, and the biggest difference  between China and the Western countries is that, in China, all  activities throughout the nation are coordinated like pieces in  a chess game and there is a great unity among people of all  nationalities. We should be proud of this at all times. In  past decades, various provinces and municipalities in the  country have provided great support to areas resided in by  minority people. In the future, the more developed coastal  cities and areas should, while developing their economies,  further support and help the development of areas resided by  minority people.    Ding Guangen, Li Tieying, Yang Baibing, Wu Bangguo, Zou  Jiahua, Chen Xitong, Wei Jianxing, Wen Jiabao, Wang Hanbin,  Zhang Zhen, Chen Muhua, Fei Xiaotong, Sun Qimeng, Lei Jieqiong,  Li Ximing, Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, Wang Guangying, Cheng Siyuan,  Lu Jiaxi, Tomur Dawamat, Chi Haotian, Song Jian, Peng Peiyun,  Luo Gan, and Zhang Siqing also took part in discussions,  respectively, with delegations from various provinces,  autonomous regions, municipalities, and the People's Liberation  Army.</p>

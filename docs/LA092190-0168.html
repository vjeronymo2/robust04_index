			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD SIGN INTO OIL WAR  </P> <P> In a stealthy, early morning protest over the deployment of U.S. troops to  Saudi Arabia, a group of artists today altered the landmark HOLLYWOOD sign to  read "OIL WAR."  </P> <P> "We did it to bring attention to the potential war situation in the Middle  East," said a spokesman for Artists for Social Responsibility who would  identify himself only as "Danny."  </P> <P> He said 10 group members took about three hours to alter the sign, using  harnesses to climb the letters.  </P> <P> Witnesses said police pulled down the sheeting that had been draped over the  50-foot letters before 6 a.m.  </P> <P> "We seriously believe we should be spending money on alternate energy sources,  becoming more energy self-sufficient rather than going to war so we can have  cheap oil that does nothing but pollute the environment," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Former Carrian chief to reappear in court THE Hong Kong government will tomorrow make its second attempt to gain a conviction against Mr George Tan, former chairman of the failed Carrian property and shipping group. Mr Tan will be brought before the colony's district court to answer eight charges of bribery. The case will be heard by a judge alone. Mr Tan is alleged to have paid HKDollars 4.8m (Pounds 338,000) in bribes to executives of WestLB Asia Ltd and HKDollars 888,000 in bribes and shares to one executive of Barclays Asia Ltd during 1981 and 1982. The executive of Barclays, Mr Stuart Turner, pleaded guilty in 1988 to accepting the bribe and 668,000 shares from Mr Tan. The two WestLB Asia executives have also pleaded guilty. The government's attempts to gain a conviction against Mr Tan were frustrated in 1987 when a judge dismissed charges against him of conspiring to defraud shareholders. Charges against his auditors, Price Waterhouse, for false accounting were also dismissed. The judge, who resigned six months after his controversial ruling, ended Hong Kong's longest trial after 281 days and a cost to the colony's exchequer of more than HKDollars 27m. The colonial government has another case pending against Mr Tan. This is dependent, however, on the extradition from Britain of Mr Lorrain Osman, former chairman of Bumiputra Malaysia Finance, a Hong Kong-based subsidiary of the state-owned Bank Bumiputra, who has been fighting extradition for the past 6 1/2 years. Mr Osman, who is the longest serving prisoner on remand in Britain, last Thursday lost his seventh attempt to have his extradition quashed. If returned to Hong Kong, Mr Osman will face 42 fraud and corruption charges connected with HKDollars 6bn on loans made by his company to Carrian. Carrian was put into liquidation in October 1983 with debts estimated at more than HKDollars 10bn. The biggest lender to the company was Bumiputra Malaysia Finance. Hongkong and Shanghai Bank also lost an undisclosed sum and its subsidiary, Wardley, was placed under new management.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] "There is no chance of attaining peace with Syria  without a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights. Anyone who  believes al-Asad can be satisfied with less, is living in  illusion."    These remarks were made yesterday by Foreign Minister  Shim'on  Peres in an address before members of kibbutzim in the Meggido  Regional Council, held at Kibbutz 'En Hashofet. "Let us not  fool ourselves with regard to al-Asad's demands. The precedent  al-Sadat set in Sinai serves as a basis for his demands," Peres  said.    Peres added that in addition to their demand for a  withdrawal, Syria also demands reciprocal demilitarization.  That is, if Israel demands that part of the Golan Heights be  demilitarized, the Syrians will demand that the Upper Galilee be  demilitarized as well. "Naturally, such a demand is impractical.  When I told Egyptian President Mubarak about it, he laughed and  said that had Egypt presented such a demand, the entire  territory of Israel would have been demilitarized," Peres said.</p>

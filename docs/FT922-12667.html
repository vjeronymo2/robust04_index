			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: AGF-Irish Life tops IPounds 7m despite underwriting losses AGF-IRISH Life Holdings, Ireland's largest composite insurance group, reported pre-tax profits of IPounds 7.3m (Pounds 6.68m sterling) for the year to December 31, its first as a consolidated group. Underwriting losses were IPounds 18.7m on gross premium income of IPounds 171m, while investment income amounted to IPounds 26m. In common with most of the non-life insurance companies in Ireland, underwriting losses are now a fact of life, offset by investment income accruing from the cashflow of premium turnover. Mr John O'Hanlon, group chief executive, said underwriting losses in the motor sector had been reduced in the past year as a result of rerating 'but we have not seen a similar improvement in ratings in other sectors. There has been no mitigation in the level of awards and we continue to see claims inflation, in excess of the overall inflation level'. The group was formed in July 1990 by Assurances Generales de France (AGF) and Irish Life, Ireland's largest life assurance company, to consolidate their interests in the Irish non-life insurance market. They acquired the Irish business of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland in July 1990, and all of the issued share capital of Church and General Insurance in June 1991. AGF owns 66.3 per cent of the group, and Irish Life holds 30.4 per cent. The balance is held by former minority shareholders in Church and General. The group now has 14 per cent of the general insurance market in Ireland, accounting for 24 per cent of the liability insurance, 9 per cent of the motor insurance, 63 per cent in international, marine and aviation and 13 per cent in property.</p>

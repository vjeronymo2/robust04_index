			<p>BFN     [Text] Our reporter has learned that the Belarusian  Embassy addressed the U.S. National Defense Council on 31 May  requesting confirmation that U.S. strategic missiles are no  longer aimed at Belarus. The request was prompted by the fact  that the U.S.-Russian declaration of 14 January 1994 confirmed  the intention of the presidents of the two states to discontinue  aiming their strategic missiles by 30 May 1994. The State  Department confirmed to the embassy that the aiming of all U.S.  strategic missiles had been discontinued, including those aimed  at Belarus, from whose territory Russian strategic missiles are  currently being withdrawn. Our reporter points out that this is  an important step toward definite elimination of the traces of  the cold war.</p>

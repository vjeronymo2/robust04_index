			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["mes"-signed report: "Kanther Wants To Observe </F> Republikaner More Closely"]    [Excerpt] Bonn -- The Federal Office for the Protection of  the Constitution [BfV] is to observe the right-wing extremist  Republikaner more closely. This was announced by Interior  Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) when he  presented the 1993 BfV report in Bonn on Thursday [14 April].  Indications that the Republikaner are to be rated as a  right-wing extremist party are getting stronger. The  Republikaner are "adopting increasingly extremist positions,  opinions, and methods," Kanther said. But so far, the Federal  Government could not bring itself to rate the Republikaner as a  right-wing extremist party. The report only says that the party  shows "signs of right-wing extremist efforts directed against  the liberal democratic constitution." The BvF observations are,  however, "not sufficient to rate all members as right-wing  extremist."    The reason given for this evaluation is that the period of  observation has been too short. This opinion is not shared by  all of the 16 laender governments. Eight laender share the  interior minister's view, while eight think that the  Republikaner should be rated as a right-wing extremist party.    The 1993 BvF report allocates 78 pages, the lion's share, to  the description of right-wing extremist activities. Left-wing  extremism is treated on 48 pages. The section on extremist  activities by foreigners has been markedly expanded, while the  "traditional" part, counterintelligence, has been reduced to a  minor role.    The BvF concludes that the threat to internal security by  violent left-wing extremists was more serious in 1993 than in  1992. In contrast to that, severe public action against  right-wing extremists has considerably shaken the neo-Nazi scene  and thus helped decrease violent actions in this group. The  number of violent crimes committed by foreigners has clearly  increased, [the BvF report says]. [passage omitted]</p>

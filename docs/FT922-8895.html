			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Letter: Language is vital in links with Japan Sir, I read with great interest the special report (April 25) on Japanese language and business courses organised in the UK for business executives. We certainly share the view that participation in business-oriented intensive language courses constitutes an efficient and vital prerequisite for the staff of companies which intend to build and maintain long-term commercial links with Japan. I would, therefore, like to draw your attention to a European Community initiative which pursues the same objective and which is open to the participation of UK companies, together with those of other EC member states. Launched in 1979, the Executive Training Programme consists of a 12-month intensive Japanese language course in Tokyo followed by a six-month placement with a Japanese company, supported by other activities, such as seminars and plant visits. A large element of the cost of the programme is borne by the Commission of the European Communities. Since the ETP's inception, more than 400 executives, including 67 from the UK, have completed the programme and more than 80 per cent of them are now playing a key role in the management of their companies' commercial relations with Japan. Horst G Krenzler, director-general, Commission of the European Communities, Rue de la Loi 200, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Bhutto's brother tries to end exile PAKISTANI police fired tear-gas at Karachi airport yesterday to disperse a crowd of thousands awaiting the return from exile of Mr Mir Murtaza Bhutto, the younger brother of Ms Benazir Bhutto, prime minister, Reuter reports from Karachi. Mr Bhutto is wanted in Pakistan in connection with terrorism charges. Aviation authorities had turned away the aircraft provided by the Syrian government to return Mr Bhutto to Pakistan after 16 years of self-imposed exile, his mother Mrs Nusrat Bhutto said. Officials refused to comment. 'The special flight came to Karachi, circled once over the airport and when it made a second circle authorities refused it permission to land,' Mrs Bhutto senior told reporters. She said the aircraft took Murtaza to Sharjah, in the United Arab Emirates, where he would board a commercial flight for Karachi. At Karachi airport, police and paramilitary forces fired into the air, sprayed tear-gas and baton-charged some of the 3,000 people on hand to greet the 39-year-old Mr Bhutto as they tried to break through a gate on to the runway. Police say Mr Bhutto, who had been living in Syria, would be arrested on arrival. He is wanted in Pakistan for allegedly leading an underground group, Al-Zulfikar, accused of bombings in several cities and of hijacking a Pakistani airliner to Kabul and Damascus in 1981 in which one man was killed. He was elected in his absence to the Sind provincial assembly on October 9, and must take the oath before Sunday or forfeit his seat.</p>

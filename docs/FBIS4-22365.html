			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [News department report: "305,000 Refugees Live in Armenia"] </F>   [Text] Armenia is currently home to 305,000 refugees, of  which 260,000 were deported from Azerbaijan and the rest from  the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic's Shaumyanskiy Rayon and Abkhazia.  Fifty-seven thousand persons do not have a permanent residence  permit. However, as V. Movsisyan, head of the state  administration for refugee affairs, noted at a recent meeting at  the National Academy of Sciences, although these people do not  have citizenship or a defined status, they enjoy civil rights  and freedom; 16,000 persons deported from Sumgait in 1988 have  received apartments or built their own homes; 28,000 of those  deported at a later date have a permanent residence permit; and  35,000 persons have been given land plots and participated in  land privatization. There are numerous objective difficulties  inherent in this sphere, which the republic authorities are  striving to overcome.</p>

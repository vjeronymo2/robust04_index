			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Council seeks return of redundancy payments TWENTY-NINE former local authority employees who received redundancy payments nearly three years ago under an enhanced severance scheme, since ruled unlawful, are being taken to court by their former employer. The 29 are among 368 former employees who have been instructed by North Tyneside council to repay a total of Pounds 1.5m they received above the statutory minimum entitlement. Letters sent by the council in July to the 368 - who received enhancements ranging from Pounds 400 to Pounds 18,000 - demanding repayment have elicited only two offers of reimbursement. The council confirmed yesterday that it had selected 29 test cases. Summonses will be sent out later this month. The proceedings will be in the County Court but some cases could go higher as some of those refusing repayment have union backing. The council's enhanced severance scheme was introduced in September 1990 to help it shed jobs because of charge-capping. It was subsequently challenged by the district auditor. A High Court ruling that the scheme was unlawful was upheld by the Appeal Court last year. Between November 12 and December 31 1990, 342 people took redundancy, including Pounds 1.4m in enhanced payments. A further 26 who took redundancy under the enhanced scheme after December 31 1990 signed letters agreeing to reimburse additional payments, totalling Pounds 141,000, should the legal challenge be upheld. The 29 test cases include 20 of these 26. The nine others are three former teachers, three ex- white collar staff and three ex-manual workers. Mr Barry Howarth, a Unison regional officer, said yesterday that the union was not contesting the cases against the 20 but was supporting all its members among the 342 who were declining repayment, in the belief they have a winnable case. The 368 received enhancements ranging from Pounds 400 to Pounds 18,000.</p>

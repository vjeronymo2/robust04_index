			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / International Company News: German metals group to present final rescue plan Metallgesellschaft will continue its fight for survival this morning when it presents details of revised refinancing proposals to bank creditors owed DM5bn (Dollars 2.86bn). Its plan will be presented at a hastily-convened meeting in a Frankfurt hotel. The stricken mining, metals and industrial group warned banks yesterday that today's package represented its last chance to avoid formal insolvency proceedings. Although Metallgesellschaft itself did not tell banks about revisions to the original DM3.4bn rescue package, it emerged that Norddeutsche Landesbank, the public sector bank which condemned the package earlier this week, had won significant concessions. NordLB, a house bank to the state of Lower Saxony, said the seven state sector banks owed a total of DM1bn by Metallgesellschaft agreed to the proposals as a result of the changes. It was not clear yesterday whether the modifications would be enough to win over French banks, which declared opposition to the refinancing terms. Their resistance forced a deputation from Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, Germany's two largest banks and big shareholders in the metals group, to fly to Paris for negotiations on Thursday. The French banks, led by Societe Generale and Credit Lyonnais, objected to the details of the original proposals, and to what they said was a lack of information about Metallgesellschaft's current financial position and prospects. The negotiations broke off without any agreement on Thursday night, and the German delegation flew back to Frankfurt. Talks continued by telephone yesterday. The original refinancing proposals envisaged a DM1.4bn rights issue, the conversion of DM1.3bn of bank debt into junior convertible stock, and DM700m in new credit lines. NordLB said yesterday the proposals had been modified on a number of counts. These are: The refinancing need not be unilaterally agreed by all 120 creditor banks - a big change from the group's original stance that all had to agree. This leaves scope for some creditors not to take part in the proposals as long as the total sum of money is provided by the others. The amount of fresh money to be lent is likely to be halved to DM350m, implying that Deutsche and Dresdner have backed down from their original position that they would not lend any more money to the stricken conglomerate after extending DM1.5bn emergency facilities last month. The terms of the DM1.3bn conversion of debt to junior convertible stock are to be improved. Metallgesellschaft's shares, readmitted to trading on the Frankfurt stock exchange yesterday after being suspended on Thursday, dropped sharply to DM214, down DM12 from Wednesday night's close.</p>

The  fighting, which was the heaviest during the last fortnight,  continued throughout the night and gradually died down in the  morning. The two sides used heavy artillery and rocket fire on  each other's positions in Bala Hesar, (Tapamaranjan),  (Tivihilloc), Takatu, and (Omryan). The presidential palace in  Kabul and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekymatyar's headquarters in  Chahar Asiab also came under heavy fire.    Meanwhile, efforts are continuing to search new avenues for  peace in Kabul.    Iranian officials have begun distribution of relief supplies  to Afghan refugees in tents in Jalalabad. The supplies were  flown to Peshawar and were taken to Jalalabad by road. The head  of Iran's aid operation for Afghanistan said his country also  plans to give supplies to Kabul once the city's airport is  reopened to cargo planes.</p>

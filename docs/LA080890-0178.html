			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: BUSTER DELIVERS BLOW TO IMAGE  </P> <P> From the beginning, we have been pretty taken with Buster Douglas. He made  mincemeat of Mike Tyson; he was living proof that every underdog has its day;  he seemed to be the most eloquent heavyweight champion since Muhammad Ali and  most modest since Floyd Patterson, and, first and foremost, he resisted the  psychological double-babble of Don King, who is the sort of guy who could  change a $12 bill in fours.  </P> <P> Swollen heads, however, belong to the cosmetics of the boxing business, along  with broken noses, black eyes, bloody lips and cauliflower ears. And the skull  size of James (Buster) Douglas, sad to say, seems to be swelling day by day as  he begins preparation for the Oct. 25 title fight against the undefeated  Evander Holyfield at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Or maybe it's Buster who is the mirage.  </P> <P> Maybe we see only what we think we see. Maybe he is merely what so many of us  wanted to see, a lovable lug in a business that by its very nature brings out  the worst in those who populate it. Maybe Buster Douglas is not America's  sweetheart after all. Maybe he is simply a boxer, full of sound and fury,  significant of nothing more.  </P> <P> In Rod Serling's "Requiem for a Heavyweight," when a character makes reference  to the virtue and nobility of boxing, another says: "Are you kidding? They'd  hold these things in sewers if there was head room."  </P> <P> Well, boxing is not so dehumanizing as that. It does, on the other hand, make  braggarts and bullies out of tough customers who no longer can tell the  difference between self-confidence and self-promotion. Once a boxer gets his  arm raised often enough, he begins to think his armpit gives off no odor.  </P> <P> So, somewhat abruptly, the Buster Douglas we appreciated most for his  once-in-a-lifetime heroism and his common courtesy and apparent decency seems  to be evolving into one of those prickly prizefighters who finds it necessary  to insult his next opponent and to castigate anybody and everybody who ever  doubted his superhuman skill.  </P> <P> Today's Buster demands to know how in the world anybody could have been  ignorant enough to have foreseen Mike Tyson laying a finger on him. Today's  Buster mocks the qualifications of top-contender Holyfield, mere minutes after  mentioning that nobody should underestimate the quality of any professional  boxer.  </P> <P> While they were shooting the bull side by side Tuesday morning in Century City,  the equally ambitious Holyfield casually observed that he believed himself  deserving of his shot at the champion, having dispatched 24 opponents without  defeat.  </P> <P> "Cakewalks!" Douglas cried.  </P> <P> Holyfield was caught off-balance.  </P> <P> "Cakewalks, every one of them!" Douglas said, and he wasn't kidding. "He didn't  fight anybody!"  </P> <P> This came from a heavyweight more invisible than invincible, whose record  before the Tyson fight included losses to such noted blood donors as David Bey,  Mike White, Jesse Ferguson and Tony Tucker, and 10-round decisions over the  mighty Oliver McCall, Dee Collier and the eminently hittable Randall (Tex)  Cobb.  </P> <P> Naturally, Holyfield had to strike back.  </P> <P> "It'll be a cakewalk when I beat you," Holyfield told Douglas.  </P> <P> And here we thought that these two were going to be different, that the new  champion and the worthy challenger were going to spend the next two months  treating one another honorably, as sportsmen, without the usual  come-October-you're-dead-meat heckling that accompanies so many of these  events.  </P> <P> We didn't expect "When Evander Meets Buster" to be the sweetest encounter since  "When Harry Met Sally," but we had been looking forward to the fight being  relatively malice-free. Too much to expect, evidently. It didn't take long  Tuesday for John Johnson, the guy in the champion's corner, to jabber away on  the subject of how Buster was about to "knock Evander Holyfield's (rear) off,"  or for one of Evander's entourage, Lou Duva, to jab back with claims that  Douglas has been ducking his opponent, inventing excuses, doing anything to  postpone the inevitable and keep that belt for a few weeks longer.  </P> <P> What should be an intriguing bout, possibly worth the five bills it'll take to  occupy a seat at ringside, shouldn't have to deteriorate into another of these  one-ring circuses.  </P> <P> But Buster has been to the big-top now, and has come to the conclusion that  it's him against the outside world.  </P> <P> "Once again, people doubt my ability!" Douglas pops off.  </P> <P> He is grievously offended that someone might actually be fool enough to favor a  professionally undefeated former Olympian over a four-time loser who has fought  three opponents in 24 months. That somebody must be pretty stupid to bet  against someone of Douglas' obvious stature, a man who needed only nine rounds  to do away with the much-feared Wimpy Halstead.  </P> <P> Buster, don't be that way.  </P> <P> The fact that you flattened Mike Tyson was evidence that good things come to  those who wait, not that good things come to those who are great.  </P> <P> That was you, if you will kindly recall, who spent somewhere between seven to  13 seconds in a prostrate condition on a bed of canvas that February evening in  Tokyo, put there by a Tyson knuckle sandwich. Don't make us sorry you got up.  </P> <P> As fond as we have been of the Buster Douglas who came along to give hope to  the hopeless by slaying boxing's dragon, that's how disappointed we are to hear  him contending now that Tyson was nothing much to begin with, that the only  reason anybody thought he was anything special was that "you been telling him  for five years how great he is."  </P> <P> Silly us, to have thought Mike Tyson was a great boxer.  </P> <P> Over the last six months, we have appreciated having Buster Douglas as the  resident king of the ring, but if we have to endure continued shooting off of  his mouth, we won't be particularly sorry to see the knocking off of his block.  </P> <P> "Holyfield will go down," Douglas said.  </P> <P> "When?" someone asked, meaning the round.  </P> <P> "As of November," he said.  </P> <P> Back up, Buster. Back up.  </P></p>

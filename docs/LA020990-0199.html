			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> YAMAGUCHI SEEKS DOUBLE CROWN  </P> <P> Kristi Yamaguchi, who goes for her second pairs title tonight with partner Rudi  Galindo, is seeking to become the first woman in 50 years to win both a U.S.  pairs and singles crown in the same U.S. Figure Skating Championships.  </P> <P> Yamaguchi was third behind Jill Trenary and Tonya Harding after Thursday's  women's original program. Trenary kept her lead -- barely -- despite falling  during her required double-axel jump in the women's original program because  she had won the compulsories Wednesday. Saturday's long program counts for 50%  of the scoring.  </P></p>

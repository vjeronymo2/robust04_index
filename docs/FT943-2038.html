			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Travis Perkins confirms recovery with 83% leap Travis Perkins yesterday confirmed the recovery in the building materials market, with an 83 per cent advance in pre-tax profits from Pounds 9.31m to Pounds 17.06m for the first half of 1994. The figure included Pounds 1.77m from property sales and a three-month contribution from AAH builders merchants - which Travis paid Pounds 41.8m for in March - worth Pounds 1.61m at the operating level. AAH also added just over Pounds 23m to total turnover, which increased 29 per cent to Pounds 215.6m (Pounds 166.8m). Earnings per share jumped 89 per cent to 11.2p (5.9p). The interim dividend was raised 12 per cent to 2.8p (2.5p). Mr Tony Travis, chairman, said that the AAH deal had moved the company from seventh to joint-second place among UK builders materials groups, which had enabled it to benefit from economies of scale. Net operating margins at the new subsidiary had been doubled, while for the group as a whole they rose from 5.4 per cent to 7 per cent. Price rises in the materials business had been successfully passed on to customers, with Mr Travis putting inflation in the industry at about 7 per cent. Although the housing market was showing only moderate signs of recovery, sales to the repair and maintenance side of the business - about 70 per cent of Travis's turnover - had improved markedly. London and the south-east were proving stronger than the group's other operating centres. Mr Travis said that the company's aim was to increase its present UK market share of some 6.5 per cent to 9 per cent. 'A small amount of this will be achieved through organic growth, but most of it realistically will be through acquisitions,' although he added that the company was currently interested only in 'bedding down' AAH, rather than make fresh purchases. COMMENT Travis' solid record of controlling costs and focusing on the bottom line has worked its way through to AAH's margins. The main part of the business has reported margins at the top end of the industry range. The company is better geographically spread than before and also has the benefit of being well placed in the recovery cycle. Full-year profit forecasts were being ratcheted up an average 15 per cent to about Pounds 33m on yesterday's performance, giving prospective earnings per share of above 21 times and a prospective p/e of 13 times. This is slightly below the sector average and compares well with competitors Wolseley (currently on about 15 times) and Meyer International (about 13.5 times).</p>

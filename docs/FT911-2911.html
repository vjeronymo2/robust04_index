			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Kinnock rejects Major's optimism about recovery - Economy A CLAIM by Mr John Major, the prime minister, that Britain was coming out of its economic difficulties while other countries faced deepening problems was disputed by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, in the Commons yesterday. 'I wish your optimism was well placed,' said Mr Kinnock who renewed his charge that government policies had plunged Britain into 'deep recession'. Mr Major stressed that inflation, having already fallen, was set to fall 'significantly further', and urged the government's critics to take account of events since sterling's entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. There had been five cuts in interest rates - four in the last ten weeks - while at the same time there had been an appreciation and not a depreciation of sterling. Labour backbenchers shouted their disagreement when the prime minister also asserted that Britain's trade gap was 'narrowing'. Unperturbed, Mr Major insisted that it would be extremely difficult even for Mr Kinnock to deny the improvements 'now coming about'. When questioned later, government officials were unable to expand on the factors which the prime minister had in mind, but emphasised that a turning point in the economy presented special difficulties for those charting future trends. Mr Kinnock buttressed his attack by citing the view of Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton,the Governor of the Bank of England,that Britain's deep and worsening recession was 'home grown'. The prime minister refused to accept that the recession was 'home grown', and pointed to the variety of causes which had caused a downturn in world trade affecting other countries. 'We cannot be immune from those,' he said. Mr Kinnock recalled that Mr Leigh-Pemberton had stated that while Britain was in recession Japan and Germany 'undeniably' were not. The Governor had also pointed out, he said, that although the economies of other European Community countries had slowed down they were not in recession. Mr Kinnock maintained that the Governor's view had been borne out by the International Monetary Fund, and urged the prime minister to take account of concern expressed by the CBI, the Engineering Employers Federation and other organisations.</p>

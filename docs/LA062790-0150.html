BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BREAKTHROUGH OFFER STIRS NEW HOPES IN U.S.-JAPAN TRADE TALKS  </P> <P> Talks between Japan and the United States on structural trade reforms  progressed today with a last-minute breakthrough on the issue of increasing  Japan's public works spending, officials said.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu conveyed Japan's final offer on the issue to  President Bush in a telephone conversation.  </P> <P> Bush said he will hear details of the talks from U.S. officials and expressed  appreciation for Kaifu's efforts, according to a high-ranking Foreign Ministry  official.  </P> <P> "This represents a breakthrough," said the official, who spoke on condition of  anonymity. "Without an agreement on public works spending . . . I doubt we  could finish the talks by (Thursday)."  </P> <P> Foreign Ministry officials said they could not confirm reports that Japanese  and U.S. officials had agreed on a final figure of $2.77 trillion in public  works spending over the next 10 years.  </P> <P> Local media said Kaifu and other top Japanese officials, meeting in a  last-ditch move to salvage the talks, had agreed to increase their original  proposal of $2.68 trillion by $96.77 billion.  </P></p>

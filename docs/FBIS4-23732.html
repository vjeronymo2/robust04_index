			<p>BFN     [Text] Seven opposition parties, including the UNIP [United  National Independence Party], have decided to form a Zambia  Opposition Front that will coordinate the parties' activities at  grassroots level. Chairman of the Zambia Opposition Front,  Zofro, Mike Kaira, told ZNBC [Zambia National Broadcasting  Corporation] news today that the alliance will aim at fielding  common candidates in future parliamentary and local government  elections. Mr. Kaira, also president of the Independent  Democratic Front, says the formation of Zofro was reached at the  all-opposition parties meeting at the weekend in Lusaka, where  Nada [National Democratic Alliance], Zambia Progressive Party,  Labor Party, and National Party for Democracy, among others,  appeared. Mr. Kaira said his committee has been empowered to  contact other opposition parties which did not attend the  meeting to try and convince them to join the front.</p>

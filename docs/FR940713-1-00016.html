			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Currently, the average net increase in in-plant inspector positions is 55&hyph;57 per year. The majority of increased positions have resulted from industry growth. It is projected that the growth of the poultry industry will continue and possibly increase. Additionally, FSIS expects an increased need for inspectors for HACCP monitoring and additional microbiological duties. The 139 inspection personnel resulting from the implementation of the enhanced poultry inspection system could fill the new positions resulting from industry growth, as well as the new positions created for HACCP monitoring and additional microbiological duties. Other positions considered could include permanent relief inspector positions or additional off-line inspector positions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although not available for the present rulemaking, new microbiological tests and sampling programs are under development. The proposed system requires inspection at a point where FSIS expects some microbiological testing to occur. Research is aimed at determining typical microbial conditions at various in-plant and in-process locations. On the basis of such information, it is hoped, criteria can be developed for determining when plant processes are in control and in compliance with a standard, based on microbiological test results. In the future, with the aid of rapid in-plant tests, inspectors and veterinarians should be able to determine more precisely the source and nature of microbial threats to public health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> FSIS has determined that this proposed rule is significant, but does not believe it to be economically significant, for the purposes of Executive Order 12866, because it raises significant policy issues arising out of legal mandates and the Administration's priorities, which include a regulatory system that improves, protects, and maintains public health and safety without imposing unacceptable costs on the private sector.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rulemaking would meet the objectives of the Secretary of Agriculture to enhance poultry inspection by enforcing a more stringent policy for the removal of feces from dressed poultry carcasses and by requiring the application of antimicrobial treatments. It is thereby intended to improve public health and safety and strengthen consumer confidence in poultry products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the proposed rulemaking would impose initial costs and additional responsibilities on the regulated industry, the Agency's assessment indicates that the proposed rulemaking is cost-effective as compared to the alternatives considered. There would be no reduction in maximum poultry production linespeeds currently allowed under optimal conditions, but the proposed regulation would provide inducements to industry to improve processing controls and further ensure the quality and safety of outgoing product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the same time, the proposed rulemaking would apply the President's regulatory philosophy by addressing a compelling public need ``.&blank;.&blank;. to protect or improve the health and safety of the public . . . or the well-being of the people.'' (E.O. 12866, section 1(a).) This need is evidenced by epidemiological and economic studies carried out in recent years that show the presence of microbial pathogens on raw poultry products to be a continuing and possibly an increasing threat to the public health and the economy of the nation. <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Agricultural Outlook, Economic Research Service, AO&hyph;198 (July 1993), pp. 33&hyph;38.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Healthy People 2000.

For example, this proposed rulemaking would be both compatible with and a precursor of the planned mandatory Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) programs for meat and poultry establishments. The inspection and plant sorting stations to be provided for control of disease and contamination would be consistent with certain control points that would be chosen for monitoring under a HACCP system. The proposal is also intended to contribute to the fulfillment of the Administration's public health objectives as set forth in the Healthy People 2000 initiative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Benefits of Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The benefits to be derived from the proposed rule include potential reductions in the microbial profile of dressed, ready-to-cook poultry, including both pathogens and other bacterial organisms. A reduction in visible contamination, combined with antimicrobial treatments, can result in a decrease in the microbial load on dressed poultry carcasses. <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> ``Comparison of the Microbiological Quality of Inspection-Passed and Fecal Contamination-Condemned Broiler Carcasses.''

An estimated 6.5 million to 33 million people in the United States become ill and 6,000 to 9,000 die each year from foodborne illness. Meat, poultry, dairy, and seafood products are the foods most likely to contain contaminants. Microbial foodborne disease causes an estimated $2.5 billion to $3.4 billion in medical costs and reduced productivity to be spent each year for four major bacterial pathogens and $2.6 billion each year for parasitic diseases. <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> USDA, Economic Research Service, Agriculture Information Bulletin No. 664&hyph;53, September 1993.

In as many as 17.2 percent of salmonellosis cases, poultry products have been implicated as the vehicle (immediate source of infection). Annual medical costs attributable to salmonellosis range from $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion. The costs associated with campylobacteriosis cases are in the neighborhood of $1 billion per year. More than 40 percent of campylobacteriosis cases can be attributed to the consumption of improperly handled chicken. Productivity losses from such cases are estimated at over $400 million for 1992. <FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>  The growing proportion of the U.S. population that is compromised by immunologic deficiencies and age exacerbates the problem because these subpopulations are more susceptible to infection and death resulting from infection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Agriculture Outlook, Economic Research Service, USDA, AO&hyph;198 (July 1993), pp. 33&hyph;36.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

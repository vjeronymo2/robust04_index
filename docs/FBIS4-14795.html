			<p>BFN     [Text] Vladislav Ardzinba, leader of the Georgia's  separatist region of Abkhazia, has authorized his prime minister  Sokrat Dzhindzholia to sign with Georgian officials two  agreements in Moscow to settle the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict.    Beslan Bargandzhia, spokesman for Abkhazia's legislature,  told Interfax one of the accords would enable all ethnic  Georgians who have fled Abkhazia and who have taken no part in  hostilities against it to return there. The other document is a  declaration on the nonviolent settlement of the conflict.    The documents, to be signed on Monday, were drafted at  Georgian-Abkhazian talks in Geneva, Bargandzhia said.</p>

			<p>Officer   <F P=102>   PY1306201294 Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish  1928 GMT 10 Jun 94 </F>  <F P=103> PY1306201294 </F> <F P=104>  Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 10 Jun (NA) -- It has been  officially announced that the Italian Embassy in Argentina on 10  June submitted to Foreign Vice Minister Fernando Petrella an  official request for the extradition of former Nazi officer  Erich Priebke, who is charged with participating in the murder  of 335 Italians during World War II.    The Foreign Ministry also announced that Foreign Minister  Guido Di Tella immediately ordered that the request be sent to  the federal court in Bariloche City, which is presided over by  Judge Leonidas Moldes, who is hearing the case involving  Priebke's arrest.    The Foreign Ministry official communique states that the  extradition request was submitted to Petrella by Italian  Ambassador to Argentina Giuseppe Maria Borga.    It was unofficially reported on 8 June that Italian  authorities would officially file for the extradition of Priebke  on 10 June.    The Foreign Ministry communique adds that the request was  checked against the current extradition treaty between Italy and  Argentina and then mailed to Judge Moldes "following the  participation of Interpol and a Foreign Ministry official."  [passage omitted]    Discussions will now surely ensue about deadlines for  meeting  the request.    Priebke's attorney, Pedro Bianchi, believes "at least two  years" will pass before his defendant's extradition will be  approved. Bianchi said he has no objection to "the charges on  which the extradition request is filed," but added that there  are "some mistakes in the resolution" signed by Italian Justice  Minister Alfredo Biondi.    Ruben Beraja, head of the Delegation of Argentine-Jewish  Associations (DAIA), said: "There is concern at all government  levels, including the courts, over resolving this case within a  reasonable time."    [Italian Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi's new  administration responded immediately to Priebke's remarks, when  Liliana Ferrero, Justice Ministry Criminal Affairs secretary,  announced that her government would request Priebke's  extradition.</p>

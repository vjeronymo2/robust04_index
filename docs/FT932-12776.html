			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Technology: Three-D vision of the future - IBM's new graphics system is an effort to marry R&amp;D with commercial instinct The images are stunning: a sleek red sports car turns slowly and cruises off screen; a blue-green rendering of the earth's atmosphere shows how the ozone layer is thinning alarmingly; red balloons drift through a group of near-abstract futuristic buildings. Capping all this, the viewer - wearing special glasses - is treated to three-dimensional pictures of breaking pottery, with fragments spilling in slow motion off the big high-definition screen, and a sinister-looking metal container with forked arms which pursues autumn leaves as they scatter across a garden and appears to enter the room. Producing this blend of realistic and toy-like images is IBM's Power Visualisation System, now being sold to scientific institutions, special effects studios and industrial users in the US and abroad. PVS costs between Dollars 300,000 and Dollars 1m (Pounds 200,000 and Pounds 677,000), can be hooked up to supercomputers or used with parallel processing systems for increased power, and can be combined with a variety of software and connecting equipment. But more important than all of PVS's capabilities and potential is what this advanced computer graphics system represents for IBM, now no longer the overlord of the world computer industry and struggling to regain profits and credibility in fragmenting markets. That challenge thrusts deep into the heart of IBM, affecting not only its products and marketing operations, but also its research activities. For PVS, like several other new products including speech recognition and multimedia conference systems, was developed in the group's research facilities and not by one of the product divisions. 'We have to run like hell to survive,' says Jim McGroddy, IBM's director of research. 'As a company, we've not been in enough of a hurry. We've not felt the heat of the market so much.' With group losses last year of some Dollars 5bn, further heavy job cuts in prospect and a tough new chief executive appointed from outside to stop the financial rot, the heat inside IBM has become scorching. Every part has to justify its existence. That is true of the research activities - headquartered in New York state and employing 3,300 people in the US (including California), Switzerland, Japan and Israel - just as it is for other more commercially exposed parts of the business. The research division's funding has been cut by 10 per cent to Dollars 500m this year, though there are hopes that some will be made up from federal sources. (IBM's total research and development budget was Dollars 6.5bn in 1992.) In the present harsh business climate, IBM's research unit is determined to show that it can combine its scientific and electronics skills, which have yielded several Nobel prizes and a third of IBM's 30,000 worldwide patents, with the hard-nosed commercial abilities needed to succeed in the market place. That means pushing beyond IBM's traditional areas of mainstream computer activity into new markets. According to Mark Bregman, head of technical plans and controls at the research division: 'In the last five to seven years, the principle value creation in information technology has come from the formation and exploitation of new business segments rather than just the expansion of existing segments.' As well as being developed by IBM's research division, PVS is also managed and marketed from there. Previously, when a product idea was identified as being commercially viable, it was developed by one of the concern's operating divisions. The decision to invest depended on whether there was an IBM unit in the relevant business. 'If there was not an IBM partner, most often it would be decided not to invest,' Bregman notes. Since there was no obvious IBM operation to bring PVS to end-users, the research division decided to run with the system itself. 'It was aimed at a market where IBM is not a major player,' says Armando Garcia, research director of visualisation systems. Convinced of PVS's future, and backed by IBM executives, the research division sank Dollars 20m into the system's development and brought it to the commercial stage in less than two years. Normally, this would have taken twice as long. A special team was set up to propel PVS, with its own Data Explorer software, from the laboratory to the market place. When this had been done, PVS's managers faced the problem of convincing the market of its uses. In the entertainment world, this has not been too hard. The special effects that can be generated by PVS are an obvious asset in the constant Hollywood battle for big screen success. IBM has sold the system to several US film studios. Scientific applications are also fairly easy to identify, as huge volumes of data can be transformed into animated visual images with PVS. These can be spun round, shrunk and blown up, or twisted into new shapes. Thus scientists can view and analyse complex arrays of information in new ways. Examples include the mapping of the ozone layer's deterioration, simulated chemical interactions and medical scanning images. Both Cornell and Princeton universities have PVS equipment. The real test, though, will be the extent to which IBM can move its research-derived products into the wider industrial and business world. Honda of Japan has a PVS system and European car companies are also showing some interest. With PVS, says IBM, manufacturers can speed up car design by dispensing with clay models. Yet some in the industry remain to be persuaded, says Garcia. 'True car designers are still not convinced they can dispense with traditional tools.' This is where IBM's researchers, many of whom are more used to talking and thinking along scientific rather than commercial lines, have to ally themselves with marketing experts. PVS is in competition with other high-powered systems sold by companies such as Silicon Graphics, Qantel and Kodak. It is not meant to replace supercomputers like Cray's, but to be used with them if necessary. According to Eric Rosencrans, marketing manager for PVS, the next step is to sell the system as an analytical tool to financial institutions and industrial companies, to provide them with improved visual means of monitoring performance and understanding how the parts of their operations interact. But to do this, IBM will have to make its systems more readily usable by managers who know little or nothing about computers. The group has not always been good at exploiting its technologies. It was slow, for example, to bring out its own computer using Risc (reduced instruction set computing) which it invented in the mid-1970s. To inject the necessary urgency and financial discipline into research projects which enter the commercial category, strict criteria have been laid down. Projects are evaluated on the basis of what they are trying to achieve, how this can be recognised so as to prevent them from becoming open-ended, and the value to IBM. That value used to focus on higher revenues or lower costs. Now, explains Bregman, 'it is increasingly used in a broader sense to include new markets and new businesses'. One of these is rapid prototyping, an industrial design tool aimed at giving engineers an actual plastic model of what they are trying to create. This example, not yet on the market, illustrates what McGroddy means when he talks of 'entering the white space' where IBM has traditionally not ventured. IBM's researchers insist that such activities do not mean it will weaken its commitment to fundamental research. Instead, they hope that the flow of funds back from the sale of successful products will be used, at least partly, to enhance the research spending. If IBM can pull its new ideas out of the research laboratories and put them into the market place quickly enough, it could gain a new entrepreneurial impetus at a time when this is desperately needed. If not, the white space it is so keen to enter will be blinding rather than enlightening.</p>

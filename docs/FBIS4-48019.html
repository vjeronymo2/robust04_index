			<p>BFN     [Text] Bissau, 5 May (AFP) -- Six Guinea-Bissau opposition  parties today decided to form an alliance in order to defeat the  former single ruling African Party for the Independence of  Guinea- Bissau and Cape Verde in the country's planned  multiparty elections.    According to Joao da Costa, chairman of the Party for  Renovation and Development [PRD], the alliance, in addition to  the PRD, includes the Democratic Front, the Social Democratic  Front, the Ecological Protection League, the Movement for  Democracy, and the Democratic and Progress Party. This alliance  will soon elect a single presidential candidate, Mr. da Costa  disclosed, announcing on the occasion his decision to step down  from the presidential race.    After a first postponement in 1992, President Joao Bernardo  Vieira again postponed Guinea-Bissau's first multiparty  presidential and parliamentary elections indefinitely on 22  March -- a week to the scheduled date -- for "technical  reasons." President Vieira is standing for reelection. No firm  date has so far been announced for the holding of these  elections despite the completion of a population census on 23  April.</p>

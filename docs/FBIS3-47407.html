In his New Year address he said  that the formation of the top state power structures have been  completed on the basis of the new constitution and that  foundations have been created for implementing the concept of  division of functions between power structures, as recorded in  the constitution.    However, many of the plans have not succeeded the president  admitted. Therefore, the coming year should become "a turning  point in the process of the stabilization and further  development of the economy." The task of raising living  standards is on the agenda, together with providing guarantees  of their rights and freedoms to every citizen and ensuring peace  and security.    As the process of reform in Mongolia is irreversible, so is  its peaceful foreign policy, he said.

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Pioneering package from Reuters - Institutions study pay performance scheme for executives Reuters, the international financial information and news group, is pioneering a form of executive remuneration which links rewards of senior executives directly to the group's future returns to shareholders. The scheme is being studied by investment institutions and other FT-SE 100 companies, which must decide soon how to replace the executive share option schemes which many companies adopted 10 years ago following changes in UK tax law. Institutions have made it clear they will support only share option schemes which are performance-related, but there is still widespread debate over which indicators best reflect executive achievement. Reuters has decided that instead of conventional share options, it will offer senior executives a long-term incentive scheme, in addition to their base salary and annual cash bonus. The scheme yields benefits worth up to or more than annual salary if Reuters' longer-term performance is rated good or outstanding, but nothing if it is inadequate. Performance is measured by comparing the cash return to a shareholder, including dividends, from investing in Reuters with that from other companies in the FT-SE 100, over three to five years. Executives are awarded restricted shares at the beginning of the performance period, which are released at the end of five years, subject to performance criteria. No shares are released if Reuters is ranked in the last 25 companies, but all are released if it is in the top 40, with a graduated release between these two points. The driving force behind the new approach is Sir Christopher Hogg, chairman of Reuters, who is one of the UK's most respected managers and an adviser to the Cadbury committee on corporate governance. Sir Christopher said the main weakness in current share option schemes was that they assumed a tight linkage between management performance and share price. This was fallacious, because other factors could be influential, and there could be time-lags between management actions and their impact on results. He said: 'Shareholders can, on occasion, feel that managers have been excessively rewarded by share option schemes. Managers, on the other hand, can view option schemes as a bit of a lottery - and unfair as well in that background conditions can vary uncontrollably . . . 'In particular, managers can do very well out of a strong stock market, even though their own company's results - and share price performance - may have been relatively poor. Conversely, an excellent set of company results may produce little or no stock option benefits if the stock market has fallen significantly during the option period.' Reuters considered measuring management performance by other criteria - such as return on assets, cashflow or profit margins. The chairman said: 'The trouble is that they all measure past performance only - and that only in accounting terms. Furthermore, they are best measured as different parts of a total approach, since none of them provides a satisfactory total view. 'Earnings per share comes nearest, but is still limited in what it actually measures and is also open to material variation, both as between companies and from one period to another, by virtue of different accounting treatments.' Sir Christopher hoped the Reuters scheme - which initially covers 17 executives - would contribute to the looming UK debate on executive remuneration. Boston Consultancy Group, the strategic management consultant which helped to develop the scheme, calculated the return from Reuters would have been in the top 40 of FT-SE 100 companies in five of the past six years.

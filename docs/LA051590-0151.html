			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 5 ABORTION FOES ARRESTED AT GA. CLINIC;  </P> <P> PROTEST: THE OPERATION RESCUE ACTIVISTS HAD CHAINED THEMSELVES TOGETHER IN THE  FACILITY IN VIOLATION OF A COURT ORDER.  </P> <P> Five Operation Rescue anti-abortion protesters were arrested today after they  entered an Atlanta abortion clinic and chained themselves together, defying a  court order upheld this week by the U.S. Supreme Court.  </P> <P> Police were called to the Atlanta Surgi-Center and arrested the five after  cutting their chains. Maj. W. W. Holley said that they would be charged with  criminal trespass and that information about the violation of the order would  be turned over to the court.  </P> <P> An Operation Rescue spokeswoman, Jane Shepherd, said the protest was not a  response to Monday's U.S. Supreme Court decision to uphold the court-ordered  ban on demonstrations by the group within 50 feet of any Atlanta abortion  clinic. But she acknowledged that it violated that ban, imposed by a Superior  Court judge in Atlanta.  </P> <P> "When we do a rescue in the city, it does not matter whether there's an  injunction or not," she said.  </P> <P> The clinic's director, Beth Petzelt, said the protesters pushed their way into  the clinic about 8:30 a.m., as patients were being admitted, and scuffled with  four or five staff members who tried to keep them out.  </P> <P> Meanwhile today, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., was told that Operation  Rescue spent more than $50,000 for November demonstrations that kept women out  of Washington-area clinics in violation of a court order.  </P> <P> Attorney Larry Eisenstein, who represents the National Organization for Women  and Planned Parenthood, said Operation Rescue and its leaders should be found  in contempt of a Nov. 8 order that prohibited blockades of abortion clinics.  </P> <P> He asked that they be fined "a large enough figure to deter them from returning  in the future."  </P> <P> Police arrested more than 700 protesters during a Nov. 17 demonstration on  charges that they violated a new District of Columbia law.  </P> <P> At today's hearing before U.S. District Judge Louis F. Oberdorfer, Eisenstein  showed videotapes of three November demonstrations in an effort to prove that  Operation Rescue, Project Rescue and their leaders violated Oberdorfer's  injunction.  </P> <P> Eisenstein said he would show that Organization Rescue, which says it is in  debt, spent "well in excess of $50,000 and maybe well more than $100,000" on  the November operations  </P> <P> He said that 1989 donations to the two organizations exceeded $700,000 and that  they deposited more than $1.1 million in bank accounts.  </P></p>

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Observer: No fishing Senior executives at Companies House, the government's company information agency, were caught on the hop last Friday by a one-day strike in reaction to plans to shed up to 80 of the 1,150 staff. During previous strikes, they have tried to keep operating normally using tactics such as cancelling all holiday leave. That might have helped this time except for one problem: the chief executive had already gone on holiday.</p>

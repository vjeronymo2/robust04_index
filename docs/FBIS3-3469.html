They are also hot topics at the ongoing National People's  Congress [NPC] session and the session of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC].    In the last few days, NPC deputies and CPPCC members have  expressed their views on commodity prices in almost every  speech. Sun Shangqing, NPC deputy and director of the State  Council's Development Research Center, said worriedly: Price  increases were a little too high last year and became higher at  the beginning of this year. If this is not strictly controlled,  the plan to keep price increases under 10 percent this year will  fall through.    CPPCC members Wang Rongbing and Qu Qinyue made the following  appeal: Excessive price increase in commodities closely related  to the people's lives have affected the people's standard of  living and feelings; mandatory limits must be set for price  increase indices and these limits must not be overstepped.    Xiamen Mayor Hong Yongshi spoke about the pressure he  endured  and his feelings: The increase in the purchase prices of grain,  cotton, and oil; the lifting of control over the prices of coal,  electricity, and crude oil; the introduction of the civil  service system; the implementation of wage system reform in  institutions; and the rapid growth of investments in fixed  assets in the entire society will all cause commodity price  raises. It will be hard to keep price increases under 10  percent this year.    NPC deputies and CPPCC members discussed state affairs and  expressed the people's opinions. Their worries are not without  foundation.    Since November last year, commodity prices have kept rising.    At first, panic buying of grain and oil swept from the south  to the north, causing anxiety among civilians; subsequently, the  standardization of foreign exchange rates caused some turbulence  in the use of foreign exchange certificates; some people with  foreign exchange certificates in hand began to buy gold  ornaments and imported electrical appliances, also causing some  unrest; afterward, taxation system reform was introduced amid  price raises, during which some people could not understand the  17 percent increment value-added tax and the consumer tax on  some commodities. Some people availed themselves of the  opportunity to increase commodity prices, even the prices of  some overstocked products.    Statistics revealed by an authoritative department indicate  the civilian pressure: In January this year, the civilian cost  of living throughout the country increased by 21.1 percent over  the same period last year; in February it rose to 23.3 percent;  the cost of living in 35 big cities increased by 25.9 percent.    In particular, the prices of daily necessities and service  charges increased very sharply.    There are all kinds of indications that the civilian  capacity  to endure inflation has reached a critical point. If commodity  price raises are not strictly controlled, economic relations  will be distorted, the macroeconomic environment will become  intense, and the overall situation of reform and opening up will  be endangered.    Chinese statesmen are absolutely sober-minded about this  point. They do not deny inflation and have made up their minds  to introduce control and regulation. At these ongoing NPC and  CPPCC sessions, government leaders have, of course, focused on  controlling excessive price increases.    Li Peng said: Lifting control over prices does not mean  giving up macrocontrol and regulation; prices must be controlled  within the framework of the forbearance of civilians; in  particular the "vegetable basket" issue regarding the urban and  rural people must be properly resolved.    Zhu Rongji said: Controlling prices and stabilizing markets  are important tasks for governments at all levels. From now on,  achievements in agricultural and vegetable basket issues should  be taken as the main criteria for appraising governors,  provincial party secretaries, and mayors.    Li Lanqing said: If prices cannot be controlled, popular  feelings and stability will be affected and reform cannot be  carried on. Economic, legal, and administrative methods should  be adopted to stabilize prices.    Recently, the Chinese Government has repeatedly given orders  demanding the clear pricing of commodities, the implementation  of price checks, and strict supervision of the prices of daily  necessities and service charges. These moves have initially  stabilized popular feelings but whether or not they will help  halt excessive price increases remains to be seen. The policy  is good but needs to be put into effect.    In Chinese society, which is experiencing the transformation  from a planned economy into a market economy, from lower to  higher income, and from closed to open operation, the  large-scale introduction of reform and rapid economic growth  will inevitably cause certain inflation. In this situation, the  government must severely curb the practice of raising prices at  will and strictly control the investment scale and consumption  fund to fundamentally stop price hikes. On the civilians' part,  they should spend their money reasonably, promptly report  malpractices, and avoid panic buying -- this is a sensible  choice.    We should not turn pale at the mention of price raises  because, if we do, we will not be able to control them.  However, neither should we take the problem of price hikes  lightly, otherwise it could affect and ruin reform and  discourage the reformers.    "China's agony" really exists but a new life will emerge  after this agony.</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / German inflation figures hit interest rate cut hopes HOPES of a quick and substantial cut in German interest rates receded yesterday after the publication of consumer price inflation figures for October which were worse than economists' expectations. According to a provisional estimate made by the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden, annual consumer price inflation in October in the western part of Germany was 3.8 per cent, an increase of 0.4 per cent from September. Economists were expecting inflation of at most 3.6 per cent, the same as in September. The estimate, based on data from the states of Bavaria, Baden-Wurttemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse, defied expectations that the strengthening of the D-Mark since the currency turbulence of last month would dampen inflationary pressures. The D-Mark has appreciated by 8 per cent against leading currencies since the beginning of the year. The Bundesbank held its fortnightly council meeting yesterday and left its key Lombard and discount rates unchanged, at 9.5 and 8.25 per cent respectively. Although the Bundesbank does not react to a single month's inflation statistics, the increase means a cut in the internationally sensitive Lombard rate and the key discount rate would be more difficult to justify, however intense the pressure grows for further easing in the wake of deteriorating economic conditions in Germany. This week, Germany's five leading economic research institutes urged a rapid relaxation of rates and said the west German economy was in a 'critical state'. Recent speeches from influential members of the central bank's ruling council have made clear that fighting inflation is the main objective of monetary policy. The bank has taken pains to explain that it has reduced interest rates sharply, in that money market rates have dropped by nearly a full percentage point since early September. The fall in money market rates - together with comments playing down the importance of M3 monetary growth, traditionally one of the central bank's most important anti-inflation targets - has led to expectations of substantial rate cuts in coming months. But further cuts will be difficult, if not impossible, to justify when prices are rising. The inflation figure was driven up by inflation of 4 per cent in Hesse, by 3.6 per cent in North Rhine-Westphalia, 3.9 per cent in Bavaria and 3.3 per cent in Baden-Wurttemberg. The German government's budget deficit for 1993 seems certain to rise by several billion D-Marks above the forecast DM38bn (Pounds 15.3bn), in spite of strenuous efforts to find more savings, according to senior officials, Quentin Peel writes from Bonn. The partners in the coalition remain clearly divided about the extent to which drastic cuts in spending must be found, and the extent to which the deficit can be allowed to rise. The 1993 budget is for DM435.65bn, and the DM38bn deficit is a slight reduction on this year's DM40bn. Although all are talking of 'drastic and painful savings', there is no consensus about where they should be made, or how great they should be. Chancellor Helmut Kohl himself warned this week: 'There is a gap between what we say and what we do.' While urging savings, he seemed to warn against making excessive cuts in the biggest areas of state subsidies - agriculture, coal mining and shipbuilding.</p>

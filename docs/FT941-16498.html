			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Arts: Today's Television Television has long tended to be embarrassed by true experts (too hoity toity, too serious) and instead has chosen for its presenters 'personalities' with a bit of knowledge and a lot of enthusiasm. In the arts we have recently had the nun who spent her previous life in a caravan, and now here comes stand-up comedian Billy Connolly to show us The Bigger Picture. In the first of a six-part series on Scottish art, Connolly goes to Rome to explain about the Grand Tour. Well, programme makers are as keen on an expenses-paid trip to Italy as you or I would be (7.30 BBC2). Perhaps we have previously had drama and documentary series on the same subject transmitted simultaneously, but I cannot recall them. Last night BBC2 screened its documentary series 'Auction', and tonight ITV begins its drama Under The Hammer. Richard Wilson plays the motorcycle-riding international art expert at 'Klinsky's', the auction house invented by John Mortimer (9.00). Cutting Edge (9.00 C4) looks into feuds between neighbours, over dogs, noise, almost anything.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Miyazawa dismissive of Buchanan MR Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, forecast yesterday that Mr Patrick Buchanan would not gain national support in his challenge to Mr George Bush for the US presidency, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Hours later he backed off, however, apparently fearful his comments would inflict further damage on US-Japanese relations. 'I should not publicly comment on elections in other countries. It is too early to predict the outcome of elections being held throughout the US which have just begun,' he said. The prime minister, mired in political problems of his own, earlier told reporters he had thought Mr Bush would win more than 60 per cent of the vote in the New Hampshire primary election on Tuesday. Mr Bush took 58 per cent of the ballot, against 40 per cent for Mr Buchanan, in the first test of his candidacy for the November presidential election. Mr Miyazawa said he thought 'Mr Buchanan will not gain currency in all of America. I believe it is only that state (New Hampshire), as the economy appears to be in recession'. The Japanese, who feel they have become a target for Americans frustrated with a sluggish economy, are concerned that Mr Buchanan's criticism of Mr Bush could lead to isolationist policies. In the US, 'Buy American' campaigns have sprung up in a grassroots effort to hit back at Japan and reduce the US trade deficit.</p>

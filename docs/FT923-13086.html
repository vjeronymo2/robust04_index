			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / British Rail White Paper: Politicians send the trains down yet another track IT may seem an obvious question, but if the private sector is better at running railways than the state, why were they nationalised in the first place? British Rail is a relatively recent creation. From the opening of the Stockton &amp; Darlington railway in 1825 to nationalisation in 1948, all of Britain's railways were built and owned by the private sector. Far superior in speed to canals and horse-drawn transport, railways flourished in the 19th century. They spread to all corners of the kingdom, and most paid good dividends to shareholders. Almost from the start politicians wanted to play trains, too. They interfered over service levels and fares alike. While the railways prospered they were able to tolerate a degree of political interference. But by the turn of the century they were having to cope not only with increasingly onerous regulation of freight charges, but with labour unrest and heavy losses of passenger traffic to buses and trams. When the First World War began in 1914, it put the railways under immense strain. It also brought them under state control, and many influential voices argued that they should stay that way when the war ended. Instead an attempt was made to restore viability by merging the 120 private companies into four: the Great Western, the London Midland &amp; Scottish, the London &amp; North Eastern, and the Southern. Although these companies enjoyed virtual monopolies over large areas, none of them succeeded in making much money. Competition from motor vehicles was increasing; labour troubles resumed; the government continued to regulate passenger fares and freight charges; and the Depression brought a slump in demand. During the Second World War the railways came under even greater strain than during the first - this time suffering physical destruction as well as increased wartime demands. Again the state took control. By the time the war ended the railways were in such a poor state that nationalisation was almost taken for granted. It duly took place in 1948. After the failure of two post-war efforts to restore prosperity - the 1955 Modernisation Plan and the Beeching rationalisation of the 1960s - it seemed that the arrival of motor transport had ended the profits potential of railways for good. That might have marked the end of the private sector's interest in them were it not for the arrival of the Thatcher government in 1979. An inveterate privatiser, and notoriously hostile to public transport, Mrs Thatcher declared as early as 1982 that she wanted to see BR sold off. Given the size of BR's enduring losses, however, the government had to recognise that this was impractical in the short-term. Instead it told BR to concentrate on becoming more efficient and turned its back on BR's pleas for higher investment, contenting itself in the meantime with the privatisation of other transport sectors such as road freight, aviation and buses. What changed matters was the upsurge in demand during the economic boom of the late 1980s, and the property boom, which left BR awash with development profits, giving rise to the belief that it could conceivably have a commercial future after all. Starting with Mr Paul Channon in 1988, successive transport ministers avowed their enthusiasm for privatisation. The only question was how to achieve it, given the precarious nature of BR's profits and the need for massive investment to compensate for years of underfunding. Privatising BR in one great lump seemed out of the question. Apart from anything else, it was almost inconceivable that anyone would want to buy it. By the time Mr Malcolm Rifkind took over as transport secretary in November 1990, the options had narrowed down to ways of splitting it into attractive parcels. Within a year Mr Rifkind had drawn up his master plan. The profitable InterCity and Railfreight sectors would be sold outright, while the loss-making Network SouthEast and Regional Railways operations would be franchised out. He failed, however, to carry his cabinet colleagues with him. Trade and industry ministers argued that a separate track authority was necessary to create competition between train operators, while Mr John Major, the prime minister, was said to hanker for a return to the days of four regional railway companies. In the end all the options were undermined as the economy sank deeper into recession. BR's profits fizzled out and hopes of finding a buyer for any part of the railway evaporated. After months of embarrassing delays, a general election and yet another change of transport secretary, the result was the watered-down version that emerged yesterday - a long way from the full-blown privatisation that Mrs Thatcher had dreamed of a decade earlier.</p>

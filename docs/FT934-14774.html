			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Bank of Spain cuts interest rate to 9.5% THE BANK of Spain yesterday cut its benchmark interest rate half a percentage point to 9.5 per cent, the lowest since 1978, following the success of efforts on Wednesday by the minority socialist government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to secure safe passage for its tight 1994 budget. Finance ministry officials said the Bank of Spain's move, quickly followed by base rate cuts by Spain's big commercial banks, also reflected satisfaction with inflation figures for September and a promise on Wednesday by trade unions to continue negotiating a three-year wage moderation pact with the government. The government and its main partner in parliament, the ruling Catalan CiU, announced they had reached agreement over the budget which would allow the Catalans to vote in favour of its passage. A small grouping of independent Canary Island MPs also said they would vote for the budget and its success is now all but assured. That, in turn, virtually ensures the survival of the government for the next year. The Catalans had threatened not to support the budget, which cuts non-interest spending and imposes, for the first time, taxes on unemployment benefits, largely in an effort to force the central government to speed the transfer of political and fiscal powers to Catalonia. The socialists, nevertheless, appear to have come away from this clash the winners. They have only had to fulfil an old promise to allow Catalonia and other regions to spend 15 per cent of the income taxes raised by the central government in their territories. Subsequent negotiations and suggestionsthat they might fail allowed the Catalans to claim that they had, in fact, wrestled away hard-won concessions. The CiU is unlikely in the foreseeable future to want to see the collapse of the government of Mr Gonzalez. Political observers in Madrid suggest that while the socialists remain a parliamentary minority, an artificial tension with the Catalans is likely to become the hallmark of Spanish politics as the CiU struggles to build up nationalist support in Catalonia. Political theatrics aside, the open declaration of support for the budget by the CiU on Wednesday gives Mr Gonzalez a badly-needed breathing space. It is unlikely he will now be seriously troubled in parliament until the next budget in a year's time.</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: DANCE  </P> <P> Lunev Is Staying: Soviet dancer Aleksandr Lunev, who stunned Boston audiences  with his soaring leaps in the glasnost "Swan Lake" this month, is joining the  Boston Ballet for the 1990-91 season. Lunev, disenchanted with the  opportunities he was receiving from his home Kirov company in Leningrad, landed  in Boston in early April with just the clothes on his back. He quickly was  signed to dance major roles in the historic Soviet-American "Swan Lake"  collaborative production, which ended Sunday. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

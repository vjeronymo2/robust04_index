			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STRIKE  </P> <P> Gov. Bob Miller of Nevada joined entertainer Wayne Newton this week in trying  to get a settlement in the summer-long dispute between hotels and musicians  that has forced several stars to cancel their Las Vegas engagements. Miller's  entrance into the talks came a week after Newton brought the two sides back to  the bargaining table to try and break the impasse that has darkened showrooms  at three major resorts and seen picket lines at two others. "My position has  been just to keep everybody talking," said Newton, who lives in Las Vegas and  is a big attraction in the hotel showrooms there. Last week, he refused to  cross picket lines at the Las Vegas Hilton.ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

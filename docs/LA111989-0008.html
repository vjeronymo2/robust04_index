			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN ACTIVE ALLIANCE OF CHEFS  </P> <P> The Nov. 5 cover story presents a distorted impression of the Women's Culinary  Alliance.  </P> <P> Support organizations such as the alliance, founded by chef Elka Gilmore and  several other high-profile chefs, provide opportunities for members to learn  from each other's trials and successes. It is unfortunate that in many such  groups those who have become the most successful no longer take the time to  participate.  </P> <P> Happily, the Women's Culinary Alliance counts among its members many  hard-working chefs -- some high-profile and some working for their stars and  toques -- as well as a wide variety of food industry professionals.  </P> <P> DEBBIE SLUTSKY  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> The Women's Culinary Alliance  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

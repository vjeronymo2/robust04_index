			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 16 (XINHUA) -- China will take  measures to improve the management of the container industry.    According to a ceremony for the establishment of the China  Container Industry Association held here Thursday [14 April],  China can now turn out 250,000 standard containers a year,  making it the biggest producer in this field.    But, sources said, sales of containers and technology for  making the containers has fallen behind production, and the  management of the container industry is inefficient.    The newly-established association aims to improve the  management in the industry.    It will collect and transmit information about container  production and sales, and new technology so as to promote fair  competition, improve quality, and enhance cooperation in design,  manufacture and quality control.</p>

			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STORM IS EXPECTED TODAY; ANOTHER WAITS IN WINGS  </P> <P> After a monthlong dry spell, San Diego is quickly making up for lost time.  </P> <P> A vigorous winter storm moving in from the Gulf of Alaska could dump as much as  an inch of rain on San Diego today and tomorrow, and up to a foot of snow in  the mountains, the National Weather Service said.  </P> <P> The storm is expected to weaken tonight and dissipate by Thursday afternoon,  but another storm in the Pacific is waiting in the wings, forecaster Wilbur  Shigehara said.  </P> <P> "We have received 3.42 inches of rain for the season (which runs from July  through June), but, if we get a half an inch today and Thursday, we'll be close  to the normal 4.18 inches," he said. More than an inch of rain has fallen since  the first storm moved in Saturday.  </P> <P> Along with the rain, "we may have thunderstorms, and we cannot rule out funnel  clouds and waterspouts," he said. A cold front coming into a low-pressure area  can produce funnel clouds.  </P> <P> So much rainfall in a short period can lead to problems. Saturated ground and  hillsides could cause street flooding and mudslides, especially in construction  areas, Shigehara said.  </P> <P> Temperatures are expected to fall.  </P> <P> "It looks like a very cold storm," Shigehara said. "We have issued a snow  advisory for the mountain areas."  </P> <P> Snow mixed with rain could fall as low as the 1,500-foot level, making travel  hazardous, he said.  </P> <P> Except in the desert, temperatures throughout the county are not expected to  rise above 58 today, and will dip into the 30s tonight, according to forecasts.  </P></p>

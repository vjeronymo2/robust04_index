			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow bounces back on improved trade data Wall Street AFTER two days of losses, US stock markets bounced back into positive territory yesterday on the heels of a big rally in Tokyo and improved trade figures, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 14.05 at 3,207.37, slightly below its highs for the session. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished up 3.59 at 422.86, while the Amex composite edged 2.20 to 386.49. The Nasdaq composite, which had been hit by heavy profit-taking earlier in the week, recovered strongly, adding 7.80 at 634.87. NYSE turnover was heavy at 219m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 1171 to 625. Analysts were not surprised when the market opened firmer. The selling of Monday and Tuesday had lacked real conviction, prices were due for a modest upward correction and sentiment was buoyed by a strong overnight performance from Japanese equities. Investors were also cheered by the news that the trade deficit in September had narrowed to Dollars 8.3bn from Dollars 9bn in August. The market had been expecting a larger trade gap, but economists warned that the record level of merchandise exports in September - which was behind the drop in the deficit - was not sustainable because of weakening overseas economies. Among individual stocks, Hewlett-Packard rose Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 58 3/4 in turnover of 4.4m shares in spite of news that the computer group earned 28 cents a share in its fiscal fourth quarter in the wake of a 36 cents a share restructuring charge. The earnings were below forecasts and analysts were at a loss to explain the stock's rise, although the heavy selling of the shares earlier in the week may have persuaded some investors they had become a bargain buy. Ford eased Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 38 7/8 in turnover of almost 1m shares after the securities house, Warburg, widened its fourth-quarter loss estimate from 20 cents a share to 50 cents a share, primarily because of problems with European markets. On the Nasdaq market, Price Co jumped Dollars 2 at Dollars 42 1/2 in turnover of 2m shares on uncomfirmed speculation that giant retailer Kmart is in talks to acquire the warehouse club group. Kmart eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 26 1/2 . Elsewhere on the Nasdaq, leading technology stocks began to recoup some of the losses incurred in recent days. Apple, which announced buy back another 10m of its own shares, put on Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 57 3/4 , Microsoft firmed Dollars 2 to Dollars 92, Borland International clawed back Dollars 1/4 at Dollars 25 and Sun Microsystems rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 31 7/8 . Canada TORONTO stocks ended a four-session losing streak to end moderately higher. Based on preliminary data, the TSE 300-stock composite index climbed 13.16 points, or 0.41 per cent, to 3231.68, with declines leading advances 286 to 254. Volume fell to 32,748,000 shares worth C325.1m, compared with 39,117,000 shares worth C378.9m on Tuesday. The media sector and banks were tops among the sub-groups, each adding 1.4 per cent on index.</p>

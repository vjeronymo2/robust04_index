			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: James Latham James Latham, timber importer and building materials merchant, made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 54,000 in the six months to September 30. That compared with Pounds 121,000, which included Pounds 270,000 profit on sale of site. The interim dividend is held at 1.5p but the level of the final will depend on results and, particularly, the further impact of exceptional charges arising from closures following recommendations from consultants. Group sales reached nearly Pounds 31m (Pounds 30.5m). Earnings per share came to 0.29p (0.82p).</p>

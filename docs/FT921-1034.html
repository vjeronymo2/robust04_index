			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Further deficit at Gibbs and Dandy Gibbs and Dandy, the Luton-based building, engineering and electrical distributor, remained in the red during 1991 as difficult trading conditions in the construction industry continued to take their toll. Operating profits dived from a restated Pounds 225,000 to Pounds 103,000, and although interest charges were reduced, exceptional costs of Pounds 346,000 (Pounds 335,000) for redundancy and losses and provisions on properties resulted in a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 754,000 (Pounds 757,000). Turnover declined 10 per cent to Pounds 23.5m. Losses per share were 6.9p (8.2p).</p>

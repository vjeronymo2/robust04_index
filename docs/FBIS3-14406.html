			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Unremembered Facts"] </F>   [Text] Three weeks after Hebron's Ibrahimi Mosque massacre  and the suspension of the Arab-Israeli talks on all tracks, the  UN Security Council is still unable to reach agreement on a  formula for a statement or a resolution putting the massacre in  its true historical context as a consequence of the occupation  and a logical result of Zionist settlement policies in Arab  territories. Attempts to bypass the barrier of U.S. rejection  of any UN resolution that goes beyond the superficial measures  Israel has taken to absorb the world's anger have all failed.  These measures sketch the state of the settlement activities  and acknowledge their danger. But, they do not go beyond that  to take a practical stand to end their tangible and potential  effects, in the absence of any international deterrence of a  repetition of the settlers' crime.    Today, when voting starts on the draft resolution, the  United  States will selectively choose the paragraphs that agree with  its viewpoint. It will prove conclusively that the UN Security  Council might be a forum for exchanging views on various  international issues, but basically, and in the end, remains a  mere reflection of the U.S. viewpoint, subject to predetermined  strategic considerations. No one can influence this, regardless  of how justified and logical his reasons may be, and regardless  of how much they agree with the principles of justice and peace.    In all honesty, in its current position in the UN Security  Council, the United States has shown a concern for its  commitments. It has been faithful to the pledges it made to  Israel in the form of assurances before the Madrid Conference  and before the negotiations began. These assurances kept  Jerusalem and the settlements outside any formula. The U.S.  president recently reaffirmed this fact to freshen the memory of  those who have forgotten the Madrid formula. This explains the  U.S. objection to any paragraph that includes a reference to  Jerusalem in the UN Security Council resolution that will  establish a known reality, something the Arabs have already  accepted implicitly.    What remains to be said is that the negotiations, suspended  in protest against the shedding of Arab blood, will resume on  the basis of generalities. This will save face, but will not  change the reality that reaffirmed the facts, facts forgotten by  the Arab mind and facts that taste of blood and suppression.</p>

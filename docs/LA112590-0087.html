			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOKING AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WOMEN AND HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> A TIME TO PLAY HARDBALL: SUE A STUDIO  </P> <P> While women in other industries have sought and obtained legal redress under  the Equal Pay Act and other laws, actresses continue to accept low levels of  pay and the feeble justifications made by the movie industry.  </P> <P> Given the clear pattern of discrimination against the female members of the  Screen Actors Guild, I propose that a class-action suit be filed against one of  the major studios.  </P> <P> It's about time that the most visible women in America stood up for their  rights and played hardball.  </P> <P> CHRISTINA SCHWERDTFEGER, Los Angeles  </P></p>

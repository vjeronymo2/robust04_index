			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Special Report on Franchising (1): Expanding prospects - Franchising is weathering the recession with varying success in the UK, France and US.  It also seems well suited to develop commercial skills in eastern Europe and to stimulate business in Spain THE UK franchising industry has not escaped the impact of the recession but, looking beyond the short term, franchisors have ambitious expansion plans for the rest of the decade. Internationally, franchising appears well suited as a means of developing business skills in eastern Europe and has also proved a popular means of business expansion in under- developed markets such as Spain. In Europe, France heads the franchising league by a comfortable margin while the US remains the largest single market worldwide. In spite of a recent increase in the failure rate of franchised businesses in the UK, franchising appears still able to justify its claims to be a safer method of going into business than the independent start-up. It does not offer a 'quick fix', however, for either franchisor or franchisee and the economic downturn has highlighted the need for both sides to work hard on the relationship. Franchising, sometimes referred to as business format franchising, involves the new business owner, or franchisee, signing up to use the brand name and established method of doing business of an existing company, the franchisor. The franchisee usually pays an initial fee and a continuing royalty, most commonly a percentage of sales, and may also be required to buy his raw materials from the franchisor. The closeness of the franchising relationship distinguishes it from other forms of cooperation such as licensing arrangements, distributorships, agencies and tenancy agreements. Franchising has enjoyed a mixed reputation over the past decade. The industry's code of self-regulation has not been able to prevent abuses - though it has recently been tightened up. The industry continues to be concerned over untried franchises and business propositions masquerading as the real thing but which fail to offer proper safeguards. The most serious recent dent to the industry's image came with the failure last December of Alan Paul, a USM-quoted hairdressing chain. Following the suspension of Alan Paul's shares receivers were appointed and it subsequently emerged that Fraud Squad inquiries had begun. Franchisees voiced complaints about the company's practice of jointly managing franchisees' bank accounts - a method which the British Franchise Association (BFA), representing 75 per cent of franchised outlets, described as 'unusual'. The banks, for their part, were believed to be uneasy about loans made by the company to franchisees. The fall-out from the demise of Alan Paul would have beengreater but for the fact that other companies took over large parts of the business and many franchisees were able to continue trading. The overall failure rate of franchised businesses rose from just under 6 per cent to just over 7 per cent in the year ended June 1991 (the latest period for which detailed figures are available) and may have risen slightly over the past 18 months. The impact of the recession was also felt in a decline in total franchise sales in the UK from Pounds 5.2bn in 1989-90 to Pounds 4.8bn in 1990-91, or roughly 3 per cent of total retail sales. This compares with franchising's retail share of about 6 per cent in France and 35 per cent in the US though international comparisons are complicated by differing definitions of franchising activity. In the US, where franchising includes sectors such as car and truck distributorships, petrol stations and soft drink bottling, 1991 sales amounted to Dollars 758bn, 6 per cent more than in 1990. But while UK franchising turnover was lower the numbers of franchised outlets and franchising systems increased. The number of outlets (some franchisees own more than one outlet) rose from 18,260 to 18,600 while the number of systems (franchisors) rose from 379 to 432. The number of people employed in franchising rose by 6,000 to 189,500. Looking to the future, franchisors say they plan to double the number of outlets by 1996. Inevitably, during a recession, tensions between franchisors and franchisees increase. 'Franchisees question the quality of the service they are getting while some may delay or refuse to pay the agreed fees to the franchisor,' says Mr Martin Mendelsohn, franchise partner at solicitors Jaques &amp; Lewis. The strains have been most marked in the less profitable sectors and among newer franchisees who have not yet built up trading volumes or paid off their bank loans. The better franchisors have responded by increasing their assistance for franchisees, increasing marketing support and training, notes Mr Peter Stern, senior franchise manager at National Westminster Bank. Unlike the US, in the UK the banks play a close role in vetting franchisors and in funding franchisees. But faced with the general downturn and losses and provisions in other areas of their business they have taken a tougher line on franchising proposals. The banks will still lend twice the sum invested by the franchisee compared with their normal lending ratio of 1:1 for other businesses. But they are taking a stricter line on more marginal propositions and business sectors which have had particular problems. If franchising is to achieve a significant breakthrough from its present small share in retail trade it must open up new sectors and attract big company players. There are signs that both of these are happening. The number of vehicle servicing franchisors, including activities such as car valeting and tuning, more than doubled in the two years to mid-1991 while the number of outlets increased by 50 per cent. In retailing, numbers of both systems (franchises) and outlets doubled due partly to a move by established companies such as Cullens, Levi Strauss and Rymans to expand by means of franchising. Retailing accounted for 29 per cent of franchising systems and 25 per cent of outlets while other leading sectors were buildings services (13 and 11 per cent respectively) and commercial and industrial services (10 and 5 per cent). Franchising is increasingly seen as a mainstream activity by large companies, according to some specialists. 'It used to be seen as a strategy for small and medium-sized companies which wanted to grow or as a peripheral part of big organisations,' says Ms Amanda Griggs, director of Stoy Hayward Franchising Services. 'But now we see a lot of major corporations looking at franchising. In the 1980s these large organisations became very centralised. That was all right in boom times but now they want to give more autonomy to their operating units.' Shell, the oil company, has launched its Shell Share scheme to franchise the operation of its petrol forecourts while several other petrol companies are also looking at franchising. Large dairy groups such as Unigate and Dairy Crest have been turning their milk rounds into franchises while the Post Office has begun franchising the operation of some of its larger offices (not just sub-offices) to retailers such as Rymans and Safeway. The BFA, in its latest annual review, reports that public houses, petrol stations and motor distributors, at present regarded as 'licensed distributors', are increasingly taking on the character of franchises with longer-term agreements between the licensees and licensors. If pubs and motor distributors were included in the franchise industry statistics, as they already are in the US, they would boost turnover to nearly Pounds 21bn, the BFA calculates. Converting licensed outlets into franchises is not always easy, however. Many tenants are reluctant to pay large up-front fees for the privilege of becoming the franchisee of a business they are already running. The move by large companies into the industry has helped to improve its image but the BFA, which has no wish to see legislation introduced, has been forced to tighten up its own rules. The association has dropped its 'early development' category of membership. This involved no checking of members' status and they were not allowed to advertise themselves as association members anyway. About 20 franchisors did not renew their membership when this category was abolished, says Mr Brian Smart, BFA chairman. The association has also introduced formal standards for franchisors wishing to take part in the industry's twice-yearly exhibitions, which are an important means of recruiting franchisees. If the franchising industry can make its tougher codes stick it can expect a bright future. It could ask for no sterner judge of its methods than the continuing recession.</p>

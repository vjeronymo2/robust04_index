			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'CITY OF HEALTH' CHOSEN FOR TEST;  </P> <P> DUARTE: RESIDENTS WILL RECEIVE A PROTOTYPE HEALTH GUIDE TO HELP DETERMINE THE  BEST DISTRIBUTION METHODS AND ASSESS THE PUBLIC'S REACTIONS.  </P> <P> The city, whose motto is "City of Health," has been selected by the state as  the testing ground for a new Wellness Guide.  </P> <P> A prototype of the guide, developed in a joint effort by the Office of  Prevention of the California Department of Mental Health and UC Berkeley, was  introduced Wednesday at a public health conference in Los Angeles. Duarte is  scheduled to start distributing the guides to the city's 8,000 households on  June 9.  </P> <P> Produced by the School of Public Health at UC Berkeley, the resource guide  covers a broad range of health-related topics, including pregnancy, child care,  physical fitness and aging. The four-year program has a budget of $600,000,  state officials said.  </P> <P> Duarte was chosen by the state as a pilot city because of its involvement in  the "Healthy Cities Project," introduced last year by UC Berkeley and the state  Department of Health Services to promote community health projects.  </P> <P> All cities in the state were asked to come up with project proposals. Ten  cities sent in full applications. The state selected seven of them, including  Duarte, to receive technical guidance from state officials in developing their  projects.  </P> <P> Duarte's proposal was to develop a health resource directory to be distributed  to all city residents. The city is putting together the guide now for  distribution in the fall. Officials say it will complement the Wellness Guide  by providing more local information.  </P> <P> "Not only were we excited about Duarte's project, but we thought, 'What an  ideal place to test our Wellness Guide,' " said Charles Roppel, chief of the  Office of Prevention for the Department of Mental Health. "They were very eager  to help in any way they could."  </P> <P> Using anecdotes, photographs and illustrations, the Wellness Guide shows people  how to deal with health issues such as depression, teen pregnancy, caring for  the elderly, and drug and alcohol abuse. The guide also discusses ways of  finding community support networks.  </P> <P> Each section of the guide offers toll-free 800 numbers for crisis and support  networks. The producers of the guide have also been working with phone  companies and directory publishers, including Pacific Bell, GTE and the  Hispanic Yellow Pages, to standardize the community service listings in local  Yellow Pages so they match the Wellness Guide's page-by-page listings.  </P> <P> "This is the first of its kind in the universe," said Dr. Linda Neuhauser, UC  Berkeley's evaluation director for the guide. "We're hoping that this will be a  catalyst for health education throughout the state by sending out the message  that a healthy lifestyle starts at home."  </P> <P> Program officials intend to distribute the free, 80-page guide to every  household in the state by 1991. Before that deadline, Duarte will serve as a  pilot city to research the best methods of distribution and to assess the  public's impressions of the guide.  </P> <P> "We were notified of our selection about six months ago, and ever since then,  we've been working on this nonstop," said Terry Fitzgerald, Duarte's  coordinator for the Wellness Guide. "We want people to recognize the value of  the guide, and not think that it's just an advertisement."  </P> <P> Officials in Duarte, which has a population of 22,000, have rounded up about 50  community volunteers who will hand-deliver half of the guides to 4,000 homes.  The other half will be mailed to residents to determine which method of  distribution works better.  </P> <P> "For the past few months, I've been going to different clubs and organizations,  church groups, schools and businesses, trying to recruit volunteers," said Sue  Lawrence, Duarte's director of volunteers. "A lot of seniors who are in walking  clubs said they will deliver the guides in the neighborhoods that they walk  in."  </P> <P> The guide, which will be available in English and Spanish, will be packaged  with a short letter from the city, an evaluation form to mail back and a  six-page mini-telephone book of local health and social service providers  printed by GTE. The numbers in the mini-book will also appear in the community  access section of the regular GTE phone book when it is published in December.  </P> <P> Duarte Mayor John Fasana said the city's involvement with the Wellness Guide  has brought the community together. "I give all credit to the citizens. . . .  It's really nice to know that our citizens will be the first to use the guide  and input what the rest of the state will read."  </P></p>

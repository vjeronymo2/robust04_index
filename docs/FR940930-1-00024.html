			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA has already listed acetone as an acceptable ozone-depleting substance substitute under the program known as the ``Significant New Alternatives Policy'' (SNAP) program, (59 FR 13044, March 18, 1994). Within the context of the SNAP rule, substitutes are ``acceptable'' if they are technically feasible to be used as an alternative to an ODS for particular uses and give reduced overall risk to human health and the the environment compared to the ODS they replace. In the SNAP rule, EPA listed acetone as an acceptable substitute for flexible polyurethane foam blowing (59 FR 13132). The SNAP rule lists ketones (which include acetone) as an acceptable substitute for solvent cleaning in metal cleaning, electronics cleaning, and precision cleaning (59 FR 13134). Ketones are also listed in the SNAP rule as an acceptable substitute solvent for aerosols and for adhesives, coatings, and inks (59 FR 13145).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In each of these areas of concern, toxic air emissions and depletion of stratospheric ozone, adding acetone to the list of negligibly-reactive VOC will support the EPA's pollution prevention efforts. By enacting the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990, Congress established as a national policy that ``pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source whenever feasible'' (42 U.S.C. 13). An important part of EPA's pollution prevention strategy is encouraging companies to use substitutes in their production processes that are more environmentally benign than the substances they currently use. For example, in its blueprint for a comprehensive national pollution prevention strategy, (56 FR 7849 (February 26, 1991)), the EPA recognized that the definition of pollution prevention includes a ``switch to non-toxic or less toxic substitutes'' ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . at 7854).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National air emissions of acetone from industrial sources were estimated to be 80,000 tons per year in 1991. It should be noted that due to the high volatility of acetone, increased use of acetone for metal cleaning will most likely increase emissions of the compound to the air. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. The EPA Response to the Petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the scientific data presented in the material submitted by the petitioners, EPA accepts the conclusion that acetone is not appreciably different from ethane in terms of photochemical reactivity. The EPA is responding to the petitions by proposing in this notice to add acetone to the list of compounds appearing in 40 CFR 51.100(s) that are considered to be negligibly reactive and are thus excluded from the definition of VOC for ozone SIP and ozone control purposes. The revised definition will apply in the Chicago ozone nonattainment area pursuant to the 40 CFR 52.741(a)(3) definition of volatile organic material or volatile organic compound. States are not obligated to exclude from control as a VOC those compounds that EPA has found to be negligibly reactive. However, if this proposal is made final, EPA will not enforce measures controlling acetone as part of a federally-approved ozone SIP. In addition, once this proposal is made final, States should not include acetone in their VOC emissions inventories for determining reasonable further progress under the Act (e.g., section 182(b)(1)) and may not take credit for controlling acetone in their ozone control strategy. Further, after this proposal is made final, acetone may not be used for emissions netting (e.g., 40 CFR 51.166(b)(2)(c)), offsetting (40 CFR appendix S), or trading with reactive VOC (Emissions Trading Policy Statement, 51 FR 43814, December 4, 1986 and Economic Incentive Program Rules, 59 FR 16690, April 7, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since acetone will no longer be treated as a VOC, a State should revise its base year inventory and plans that rely on that inventory (e.g., the 15 percent plan) to remove acetone and the VOC emissions reduction credit taken from controlling acetone. To avoid unnecessary work, however, States may account for the fraction of the VOC inventory that acetone comprises or the amount of reduction claimed for controlling acetone. If the acetone fraction in the inventory or the amount of control claimed is not significant for a particular area, EPA would not expect a State to revise its emissions inventory or a plan based on that inventory to account for the revised VOC definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Saudi Arabia thus overruled a bid by Iran and other non-Gulf  members, including Indonesia, to reduce the ceiling from its  present level of 24.52 million barrels a day (MBD) to bolster  weak oil prices, delegates said.    Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazir told reporters "it was the  best we could do under the circumstances."    Nazir declined to say what the impact could be on oil  prices.    Ahmed Said al-Badi, of the United Arab Emirates, said the  decision was a unanimous one and the Libyan minister, Abdalla  al-Badri, said he was "not happy" with the outcome.</p>

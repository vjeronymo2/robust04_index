			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Unions fight for naval dockyards MR JACK DROMEY, national secretary of the TGWU, Britain's largest trade union, urged the government yesterday to avoid 'a second great coal board disaster' in the naval dockyards. That follows reports - denied by the government - that there are plans to close the Rosyth yard, with thousands of job losses. The yard is Scotland's largest single employer and has 4,000 direct employees. Unions say the Navy Board would prefer Devonport dockyard, Plymouth, to handle refitting on Trident submarines. Unions at both yards have joined forces to argue for both sites to be kept open. They also want a review into overall industrial policy and consequences of mass redundancies and closures. Mr Dromey said: 'With the right approach, Devonport and Rosyth have a bright future. Their prime purpose will remain naval refitting, but both yards should continue to diversify to win commercial work because defence expenditure will fall throughout the 90s. That is why an industrial policy from the government to help Devonport and Rosyth plan for the future is so critical.' Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU engineering and electrical union, said: 'If spare capacity exists, then the first task should be how to fill it, to make use of skills and to protect jobs and local communities.' Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, has said the reports are clearly 'at best premature, and at worst totally wrong', that he was unaware of any conclusion to the nuclear submarine refitting studies, and that a final decision was expected by Christmas.</p>
